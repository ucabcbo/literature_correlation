Traditional phenological observations are based on surface observation networks. Generally, the outcomes of this manner are less representative and hard to implement in wide forested regions. Remote sensing based observation of forest SOS has currently been a popular way. Those sensors with coarse spatial resolution have been widely used to estimate forest SOS, but they create serious estimation errors in areas of high heterogeneity. Medium-resolution sensors, such as Landsat, face significant challenges in SOS monitoring due to the long revisit period. In this study, we aimed to develop a new method to estimate forest SOS from 2013 to 2019. First, we collected all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, and then redefined the linear regression coefficients for the bandpass adjustment to weaken the surface reflectance (SR) differences in different sensors. Subsequently, we improved and developed the modified continuous change detection and classification (MCCDC) model to generate daily vegetation index curves. Finally, we adopted the logistic regression model to test the potential of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) in evaluating the annual SOS. The reduced root mean square error (RMSE) for all bands after the integration indicated that the adjustment was successful. We visually compared Landsat's synthetic images with the actual acquired images and found that their respective false-colour composites were highly similar. Assessing the SOS from the EVI, NDVI and LSWI showed different estimated results. By comparing the annual SOS derived from the three indices with the field observations, it was found that the SOS based on the EVI maintained a low consistency with the field observations. The SOS accuracy from LSWI was the highest and most forest SOS from LSWI in the study area were mainly concentrated in 80–150 days. These three indices all showed that the SOS always fluctuated by ± 4 days from 2013 to 2019. Facing the lack of clear remote sensing images with medium spatial resolution in cloudy and rainy areas, this study proposes an improved method to generate clear daily vegetation index images at a spatial resolution of 30 m, making annual SOS monitoring promising and feasible. © 2021 The Author(s)","forest; image analysis; Landsat; monitoring system; phenology; regression analysis; remote sensing; Sentinel; time series","Dense time series; Forest SOS; Image synthesis; Multi-sensor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121631593"

Nationwide assessment of forest health in the Czech Republic is based on the interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite data using novel approaches for cloud-free image synthesis based on all available satellite observations. A predictive statistical model to yield time series of leaf area index (LAI) from satellite observations is developed above extensive in-situ data, including LAI and forest defoliation assessment. Forest health is evaluated for each pixel from yearly changes of forest LAI, while the country-wise assessment of the health status is performed at the cadastral level. Methodology developed for Slovakia is based on a two-phase regression sampling. The first phase of the procedure provides an initial fast estimate of forest damage using only satellite observations (visible and infrared channels from Landsat or Sentinel-2 systems). The second phase refines the result of the first phase using data from a ground damage assessment (site-level defoliation from ICP Forests database). Resulting forest health assessment over the whole forest area is presented in 10 defoliation classes. The Czech Republic shows 1.6% of heavily damaged forests, 12.5% of damaged forests, 79.2% of forests with stable conditions, 6.3% of regenerated forests and 0.4% of strongly regenerated forests. In Slovakia, the total share of damaged stands (i. e. with defoliation higher than 40%) increased from 6-8% in 2003-2011 to 13-15% in 2012-2017. Both methodologies conduct nationwide assessment of forest health status in a fast and automatized way with high accuracy and minimal costs. The weaknesses are, for example, a high computational demands for production cloud free mosaics, inability to identify initial phases of forest health decline, exclusion of stands older than 80 years (in the Czech Republic) and inability to differentiate between harvested and severely damaged stands (in Slovakia). Finally, the paper outlines future development of both methodologies. © 2018 Ivan Barka et al. published by Sciendo.","","Defoliation; Forest health status; Landsat; Satellite scenes; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058472951"

For decades, the Brazilian government has maintained monitoring programs for deforestation detection in the Brazilian Legal Amazon area based on remotely sensed optical images in a protocol that involves considerable efforts of visual interpretation. However, the Amazon region is covered with clouds for most of the year, and deforestation assessment can rely only on images acquired in the dry season when cloud-free images are more likely to capture. One possibility to lessen that restriction and enable deforestation detection throughout the year is to synthesize cloud-free optical images from corresponding SAR images, which are only marginally influenced by atmospheric conditions. This work compares a set of such image synthesis methods, considering deforestation detection in the Amazon forest as the target application. Specifically, we evaluate three deep learning methods for cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images: a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based on the pix2pixi architecture; an extension of that method, which uses atrous convolutions (Atrous cGANi) to enhance fine image details; and a non-generative method (DSen2-CRi) based on residual networks. In the evaluation, we assess both the quality of the generated images and the accuracy obtained when performing deforestation detection from those images. We further compare those methods with an image aggregation tool available in Google Earth Engine (GEE Tooli), which creates cloud-free mosaics from sequences of images acquired at nearby dates. In this study, we considered two sites in the Brazilian Amazon, characterized by distinct vegetation and deforestation patterns. In terms of the quality metrics and classification accuracy, the Atrous cGANi was the best performing deep learning method. The GEE Tooli outperformed all those methods when dealing with images from the dry season but turned out to be the poorest performing method in the wet season.  © Authors 2022","Carbon dioxide; Data fusion; Deep learning; Deforestation; Generative adversarial networks; Geometrical optics; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Quality control; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Amazon rain forest; Cloud removal; Deep learning; Dry seasons; Learning methods; Optical data; Optical image; Optical imagery; Removal method; SAR-optical data fusion; Global warming","Cloud Removal; Deep learning; Deforestation; Optical imagery; SAR-optical Data fusion","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131917969"
