High-resolution roughness estimates from airborne laser measurements are limited in spatial and temporal coverage while pan-Arctic satellite roughness does not extend over multi-decadal timescales. Launched on the Terra satellite in 1999, the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument acquires optical imagery from nine near-simultaneous camera view zenith angles. Extending on previous work to model surface roughness from specular anisotropy, a training dataset of cloud-free angular reflectance signatures and surface roughness, defined as the standard deviation of the within-pixel lidar elevations, from near-coincident operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne laser data is generated and is modelled using support vector regression (SVR) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel selected. Blocked k-fold cross-validation is implemented to tune hyperparameters using grid optimisation and to assess model performance, with an (Formula presented.) (coefficient of determination) of 0.43 and MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.041 m. Product performance is assessed through independent validation by comparison with unseen similarly generated surface-roughness characterisations from pre-IceBridge missions (Pearson’s r averaged over six scenes, r = 0.58, p < 0.005), and with AWI CS2-SMOS sea-ice thickness (Spearman’s rank, (Formula presented.) = 0.66, p < 0.001), a known roughness proxy. We present a derived sea-ice roughness product at 1.1 km resolution (2000–2020) over the seasonal period of OIB operation and a corresponding time-series analysis. Both our instantaneous swaths and pan-Arctic monthly mosaics show considerable potential in detecting surface-ice characteristics such as deformed rough ice, thin refrozen leads, and polynyas. © 2022 by the authors.","NASA; Optical radar; Radial basis function networks; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Time series analysis; Arctic sea ice; Climate studies; Crucial parameters; Ice surface roughness; Icebridge; Melt ponds; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Oceanographic study; Pan-Arctic; Support vector regressions; Surface roughness","icebridge; multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer; sea ice; support vector regression; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144825486"
