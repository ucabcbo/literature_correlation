This letter presents an enhanced region-based probabilistic posterior sampling approach to effectively synthesize SAR imagery with different ocean features. In the proposed approach, instead of relying entirely on the SAR intensity values, the posterior sampling is performed based on a number of quantitative factors, such as intensity, label field, and the prior class probability of sampling candidates, constituting a complete probabilistic framework that addresses key aspects in the synthesis of SAR imagery from heterogeneous sources. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can better address the difficulties caused by the heterogeneity in the source images compared with the existing state-of-the-art ice synthesis method, and it will improve the consistency, comprehensiveness, and fairness of the evaluation of the remote sensing classification and segmentation algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.","Ice; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mapping; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Class probabilities; Evaluating algorithms; Heterogeneous sources; Probabilistic framework; Quantitative factors; Remote sensing classification; Segmentation algorithms; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging","Image synthesis; oil spills; sea ice; Statistical texture modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007110623"
