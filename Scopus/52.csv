In terms of surface material characteristics, this holds for rocks and minerals, but only to a lesser degree for soils (including alluvium, colluvium, regolith or weathered outcrop) and not for vegetation cover, for example. A view unobstructed by clouds, vegetation or fire scars is essential for a persistent observation of surface mineralogy. Sensors with a continuous multi-temporal operation (e.g., Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) can provide the data volume needed to come to an optimal seasonal acquisition and the application of data fusion approaches to create an unobstructed view. However, the acquisition environment always changes over time, driven by seasonal changes, illumination changes and the weather. Consequently, the creation of an unobstructed view does not necessarily lead to a repeatable measurement. In this paper, we evaluate the influence of weather and resulting soil moisture conditions over a 3-year period, with alternating dry and wet periods, on the variance of several “geological” spectral indices in a semi-arid area. Sentinel-2 MSI data are chosen to calculate band ratios for green vegetation, ferric and ferrous iron oxide mineralogy and hydroxyl bearing alteration (clay) mineralogy. The data were used “as provided”, meaning that the performance of the atmospheric correction and geometric accuracy is not changed. The results are shown as time-series for selected areas that include solid rock, beach sand, bare soil and natural vegetation surfaces. Results show that spectral index values vary not only between dry and wet periods, but also within dry periods longer than 45 days, as a result of changing soil moisture conditions long after a last rain event has passed. In terms of repeatability of measurements, an overall low soil-moisture level is more important for long-term stability of spectral index values than the occurrence of minor rain events. In terms of creating an unobstructed view, we found that thresholds for NDVI should not be higher than 0.1 when masking vegetation in geological remote sensing, which is lower than what usually is indicated in literature. In conclusion, multi-temporal data are not only important to study dynamic Earth processes, but also to improve mapping of surfaces that are seemingly invariant. As this work is based on a few selected pixels, the obtained results should be considered only indicative and not as a numerical truth. We conclude that multi-temporal data can be used to create an unobstructed view, but also to select the data that give the most repeatability of measurements. Images selection should not be based on a certain number of days without rain in the days preceding data acquisition but aim for the lowest soil moisture conditions. Consequently, weather data should be incorporated to come to an optimal selection of remote sensing imagery, and also when analyzing multi-temporal data. © 2022 by the authors.","Data fusion; Iron oxides; Rain; Rare earths; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Vegetation; Dry and wet; Dry periods; Moisture conditions; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal data; Remote-sensing; Repeatability; Sentinel-2 MSI; Spectral indices; Weather; Soil moisture","geology; mineral; multi-temporal; repeatability; Sentinel-2 MSI; spectral index; weather","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144631584"

This is particularly true when targets are complex environments, such as wetlands, on which a vast majority of studies are site-specific and based on a single date. With this work, an extensive reference dataset of about 400,000 samples was collected, covering nine different sites and multiple seasons, to be considered representative of temperate wetland vegetation communities at continental scale. Starting from this dataset, the performance of selected ML classifiers was compared for detailed wetland vegetation type mapping, using spectral indices (SI) derived from multi-temporal composites of Sentinel-2 as input. Global and per-class accuracy metrics were computed based on four independent training and testing subsets, extracted from the overall dataset, and the impacts of input features variation in number and sites covered were assessed. Our results show a generally higher predictive power for ensemble methods, such as Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), compared to standalone ones, with the notable exception of Support Vector Machine (SVM); the latter in fact, in the algorithm that scored the highest overall accuracy (0.977 ± 0.001) and F-score for all the target classes. Decreasing the number of input features generally resulted in classification accuracy losses, less marked for RF than for SVM, while site-specific algorithms training showed more stability of SVM, thus indicating SVM stronger transferability than RF and XGBoost. © 2023 The Authors","","Random forest; Spectral indices; Supervised classification; Support vector machine; Wetland vegetation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147001962"

Meanwhile, to address the lack of datasets, we collected a new dataset named Sen2 MTC from the Sentinel-2 satellite and manually labeled each cloudy and cloud-free image.

Many studies use remote sensing images combined with different machine learning algorithms to predict the regional SOM content. However, the information provided by remote sensing images in different time windows is very different. Taking Youyi Farm, a typical black soil area in Northeast China, as the research area, this study obtains all available Sentinel-2 images covering the research area from 2019 to 2021, calculates the spectral index of single-phase and multi-temporal synthesis images, takes the spectral index and band of each image as the input, and employs the random forest regression algorithm to evaluate the performance of SOM prediction using remote sensing images with different time windows. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is generally improved compared to using only the band; (2) when using single-phase images, the R2 range of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is from 0.16 to 0.59 and the RMSE ranges from 0.82% to 1.23%; When using multi-temporal synthesis images, the R2 range of SOM prediction using image band and spectral index is from 0.18 to 0.56 and the RMSE ranges from 0.85% to 1.19%; (3) the highest accuracy of SOM prediction using synthetic images is lower than that of single-phase images; (4) the best time window of the bare soil period in the study area is May. This study emphasizes the importance of the time window to SOM prediction. In subsequent SOM prediction research, remote sensing images with appropriate time windows should be selected first, and then the model should be optimized. © 2022 by the authors.","China; cultivation; machine learning; remote sensing; Sentinel; soil organic matter; temporal analysis","black soil area; multi-temporal synthesis; remote sensing prediction; Sentinel-2; single-phase image; soil organic matter","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146042988"

Remote sensing images can provide monitoring information on the spatial distribution of tree species and multi-feature fusion can improve the classification accuracy of tree species. However, different features will play their own unique role. Therefore, considering various related factors about the growth of tree species such as spectrum information, texture structure, vegetation phenology, and topography environment, we fused multi-feature and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, which combines spectral features with three other types of features. We combined different feature-combinations with the random forest method to classify Changbai Mountain tree species. Results indicate that topographic features participate in tree species classification with higher accuracy and more efficiency than phenological features and texture features, and the elevation factor possesses the highest importance through the Mean Decrease in Gini (MDG) method. Finally, we estimated the area of the target tree species and analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics by overlay analysis of the Classification 3 result and topographic features (elevation, slope, and aspect). Our findings emphasize that topographic factors have a great influence on the distribution of forest resources and provide the basis for forest resource investigation. © 2022 by the authors.

Land cover/use maps are also created using these data. These data play an important role as a base for determining land cover and land use classes, detecting changes, monitoring forest, agriculture and wetlands, as well as updating the LPIS data used by countries. As well as being reference data in the LPIS update, current land cover and land use classification results with satellite images also provide statistical information about which class has changed over the years and how much the class or classes need to be updated, and will also provide the planning of the update to be made on a national scale. In this study, land cover classification for 2020 covering Çivril-Baklan Plain, which is between the borders of Denizli Province (Turkey), Baklan, Çal and Çivril Districts, was performed. The LPIS classes of the study area drawn in 2015 and the land cover classes as a result of the 2020 classification were compared as a result of the classification process, and particularly the areas with change were referenced in the LPIS update. In the classification process, the open source Eo-Learn library, which uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms in remote sensing studies and Sentinel-2 images that can be accessed directly in this library were used. The open source Eo-Learn library has been preferred because it provides great convenience to users in the classification process with ready-made machine learning models and easy access to satellite images, image processing steps (cloud masking, calculate index, feature extraction, temporal interpolation) are carried out in a certain workflow. Instead of land cover classification from a single image, 17 different time (multi-temporal) images between 01.02.2020 and 31.11.2020 were used. In the classification process, 12 different features were used for the image taken on each date, including NDVI, NDWI, NDBI indices and Tasseled Cap transformations, as well as (Blue) B02, (Green) B03, (Red) B04, (NIR) B08, (SWIR-1) B11, (SWIR-2) B12 bands. In the classification process, the Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) algorithm in the Eo-Learn library and the physical blocks produced within the scope of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) project were used as ground truth data; arable land, bare land, forest, artificial surface, shrubland, tree crops and water classes were created. The classification results were evaluated using the K fold (k = 5) cross validation method, with F1 score, recall, and precision values calculated for each class, and the overall accuracy %92.2. When the classification result is compared with the LPIS data, it is seen that the arable land, shrub land, and water classes have changed. This study determined that these classes, in particular, need to be updated. © 2022 The Author(s).

How do NDVI maps from different sensing technologies differ in a production context? What part of the variability of yield and quality can they explain? This study compares high-resolution multispectral, multi-temporal data from CropCircle, SpectroSense + GPS, Parrot Sequoia + multispectral camera equipped UAV, and Sentinel-2 imagery over two seasons (2019 and 2020). The objective was to assess whether the date of data collection (phenological growth stage) influences the correlations between NDVI and crop production. The comparison of vineyard NDVI data from proximal and remote sensing in both a statistical and a productive context showed strong similarities between NDVI values from similar sensors (0.69 < r < 0.96), but divergences between proximal and airborne/spaceborne observations. Exploratory correlation analysis between NDVI layers and grape yield and total soluble solids data (TSS) showed high correlations (maximum |r|= 0.91 and |r|= 0.74, respectively), with correlations increasing as the season progressed. No relationship with must titratable acidity or pH was found. Finally, proximal sensors explained better the variability in yield and quality for grapes in the early and late growth stages. The UAV's MUs described the yield of both years better than the other sensors. In 2019, the PCA-based MUs explained the TSS variability better than the UAV-related zones. Due to their coarse spatial resolution, the satellite data proved inconsistent in explaining the variability. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Fuzzy clustering; Management units; Precision viticulture; Satellite; Total soluble solids; UAV; Yield","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147712151"

Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images (“S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue” dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors. © 2022 The Authors","Deep learning; HTTP; Image processing; Landsat; Learning systems; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Cloud masks; Deep learning; Distortion model; Generative adversarial network; LANDSAT; Model method; Remote-sensing; Satellite sensors; artificial neural network; detection method; image processing; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral analysis; supervised learning; Generative adversarial networks","Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks (GAN); Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136277692"

The publicly available medium resolution optical Sentinel-2 satellite data provides a practical and effective solution for burnt area detection. In this study, we proposed two different approaches using mono-temporal and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to detect burnt areas in Rokan Hilir Regency, Indonesia. The multi-temporal approaches utilized two different ensemble machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and XGBoost) and used six composite spectral indices of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differenced Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (dNBR2), differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), differenced Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (dSAVI), differenced Char Soil Index (dCSI), differenced Burnt area Index for Sentinel-2 (dBAIS2), and differenced Mid-infrared Burn Index (dMIRBI) as model inputs. The burnt areas are labeled by combining hotspots with confidence intervals above 95%, fire spots, and change detection methods. The XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an F1 score of 0.97 and an accuracy of 96%. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of each feature as well as its correlation with the target class. The dNBR, dMIRBI, and dNBR2 indices contribute the most to the XGBoost model. In comparison, this study also investigates and compares a mono-temporal approach with One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN-1D) architecture and the performance obtained is slightly better than both machine learning models. Overall, both mono-temporal and multi-temporal approaches satisfactorily detect the burnt area. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Indonesia; algorithm; detection method; NDVI; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis","Burnt area detection; Deep learning algorithms; Fire; Machine learning algorithms; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130285522"

These areas represent coastal ecosystems with significant ecological, biological, and economic importance. The status of these ecosystems needs to be monitored; the latest condition is important to local authorities. Rate of change in mangrove conditions can be used to forecast the future condition of these coastal areas. This study aims to determine the temporal changes in the area and density of mangrove vegetation in Jepara Regency in 2017 and 2020. This study applied analysis of Sentinel 2-A multitemporal satellite imagery and classification using random forest on the Google Earth Engine platform. It was found that the mangrove area shrank from 103 ha in 2017 to 95 ha in 2020. The vegetations showed that changes in mangrove area in Jepara Regency have decreased in the rare and dense mangrove density types. The density of rare and dense mangroves experienced a decrease in area of 6 and 5 hectares, respectively. No mangroves with dense cover were found in 2020. Meanwhile, mangroves with moderate cover experienced an increase in area of 3 hectares in 2020 compared to last year 2017. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Coastal ecosystem degradation; google earth; sentinel 2-A","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132585206"

At the same time, surface melt can form surface types that are spectrally similar to blue ice, especially at low elevations. These are termed melt-induced blue ice areas. Both types of blue ice are sensitive indicators of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful technique to retrieve the spatial extent of blue ice areas and their variation in time. Yet, existing satellite-derived blue ice area products are either mono-temporal for the entire Antarctic ice sheet, or multi-temporal for a limited area. Here, we present FABIAN, a product of blue ice fraction over Antarctica, derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) archive covering the period 2000–2021. A spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in Google Earth Engine, based on a careful selection of endmember spectra, accurately reconstructs the reflectance observed by MODIS in blue ice areas. Based on a validation with contemporaneous Sentinel-2 images, FABIAN has a root mean square error in blue ice fraction of approximately 10% ∼ 20% in wind-induced blue ice areas, and 20% ∼ 30% in melt-induced blue ice areas across six selected test sites in the coastal East Antarctic ice sheet. FABIAN is challenged in regions with shallow melt streams and lakes, since their spectral profiles are similar to those from blue ice areas in MODIS bands. For further analyses and applications, FABIAN holds the potential for (1) deriving annual blue ice area maps, (2) distinguishing between wind-and melt-induced blue ice types, (3) evaluating and correcting (regional) climate models, and (4) analyzing temporal variations in blue ice abundance and exposure. © 2022 The Authors","Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Climate change; Climate models; Glaciers; Ice; Mean square error; Mixtures; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Antarctica; Austral summers; Blue ice; Google earth engine; Google earths; Ice fraction; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Satellite remote sensing; Sensitive indicator; Spectral mixture analysis; ice; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; spectral reflectance; spectral resolution; sublimation; summer; Engines","Antarctica; Blue ice; Google Earth Engine; MODIS; Spectral mixture analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135710073"

We synthesize the evolution of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which experiences high seismic hazard, and derive new datasets relevant for seismic risk modeling. First, the urban sprawl of Bishkek (1979–2021) was quantified using built-up area land cover classifications. Second, a change detection methodology was applied to a declassified KeyHole Hexagon (KH-9) and Sentinel-2 satellite image to detect areas of redevelopment within Bishkek. Finally, vertical development was quantified using multi-temporal high-resolution stereo and tri-stereo satellite imagery, which were used in a deep learning workflow to extract buildings footprints and assign building heights. Our results revealed urban growth of 139 km2 (92%) and redevelopment of ~26% (59 km2) of the city (1979–2021). The trends of urban growth were not reflected in all the open access global settlement footprint products that were evaluated. Building polygons that were extracted using a deep learning workflow applied to high-resolution tri-stereo (Pleiades) satellite imagery were most accurate (F1 score = 0.70) compared to stereo (WorldView-2) imagery (F1 score = 0.61). Similarly, building heights extracted using a Pleiades-derived digital elevation model were most comparable to independent measurements obtained using ICESat-2 altimetry data and field-measurements (normalized absolute median deviation < 1 m). Across different areas of the city, our analysis suggested rates of building growth in the region of 2000–10,700 buildings per year, which when combined with a trend of urban growth towards active faults highlights the importance of up-to-date building stock exposure data in areas of seismic hazard. Deep learning methodologies applied to high-resolution imagery are a valuable monitoring tool for building stock, especially where country-level or open-source datasets are lacking or incomplete. © 2022 by the authors.","Buildings; Deep learning; E-learning; Geomorphology; Hazards; Learning systems; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Stereo image processing; Surveying; Active fault; Building footprint; Building height; Deep learning; Digital elevation model; High resolution; Kyrgyzstan; PLEIADES; Seismic hazards; Work-flows; Urban growth","building footprints; deep learning; digital elevation models; urban growth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142735914"

In this context, images from the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4), CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 have been used in remote sensing applications in Brazil. However, the geometric accuracy of the WFI data has not yet been documented in the literature, as it was done for other satellites/sensors such as TERRA/MODIS, Landsat-8/OLI, and Sentinel-2/MSI. This work presents the first study to assess the geometric accuracy of WFI images along different spectral channels, from multi-temporal images, and taking Sentinel-2/MSI images as a reference. Surface reflectance WFI images, Level-4 (orthorectified) with spatial resolution of 55 m (CBERS-4A) and 64 m (CBERS-4 and Amazonia-1) were analysed. Thousands of control points (CPs) were used to quantify the geometric accuracy of more than 300 WFI images and to construct multiple mapping functions to correct the displacements found. The NIR band was taken as a reference in the inter-channel (band-to-band) registration evaluation. In this case, all tiles had an RMSE average of fewer than 0.44 pixels. For the multi-temporal case, the CBERS-4A/WFI had the highest average RMSE (0.87 ± 0.34 pixels). Considering the Sentinel-2/MSI as a reference, there were observed shifts up to 1.45 pixels for CBERS-4/WFI and Amazonia-1/WFI and 2.5 pixels for CBERS-4A/WFI. Given the displacements found, image registration is needed for further time series analysis of WFI images for several applications that requiring precise sub-pixel registration (i.e., land use cover change). As a result, we propose a framework for the automatic registration of WFI images to properly foster the use of WFI images. This framework substantially reduced the misregistrations, decreasing the RMSE average to less than 0.29 pixels for the WFI images from the three satellites. The use of the 2nd degree polynomial as a mapping function proved to be appropriate for registering the WFI data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Brazilian earth observation satellites; Multi-sensor approach; Satellite images time series; Wide-field imager","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139735612"

We adopt a convolutional variant of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for canopy height estimation from multitemporal instances of Sentinel-2 products. Furthermore, we utilize the deep ensembles technique for meaningful uncertainty estimation on the predictions and postprocessing isotonic regression model for calibrating them.

As it is necessary to study phenological data over a period of time across a large territory, a lot of storage space is needed to save the satellite images and a lot of calculation time to analyse all this information. Sensing periods are usually established based on subjective expert criteria or previous experience. However, this decision may cause several differences when discriminating crop patterns, besides not guaranteeing good precision. These processes would greatly improve if the appropriate time periods could be found systematically using the minimum number of satellite images in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to determine a suitable sensing period for crop identification using Sentinel-2 images, applying hill climbing algorithms to the training sets of neural network models.

Forest canopy height is a global metric to characterise and monitor dynamics in forest ecosystems worldwide. Satellite mapping missions as NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) are creating opportunities to refine global forest canopy height models adding forest structural information to time-series satellite imagery. A recent global canopy height model presented by Lang et al., (2022) using GEDI and 10-m Sentinel-2 and the map from Potapov et al., (2020) using GEDI and Landsat are both tested in this study using multi-temporal tree-level data collected over eucalypt plantations in Brazil. Our results at plot-level showed Lang et al., (2022)’s estimates of canopy height came short compared to 2020 maximum and mean tree height records in the plots, 7.6 and 3.6 m, respectively, but adding CHM standard deviation improves the agreement of ground records for maximum tree height. Higher errors were computed for the plots in 2019 using the Potapov's 30-m CHM: 14.2 and 9.5 m, respectively. Averaged stand values were more similar between the three sources tested. We report improvement from the 30-m CHM to the 10-m, but still height saturation problems were observed when accounting for height differences in tall eucalypt trees. As more global products for forest height and biomass are becoming available to users, more validation exercises as presented in this study are needed to assess the suitability of CHM products to forestry needs, and facilitate the uptake and actionability of the next generation of global height and biomass products.

Consequently, monitoring and detecting the changes of coastal areas is thus necessary in order to provide valuable information for future mitigation and adaptation. Recently, the utilization of satellite images for coastal areas has been used widely and effectively as a viable alternative to in-situ observation and monitoring. In this study, multi-temporal satellite imagery data from Sentinel-2 have been used to find out the changes in the coastal area of Gianyar and Klungkung Regency - Bali, considering the capability which has good resolution with a wide swath and high revisit time. Sentinel-2 imagery data taken from 2016 and 2019 at an interval of about 4 years were collected to determine coastline changes. There are two main steps to detect the coastline. First is image classification by supervised classification where each pixel has been labeled with one or three classes. And the second is to make border segmentation between sand and water by applying the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The areas that are experiencing erosion and accretion were determined by using the overlay method between two satellite images. Results show that about 9,248 m2 of coastline were eroded in Gianyar Regency and 121,000 m2 in Klungkung Regency for the period of 2016 to 2019. Meanwhile, the accretion area reached 158,615 m2 in Gianyar and 32,159 m2 in Klungkung Regency.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Bali; Coastline change; Erosion; MNDWI; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141838816"

To perpetrate such an exigent task, an attempt is made to prepare a novel dataset, the CaneSat dataset, in two formats: RGB color space and geo-tiff images, covering the region of four talukas in Karnataka, India. This research aims to build a model for sugarcane classification using two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet) applying RS time series data. Further, the study intents to evaluate competency of four state-of-the-art deep CNNs namely AlexNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 using fine tuning and deep CNNs as feature extractors to classify sugarcane and non-sugarcane areas from Sentinel-2 data. The results of the research are expressive on CaneSat dataset. It shows that the CNN model performs significantly good producing 88.46% accuracy, whereas all deep networks exhibit more than 73.00% overall accuracy. When used as feature extractors, ResNet50 and DenseNet201 outperform all other models with precision of 85.65% and 87.70%, respectively.

Combining spaceborne optical and microwave data is essential for accurate classification in areas with frequent cloud cover, such as tropical regions. In this study, we investigate the possible improvements, when SAR data is incorporated into the classification process along with optical data. We used MSI/Sentinel-2 and SAR/Sentinel-1 to provide LULC mapping in the Roraima State, Brazil, in 2019. This State is located in a tropical area, where the cloud cover is frequent over the year. Cloud cover becomes substantial, especially during the May-August period when crops are grown. Twenty-nine scenarios involving a combination of optical- and SAR-based features, as well as times of data acquisition, were considered in this study. Our results showed that optical or SAR data used individually are not enough to provide accurate LULC mapping. The best results in terms of overall accuracy (OA) were achieved using metrics of multi-temporal surface reflectance and vegetation index (VI) for optical imagery, and values of backscatter coefficient in different polarizations and their ratios yielding an OA of 86.41 ± 1.74%. Analysis of three periods of data (January to April, May to August, and September to December) used for classification allowed us to identify the optimal period for distinguishing specific classes. When comparing our LULC map with a LULC product derived within the MapBiomas project we observed that our method performed better to map annual and perennial crops and water classes. Our methodology provides a more accurate LULC for the Roraima State, and the proposed technique can be applied to benefit other regions that are affected by persistent cloud cover. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This issue is particularly relevant for image classification on time series data, considering RS datasets that feature long temporal coverage generally have a limited spatial resolution. Recent advances in deep learning brought new opportunities for enhancing the spatial resolution of historic RS data. Numerous convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods showed superior performance in terms of developing efficient end-to-end SR models for natural images. However, such models were rarely exploited for promoting image classification based on multispectral RS data. This paper proposes a novel CNN-based framework to enhance the spatial resolution of time series multispectral RS images. Thereby, the proposed SR model employs Residual Channel Attention Networks (RCAN) as a backbone structure, whereas based on this structure the proposed models uniquely integrate tailored channel-spatial attention and dense-sampling mechanisms for performance improvement. Subsequently, state-of-the-art CNN-based classifiers are incorporated to produce classification maps based on the enhanced time series data. The experiments proved that the proposed SR model can enable unambiguously better performance compared to RCAN and other (deep learning-based) SR techniques, especially in a domain adaptation context, i.e., leveraging Sentinel-2 images for generating SR Landsat images. Furthermore, the experimental results confirmed that the enhanced multi-temporal RS images can bring substantial improvement on fine-grained multi-temporal land use classification. © 2021","artificial neural network; image classification; image resolution; land use; remote sensing; sampling; spatial resolution; time series","Attention mechanism; Convolutional neural networks; Dense connection; Image super-resolution; Multi-temporal land use classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121645574"

One of the most invasive species on Earth is the water hyacinth. These plants are harmful to biodiversity and create negative impacts on society and economy. The Guadiana river (one of the most important ones in Spain) has suffered from this problem since the early 2000s. Several efforts have been made to mitigate it. However, invasive plants, such as the water hyacinth, are still present in seed banks at the bottom of the river and can germinate even more than a decade after. In this article, we propose an automatic methodology, based on remote sensing and deep learning techniques, to monitor the water hyacinth in the Guadiana river. Specifically, a multitemporal analysis was carried out during two years using images collected by ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite, analyzed with a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that, with our strategy, the river can be monitored every few days, and we are able to automatically detect the water hyacinth. Three experiments have been carried out to predict the presence of water hyacinth from a few scattered training samples, which represent invasive plants in different phenological stages and with different spectral responses.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Guadiana River; Spain; Biodiversity; Deep learning; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Seed; Aquatic plants; Aquatic species; Deep learning; Invasive aquatic species; Invasive plants; Invasive species; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Seedbanks; Spatiotemporal distributions; Water Hyacinth; aquatic plant; invasive species; machine learning; monitoring; population distribution; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; Rivers","Deep learning (DL); invasive aquatic species; multitemporal remote sensing; water hyacinth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144009951"

Batticaloa Lagoon is one of the major mangrove areas in Sri Lanka. This region underwent degradation of mangroves due to a number of natural and anthropogenic factors, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Mangrove reforestation was conducted after the 2004 tsunami event in this area. The present study investigated the outcome of such activities in this lagoon in eastern Sri Lanka. Spatiotemporal changes in mangroves in Batticaloa Lagoon was estimated using multi-temporal satellite (Landsat, Sentinel-2, RapidEye and PlanetScope) data.

However, severe gully erosion triggered by extreme rainfall and intense human activities makes tableland areas shrink continuously. Preventing the loss of tableland areas is of real urgency, in which generating its accurate distribution map is the critical prerequisite. However, a plateau-scale inventory of tableland areas is still lacking across the Loess Plateau. This study proposed a large-scale approach for tableland area mapping. The Sentinel-2 imagery was used for the initial delineation based on object-based image analysis and random forest model. Subsequently, the drainage networks extracted from AW3D30 DEM were applied for correcting commission and omission errors based on the law that rivers and streams rarely appear on the tableland areas. The automatic mapping approach performs well, with the overall accuracies over 90% in all four investigated subregions. After the strict quality control by manual inspection, a high-quality inventory of tableland areas at 10 m resolution was generated, demonstrating that the tableland areas occupied 9507.31 km2 across the CLP. Cultivated land is the dominant land-use type on the tableland areas, yet multi-temporal observations indicated that it has decreased by approximately 500 km2 during the year of 2000 to 2020. In contrast, forest and artificial surfaces increased by 57.53% and 73.10%, respectively. Additionally, we detected 455 vulnerable hotspots of the tableland with a width of less than 300 m. Particular attention should be paid to these areas to prevent the potential split of a large tableland, accompanied by damage on roads and buildings. This plateau-scale tableland inventory and erosion-vulnerable hotspots are expected to support the environmental protection policymaking for sustainable development in the CLP region severely threatened by soil erosion and land degradation. © 2022 by the authors.

It has resulted in significant changes in estuarine wetland ecosystems between rainy and dry seasons. To avoid estuary vulnerability, monitoring and evaluation of the estuarine ecosystems are very critical tasks. The main goal of this research is to propose and implement a novel deep learning method in monitoring various ecosystems in estuarine regions. The processing speed and accuracy of common neural networks is improved more than ten times through spatial and context paths integrated into a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). The multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite images (including Sentinel-2, ALOS-DEM, and NOAA-DEM images) served as input data. As a result, four BiSeNet models out of 20 trained models achieved a greater than 90% accuracy, especially for interpreting estuarine waters, intertidal forested wetlands, and aquacultural lands in subtidal regions. These models outperformed Random Forest and Support Vector Machine approaches.

The need for satellite systems to monitor rice crops and assist in rice crop management is gaining in popularity. The European Space Agency's (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform's which enhanced the temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution, opening the way for their widely use in crop monitoring. Aside from the technical features of the Sentinel-2 A and B constellation, the easily accessible type of information they generate as well as the appropriate support software have been significant improvements for rice crop monitoring. In this study, the spectral reflectance has been analysed to find how far their potential in determining rice growth phases. The highest spectrum in reflectance was observed in the near infrared (NIR) region (842 nm). Because of the structure of mesophyll cells tissues and the inner backscatter of air spaces, moisture content, and air-water abstraction layers within the leaves, the reflectance in the NIR region seems to be much larger than in the visible band. The multi-temporal vegetation index namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) have derived from ten Sentinel-2 images cover the entire rice season. These indices have been tested to determine the rice growth phases over the rice season. The spatial distribution of each tested indices is displayed in the map output. The maps are then analysed and compared to determine the potential of each index in determining rice growth phases. It was discovered in this study that there was a quadratic correlation between all of the tested indices and rice age. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most accurate vegetation index for estimating rice growth phases, followed by SAVI and NDMI.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135488177"

Volcanic activity is always present when heat is transferred from the Earth's surface layer into the air. This thermal anomaly may be perceived using remote sensing and which is a quick approach to detect volcanic activity. Active volcanoes are detected using satellite thermal data, which is also used to anticipate eruptions and display drifts and forms at the time of eruption disasters. The goal of this study is to keep track on India's only stravo-volcano, Barren Island Volcano (BIV), which has been active since 1991 with reference to thermal activity. The BIV's land surface temperature (LST) is monitored using Landsat 8 thermal infrared (TIR) data to detect eruptions and track thermal activity. When clear images of Landsat 8 are not possible during an eruption, Sentinel-2 data is used to identify volcanic eruption features like, lava flow, ash plume, and direction of lava flow from the cinder cone by visual interpretation. For the development of global volcanic monitoring, it is critical to combine different satellite data. Based on numerous satellite data and observations, BIV activity was studied throughout the active period from January, 2017 to March, 2021. Here, the two eruptive phases of January-March, 2017 and September, 2018 to January, 2019 were considered. Middle infrared observation of volcanic activity (MIROVA) system estimates volcanic radiative power (VRP) using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor data and radiant flues of the volcanoes will be presented in the web resource www.mirovaweb.it. This database was utilized by the current research work to validate LST estimated by using mono-window algorithm based on Landsat 8 data. In addition to that, thermal anomaly in the form of fire pixels temperature values was estimated and made available to public in national aeronautics and space administration’s (NASA) fire information for resource management system (FIRMS) database. The temperature data which is available in the NASA's FIRMS was used to compare estimated LST values at the study location BIV using high spatial resolution Landsat 8 data. FIRMS uses Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite–band 14 (VIIRS-14) sensor data to estimate fire pixels temperature values. Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (NPP) spacecraft of NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20) spacecraft carry VIIRS sensor. Finally, morphological changes and thermal deviations in topical eruptive episodes of the BIV were deliberated using multi-sensor, multi-temporal and multi-resolution data from various portions of the radio-frequency spectrum. From the results it was observed that, estimated LST values and Sentinel-2 based false colour composite (FCC) images can have the ability to predict the thermal changes occurring at active volcanoes. © 2022 A.

This approach is intended to be generic and independent of the type of satellite used, whether band limited or multispectral. It is based on a global analysis of the sequence. The statistical detection method is applied to a residual sequence computed from backward and forward novelty filters applied to all images in the series. Significant changes are computed with a guarantee on their number of false alarms (NFA). To establish the efficiency of the method, we have created an open database of 28 sequences of 20 images acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellite, in different regions of the world.

It was observed that during peak growing stage all crops ascribed higher Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI values (0.4 to 0.73) and NDVI became as low as 0.06 when the fields were vacant. Sentinel-2 data acquired in the peak crop growing period during each cropping season were carefully selected, and NDVI was computed over the whole study area. Rule-based classification was applied for cropping sequence and cropping intensity classification based on the occurrence and non-occurrence of crops using NDVI threshold (0.4). Sentinel-2 images acquired on 22/10/2018, 6/12/2018, 30/1/2019 and 30/4/2019 were used for masking of trees and non-agricultural area. October 22, January 30 and April 30 imageries demonstrated peak crop growing period during kharif, rabi and pre-kharif seasons whereas December 6 image represented occurrence of no or little crop in the study area. Crop acreage was the highest in Polba-Dadpur block during all the three seasons. The crop–fallow—crop sequence occupied the highest areas (43%) followed by crop–crop–crop sequence (39%). 50% and 39% of the total cultivated land was under 200% and 300% cropping intensities. Overall, accuracies of cropping system and cropping intensity classification were 88.54% and 87.85%, respectively.

The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016–2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km2 and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments. © 2022 by the authors.

Therefore, we adopted a multitemporal and multispectral approach using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in combination with the NDVI vegetation index, Haralick's textural measures, and topographic information. The workflow identifies a methodology for combining various groups of input data (optical, NDVI, textural, topographic) and explores the suitable use of the Random Forest classifier for the task. The classification was carried out in three different European locations. The results present a strong separation of arable land (F1 score over 96%) from the other two classes.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of surface biophysical features in the land crop/cover classification accuracy and introduce a new fusion-based method with more accurate results for land crop/cover classification. For this purpose, multi-temporal images from Sentinel 1 and 2, and an actual land crop map prepared by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) in 2019 were used for 3 test sites in Ontario, Canada. Firstly, surface biophysical features maps were prepared based on spectral indices from Sentinel 2 including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), Wetness, Albedo, and Brightness and co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH) from Sentinel 1 for different dates. Then, different scenarios were generated; these included single surface biophysical features as well as a combination of several surface biophysical features. Secondly, land crop/cover maps were prepared for each scenario based on the Random Forest (RF). In the third step, based on the voting strategy, classification maps from different scenarios were combined. Finally, the accuracy of the land crop/cover maps obtained from each of the scenario was evaluated. The results showed that the average overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps obtained from individual scenario (one feature) including NDVI, IBI, Wetness, Albedo, Brightness, VV and VH were 66%, 68%, 63%, 60%, 57%, 62% and 58%, respectively, which by the surface biophysical features fusion, the overall accuracy of land crop/cover maps increased to 83%. Also, by combining the classification results obtained from different scenarios based on voting strategy, the overall accuracy increased to 89%. The results of this study indicate that the feature level-based fusion of surface biophysical features and decision level based fusion of land crop/cover maps obtained from various scenarios increases the accuracy of land crop/cover classification. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Ontario; Remote Sensing Technology; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Biophysics; Crops; Decision trees; Food supply; Luminance; Polarization; Solar radiation; Classification accuracy; Features fusions; Land crop/cover; Normalized difference vegetation index; Overall accuracies; Random forests; Remote-sensing; Scenario-based; Sentinel-1; Surface biophysical feature; accuracy assessment; land cover; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; agriculture; article; brightness; Canada; crop; nonhuman; Ontario; polarization; random forest; remote sensing; vegetation; environmental monitoring; procedures; Remote sensing","Fusion; Land crop/cover; Random forest; Remote sensing; Surface biophysical features","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131720834"

In this context, remote sensing images have shown a high potential in forest cover changes detection. In Vietnam, although the existence of a large number of such images and ground-truth labels, current researches still relied on classical methods employed manual indices, such as multi-variant change vector analysis (MVCA) and normalized difference vegetation index. These methods highly require domain knowledge to determine threshold values for forest change that are applicable only for studied areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to detect coastal forest cover changes, which can exploit available dataset and ground-truth labels. Moreover, the proposed method does not require much domain knowledge. We used multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery to train a segmentation model, that is based on the U-Net network. It was used then to detect forest areas at the same location taken at different times. Lastly, we compared obtained results to identify forest disturbances. Experimental results demonstrated that our method provided a high accuracy of 95.4% on the testing set. Furthermore, we compared our model with the MVCA method and found that our model outperforms this popular method by 3.8%. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This study focuses on a deep learning-based method for dynamic forest change detection using Sentinel-2 satellite data, especially within mountainous areas. First, the performance of various deep learning models (U-Net++, U-Net, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, and STANet) and various loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss(CELoss), DiceLoss, FocalLoss, and their combinations) are compared on a self-made dataset. Next, the best model and loss function is used to predict the annual forest change in Hunan Province from 2017 to 2021, and the detection results are evaluated in 12 sample areas. Finally, forest changes are detected in Sentinel-2 images for each quarter of 2017–2021. In addition, a dynamic detection map of forest change in Hunan Province from 2017 to 2021 is drawn. The results reveal that the U-Net++ model and the CELoss performed the best on the self-made dataset, with a Precision of 0.795, a Recall of 0.748, and an F1-score of 0.771. The results of annual and quarterly forest change detection were consistent with the changes in the Sentinel-2 images with accurate boundaries. This result demonstrates the high practicality and generalizability of the method used in this paper. This paper achieves a rapid and accurate extraction of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image forest change areas based on the U-Net++ model, which can be used as a benchmark for future large territorial areas monitoring and management of forest resources. © 2023 by the authors.","Deep learning; Forestry; Learning systems; Natural resources; Change detection; Deep learning; Dynamic detection; Forest change; Forest resources; Forestlands; Hunan province; LinkNet; Loss functions; Sentinel-2; Change detection","deep learning; dynamic detection; forest change; Hunan Province; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147964617"

Studies show that these methods lead to many errors and are time-consuming and costly. Satellite remote sensing imagery is widely used in agriculture to provide timely, high-resolution data and analytical capabilities. Earth observations with high spatial and temporal resolution have provided an excellent opportunity for monitoring and mapping crop fields. This study used the time series of dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 ESA’s Copernicus program to extract rice cultivation areas in Mazandaran province in Iran. A novel multi-channel streams deep feature extraction method was proposed to simultaneously take advantage of SAR and optical imagery. The proposed framework extracts deep features from the time series of NDVI and original SAR images by first and second streams. In contrast, the third stream integrates them into multi-levels (shallow to deep high-level features); it extracts deep features from the channel attention module (CAM), and group dilated convolution. The efficiency of the proposed method was assessed on approximately 129,000 in-situ samples and compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results showed that combining NDVI time series and SAR data can significantly improve rice-type mapping. Moreover, the proposed methods had high efficiency compared with other methods, with more than 97% overall accuracy. The performance of rice-type mapping based on only time-series SAR images was better than only time-series NDVI datasets. Moreover, the classification performance of the proposed framework in mapping the Shirodi rice type was better than that of the Tarom type. © 2022 by the authors.","","attention modules; deep learning; multi-temporal; NDVI; rice mapping; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144724642"

This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology to estimate the water volume changes in water reservoirs. Two specific methods are proposed using Australian National University’s Digital Elevation Model (ANUDEM) raster surface and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface models, both utilizing normalized difference water index (NDWI) of Sentinel 2A satellite images for water-covered area and coastline and digital elevation model (DEM) for 3D modelling of the reservoir. The most crucial part of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of the model findings considering hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic factors, simultaneously. Application of the proposed methods is provided for the analysis of the multi-temporal water volume changes of Bayramiç Dam Lake (Çanakkale, Turkey) in two hydrological periods covering the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 water years. The results indicate that the TINS model produced water volume values much closer to the in situ Turkish General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) values than the ANUDEM model. The performance of these methods was also assessed by the temporal dynamics of surface hydrological processes. Regarding the water storage dynamics, hydro-meteorological factors influence the water input, while anthropogenic factors strongly influence the water output. Water consumption for irrigation and electricity generation was found to be the most important water budget components of the total water consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anthropogenic Effects; Australia; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Lakes; Remote Sensing Technology; Water; Australia; 3D modeling; Budget control; Digital instruments; Digital storage; Geomorphology; Lakes; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Surveying; water; Anthropogenic factors; Australian National University; Digital elevation model; Meteorological factors; Normalized difference water index; Reservoir volume; Surface modeling; Volume change; Water reservoir volume; Water volumes; comparative study; dam; digital elevation model; environmental assessment; GIS; lake water; NDVI; remote sensing; reservoir; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Article; Australia; comparative study; dam (barrier); financial management; geographic information system; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); lake ecosystem; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; normalized difference water index; remote sensing; satellite imagery; scoring system; surface water hydrology; Turkey (republic); water monitoring; water supply; environmental monitoring; human; lake; Geographic information systems","DEM; GIS; NDWI; Surface models; Water reservoir volume","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122968838"

An up-to-date high-quality glacial lake dataset with parameters such as lake area, volume, and type, which is fundamental to water resource and flood risk assessments and prediction of glacier-lake evolutions, is still largely absent for the entire CPEC. This study describes a glacial lake dataset for the CPEC using a threshold-based mapping method associated with rigorous visual inspection workflows. This dataset includes (1) multi-temporal inventories for 1990, 2000, and 2020 produced from 30m resolution Landsat images and (2) a glacial lake inventory for the year 2020 at 10m resolution produced from Sentinel-2 images. The results show that, in 2020, 2234 lakes were derived from the Landsat images, covering a total area of 86.31±14.98km2 with a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 5 pixels (4500m2), whereas 7560 glacial lakes were derived from the Sentinel-2 images with a total area of 103.70±8.45km2 with an MMU of 5 pixels (500m2). The discrepancy shows that Sentinel-2 can detect a large quantity of smaller lakes compared to Landsat due to its finer spatial resolution. Glacial lake data in 2020 were validated by Google Earth-derived lake boundaries with a median (± standard deviation) difference of 7.66±4.96% for the Landsat-derived product and 4.46±4.62% for the Sentinel-derived product. The total number and area of glacial lakes from consistent 30m resolution Landsat images remain relatively stable despite a slight increase from 1990 to 2020. A range of critical attributes has been generated in the dataset, including lake types and mapping uncertainty estimated by an improved equation of Hanshaw and Bookhagen (2014). This comprehensive glacial lake dataset has the potential to be widely applied in studies on water resource assessment, glacial lake-related hazards, and glacier-lake interactions and is freely available at 10.12380/Glaci.msdc.000001 (Lesi et al., 2022).  © 2022 Muchu Lesi et al.","","","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145583282"

Local specialty fruits (e.g. walnut, jujube, apricot, fragrant pear, and apple) have been produced in four prefectures of Southern Xinjiang around the Tarim River Basin, accounting for more than 80% of the total fruit planting area in Xinjiang. It is very necessary to real-time and accurately acquire the fruit tree type and area information under the pattern of forest and crops interplanting, further to improve the quality and efficiency of the specialty fruit industry. Taking the continuous area of forest and crops interplanting in Hotan oasis of southern Xinjiang in China as an example, this study aims to extract the structure information of fruit trees from the satellite images. The high-resolution remote sensing image data with abundant texture and spectral characteristics was also integrated with the medium-resolution sensing image data with multi-temporal characteristics. Firstly, an object-oriented programming was used to extract the high-precision boundary of fruit trees parcel using GF-2 (PMS) image data. The GF-2 image data was divided into the winter (February) and summer-autumn (July-September). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was determined to identify the spectral and texture features between target objects and other ground objects. Four plots were obtained to gradually eliminate the non-target ground categories. Then, the NDVI time series products were constructed using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image data. A decision tree model was established to extract the interplanting walnut, pure walnut, jujube, and grape orchard, according to the characteristics of phenology. There were many peaks and troughs in the NDVI time series curve of fruit trees in one year. The peak represented the flourishing period of fruit trees' growth, and the trough reflected the orchard management (such as irrigation and pruning branches). There were some outstanding and different time windows for the NDVI timing series of pure walnut, interplanting walnut, jujubes, and grapes, particularly for the rarely staggered overlapping. These differences were greatly contributed to the classification of fruit trees. Finally, the multi-phase orchard classification was overlaid the high-resolution of fruit trees parcel, further to obtain the distribution of fruit crops in the study area. The research results show that the major area of fruit was 4.28×105 hm2 here, with 3.31×105 hm2 of the walnut orchard (including interplanting and pure walnut), 8.29×104 hm2 of jujube, and 1.40×104 hm2 of grapes. The area of interplanting walnuts accounted for 63.8% of the total fruit area, The user accuracy and overall classification accuracy were both exceed 90%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.95, fully meeting the accuracy requirements of agroforestry classification at the county and city level. The relative accuracies of walnuts, jujube, and grapes were 62.1%, 97.8%, and 85.2%, respectively, using remote sensing extraction, compared with the forestry survey in 2019. The areas of jujube and grape using remote sensing extraction were close to the forestry survey data. The walnut planting areas in the Hotan area were mainly distributed in the upper reaches of Yurunkax and Karakax River with suitable soil and water conditions. The jujube trees were mostly distributed in the downstream oasis-desert ecotone, and the grapes were mostly distributed in the sandy desert of the lower reaches of the Karakax River. This finding can provide a strong reference for the fruit tree extraction under the pattern of forest and crop intercropping. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this context, multi-sensor image fusion allows a comprehensive representation of biophysical and structural information. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods are used for several applications due to their spatial-spectral interpretability. Hence, this study explores the potential of fused multi-temporal Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images for Land Use/Land Cover classification over an agricultural area in India. For classification, Bayesian optimised 2D CNN-based DL and pixel-based SVM classifiers were used. For fusion, a CNN-based siamese network with Ratio-of-Laplacian pyramid method was used for the images acquired over the entire winter cropping period. This fusion strategy leads to better interpretability of results and also found that 2D CNN-based DL classifier performed well in terms of classification accuracy for both single-month (95.14% and 96.11%) as well as multi-temporal (99.87% and 99.91%) fusion in comparison to the SVM with classification accuracy for single-month (80.02% and 81.36%) and multi-temporal fusion (95.69% and 95.84%). Results indicate better performance by Vertical-Vertical polarised fused images than Vertical-Horizontal polarised fused images. Thus, implying the need to analyse classified images obtained by DL classifiers along with the classification accuracy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Image classification; Image fusion; Land use; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Bayesian optimization; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Fused images; Interpretability; Multi-temporal; Network-based; Support vector machine; Support vectors machine; artificial neural network; Bayesian analysis; image analysis; image classification; optical method; optimization; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; Support vector machines","Bayesian Optimisation; Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Fusion; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121724919"

Accurate detection of RB occurrence with a universal metric is crucial to facilitate early disease prevention and curtailing the disease expansion but has not been addressed to date. This study aimed to design a rice blast index (RIBI) for quantifying the disease index (DI) and tracking the smallholder rice blast dispersal over multiple spatial scales. To achieve this goal, a large dataset including leaf- and canopy-scale reflectance spectra and satellite imagery was acquired within the framework of seven independent campaigns over four years (2018–2021). Specifically, an extensive collection of Magnaporthe oryzae infected samples were analyzed to examine the specific spectral response to pathogen infection in paddy rice from leaf to near-ground canopy scales. Two variants of the RIBI were developed, which were RIBInir = (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) and RIBIred = (R753-R1102)/(R665 + R1102) based on the single-band separability and exhaustive search of band combinations. They were subsequently evaluated for quantifying the RB occurrence from ground to space. Spatial cluster analysis was then integrated with the superior RIBI adjusted for Sentinel-2 imagery to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogen infection, and to reveal the within-field hotspots of potential rice blast dispersal in smallholder farms. The results demonstrated that both RIBInir and RIBIred exhibited high overall accuracies for the classification of infected and healthy samples at the leaf scale under greenhouse in 2018 (RIBInir: 81.41%; RIBIred: 84.62%) and 2019 (RIBInir: 81.30%; RIBIred: 90.37%) and field conditions in 2020 (RIBInir: 86.36%; RIBIred: 89.39%). Compared with traditional VIs (Near-ground: R2 < 0.47, satellite: R2 < 0.54), the RIBInir yielded improved R2 in quantifying the DI from in situ spectra to satellite imagery (Near-ground: R2 = 0.73, satellite: R2 = 0.78). The strongest DI-RIBInir relationship was attributed to the use of two near-infrared (NIR) bands that helped enhance the unique spectral responses in the NIR region induced by pathogen infection, in contrast to the extensively studied visible region. Multi-temporal analysis of Sentinel-2A derived RIBInir successfully captured the temporal dynamics of RB infection and recovery and yielded compelling maps showing the spatial propagation and attenuation of disease over time. This research opens new opportunities towards quantifying field disease occurrence and detecting the within-field hotspots of potential disease dispersal in a timely manner from publicly available satellite imagery. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cluster analysis; Crops; Diseases; Food supply; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Large dataset; Textures; Crop disease; Disease index; Disease-specific vegetation index; Hot-spot analyse; Hotspots; HyperSpectral; Magnaporthe oryzae; Multi-temporal analysis; Rice blasts; Vegetation index; dispersal; fungus; host-pathogen interaction; index method; infectious disease; paddy field; rice; satellite imagery; smallholder; Satellite imagery","Crop disease; Disease-specific vegetation index; Hot-spot analysis; Hyperspectral; Multi-temporal analysis; Rice blast","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142707929"

Digital SOC mapping is essential for agricultural production management. Digital SOC mapping based on multi-source remote sensing data has been integrated well into prediction models and methodological approaches on different mapping scales. However, the mixed use of synthetic images and the application of the hybrid model considering the soil classification probability are rare. Here, we propose a probability hybrid model to estimate and map SOC content and distribution. Multi-temporal synthetic images were used to build the probability hybrid model. One hundred forty topsoil samples were collected in Suihua, a city in a typical black soil region in China. Cloud-free Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the bare soil periods between 2018 and 2021. Minimum, maximum, mean, and median synthetic images were calculated using single images from the same period. The random forest and support vector machine models were used for discriminating soil class and calculating soil classification probability, and then random forest regression model was applied to SOC mapping. Soil class mapping and classification probability were performed for Phaeozems, Chernozems, and Cambisols of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) based on soil texture, climatic factors, and the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Based on soil class mapping results, global models using single temporal images and multi-temporal images, the hybrid model using multi-temporal images for the three soil classes as well as a probability hybrid model using multi-temporal images were built and compared their SOC predictions. Our study showed that (1) Phaeozems, Chernozems and Cambisols could be classified accurately, and the overall validation accuracy of random forest model was 91.67%. (2) The correlations of SOC with bands and band indices improved using multi-temporal images, and the use of mixed synthetic images was better than the use of only one synthetic image. (3) The hybrid model performed far better than the global models, and the probability hybrid model led to the highest prediction accuracy, a validation R2 of 0.77 and an RMSE of 2.30 g kg−1. (4) The probability hybrid model was more accurate than the original hybrid model for digital SOC mapping, and the SOC distribution in boundary regions was smoother and more continuous. Our results suggest that the probability hybrid model has a large potential for SOC prediction and mapping. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","China; Agriculture; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Image enhancement; Organic carbon; Probability distributions; Random forests; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soils; Support vector machines; Textures; Vegetation mapping; Black soil regions; Hybrid model; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Probability hybrid model; Random forests; Soil class; Soil organic carbon; Synthetic images; Typical black soil region; accuracy assessment; agricultural production; bare soil; Cambisol; classification; mapping; model validation; NDVI; Phaeozem; probability; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil organic matter; Decision trees","Probability hybrid model; Random forest; SOC; Typical black soil regions","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134890081"

For the Amazon rainforest, automated mapping is of critical importance, as land cover is changing rapidly due to forest degradation and deforestation. Several research groups have addressed this challenge by conducting local surveys and producing maps using freely available remote sensing data. However, automating the process of large-scale land cover mapping remains one of the biggest challenges in the remote sensing community. One issue when using supervised learning is the scarcity of labeled training data. One way to address this problem is to make use of already available maps produced with (semi-) automated classifiers. This is also known as weakly supervised learning. The present study aims to develop novel methods for automated LULC classification in the cloud-prone Amazon basin (Brazil) based on the labels from the MapBiomas project, which include twelve classes. We investigate different fusion techniques for multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time-series from 2018. The newly designed deep learning architectures—DeepForest-1 and DeepForest-2—utilize spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as multi-scale representations of the data. In several data scenarios, the models are compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) models, such as U-Net and DeepLab. The proposed networks reach an overall accuracy of up to 75.0%, similar to the SotA models. However, the novel approaches outperform the SotA models with respect to underrepresented classes. Forest, savanna and crop were mapped best, with F1 scores up to 85.0% when combining multi-modal data, compared to 81.6% reached by DeepLab. Furthermore, in a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the classifiers sometimes outperform the inaccurate labels. © 2022 by the authors.","Automation; Data fusion; Deep learning; Deforestation; Land use; Mapping; Modal analysis; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Supervised learning; Tropics; Amazon rain forest; Deep learning; Land-use and land-cover classifications; Multi-modal; Multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Tropic; Weak supervision; Synthetic aperture radar","Amazon rainforest; data fusion; deep learning; land use and land cover classification; multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; tropics; weak supervision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140030738"

This paper presents the methodology developed to produce a prototype relative to 2018 as the first land cover map of the future annual map series (COSsim). A total of thirteen land cover classes are represented, including the most important tree species in Portugal. The mapping approach developed includes two levels of spatial stratification based on landscape dynamics. Strata are analysed independently at the higher level, while nested sublevels can share data and procedures. Multiple stages of analysis are implemented in which subsequent stages improve the outputs of precedent stages. The goal is to adjust mapping to the local landscape and tackle specific problems or divide complex mapping tasks in several parts. Supervised classification of Sentinel-2 time series and post-classification analysis with expert knowledge were performed throughout four stages. The overall accuracy of the map is estimated at 81.3% (±2.1) at the 95% confidence level.

In our case states represent affine transformations. The proposed method globally combines via synchronization pairwise transformations computed for all the image combinations of the multi-temporal sequence, beyond the traditional image-to-base approach available in remote sensing and GIS packages.

It automatically ingests and processes Sentinel-2 and LandSat 8 images. Our goal was to provide practitioners with recommendations for the best sample size and composition. The study area was located in the Yaqui Valley in Mexico. Using polygons of more than 6000 labeled crop fields, we prepared data sets for training, in which the nine crops had an equal or proportional representation, called Equal or Ratio, respectively. Increasing the size of the training set improved the overall accuracy (OA). Gains became marginal once the total number of fields approximated 500 or 40 to 45 fields per crop type. Equal achieved slightly higher OAs than Ratio for a given number of fields. However, recall and F-scores of the individual crops tended to be higher for Ratio than for Equal. The high number of wheat fields in the Ratio scenarios, ranging from 275 to 2128, produced a more accurate classification of wheat than the maximal 80 fields of Equal. This resulted in a higher recall for wheat in the Ratio than in the Equal scenarios, which in turn limited the errors of commission of the non-wheat crops. Thus, a proportional representation of the crops in the training data is preferable and yields better accuracies, even for the minority crops. © 2023 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Forestry; Remote sensing; Supervised learning; Crop classification; Machine-learning; Multi-temporal; Optimal samples; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Remote-sensing; Sample composition; Sample sizes; Software-systems; Crops","agriculture; crop classification; machine learning; random forest; remote sensing; sample size","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147936961"

Digital processing and classification methods were applied on multi-temporal data of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 to derive maps of irrigated areas for the period 2017–2019. Different relationships were developed between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the crop coefficient (Kc) to map evapotranspiration (ET). Using ground data, ET maps were transferred to IWC for the whole country. Spatial analysis was then used to delineate hotspots where shifts between ET and groundwater abstraction were observed. Results showed that the applied remote sensing methods provided accurate maps of irrigated areas. The NDVI-Kc relationships were significant, with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.89 to 0.93. Subsequently, the ET estimates from the NDVI-Kc relationships were in agreement with remotely sensed ET modeled by SEBAL (NSE = 0.89). In the context of Jordan, results showed that irrigated areas in the country reached 98 thousand ha in 2019, with 64% of this area located in the highlands. The main irrigated crops were vegetables (55%) and fruit trees and olives (40%). The total IWC reached 702 MCM in 2019, constituting 56% of the total water consumption in Jordan, with 375 MCM of this amount being pumped from groundwater, while reported abstraction was only 235 MCM. The study identified the hotspots where illegal abstraction or incorrect metering of groundwater existed. Furthermore, it emphasized the roles of remote sensing in AWM, as it provided updated figures on groundwater abstraction and forecasts for future IWC, which would reach 986 MCM in 2050. Therefore, the approach of ET and IWC mapping would be highly recommended to map ET and to provide estimates of present and future IWC. © 2022 by the authors.","Abstracting; Crops; Groundwater; Mapping; Orchards; Remote sensing; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural water management; Groundwater abstraction; Hotspots; Irrigation waters; Jordan; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetation index-kc; Remote-sensing; Water consumption; Waters managements; Irrigation","ET; irrigation; Jordan; NDVI-Kc; remote sensing; water management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145964074"

To reduce water scarcity in arid regions, recently, remote sensing and GIS techniques have been successfully applied to predict areas with prospective water resources. Thus, this study attempted to spatially reveal groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) and to conduct change detection on the desert fringes of Wadi Asyuti, a defunct tributary of Egypt’s Nile basin in eastern Sahara. Eleven influential groundwater factors generated from remote sensing imagery, and geological, hydrological, and climatic conditions were combined after giving a weight to each factor through a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with the weighted overlay technique (WOT). The results revealed six distinctive zones with scores ranging from very low (10.59%) to excellent (3.03%). Thirty-three productive groundwater wells, Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD), a land use map derived from Sentinel-2, and the delineated flooding zone derived from Landsat-8 data were used to validate the delineated zones. The GWPZs indicated that 48% of the collected wells can be classified as consistent to excellent. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and image classification were applied to the multi-temporal Landsat series and Sentinel-2 along with the InSAR CCD data derived from Sentinel-1 images to reveal dramatic changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) in terms of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in the structurally downstream area, which is the most promising area for future developments. Overall, the integration of radar and multispectral data through the GIS technique has the ability to provide valuable information about water resources in arid regions. Thus, the tested model is a promising technique, and such information is extremely significant for the guidance of planners and decision makers in the area of sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.","Egypt; Agriculture; Arid regions; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Groundwater resources; Land use; Planning; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Groundwater potentials; Interferometry synthetic aperture radars; LANDSAT; Modeling; Prospectives; Remote sensing and GIS; Remote-sensing; Water monitoring; Waters resources; arid region; detection method; environmental monitoring; human activity; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; mapping method; NDVI; numerical model; radar altimetry; remote sensing; water resource; Groundwater","arid region; change detection; GIS; groundwater; modeling; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136959766"

In recent decades, optical remote sensing has been widely used for mapping f c, f cr, and f bs. The crop residue and soil spectra decrease rapidly with increasing cropland moisture primarily because of water absorption in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands. This leads to a decrease in the denominator of current normalized crop residue spectral indices (shortwave infrared [SWIR] band 1 + band 2), thereby causing them to increase with increasing cropland moisture. This study revealed that the slopes of the soil and crop residue spectra between SWIR1 and SWIR2 were less affected by cropland moisture changes. Based on this feature, we propose a shortwave infrared angle (SWIRA) index and jointly use it with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate and produce multi-temporal maps of f c, f cr, and f bs using broadband Sentinel-2 MSI images. The proposed SWIRA is the slope of the spectrum between SWIR1 and SWIR2. This study (i) uses laboratory-based spectral reflectance to evaluate the performance of the SWIRA and (ii) further evaluates the performance of the SWIRA–NDVI method using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI images. Our results indicate that (i) cropland moisture has a considerably smaller effect on SWIRA than it does on current broadband normalized crop residue spectral indices, and (ii) maps of the estimated f c, f cr, and f bs values can be used to improve crop growth and decision-making, for example, by providing harvest maps and soil tillage intensity maps. © 2022 The Author(s).

Remote sensing products provide essential information for the crop classification application, which is used to produce thematic maps. High-resolution and regional-scale maps of agricultural land are required to develop better adapted future strategies. Nevertheless, the performance of crop classification using large spatio-temporal data remains challenging due to the difficulties in handling huge amounts of input data (different spatial and temporal resolutions). This paper proposes an innovative approach of remote sensing data management that was used to prepare the input data for the crop classification application. This classification was carried out in the Cap Bon region, Tunisia, to classify citrus groves among two other crop classes (olive groves and open field) using multi-temporal remote sensing data from Sentinel- 1 and Sentinel-2 satellite platforms. Thus, we described the new QGIS plugin “Model Management Tool (MMT)”. This plugin was designed to manage large Earth observation (EO) data. This tool is based on the combination of two concepts: (i) the local nested grid (LNG) called Tuplekeys and (ii) Datacubes. Tuplekeys or special spatial regions were created within a LNG to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. The Datacubes concept allows to provide an arranged array of time-series multi-dimensional stacks (space, time and data) of gridded data. Two different classification processes were performed based on the selection of the input feature (the obtained time-series as input data: NDVI and NDVI + VV + VH) and on the most accurate algorithm for each scenario (22 tested classifiers). The obtained results revealed that the best classification performance and highest accuracy were obtained with the scenario using only optical-based information (NDVI), with an overall accuracy OA = 0.76. This result was obtained by support vector machine (SVM). As for the scenario relying on the combination of optical and SAR data (NDVI + VV + VH), it presented an OA = 0.58. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the new data management tool in organizing the input classification data. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of optical data to provide acceptable classification performance especially for a complex landscape such as that of the Cap Bon. The information obtained from this work will allow the estimation of the water requirements of citrus orchards and the improvement of irrigation scheduling methodologies. Likewise, many future methodologies will certainly rely on the combination of Tuplekeys and Datacubes concepts which have been tested within the MMT tool. © 2022 by the authors.","Application programs; Classification (of information); Crops; Information management; Maps; Monitoring; Observatories; Optical remote sensing; Space optics; Support vector machines; ARD; Citrus; Crop classification; Data cube; Earth observations; Olive; Plug-ins; QGIS plugin; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Support vectors machine; Time series","ARD; citrus; crop classification; Datacubes; Earth observation; interoperability; olive; QGIS plugin; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140037493"

For example, while the earliest versions of Planet's CubeSats provided tri-band and then quad-band optical image data, the most recent iterations deliver imaging capabilities with eight unique spectral bands for Earth system monitoring. To determine the utility of these rich geospatial data collections for a range of applications, it is necessary to characterise their radiometric accuracy. Leveraging on-ground spectroradiometer measurements of radiometrically pseudo-invariant features, we assess the absolute accuracy of an annual sequence of Planet SuperDove surface reflectance data. Date-coincident and spectrally overlapping Sentinel-2 image data were also used to assess the relative radiometric accuracy of the CubeSat reflectance data. Additionally, confidence levels for acquiring consistent SuperDove surface reflectance data were calculated, and the multi-temporal patterns of surface reflectance between the SuperDove and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products were evaluated by examining their rank correlation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) the average accuracy of the Coastal-Blue, Blue, Green I, and Green II SuperDove surface reflectance bands was 5% higher than for the Yellow, Red, Red-Edge, and Near-Infrared bands; (2) the SuperDove surface reflectance data was on average almost identical to the surface reflectance derived from the coincident Sentinel-2 data; and (3) the radiometric accuracies (i.e., mean errors) can be improved by using band combinations (e.g. normalised difference vegetation index). However, due to the different radiometric performance between the spectral bands, some vegetation indices (e.g. the Yellowness Index) did not provide a linear relationship between the SuperDove and reference data. The probability of acquiring surface reflectance data with less than 5% reflectance variation was approximately 90% for the annual multi-satellite dataset. On average, 68% of the data derived from a single satellite had at least 95% probability of acquiring surface reflectance with less than 5% variation. The time series patterns of the SuperDove reflectance data had an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 for all types of surface units and 0.77 for vegetated surfaces when compared with the spectrally overlapping bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. In addition to providing confidence levels for users to directly assess the radiometric accuracies of SuperDove surface reflectance products, we also provide suggestions to improve the data quality from an end-user's perspective. © 2022","accuracy assessment; radiometric method; satellite constellation; spatial data; spectral reflectance; surface reflectance","CubeSat; PlanetScope constellation; Radiometric accuracy; SuperDove; Surface reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138334985"

One of the basic tasks is the pixel-wise classification of land cover, i.e.The task of identifying the physical material of the Earth's surface in an image. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) are successfully used for this task. In this paper, we investigate different FCN variants, using different methods for the computation of spatial, spectral, and temporal features. We investigate the impact of 3D convolutions in the spatial-Temporal as well as in the spatial-spectral dimensions in comparison to 2D convolutions in the spatial dimensions only. Additionally, we introduce a new method to generate multitemporal input patches by using time intervals instead of fixed acquisition dates. We then choose the image that is closest in time to the middle of the corresponding time interval, which makes our approach more flexible with respect to the requirements for the acquisition of new data. Using these multi-Temporal input patches, generated from Sentinel-2 images, we improve the classification of land cover by 4% in the mean F1-score and 1.3% in the overall accuracy compared to a classification using mono-Temporal input patches. Furthermore, the usage of 3D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions improves the classification performance by a small amount of 0.4% in the mean F1-score and 1.2% in the overall accuracy.  © Authors 2022.","Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; 3d-CNN; Convolutional neural network; Earth's surface; Fully convolutional neural network; Land cover; Land cover classification; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Remote-sensing; Spatial temporals; Convolution","3D-CNN; FCN; land cover classification; Multi-Temporal images; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132043839"

The Yarlung Zangbo River is not only a global plateau river with typical regional characteristics, but also an important international river. However, due to its remote location, mountainous terrains, and harsh environmental conditions, the gauge stations are sparsely distributed in the Yarlung Zangbo River, which greatly impedes a better understanding of its hydrological dynamic characteristics. Satellite remote sensing makes it possible to monitor and analyze the wide and long-term dynamic changes and to examine the hydrological characteristics of the Yarlung Zangbo River by providing multi-temporal image data. Based on the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) dataset and the threshold segmentation method of water boundary inundation frequency, this study reconstructed the complete monthly water area of the study area, and then estimated the spatial and temporal distribution of the river width from 2000 to 2020. The results indicate that due to the seasonal differences in temperature and precipitation, the width of the river showed a significant seasonal variation from 2000 to 2020. The seasonal variation in the middle reaches was the largest (453.6 m), while that of the downstream was the smallest (90.3 m). Influenced by climate and topography, the spatial distribution of river width in the whole course of the Yarlung Zangbo River varies greatly. The narrowest part of the observed river channel is about 30 m, i.e., a spatial resolution of Landsat images. The maximum river width in the middle and lower reaches of braided rivers can reach 5935.7 m. About 50% of the river segments of the Yarlung Zangbo River are narrower than 150 m, and only 2.0% of the river segments are wider than 2000 m. From 2000 to 2020, the average river width of the main stream first decreased, then increased and finally decreased. There was a very significant positive correlation between the mean river width of the mainstream and precipitation and air temperature, and the correlation coefficient R was 0.7, which passed the confidence test of 0.01. In addition, the monthly river width based on GLAD was also evaluated by the river width results derived from 10 m resolution Sentinel-2 data. The results showed that both of the relative deviations were less than 2%, indicating that the estimation results were relatively reliable in general. © 2022, Science Press.

In this article, we develop a novel crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology. However, for crop mapping, the selection and labeling of training samples is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a fully automated training-sample-selection method. First, we design the method according to image processing algorithms and the concept of a sliding window. Second, we develop the Geo-3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and Geo-Conv1D for crop classification using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery. Specifically, we integrate geographic information of crops into the structure of deep-learning networks. Finally, we apply an active learning strategy to integrate the classification advantages of Geo-3D CNN and Geo-Conv1D. Experiments conducted in Northeast China show that the proposed sampling method can reliably provide and label a large number of samples and achieve satisfactory results for different deep-learning networks. Based on the automatic selection and labeling of training samples, the crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology can achieve the highest overall accuracy (OA) with approximately 92.50% as compared with Geo-Conv1D (91.89%) and Geo-3D CNN (91.27%) in the three study areas, indicating that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multi-temporal crop classification. 1558-0644 © 2021 IEEE.

Faidherbia albida trees are characterized by their inverse phenology, growing leaf flowers and pods during the dry season, thereby providing fodder and shedding leaves during the wet season, which minimizes competition with pastures and crops for resources. Multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite systems and novel computational methods open new doors for classifying single trees and identifying species. This study used a Multi-Layer Perception feedforward artificial neural network to classify pixels covered by Faidherbia albida canopies from Sentinel-2 time series in Senegal, West Africa. To better discriminate the Faidherbia albida signal from the background, monthly images from vegetation indices were used to form relevant variables for the model. We found that NDI54/NDVI from the period covering onset of leaf senescence (February) until end of senescence (leaf-off in June) to be the most important, resulting in a high precision and recall rate of 0.91 and 0.85. We compared our result with a potential Faidherbia albida occurrence map derived by empirical modelling of the species ecology, which deviates notably from the actual species occurrence mapped by this study. We have shown that even small differences in dry season leaf phenology can be used to distinguish tree species. The Faidherbia albida distribution maps, as provided here, will be key in managing farmlands in drylands, helping to optimize economic and ecological services from both tree and crop products. © 2022 by the authors.

Whereas field inventories and optical images are generally used to estimate forest diversity, studies that combine vertical structure information and multi-temporal phenological characteristics to accurately quantify diversity in large, heterogeneous forest areas are still lacking. In this study, combined with regression models, three different diversity indices, namely Simpson (λ), Shannon (H′), and Pielou (J′), were applied to characterize forest tree species diversity by using GEDI LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery in temperate natural forest, northeast China. We used Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) to assess the importance of certain variables including monthly spectral bands, vegetation indices, foliage height diversity (FHD), and plant area index (PAI) of growing season and non-growing seasons (68 variables in total). We produced 12 forest diversity maps on three different diversity indices using four regression algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Lasso Regression (LR). Our study concluded that the most important variables are FHD, NDVI, NDWI, EVI, short-wave infrared (SWIR) and red-edge (RE) bands, especially in the growing season (May and June). In terms of algorithms, the estimation accuracies of the RF (averaged R2 = 0.79) and SVM (averaged R2 = 0.76) models outperformed the other models (R2 of KNN and LR are 0.68 and 0.57, respectively).

Based on the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 dataset, this study presents three multi-temporal modified vegetation indices (the multi-temporal modified normalized difference Quercus wutaishanica index (MTM-NDQI), the multi-temporal modified difference scrub grass index (MTM-DSI), and the multi-temporal modified ratio shaw index (MTM-RSI)) to improve the classification accuracy of the remote sensing of vegetation in the Lingkong Mountain Nature Reserve of China (LMNR). These three indices integrate the advantages of both the typical vegetation indices and the multi-temporal remote sensing data. By using the proposed indices with a uni-temporal modified vegetation index (the uni-temporal modified difference pine-oak mixed forest index (UTM-DMI)) and typical vegetation indices (e.g., the ratio vegetation index (RVI), the difference vegetation index (DVI), and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), an optimal feature set is obtained that includes the NDVI of December, the NDVI of April, and the UTM-DMI, MTM-NDQI, MTM-DSI, and MTM-RSI.

Earth Observation (EO) data provides high spectral, spatial and temporal data for various agricultural applications. However, mapping and monitoring small crop fields and complex landscapes are still challenging, in particular when attempting to trace the historical evolution of land use changes. To address this issue, a study was set up in the Udon Thani Province of Thailand, with small agricultural parcels and highly fragmented landscapes, covering an area of approximately 11,000 km2. Three decades of crop type dynamics were monitored and assessed using different combinations of multi-temporal Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat data and the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined multi-temporal EO datasets proved the most efficient for mapping crop types. Classification results achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 87.9%, 88.1%, 84.8% and 92.6% for the four base-years 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. Thanks to the availability of high-quality reference labels, the crop type map of 2019 showed the highest overall and class-specific accuracies. The 2019 classification model separated many crop classes well, especially sugarcane, cassava, rice and para rubber. On the contrary, for 1989, 1999 and 2009 drops in accuracy had to be accepted, as direct field reference observations were unavailable and reference information had to be sourced through photo-interpretation or trimming approaches. Overall, however, the RF method together with multi-temporal EO satellite data from multiple platforms showed high potential and excellent efficiency in crop type classification in complex landscapes. The most dominant classes of crop types for the four base-years were rice, sugarcane, and cassava, respectively. Land cover changes indicated that transitions of 1,529 km2 (14%) occurred between 1989 and 1999, mainly as increase in sugarcane and rice areas. From 1999 to 2009, significant land changes were observed covering 2,340 km2 (21%), primarily as increased cassava and para rubber cultivation. During the most recent period 2009 to 2019, an additional 3,414 km2 (31%) were transformed, mainly through the expansion of para rubber and sugarcane plantations. The main drivers for the observed land use changes in the three decades were commodity prices and agricultural policies. The cost-efficiently derived results provide valuable information to inform land use management decisions of policymakers and other stakeholders, including the consideration of environmental aspects. © 2022 The Authors","Northeastern Region; Thailand; Udon Thani; Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Food supply; Image classification; Image recognition; Land use; Mapping; Observatories; Plants (botany); Change detection; Crop type; Earth observations; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal imageries; Post classification; Post-classification change detection; Random forests; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; crop production; land cover; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; Sentinel; Rubber","Crop type; Earth Observation; Landsat; Multi-temporal imagery; Post-classification change detection; Random Forest; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131440092"

To achieve this, multi-temporal space-born data of both Landsat-8 OLI- (L1 and L2) and Sentinel-2 (2A and 2B) were used during 2014–2020. The methodologies of Case 2 regional coast colour algorithm and aquatic reflectance were applied for monitoring the physical properties of different water characteristics encompassing chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and aquatic reflectance. Satellite data from dry and wet seasons (2014–2020) were selected to examine seasonal and temporal variation. Comparing water quality through the dry and wet seasons (2014–2020) is to avoid the difference in atmospheric conditions and detect seasonal variations. The present study results have shown that the Western Lagoon and its streams are considered the primary source of pollution. Specifically, lower values are observed during August 2015 for TSM (4–17 g m−3) and chlorophyll-a (2–11 g m−3), while the highest values of TSM (23–50 g m−3) appear during August 2018 and for chlorophyll-a during August 2016–2018 (20–40 g m−3). For the wet season for TSM, the lowest values are observed during 2016 (3–10 g m−3), and the maximum is noticed during 2019 (13–29 g m−3); for the chlorophyll-a, maximum values are observed during 2017 (10–23 g m−3). © 2022, The Author(s).","Egypt; Ismailia [Egypt]; Lake Timsah; Port Said [Egypt]; Suez Canal; chlorophyll a; Landsat; monitoring system; satellite data; Sentinel; water quality","Chlorophyll-a; Landsat 8; Sentinel-2; Timsah Lake-Ismailia; Total suspended matter (TSM); Water quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139167288"

However, a substantial amount of effort and infrastructure is still required for the generation of analysis-ready data (ARD) from the low-level products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). Here, a flexible Python framework able to generate a range of consistent ARD aligned with the ESA-recommended processing pipeline is detailed. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are radiometrically calibrated, speckle-filtered and terrain-corrected, and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data resampled in order to harmonise the spatial resolution between the two streams and to allow stacking with multiple scene classification masks. The global coverage and flexibility of the framework allows users to define a specific region of interest (ROI) and time window to create geo-referenced Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, or a combination of both with closest temporal alignment. The framework can be applied to any location and is user-centric and versatile in generating multi-modal and multi-temporal ARD. Finally, the framework handles automatically the inherent challenges in processing Sentinel data, such as boundary regions with missing values within Sentinel-1 and the filtering of Sentinel-2 scenes based on ROI cloud coverage. © 2022 by the authors.

It is necessary to clarify the changes in cropping patterns, thereby optimizing the farmland landscape during the sustainable intensification development of agriculture. Taking a typical county in Haihe Lowland Plain as the study area, this study aims to conduct the spatial distribution, variables of multiple cropping index, and cropping patterns at the county level from 2013 to 2019. A quadratic difference set was firstly used to collect the multiple cropping index, according to the smooth NDVI time-series curves by Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS). A Principal Component Analysis - Random Forest (PCA-RF) was then selected to classify the cropping patterns via the image interpretation using multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 2 images. General cropping patterns were interpreted including the cotton, pepper, peanut, maize, and tree crop single cropping, as well as the wheat-maize and tree crop double cropping. Finally, the transfer matrix was operated to quantify the transformations between every two cropping patterns, and then landscape metrics (e.g. Splitting Index (SPLIT), Shannon’s Diversity Index (SHDI) and Shannon’s Evenness Index (SHEI)) were calculated by Fragstats 4.2, further to describe the landscape fragmentation and diversity of the farmland. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient exceeded 90% and 0.84, respectively, after interpreting multiple cropping indexes using PCA-RF. Overall, the multiple cropping index increased from 163% to 174%, and the area of single cropping transformed to double cropping was 1.64 times that of the double cropping transformed to single cropping. The area of wheat-maize pattern remained stable, and the area of cotton single cropping decreased by 80.93%, with the area reduction of tree crop planting pattern increased by 64.54%. Cotton single cropping was the major pattern that transformed into wheat-maize double cropping, accounting for 81.15% of the transformed area. At the same time, the wheat-maize double and cotton single cropping were the main cropping patterns that transformed into the maize single cropping, accounting for 46.43% and 41.43% of the transformed area, respectively. The SHDI of the cropping pattern increased by 8.57%, and the SPLIT of wheat-maize double cropping and cotton single cropping increased significantly. In conclusion, the major variation in the farmland landscape was that: 1) The increase of the multiple indexes was mainly caused by transformation from cotton single cropping to wheat-maize double cropping. 2) The diversity of farmland landscape increased in two ways. One is that the cotton single cropping was transformed to other patterns (e.g. wheat-maize double cropping, tree crop double cropping, and cotton single cropping). The other is that more cropping patterns (such as peanut single cropping and maize single cropping) appeared, with the increased area of those cropping patterns in smaller areas. 3) Larger fragmentation of wheat-maize double cropping and cotton single cropping resulted in the more fragmented farmland landscape, in turn further preventing the large-scale crop production of the main cropping patterns. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The concept of the Virtual Constellation (VC) is gaining interest within the science community owing to the increasing number of satellites/sensors in operation with similar characteristics. The establishment of a VC out of individual missions offers new possibilities for many application domains, in particular in the fields of land surface monitoring and change detection. In this context, this paper describes the Copernicus Sen2Like algorithms and software, a solution for harmonizing and fusing Landsat 8/Landsat 9 data with Sentinel-2 data. Developed under the European Union Copernicus Program, the Sen2Like software processes a large collection of Level 1/Level 2A products and generates high quality Level 2 Analysis Ready Data (ARD) as part of harmonized (Level 2H) and/or fused (Level 2F) products providing high temporal resolutions. For this purpose, we have re-used and developed a broad spectrum of data processing and analysis methodologies, including geometric and spectral co-registration, atmospheric and Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrections and upscaling to 10 m for relevant Landsat bands. The Sen2Like software and the algorithms have been developed within a VC establishment framework, and the tool can conveniently be used to compare processing algorithms in combinations. It also has the potential to integrate new missions from spaceborne and airborne platforms including unmanned aerial vehicles. The validation activities show that the proposed approach improves the temporal consistency of the multi temporal data stack, and output products are interoperable with the subsequent thematic analysis processes. © 2022 by the authors.","Antennas; Data fusion; Data handling; Distribution functions; Quality control; Reflection; Surface measurement; Analyse ready data; Copernicu; Harmonisation; Land surface; LANDSAT; Optical data; Sentinel-2; Surface monitoring; Surface reflectance; Virtual constellation; Landsat","Analysis Ready Data; Copernicus; data fusion; harmonization; Landsat; Sentinel-2; surface reflectance; Virtual Constellation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137792251"

Whereas field inventories and LiDAR data are generally used to estimate understory vegetation density, methods for large-scale and spatially continuous estimation of understory vegetation density are still lacking. For an evergreen coniferous forest area in southern China, we developed and tested an effective and practical remote sensing-driven approach for mapping understory vegetation, based on phenological differences between over and understory vegetation. Specifically, we used plant area volume density (PAVD) calculations based on GEDI data to train a support vector regression model and subsequently estimated the understory vegetation density from Sentinel-2 derived metrics. We produced maps of PAVD for the growing and non-growing season respectively, both performing well compared against independent GEDI samples (R2 = 0.89 and 0.93, p < 0.01). Understory vegetation density was derived from the differences in PAVD between the growing and non-growing season. The understory vegetation density map was validated against field samples from 86 plots showing an overall R2 of 0.52 (p < 0.01), rRMSE = 21%. Our study developed a tangible approach to map spatially continuous understory vegetation density with the combination of GEDI LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery, showing the potential to improve the estimation of terrestrial carbon storage and better understand forest ecosystem processes across larger areas. © 2022 The Author(s).

Agricultural practices can benefit from temporally dense satellite image time series (SITS) for accurate understanding of the phenological evolution and behavior of crops. Developing techniques that deal with high spatial correlation and high temporal resolution requires a shift in the processing paradigm and poses new challenges in terms of data processing and methodology. This article presents an automatic approach to large-scale precise mapping of small agricultural fields based on the analysis of S2-SITS at Country level. The approach deals with a flexible and automatic processing chain for massive data and was tested at Country level.

Mapping coffee land cover is still a challenge because it is grown mainly on small areas in agroforestry systems (AFS), which are located in hard-to-access mountainous regions. The objective of this research was to map coffee AFS types in a mountainous region using the changing spectral response patterns over the dry season as well as supplementary data. We employed Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-Palsar images, a digital elevation model, soil moisture layers, and 150 field plots. First, we defined three coffee AFS types based on their structural and spectral characteristics. Then, we performed a recursive feature elimination analysis to identify the most relevant predictor variables for each land use/cover class in the region. Next, we constructed a predictor variable dataset for each AFS type and one for the remaining land use/cover classes. Afterward, four maps were generated using a random forest (RF) classifier. Finally, we combined the four maps into a unique land-cover map through a maximum likelihood algorithm. Using a validation sample of 932 sites derived from Planet images (4.5 m pixel size), we estimated a 95% map overall accuracy. Two AFS types were classified as having low error; the third, with the highest tree density, had the lowest accuracy. The results obtained show that the infrared and near-infrared bands from the Sentinel-2 scenes are particularly useful for coffee AFS discrimination. However, supplementary data are required to improve the performance of the classifier. Our findings also highlight the importance of the multi-temporal and multi-dataset approach for identifying complex production systems in areas of high topographic heterogeneity. © 2022 by the authors.","Forestry; Infrared devices; Land use; Maximum likelihood; Random forests; Soil moisture; Agroforestry system; Chiapa; Mountainous regions; Multi-temporal; Predictor variables; Random forests; Recursive feature elimination; Shade coffee; Sierra madre; Supplementary data; Decision trees","Chiapas; random forest; recursive feature elimination; shade coffee; Sierra Madre","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137840712"

The rainfall triggered floods and landslides across the district, resulting in the death of three people and damage to property (mainly road and rail network) worth few hundred crores of Indian rupees. Platforms of the New Haflong railway station were completely buried by multiple debris flows, and several coaches of a train were overtoppled. We hereby investigate the cause of the landslide disaster by analyzing temporal rainfall data and also assess damages in the region using high-resolution optical satellite imagery from Resourcesat-2A (5.8 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and Cartosat-3 (1.1 m) satellites. It is seen from the satellite-based precipitation measurement that the region around Haflong town received maximum 24 h rainfall (156 mm) on 11 May 2022 and the heavy rainfall continued till 18 May 2022. This resulted in the occurrence of 5178 landslides, which are mapped using multi-temporal cloud free optical satellite data. Rainfall data analysis shows that 4 days antecedent rainfall of ~ 200 mm has mainly triggered landslides in this area. The initial heavy rainfall has saturated the soil and increased the pore pressure, which caused slope failure due to subsequent spell of rains. Small-sized landslides are seen to damage buildings in the Haflong town and neighboring villages. Various roads, including the Lumding-Silchar highway, were damaged at multiple places by landslides. Landslides were triggered mainly within Renji and Bokabil Rock Formations on moderate to high slopes. Results are further substantiated by debris flow simulations which showed that ~ 4 m height of debris may have been accumulated in the New Haflong railway station, thus burying the railway track and platforms. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Assam; India; Debris; Disasters; Railroad stations; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Rain; Satellite imagery; Debris flows; Heavy rainfall; Himalayas; Property; Rail damage; Rail networks; Railway stations; Rainfall data; Road network; Satellite data; Cartosat; debris flow; landslide; natural disaster; railway; rainfall; Resourcesat; satellite data; Sentinel; Landslides","Debris flow; Disaster; Himalaya; Rail damage; Satellite data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140445619"

These dynamics could, in principle, be exploited to classify different types of crops. Thus, this study aims to investigate methodologies and results of crop type classification making use of phenological information extracted from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. Vegetation indices (VI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery are evaluated to track the year-round vegetation behavior. Starting from a multi-temporal image series of the same scene, the phenological profiles can be extracted and introduced into a supervised classification process to detect crop fields, discriminating among different species. Following this, we propose a cross-correlation based model that, using a priori information from ground training data, searches for the best matching phenology. When compared to machine learning models for crop classification, the one proposed in this study can provide useful information about phenology that can be stored and used for better monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crops species through the future years and guiding agricultural management accordingly. Our case studies are the regions of Bothaville and Harrismith, located in South Africa, and the region of Jendouba in Tunisia. The results for the Bothaville region show 89.19% of user accuracy on the main crop type classification (maize crops).

Traditional classification methods tend to fit most categories, which will cause the classification accuracy of major crops and minor crops to be too low. Therefore, we proposed an improved Gray Wolf Optimizer support vector machine (GWO-SVM) method with oversampling algorithm to solve the imbalance-class problem in the classification process and improve the classification accuracy of complex crops. Fifteen feature bands were selected based on feature importance evaluation and correlation analysis. Five different smote methods were used to detect samples imbalanced with respect to major and minor crops. In addition, the classification results were compared with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we proposed a combined improved GWO-SVM algorithm, using an oversampling algorithm(smote) to extract major crops and minor crops and use SVM and RF as classification comparison methods. The experimental results showed that band 2 (B2), band 4 (B4), band 6 (B6), band 11 (B11), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had higher feature importance. The classification results oversampling- based of smote, smote-enn, borderline-smote1, borderline-smote2, and distance-smote were significantly improved, with accuracy 2.84%, 2.66%, 3.94%, 4.18%, 6.96% higher than that those without 26 oversampling, respectively. At the same time, compared with SVM and RF, the overall accuracy of improved GWO-SVM was improved by 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Therefore, the GWO-SVM model in this study not only effectively solves the problem of equilibrium of complex crop samples in the classification process, but also effectively improves the overall classification accuracy of crops in complex farming areas, thus providing a feasible alternative for large-scale and complex crop mapping. © 2022 by the authors.","Decision trees; Food supply; Productivity; Support vector machines; Vegetation mapping; Classification accuracy; Crop mapping; Gray wolf optimizer support vector machine; Gray wolves; Multi-temporal; Optimizers; Over sampling; Oversampling algorithm; Sentinel-2 data; Support vectors machine; Crops","crop mapping; GWO-SVM; multi-temporal; oversampling algorithms; Sentinel-2 data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140794586"

Consequently, nutrients and pollutants accumulate in Jakarta Bay and lead to eutrophication. Therefore, monitoring the water quality of Jakarta Bay is essential to support integrated river coastal management. Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration is one of the essential parameters in describing water environment conditions. For large and dynamic areas, Chl-a concentration distribution monitoring requires multi-temporal remote sensing data. This study examines remote sensing data and methods combined with on-site measurement to get more accurate and effective Chl-a spatiotemporal analysis approaches. We estimate Chl-a concentration of Jakarta Bay during 2016-2021 using selected Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B images. We conducted an atmospheric correction using a C2RCC (Case 2 Regional Coast Colour) processor and obtained Chl-a concentration from the embedded Neural Network model. The results showed that the model could retrieve Chl-a concentration with an R2 of 0.79 and the root mean square error of 31.75 mg/m3. Time-series results reveal an increase of maximum Chl-a concentration during 2016-2021.

The amount of data from imagery have increased tremendously since the past years, due to the increase in space missions and public and private agencies involved in this activity. A lot of these data are open-data, and academics and stakeholders in general can freely download and use it for any type of application. The bottle-neck is often not data availability anymore, but the processing resources and tools to analyse it. In particular multi-temporal analysis requires stacks of images thus digital space for storage and processing workflows that are tested and validated. Processing image by image is often not a viable approach anymore. Basic tools for multi-temporal analysis are provided via the same web interface, allowing the user to also apply parallel processing for a faster data extraction. A study case over burned areas in the north-eastern region of Italy are reported, to show how the multi-temporal analysis tools provided can be a valid source of data for further analysis. Multitemporal data consisting on the index values of each pixel inside user-defined areas can be downloaded in a spreadsheet that provides the values, the cell ids, the timestamp and the cloud and snow percentage. Also the full-resolution raster with index values that are rendered on screen can be downloaded as GeoTIFF at each specific date. © Copyright:","Digital storage; Earth atmosphere; Geographic information systems; Orbits; Remote sensing; Analysis tools; Analytic; Copernicu; Earth observations; Index values; Multi-temporal analysis; Parallel processing; Sentinel-2; Toolsets; Web-GIS; Bottles","analytics; Copernicus; earth observation; multitemporal analysis; parallel processing; Sentinel-2; web-gis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137171258"

The spatio-temporal fluctuations in morphological parameters of glaciers were estimated for a period of 28 years from 1990 to 2018. This has been achieved by analyzing multi-temporal imageries from Landsat-5, Sentinel-2 and IRS LISS IV earth observation data using geospatial tools and supplemented with field observations. The total glaciated area of Sind basin has decreased from 56.73 Km2 (1990) to 43.94 Km2 (2018) with the loss of 22.5% during the period of 28 years. The number of glaciers has increased from 92 (1990) to 116 (2018) generally due to defragmentation of glaciers. Glaciers (> 1 Km2) have shown a maximum loss of −34.8% during the study period. Although contributing less to the total glacier area, glaciers found in low elevation zones (3800–4200 masl) have lost maximum area of around − 55.5%. Mean elevation of glaciers has increased from 4330 masl (1990) to 4390 masl (2018). Mean Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) of glaciers (> 0.5 Km2) has shifted from 4336 to 4432 masl with an annual upward shift of 3.4 m a−1. The trend analysis of meteorological parameters (Temperature and Precipitation) using Mann–Kendall test reveals that the seasonal and annual temperature (both Tmax and Tmin) has shown a significant positive trend. While as precipitation (both annual and seasonal) has shown a negative trend. The continued glacier recession in the region is largely due to decreasing precipitation in the winter months (November–March) and increasing mean annual temperatures. The persistence of warming trend will result in continuous shrinkage and thinning of glaciers with drastic impacts on the hydrological regime of the region. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Himalayas; India; Sind Basin; climate change; glacier; IRS (satellite); Landsat; LISS; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; watershed","Climate change; Glacier recession; North-western Himalayas; Sentinel-2; Sind watershed","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111629585"

Four conventional vegetation indices of NDVI, PSRI, GNDVI, and RVI and four improved vegetation indices of NDVIre1, NDVIre2, NDVIre3, and NDVIre4 based on the red-edge band were selected to construct a decision tree classification model combined with machine learning technology. Through the analysis of vegetation indices under different treatments and different months, combined with the attribute of Feature_importances_, the vegetation indices of different periods with high contribution were selected as input features, and the Max_depth values of the decision tree model were determined by the hyperparameter learning curve. The results have shown that when the Max_depth value of the decision tree model of the vegetation indices under the three treatments was 6, 8, and 8, the model classification was the best.

Through comparative experiments, this paper studied the feasibility of identifying crops with multi-temporal data and fused data.

Our approach is powered by the cloud-computing data cataloguing and processing capabilities of Google Earth Engine and it uses all the available scenes from the Sentinel-2 image collection to map index-based multi-aggregate yearly vegetation changes. A user-defined index threshold maps the first per-pixel occurrence of an abrupt vegetation change and returns an updated and classified multi-temporal image aggregate in almost-real-time. The algorithm requires an input vector table such as data gazetteers or heritage inventories, and it performs buffer zonal statistics for each site to return a series of spatial indicators of potential site disturbance. It also returns time series charts for the evaluation and validation of the local to regional vegetation trends and the seasonal phenology. Additionally, we used multi-temporal MODIS, Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planet imagery for further photo-interpretation of critically endangered sites. AgriExp was first tested in the arid region of the Cholistan Desert in eastern Pakistan. Here, hundreds of archaeological mound surfaces are threatened by the accelerated transformation of barren lands into new irrigated agricultural lands. We have provided the algorithm code with the article to ensure that AgriExp can be exported and implemented with little computational cost by academics and heritage practitioners alike to monitor critically endangered archaeological and cultural landscapes elsewhere. © 2022 by the authors.","Aggregates; Agriculture; Conservation; Data handling; Expansion; Vegetation; Agricultural expansion; Big earth data; Copernicu; Cultural heritages; Endangered cultural heritage; Google earth engine; Google earths; Planetscope; Sentinel-2; Vegetation change; Engines","agricultural expansion; Big Earth Data; Copernicus; endangered cultural heritage; Google Earth Engine; Planetscope; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145979454"

The 2016 Kaikōura earthquake affected the northeastern region of the South Island in New Zealand, triggering numerous landslides that dammed river courses leading to the formation of hundreds of dammed lakes. Detecting and monitoring landslide-dammed lakes is important for disaster management. Satellite remote sensing imagery is often complementary to field acquisitions to obtain an overview of large and remote areas and thus can be exploited to monitor landslide-dammed lakes. Yet, the strengths and limitations of freely available multi-temporal satellite imagery for landslide-dammed lake assessment remain largely unexplored. This study aimed at automatically mapping landslide-dammed lakes caused by the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake and monitoring their evolution using time series of Sentinel-2 imagery and the computing capabilities of the Google Earth Engine. Our approach combined dynamic thresholding, change detection, and connected component analysis. Landslide-dammed lakes larger than 300 m2 and located on relatively flat terrain were detected with reasonable accuracy, while lakes located in steeply incised valleys were detected less frequently. Despite the challenging topographical and environmental characteristics of the study area, we were able to detect landslide-dammed lake candidates at a regional scale. Temporal monitoring of the evolution of the landslide-dammed lake area revealed four distinct patterns: 1) constant, 2) increasing, 3) decreasing, and 4) variable. Our approach contributes to the understanding of the utility and limitations of temporal and spatial monitoring of landslide-dammed lakes, their potential cascading hazards and their interactions. © 2022 The Authors","Earthquakes; Environmental Monitoring; Lakes; Landslides; New Zealand; Satellite Imagery; New Zealand; South Island; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Earthquakes; Engines; Landslides; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Google earth engine; Google earths; Lake detection; Lake monitoring; Landslide-dammed lakes; New zealand; River course; Sentinel-2; South Island; Spatiotemporal evolution; detection method; earthquake event; GIS; Internet; lake water; landslide; monitoring system; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; article; earthquake; human; human experiment; lake; landslide; New Zealand; remote sensing; satellite imagery; time series analysis; environmental monitoring; lake; New Zealand; satellite imagery; Lakes","Google Earth Engine; Lake detection; Lake monitoring; Landslide-dammed lake; New Zealand; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123701704"

The combination of abiotic and biotic disturbances in forests can cause drastic environmental and economic losses. The first step to containing such damage is establishing a monitoring framework for the early detection of vulnerable plots and distinguishing the cause of forest damage at scales from the management unit to the region. To develop and evaluate the functionality of such a monitoring framework, we first selected an area of interest affected by windthrow damage and bark beetles at the border between Italy and Austria in the Friulian Dolomites, Carnic and Julian Alps and the Carinthian Gailtal. Secondly, we implemented a framework for time-series analysis with open-access Sentinel-2 data over four years (2017–2020) by quantifying single-band sensitivity to disturbances. Additionally, we enhanced the framework by deploying vegetation indices to monitor spectral changes and perform supervised image classification for change detection. A mean overall accuracy of 89% was achieved; thus, Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be suitable for distinguishing stressed stands, bark-beetle-attacked canopies and wind-felled patches. The advantages of our methodology are its large-scale applicability to monitoring forest health and forest-cover changes and its usability to support the development of forest management strategies for dealing with massive bark beetle outbreaks. © 2022 by the authors.","Change detection; Climate change; Damage detection; Dolomite; Forestry; Image classification; Image enhancement; Losses; Remote sensing; Storms; Time series analysis; Vegetation mapping; Change detection; Forest; Forest cover change; Forest-cover change detection; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Spectral signature; Spruce bark beetles; Supervised image classifications; Vegetation index; Windstorm; Drought","drought; forest-cover change detection; forests; remote sensing; Sentinel-2; spectral signatures; spruce bark beetle; supervised image classification; vegetation indices; windstorms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143794211"

Low variation in terrain attributes (classically used for digital soil mapping) at low relief areas calls for additional spatial data to explain soil variability. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive capability of Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) time series and statistics, summarized as multi-temporal features (MTF) to improve the spatial predictions of SOC and SIC in Ghorveh plain, located in Kurdistan Province, Western Iran. A systematic grid sampling was then employed to collect 150 soil surface samples (0–30 cm) for SOC and SIC measurements. We applied boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) to predict SOC and SIC contents by using covariate sets compiled from radar and optical time series and topographic attributes. Model performance, evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation, showed that RF using the covariate set containing time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and topographic attributes performed the best in predicting SOC (RMSE = 0.23, ME = 0.005, R2 = 0.29). On the other hand, for SIC, the covariate set containing MTF of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and topographic attributes ranked the best with BRT (RMSE = 0.77, ME= −0.001, R2 = 0.48). The study indicates that using the time series and MTF from multiple dates of remote sensing data with topographic attributes results in improved predictions. However, model performance for SIC and SOC was moderate to poor, respectively. Therefore more substantial studies would be required to verify if the computational effort is likely justified by an increase in accuracy in general. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Iran; Kordestan [Iran]; Decision trees; Forecasting; Organic carbon; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soil surveys; Soils; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation mapping; Carbon content; Covariates; Inorganic carbon; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal feature; Sentinel-1; Soil inorganic carbons; Soil organic carbon; Temporal features; Times series; data set; satellite imagery; semiarid region; Sentinel; soil organic matter; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis; Time series","Multi-temporal features; Soil inorganic carbon; Soil organic carbon; Time series; Uncertainty analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142749597"

To optimize agricultural land uses, one of the crucial indicators is cropping intensity, which measures the number of times a single parcel of land is farmed. Therefore, it is imperative to create a timely and accurate cropping intensity map so that landowners and agricultural planners can use it to determine the best course of action for the present and for the future. In the present study, we have developed an algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE) to depict cropping patterns and further fused it with a GIS environment to depict cropping intensity in the arid western plain zone of Rajasthan, India. A high-resolution multi-temporal harmonized product of the Sentinel-2 dataset was incorporated for depicting the growth cycle of crops for the year 2020–2021 using the greenest pixel composites. Kharif and Rabi accounted for 73.44% and 26.56% of the total cultivated area, respectively. Only 7.42% was under the double-cropped area to the total cultivated area. The overall accuracy of the classified image was 90%. For the Kharif crop, the accuracy was 95%, while for Rabi and the double-cropped region, the accuracy was 88%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.784. The present study was able to depict the seasonal plantation system in arid arable land with higher accuracy. The proposed work can be used to monitor cropping patterns and cost-effectively show cropping intensities. © 2022 by the authors.","","arid western plain zone; cropping intensity; cropping pattern; Google Earth Engine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144873298"

In this paper, we focus on one of the remote glacier areas, namely the Tyndall Glacier area in the Southern Patagonian Icefield in Chile. Based on optical remote sensing data in the form of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery, we analyze the extent of different snow and ice classes on the surface of the glacier by means of pixel-wise classification. Our study comprises three main steps: (1) Labeled Sentinel-2 compliant data are obtained from theoretical spectral reflectance curves, as there are no training data available for the investigated area; (2) Four different classification approaches are used and compared in their ability to identify the defined five snow and ice types, thereof two unsupervised approaches (k-means clustering and rule-based classification via snow and ice indices) and two supervised approaches (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest classifier); (3) We first focus on the pixel-wise classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, and we then use the best-performing approach for a multi-temporal analysis of the Tyndall Glacier area. While the achieved classification results reveal that all of the used classification approaches are suitable for detecting different snow and ice classes on the glacier surface, the multi-temporal analysis clearly reveals the seasonal development of the glacier. The change of snow and ice types on the glacier surface is evident, especially between the end of ablation season (April) and the end of accumulation season (September) in Southern Chile. © 2022 by the authors.

Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m2. In conclusion, the reusable farm-scale multi-temporal crop yield dataset and the proposed novel model could meet the actual requirements for the prediction targets in this paper, providing further valuable insights for the research community. © 2021 by the authors.

Analytical approaches require several water properties and assumptions, which might not be known. Empirical approaches rely on the linear relationship between reflectances and in-situ depths, but the relationship may not be entirely linear due to bottom type variation, water column effect, and noise. Machine learning approaches have been used to address nonlinearity, but those treat pixels independently, while adjacent pixels are spatially correlated in depth. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can detect this characteristic of the local connectivity. Therefore, this paper conducts a study of SDB using CNN and compares the accuracies between different areas and different amounts of training data, i.e., single and multi-temporal images. Furthermore, this paper discusses the accuracies of SDB when a pre-trained CNN model from one or a combination of multiple locations is applied to a new location. The results show that the accuracy of SDB using the CNN method outperforms existing works with other methods. Multi-temporal images enhance the variety in the training data and improve the CNN accuracy. SDB computation using the pre-trained model shows several limitations at particular depths or when water conditions differ. © 2022 The Author(s).

Previous studies have reported that gross emissions from forest degradation might be higher than from deforestation, due to the larger area affected by the first process. The quantification of forest degradation with remote sensing has large uncertainty, mainly because the subtle and gradual changes in forest are challenging to detect, and sometimes these changes happen below the canopy cover which the optical sensors cannot see. The objective of this work is to map the degraded forests and the most relevant biophysical and socio-economic factors contributing to such degradation in the dry tropics. We mapped the degraded forests by modeling forest biophysical parameters with multi-temporal optical data of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and identified the most relevant biophysical and socio-economic factors that can be associated with forest degradation. We included three biophysical variables and 11 socio-economic variables including parceled land and land in ejido property and used multiple linear regression to relate those variables with identified degraded forests. We identified 62,878 ha of tropical dry forest in a degraded state, cover 49.91% of the forest area. The most relevant biophysical factor was distance to settlements and the most relevant socio-economic factor was percentage of parceled land property (private land). Both factors were negatively associated with the mapped degraded forests. Since parceled land and land in ejido property are strongly and positively correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.82, p < 0.001), it suggests that ejido property, as a form of land tenure, plays an important role in preventing forest degradation. This experiment presents a possible way to measure and understand degradation which may help finding solutions to slow down forest degradation and promote forest restoration.

Extensive training datasets are required to train machine learning algorithms, which can be challenging to obtain. To alleviate the limitations, we extract the training samples from the agricultural census information. We focus on Japan and demonstrate how agricultural census data in 2015 can map different crop types for the entire country. Due to the lack of Sentinel-2 datasets in 2015, this study utilized Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 collected across Japan and combined observations into composites for different prefecture periods (monthly, bimonthly, seasonal). Recent deep learning techniques have been investigated the performance of the samples from agricultural census information. Finally, we obtain nine crop types on a countrywide scale (around 31 million parcels) and compare our results to those obtained from agricultural census testing samples as well as those obtained from recent land cover products in Japan. The generated map accurately represents the distribution of crop types across Japan and achieves an overall accuracy of 87% for nine classes in 47 prefectures. Our findings highlight the importance of using multi-modality data with agricultural census information to evaluate agricultural productivity in Japan.

Whilst open-access archives of high spatial resolution imagery are increasingly available from satellite sensors, such as Sentinel-2, there remains a fundamental challenge of maximising the utility of information in each band whilst maintaining a sufficiently fine resolution to identify landforms. Although image fusion and downscaling methods on Sentinel-2 imagery have been investigated for many years, there is a need to assess their performance for multi-temporal object-based river landform classification. This investigation first compared three downscaling methods: area to point regression kriging (ATPRK), super-resolution based on Sen2Res, and nearest neighbour resampling. We assessed performance of the three downscaling methods by accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. ATPRK was the optimal downscaling approach, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.861. We successively engaged a set of experiments to determine an optimal training model, exploring single and multi-date scenarios. We find that not only does remote sensing imagery with better quality improve river landform classification performance, but multi-date datasets for establishing machine learning models should be considered for contributing higher classification accuracy. This paper presents a workflow for automated river landform recognition that could be applied to other tropical rivers with similar hydro-geomorphological characteristics. © 2022 The Author(s).

The rapid development of remote sensing techniques shows great potential for mapping soil properties. This study highlights the effectiveness of multitemporal remote sensing data in identifying soil textural class by using retrieved vegetation properties as proxies of soil properties. The impacts of sensors, modeling resolutions, and modeling techniques on the accuracy of soil texture classification were explored. Multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were individually acquired at the same time periods. Three satellite-based experiments with different inputs, i.e., Landsat-8 data, Sentinel-2 data (excluding red-edge parameters), and Sentinel-2 data (including red-edge parameters) were conducted. Modeling was carried out at three spatial resolutions (10, 30, 60 m) using five machine-learning (ML) methods: random forest, support vector machine, gradient-boosting decision tree, categorical boosting, and super learner that combined the four former classifiers based on the stacking concept. In addition, a novel SHapley Addictive Explanation (SHAP) technique was introduced to explain the outputs of the ML model. The results showed that the sensors, modeling resolutions, and modeling techniques significantly affected the prediction accuracy. The models using Sentinel-2 data with red-edge parameters performed consistently best. The models usually gave better results at fine (10 m) and medium (30 m) modeling resolutions than at a coarse (60 m) resolution. The super learner provided higher accuracies than other modeling techniques and gave the highest values of overall accuracy (0.8429), kappa (0.7611), precision (0.8378), recall rate (0.8393), and F1-score (0.8398) at 30 m with Sentinel-2 data involving red-edge parameters. The SHAP technique quantified the contribution of each variable for different soil textural classes, revealing the critical roles of red-edge parameters in separating loamy soils.

This study aims to provide a timely and accurate main irrigated crop types mapping at 10m resolution for Tashkent province based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data acquired for the growing season in 2018. This paper shows the potential use of multitemporal Sentinel-2 satellite data to derive an up-to-date irrigated crop types classification map of the study area. As single-date satellite imagery does not allow proper cropland classification, multitemporal and high-resolution Sentinel-2 data was used to capture small cropland fields and specific crop types for the vegetation period (April to October 2018). NDVI monthly profiles of crop types as well as additional 10 m resolution bands 2 and 3 were used as input data to perform and assess three classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Accuracy assessment results showed that SVM showed the highest Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Accuracy (KA). KA of classified images for SVM were 0.90 and 0.89 for the RF algorithm. Both performed well with close values. But MLC showed a lower result of KA 0.60. The paper also compares the area of derived irrigated cropland area with data from the State Committee for Statistics of Uzbekistan for selected crop types. Values for the crops ""cotton"" and ""wheat"" derived by SVM and RF methods show a high correlation with the provided statistical data. Based on the results, the SVM classification method is recommended for further mapping and monitoring of irrigated crop types in the region when Sentinel-2 data is used. © Geoinformatics International.","Tashkent; Uzbekistan; cropping practice; identification method; image classification; irrigation; NDVI; satellite data; Sentinel; support vector machine; vegetation mapping","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131512291"

Deep learning algorithms, especially fully convolutional networks (FCNs), and variations like the ResU-Net have been used recently as rapid and automatic landslide detection approaches. Although FCNs have shown cutting-edge results in automatic landslide detection, accuracy can be improved by adding prior knowledge through possible frameworks. This study evaluates a rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach built on probabilities resulting from the ResU-Net model for landslide detection. We train the ResU-Net model using a landslide dataset comprising landslide inventories from various geographic regions, including our study area and test the testing area not used for training. In the OBIA stage, we first calculate land cover and image difference indices for pre-and post-landslide multi-temporal images. Next, we use the generated indices and the resulting ResU-Net probabilities for image segmentation; the extracted landslide object candidates are then optimized using rule-based classification. In the result validation section, the landslide detection of the proposed integration of the ResU-Net with a rule-based classification of OBIA is compared with that of the ResU-Net alone.

Sentinel-2 spectral imagery is well placed to capture the spatiotemporal variability of SOC, but its capability has only been demonstrated for agricultural regions mostly located in Europe. Furthermore, most studies so far only used single-date images that resulted in spatially non-continuous SOC maps, hampering their ability to aid multiscale SOC assessments. Here, we aim to achieve spatially continuous mapping of SOC in croplands, by creating multitemporal bare soil composites that maximize cropland coverage in two regions of varying agroecosystems and landscape structure in the Northeast China Chernozem region and the Belgian Loam Belt. Bare soil pixels were extracted via spectral index thresholding that excluded contaminated pixels from external perturbance. Multitemporal soil composites were then obtained by averaging over multiple single-date bare soil images that were selected within pre-determined optimal time-windows, corresponding to the region-specific crop sowing periods when best possible surface conditions were expected. Results show that the optimal time-window filter ensured selective inclusion of single-date images that themselves yielded stable and robust SOC predictions across multiple years. Spectral-based models developed from multitemporal composites consistently produced better or similar prediction accuracies than single-date images for both study regions (R2: 0.52–0.62; RMSE: 0.17–0.21 g 100 g−1), while also achieved maximum cropland coverage (>82 %). Bootstrap modelling demonstrated that SOC mapping via multitemporal Sentinel-2 data was associated with small uncertainties. Investigations into the significant spectral bands that contributed to the prediction of SOC suggested that, regardless of the study regions, the physical relationship between spectral bands and SOC that predominantly exists for laboratory spectra is largely translated into Sentinel-2 platforms. This study highlights the widespread applicability of multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing for effective and high-resolution SOC mapping, in order to detect localized soil degradation as well as to inform regional cropland management in diverse agroecosystems. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To overcome these challenges, we here present a large-area mapping framework to identify active cropland and short-term fallows in smallholder landscapes for the 2020/2021 growing season at 4.77 m spatial resolution. Our study focuses on Northern Mozambique, an area comprising 381,698 km2. The approach is based on Google Earth Engine and time series of PlanetScope mosaics made openly available through Norwaýs International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) data program. We conducted multi-temporal coregistration of the PlanetScope data using seasonal Sentinel-2 base images and derived consistent and gap-free seasonal time series metrics to classify active cropland and short-term fallows. An iterative active learning framework based on Random Forest class probabilities was used for training rare classes and uncertain regions. The map was accurate (area-adjusted overall accuracy 88.6% ± 1.5%), with the main error type being the commission of active cropland. Error-adjusted area estimates of active cropland extent (61,799.5 km2 ± 4,252.5 km2) revealed that existing global and regional land cover products tend to under-, or over-estimate active cropland extent, respectively. Short-term fallows occupied 28.9% of the cropland in our reference sample (13% of the mapped cropland), with consolidated agricultural regions showing the highest shares of short-term fallows.

Thus, this study demonstrates cotton cultivation dynamics by constructing their change trajectories using multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. Then we reclassified the trajectories into four change trends, namely permanent cotton-field, cotton-field gain, cotton-field loss and unstable changes type. The results showed that increased cotton-cultivated areas were greater than the decreased areas. Cotton fields’ expansion gradually appeared in the outer parts of the permanent cotton fields, especially towards the northern mountain front alluvial-plain. Production decline caused by cotton cultivation loss was 3.09 × 108 kg. The observed cotton cultivation dynamics were associated to farmers’ options driven by crop price fluctuations, agricultural policies and natural conditions. The production loss was associated to cotton field loss and fields that underwent unstable changes. Management strategies should thus focus intercepting the loss and the unstable change trajectories. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; agricultural policy; alluvial plain; cotton; crop production; cultivation; Landsat; oasis agriculture; price dynamics; Sentinel","arid oasis region; Cotton cultivation mapping; remote sensing; temporal trajectory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101933363"

However, the contribution of individual features from these two domains of the electromagnetic spectrum for tree species classification is still unclear. For large-scale forest assessments, it is moreover important to better understand the domain-specific limitations of the two sensor families, such as the impact of cloudiness and low signal-to-noise-ratio, respectively. In this study, seven deciduous and five coniferous tree species of the Austrian Biosphere Reserve Wienerwald (105,000 ha) were classified using Breiman’s random forest classifier, labeled with help of forest enterprise data. In nine test cases, variations of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery were passed to the classifier to evaluate their respective contributions. By solely using a high number of Sentinel-2 scenes well spread over the growing season, an overall accuracy of 83.2% was achieved. With ample Sentinel-2 scenes available, the additional use of Sentinel-1 data improved the results by 0.5 percentage points. This changed when only a single Sentinel-2 scene was supposedly available. In this case, the full set of Sentinel-1-derived features increased the overall accuracy on average by 4.7 percentage points. The same level of accuracy could be obtained using three Sentinel-2 scenes spread over the vegetation period. On the other hand, the sole use of Sentinel-1 including phenological indicators and additional features derived from the time series did not yield satisfactory overall classification accuracies (55.7%), as only coniferous species were well separated. © 2022 by the authors.

The methodology mapped the maximum flood extent of over 25,000 detected water bodies across Ireland over a five-year period (2016–2021). Flood extents were classified using a semi-automatic tile-based histogram thresholding approach and refined using a series of post processing filters. These included multi-temporal filters which exploited the timing and orbit position of the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify likely false positives, and contextual information based filters which used external information such as topography and land use to estimate the likelihood of flooding and constrain its extent. A topographic correction algorithm was also applied to hydrologically-correct flood bodies. The methodology produced a user accuracy of above 0.95 for each annual map when compared to observed flood level data, overall accuracy values above 0.97 and kp values above 0.7 when compared to mapping process based on Sentinel-2 validation imagery, and the capacity to detect over 90% of recorded permanent water bodies larger than 2 ha. As an additional step, confidence information was provided for each flood polygon based on the quantity of consistently flooded pixels used in its definition.

When applied to small water bodies, misjudging often occurs. The multi-spectral remote sensing data of the Sentinel 2 satellite has a spatial resolution of 10, 20, and 60 meters; a dual-star time resolution of 5 days; and a high temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, this paper uses the sentinel-2 green light band (560 nm), red-edge band (705 nm), near-infrared band (842 nm, 865 nm), and short wave-infrared band (2190 nm) for remote sensing reflectance. A new water index algorithm (red edge-based water index, RWI for short) is proposed for the extraction of fine water. The normalized remote sensing reflectance of vegetation, shadow, building, mixed pixel, bare soil, and water body is compared and analyzed. The mechanism explains why RWI has a better effect of extracting fine water bodies compared with other water body indexes.To quantitatively evaluate the advantages of the RWI water body extraction algorithm proposed in this paper, this paper compares several current water body extraction algorithms, including the improved normalized difference water index MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index), multi-band water body index MBWI (multi-band water index), and AWEI (automatic water extraction index). The water body extraction results obtained by several algorithms and the area statistics of the artificial water interpretation of the water body results are calculated using the error formula to obtain RWI. The errors of MNDWI, MBWI, AWEIsh, and AWEInsh are 3.6%, 4.2%, 12.2%, 8.8%, and 19.8%, respectively. Results show that the RWI algorithm has the highest accuracy. At the same time, through analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of several water extraction results are quantitatively evaluated. From the results of image extraction, this paper proposes that the water boundary extraction method extracted by the RWI water body extraction algorithm is better, and it can eliminate mountains, building shadows, and clouds. The effect of shadows can eliminate the effects of mixed pixels.At the same time, this paper carried out multi-temporal water extraction in Xiong'an New District, Shendong Mining Area, and Yongcheng Mining Area. In the time range from January 2016 to December 2018, a total of 43 Sentinel-2 images without clouds were screened, and the small broken water bodies in the three areas of Xiong'an New District, Shendong Mining Area, and Yongcheng Mining Area were selected by the algorithm proposed in this paper. The distribution carried out multi-temporal analysis. Results from statistical area analysis indicate that Xiong'an New District has the largest water body area in spring, followed by summer and autumn. No significant change in water area was observed in the Shendong and Yongcheng mining areas. After careful observation, the results of each phase are very good, the boundary of the small water body is highly differentiated, and no data are misleading or missing, and the algorithm has good applicability and stability. © 2022, Science Press.

Despite its climate and environmental impacts, India is largely unexplored considering the magnitude and frequency of agricultural residue burning. This study focuses on Central India and explores the potential of Sentinel-2 (10 m) multispectral data to accurately estimate ABA, which can be used to calculate associated emissions. We used a locally adapted multi-temporal burned area detection methodology to quantify burned areas after the winter crop harvest in Central India from 2019 to 2021. A novel satellite data assisted virtual sampling method was used to collect burned and unburned training samples. Monthly ABAs were extracted at 10 m resolution and were compared with existing global burned area products. On average, the derived ABAs were larger (∼9179 km2 per month) than those reported by global burned area products that are based on MODIS at 500 m and 250 m resolutions. We show that our approach maps ABA from smallholder farms more accurately than other global products, particularly for fields that are smaller than 10 ha. The derived ABAs were further used to estimate emissions due to agricultural residue burning, which can be used as an initial estimate of potential emissions due to ABA in Central India. Overall, the study demonstrates the ability of Sentinel-2 data to detect and quantify ABA in smallholder systems, which can be used to more accurately estimate emissions compared to existing global products. © 2022","India; Madhya Pradesh; agricultural development; burning; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; smallholder","Agricultural burned area mapping; Central India; Google Earth Engine; Madhya Pradesh; Planet; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128326457"

Although the underwater substrates do not change, the spectral properties differ due to attenuation effects. These differences have an impact on the results when multi-temporal remote sensing images are used to analyze seagrasses. This paper proposes a remote sensing mapping method for seagrasses taking the tidal influence, using the seagrasses growth area in Xincun Bay, Hainan Province, China as a case study. a) The seagrasses growth area was determined from remote sensing images. The seagrasses were divided into two types: the seagrasses exposed to water surface or tidal flats (non-submerged seagrasses) and the seagrasses submerged in water (submerged seagrasses). b) The spectral features of seagrasses in Sentienl-2 image were analyzed. We found that the spectral characteristics of non-submerged seagrasses were similar to terrestrial vegetation and these seagrasses could be extracted by using NDVI. The submerged seagrasses spectral was different, forming a reflection peak at the first vegetation red edge band (i.e.705 nm) in Sentinel-2 images. This reflection peak was used to design the Submerged Seagrasses Identification Index (SSII) for extracting underwater seagrass. c) The extraction results of non-submerged seagrasses and submerged seagrasses were merged to map the seagrasses in the study area. The experimental results show that the mapping method proposed in this study can fully consider the influence of tidal changes in remote sensing images on seagrasses identification. The SSII constructed based on Sentinel-2 images extracted submerged seagrasses effectively.

Selecting a remote-sensing (RS) data source is a critical step in efficient orchard mapping, and it is hard to have a RS image with both rich temporal and spatial information. A trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution must be made. Taking grape-growing regions as an example, we tested imagery at different spatial and temporal resolutions as classification inputs (including from Worldview-2, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2) and compared and assessed their orchard-mapping performance using the same classifier of random forest. Our results showed that the overall accuracies improved from 0.6 to 0.8 as the spatial resolution of the input images increased from 58.86 m to 0.46 m (simulated from Worldview-2 imagery). The overall accuracy improved from 0.7 to 0.86 when the number of images used for classification was increased from 2 to 20 (Landsat-8) or approximately 60 (Sentinel-2) in one year. The marginal benefit of increasing the level of details (LoD) of temporal features on accuracy is higher than that of spatial features, indicating that the classification ability of temporal information is higher than that of spatial information. The highest accuracy of using a very high-resolution (VHR) image can be exceeded only by using four to five medium-resolution multi-temporal images, or even two to three growing season images with the same classifier. Combining the spatial and temporal features from multi-source data can improve the overall accuracies by 5% to 7% compared to using only temporal features. It can also compensate for the accuracy loss caused by missing data or low-quality images in single-source input. Although selecting multi-source data can obtain the best accuracy, selecting single-source data can improve computational efficiency and at the same time obtain an acceptable accuracy. This study provides practical guidance on selecting data at various spatial and temporal resolutions for the efficient mapping of other types of annual crops or orchards. © 2023 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Data Selection; Google earth engine; Google earths; Image-analysis; Object based; Object-based image analyse; Objects-based; Orchard mapping; Spatial features; Temporal features; Orchards","data selection; Google Earth Engine; object-based image analysis; orchard mapping; spatial features; temporal features","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147904813"

For instance, extreme weather can lead to earlier or later senescence than normal, while higher altitudes often favor early grass senescence. However, to date, there is no comprehensive understanding of key remote-sensing-derived environmental variables that influence the occurrence of autumn grassland senescence, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Meanwhile, knowledge of the relationship between autumn grass senescence and environmental variables is required to aid the formulation of optimal rangeland management practices. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the spatial autocorrelations between remotely sensed autumn grass senescence vis-a-vis climatic and topographic variables in the subtropical grasslands. Sentinel 2′s Normalized Difference NIR/Rededge Normalized Difference Red-Edge (NDRE) and the Chlorophyll Red-Edge (Chlred-edge) indices were used as best proxies to explain the occurrence of autumn grassland senescence, while monthly (i.e., March to June) estimates of the remotely sensed autumn grass senescence were examined against their corresponding climatic and topographic factors using the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), the Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and the Random Forest Regression (RFR) models. The RFR model displayed a superior performance on both proxies (i.e., RMSEs of 0.017, 0.012, 0.056, and 0.013, as well as R2s of 0.69, 0.71, 0.56, and 0.71 for the NDRE, with RMSEs and R2s 0.023, 0.018, 0.014 and 0.056, as well as 0.59, 0.60, 0.69, and 0.72 for the Chlred-edge in March, April, May, and June, respectively). Next, the mean monthly values of the remotely sensed autumn grass senescence were separately tested for significance against the average monthly climatic (i.e., minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) air temperatures, rainfall, soil moisture, and solar radiation) and topographic (i.e., slope, aspect, and elevation) factors to define the environmental drivers of autumn grassland senescence. Overall, the results indicated that Tmax (p = 0.000 and 0.005 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively), Tmin (p = 0.021 and 0.041 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively), and the soil moisture (p = 0.031 and 0.040 for the NDRE and the Chlred-edge, respectively) were the most influential autumn grass senescence drivers. Overall, these results have shown the role of remote sensing techniques in assessing autumn grassland senescence along climatic and topographic gradients as well as in determining key environmental drivers of this senescence in the study area © 2023 by the authors.","","autumn senescence; climate; grass; remotely sensed; topographic factors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146749067"

Reconstructing the original signal from the missing data is an essential task of a multi-temporal image analysis to monitor dynamic phenomena, e.g. crop growth and phenology, weather/climate changes, disaster evolution, land use/cover change, and others. Generally, two operations are performed: 1. identification of the cloudy pixels (generation of a cloud mask); 2. reconstruction with cloud-free pixels, derived or estimated from past/future cloud-free acquisitions (e.g. generation of a composite image). This article presents a review of the main cloud detection methods and discusses advantages and disadvantages of the replacement of cloudy pixels with cloud-free ones. We propose a new smoothing function; it performs the above two steps in one-pass operation thus simplifying the processing chain.

Despite the considerable efforts in quantifying spatially explicit ammonia emissions, there are significant uncertainties in ammonia emission estimates at regional scales. We aimed to improve the modeling of atmospheric ammonia emission variability in space and time across the Netherlands by updating an agricultural ammonia emission model with a newly derived high-resolution crop map and a livestock housing location database of the Netherlands. To generate a crop map of 12 agricultural land cover classes, we applied random forest classification to the multi-temporal multispectral observations of surface reflectance and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2. The crop statistics were used to calculate ammonia emission distribution based on nitrogen demand (manure and mineral fertilizer needed) of different crop types using the INTEGRATOR model. Next, the crop map was utilized to spatially allocate the ammonia emissions to a high-resolution grid across the Netherlands. In addition, ammonia emissions from livestock housing systems were introduced as point sources using location data from the Geographic Information Agricultural Business system. The temporal emission variability was updated using a recently developed TIMELINES module. After the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emission was obtained with the crop map and housing information, it was imported into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to model ammonia surface concentration for validation with in situ measurements. The performed crop classification has an average accuracy score of 0.73. The derived crop map was compared with Dutch national statistics, and the results showed that the absolute median of the relative difference between Sentinel-2 derived crop areas and national statistical information is around 5%. The newly modeled ammonia monthly surface concentrations compared better with in situ measurements in terms of the magnitude and temporal variability than those derived from the original emission distribution, indicating that the temporal distribution of ammonia emissions was improved. The comparison of modeled and measured annual averaged surface concentrations illustrated that the spatial distribution of ammonia emission was also improved. All model performance indicators significantly improved, and the performance of the updated model was more stable and robust. The improvement was more evident at the stations where livestock housing is the main emission source. This study illustrates that apart from a satellite-derived crop map, information on the locations of animal housing systems also plays an essential role in better estimates of the spatial and temporal distribution of ammonia emissions. It can be worthwhile to extrapolate the method to other regions in Europe and elsewhere. © 2023","Biodiversity; Crops; Forestry; Housing; Location; Nitrogen fertilizers; Spatial distribution; Uncertainty analysis; Ammonia emissions; Crop mapping; Crop maps; Emission; Emission distribution; Housing systems; Livestock housing; Netherlands; Surface concentration; Temporal distribution; Ammonia","Ammonia; Crop mapping; Emission; Spatial distribution; Temporal distribution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148080124"

However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediterranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of environmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3% and 14.6% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2–82.7% overall accuracy.

Spectral indices such as the Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), and Burned Area Index (BAI) were used to identify the burned area in the March 2022 forest fire in Uljin. Based on the results of six indices, the accuracy to detect the burned area was assessed for four satellites using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, respectively. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 produce images every 16 and 10 days, respectively, although it is difficult to acquire clear images due to clouds. Furthermore, using images taken before and after a forest fire to examine the burned area results in a rapid shift because vegetation growth in South Korea began in April, making it difficult to detect. Because Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images from February to May are based on the same date, this study is able to compare the indices with a relatively high detection accuracy and gets over the temporal resolution limitation.

It uses this model to analyze differences in the pixel and its spatial context-based predictions in subsequent time periods for CD. We combine this spatial context-based CD with ensembling over mutually exclusive neighborhoods and transitioning from pixel to object-level changes with morphological operations. SiROC achieves competitive performance for CD with medium-resolution Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planetscope imagery on four datasets. Besides accurate predictions without the need for training, SiROC also provides a well-calibrated uncertainty of its predictions.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Forecasting; Mathematical morphology; Optical sensors; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Change detection; Multi-temporal; Optical image; Optical imaging; Optical-; Remote-sensing; Spatial context; Spatial resolution; Unsupervised; Urban analysis; morphology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; urban area; Geometrical optics","Change detection (CD); multitemporal; optical images; unsupervised; urban analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120579030"

The absorption of solar radiation in the water leads to a higher ice ablation, and water draining through the glacier to its bed leads to a higher velocity. Rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns provoke an increase in the supraglacial lakes in number and total area. However, the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and thus their potential for influencing mass balance and ice dynamics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We present a summertime series of supraglacial lake evolution on Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram from 2016 to 2020. The dense time series is enabled by a multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach based on optical (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X) remote sensing data. The mapping of the seasonal lake evolution uses a semi-automatic approach, which includes a random forest classifier applied separately to each sensor. A combination of linear regression and the Hausdorff distance is used to harmonize between SAR- and optical-derived lake areas, producing consistent and internally robust time series dynamics. Seasonal variations in the lake area are linked with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) based on air temperature and precipitation data derived from the climate reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land. The largest aggregated lake area was found in 2018 with 5.783 km2, followed by 2019 with 4.703 km2, and 2020 with 4.606 km2. The years 2016 and 2017 showed the smallest areas with 3.606 and 3.653 km2, respectively. Our data suggest that warmer spring seasons (April–May) with higher precipitation rates lead to increased formation of supraglacial lakes. The time series decomposition shows a linear increase in the lake area of 11.12 ± 9.57% per year. Although the five-year observation period is too short to derive a significant trend, the tendency for a possible increase in the supraglacial lake area is in line with the pronounced positive anomalies of the SPI and STI during the observation period.

Due to significant elevation gradients, high-mountain plant communities in a small area allow for the monitoring of the most important environmental changes. Additionally, being a tourist attraction, they are exposed to direct human influence (e.g., trampling). Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the best data sources for vegetation mapping, but flight campaign costs limit the repeatability of surveys. A possible alternative approach is to use satellite data from the Copernicus Earth observation program. In our study, we compared multitemporal Sentinel-2 data with HySpex airborne hyperspectral images to map the plant communities on Tatra Mountains based on open-source R programing implementation of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. As high-mountain ecosystems are adapted to topographic conditions, the input of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derivatives on the classification accuracy was analyzed and the effect of the number of training pixels was tested to procure practical information for field campaign planning. For 13 classes (from rock scree communities and alpine grasslands to montane conifer and deciduous forests), we achieved results in the range of 76–90% F1-score depending on the data set. Topographic features: digital terrain model (DTM), normalized digital surface model (nDSM), and aspect and slope maps improved the accuracy of HySpex spectral images, transforming their minimum noise fraction (MNF) bands and Sentinel-2 data sets by 5–15% of the F1-score. Maps obtained on the basis of HySpex imagery (2 m; 430 bands) had a high similarity to maps obtained on the basis of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data (10 m; 132 bands; 11 acquisition dates), which was less than one percentage point for classifications based on 500–1000 pixels; for sets consisting of 50–100 pixels, Random Forest (RF) offered better accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the multiple crop types and frequent cloud cover locally have posed a great challenge to the direct identification of the large-scale citrus orchard using the spectral information. In this study, a systematic approach was developed to identify the citrus orchard using the phenological characteristics of citrus during the fruit expansion stage, where the threshold value was determined to the key time window. Taking the Wuming District of Nanning Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest China as the study area, an empirical investigation was carried out using the Google Earth Engine platform. 1 751 ground samples were also collected in the field for validation. Meanwhile, the cloud coverage assessment was performed on the Sentinel-2 images over the whole year of 2018. According to the citrus phenology in the study area, the characteristics of flowering were not outstanding in the first half of 2018 (the flowering period of citrus), while the key identification features were found in the second half of 2018 (the peak stage of citrus fruit growth and expansion). As such, the second half of 2018 was determined as the study period, considering the data availability and citrus phenological stage. Then, a multi-temporal image dataset was obtained from August to December. The specific procedure was as follows. Firstly, some indices were calculated using the time series Sentinel-2 data in 2018, including the multiple vegetation indices (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Difference Vegetation Index (DVI)), and Sentinel-derived Red-Edge Spectral Indices (RESI). The vegetation information of multi-temporal remote sensing was then obtained for the entire study area. Secondly, the vegetation information of various planting types was compared in different growing periods, according to the measured ground data. The results showed that there was no outstanding spectral difference between the citrus orchards and other vegetation types (e.g. sugarcane, banana, maize, and rice) in the study area. However, the vegetation indices of multi-temporal remote sensing presented that the NDVI of 0.47 for the citrus orchards was distinctly lower than that for the other vegetation types in October. There was also a lower GNDVI of citrus orchards in October and November. But there was no difference in the DVI of citrus orchards from other vegetation. Furthermore, the fruit expansion stage of citrus was located from September to October, indicating weak vegetation information of citrus. Nevertheless, there were significant differences among different vegetation indices, where the NDVI presented the highest. In addition, a renormalization of vegetation indices was further constructed to identify the spatial distribution of citrus in the study area by a threshold, according to the NDVI in October. The overall accuracy of citrus orchards reached 82.75% using the renormalization of NDVI, where the Kappa coefficient was 0.66, indicating a better identification, compared with the rest of renormalized vegetation indices (GNDVI, DVI, and RESI). The NDVI presented more complete identification for the citrus orchards, whereas, the GNDVI performed more fragmented identification. Consequently, the total area of citrus planting was calculated as 3.42×104 hm2 using the phenological parameters of citrus orchards.

However, two major issues have constrained the urban tree species (e.g. PaWs) identification: (1) the urban tree landscapes are highly fragmented and susceptible to the existence of mixed pixels in the remote sensing imagery; (2) the tree species in urban environment are diverse with high spectral similarity. To this end, this study developed a sub-meter phenological spectral feature (Spsf) with multi-scale and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery for monitoring PaWs at the tree species level. Spsf includes three steps: (1) exploring three key phenological periods of PaWs (leafless period, greenleaf period, and senescence period); (2) selecting one or three spectral indexes to characterize each phenological period; (3) stacking the spectral vegetation indexes from Sentinel-2 SR imagery and freely available sub-meter (0.8 m) Google Earth imagery together. Subsequently, Spsf was taken as the input data to train the deep learning DeepLabv3 + model for predicting the PaWs distribution. The Beijing Plain was chosen as the study area, where the distribution of PaWs was extensive and fragmented. Compared with the field survey reference data, the derived PaWs map achieved the overall accuracy higher than 92 % and the Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The Spsf integrated rich spatial information from sub-meter imagery and phenological spectral information from Sentinel-2 imagery, which may alleviate the impacts of mixed pixels and enhance the spectral separability between PaWs and other tree species effectively. The proposed Spsf-based method provides a new paradigm for sub-meter tree species mapping with multi-source free remote sensing data. The PaWs map can serve as reference data for the relevant departments to monitor and manage the PWCs. © 2022","Beijing Plain; Beijing [China]; China; North China Plain; Deep learning; Forestry; Image enhancement; Photomapping; Pixels; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; Vegetation mapping; Deep learning; Multi-scales; Phenology; Species classification; Spectral feature; Sub meter; Tree species; Tree species classification; Urban; Urban environments; algorithm; phenology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; senescence; urban ecosystem; Remote sensing","Deep learning; Multi-scale; Phenology; Sub-meter; Tree species classification; Urban","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138089341"

This research looks at how Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) can be used to map rice fields in Palakkad district of Kerala. The area was delineated using three multi-temporal cloud free Sentinel-2 data with 10 m spatial resolution, matching to crop's reproductive stage during mundakan season (September-October to December-January), 2020-21. To make classification easier, the administrative boundary of district was placed over the mosaicked image. The rice acreage estimation and land use classification of the major rice tract of Palakkad district comprising five blocks was done using Iterative Self-Organisation Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classification provision in ArcGIS 10.1 software, employing False Colour Composite (FCC) including Blue (B2), Green (B3), Red (B4) and Near-infrared (B8) Bands of Sentinel-2 images. The classification accuracy was determined by locating a total of 60 validation points throughout the district, comprising 30 rice and 30 non-rice points. The total estimated area was 24742.76 ha, with an average accuracy of 88.33% and kappa coefficient 0.766 in five blocks of Palakkad district.

Sentinel-2 data with the dense time-series observations enable to identify tree species. However, few studies clarify the differences in classification using Sentinel-2 images in natural forest and planted forest. Two study areas with different forest environments (planted forest and natural forest) were selected to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery. Our results show that red-edge band, short-wave infrared (SWIR) band and vegetation indices (VIs), such as Red-Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (ReNDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), have important effects on tree species classification, especially in the growing season. By using two machine learning algorithms (support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]), the results show that the classification accuracy for planted forests (91.27% in SVM and 88.35% in RF) significantly exceeds that of natural forests (84.34% in SVM and 81.03% in RF). This accuracy difference may be related to the spatial heterogeneity inside the forest and the surrounding environmental implications. Although the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images produce satisfactory accuracy for classifying tree species, further research is needed to improve the classification accuracy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Decision trees; Forestry; Image classification; Image enhancement; Infrared radiation; Learning algorithms; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Classification accuracy; Forest resource managements; Natural forests; Random forests; Red edge; Remote sensing technology; Support vectors machine; Sustainable forest; Tree species; Vegetation index; forest ecosystem; mapping method; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil-vegetation interaction; tree; Support vector machines","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126837596"

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of multi-temporal (monthly time series) compared to mono-temporal (single time step) satellite images for multi-label classification using supervised learning on the RapidAI4EO dataset. As a first step, we trained our CNN model on images at a single time step for multi-label classification, i.e. mono-temporal. We incorporated time-series images using a LSTM model to assess whether or not multi-temporal signals from satellites improves CLC classification. The results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 0.89% in classifying satellite imagery on 15 classes using a multi-temporal approach on monthly time series images compared to the mono-temporal approach.

Remote Sensing (RS) technology is the most effective method to obtain the planting area data of winter wheat over wide areas. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) parameter derived from multi-temporal RS images with medium and low resolution, such as MODIS imagery, is frequently used for such purpose. But the accuracy of obtained winter wheat planting area is usually unsatisfactory due to the limited spatial resolution of the used RS images. Sentinel-2A and Sentine-2B, which were launched in 2015 and 2017 respectively, are currently the only spaceborne sensors capable of acquiring images in three red-edge spectral bands with meter-level spatial resolution. Red-edge bands have great potential in discriminating vegetation types and evaluating vegetation health condition, because these bands are sensitive to the chlorophyll and the nitrogen contents of vegetation. However, there are few studies on winter wheat extraction over wide area using the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data. In this paper, a wide-area winter wheat extraction method based on the Red-Edge Position Index (REPI) and the NDVI data derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images is proposed, which is then applied to extract the winter wheat planting area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region for the year of 2020. Firstly, the temporal REPI and NDVI are extracted from Sentinel-2 data. Secondly, the key temporal phases for discriminating winter wheat are studied, and the decision rules based on temporal REPI and NDVI features for winter wheat discrimination are constructed. Finally, the winter wheat planting area in the Beijin-Tianjin-Hebei region in 2020 is extracted using the constructed decision rules. The extracted winter wheat area is validated by two kinds of reference data. It shows an error of -2.57% when compared with the winter wheat planting area data published by the National Bureau of Statistics. Additionally, the overall accuracy of the extracted winter wheat area is 94.24% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.88 in comparison with the visual interpretation results of Google Earth high-resolution images. The conclusions are: (1) REPI changes with the change of chlorophyll concentration during the growth period of winter wheat, and gradually increases with the growth of winter wheat seedlings after sowing period, until reaching the first peak (about 722 nm) at the emergence stage (November). During the overwintering period, it falls below 715 nm. The second peak is reached at heading stage (April-May), with the corresponding value greater than 730 nm. The REPI value in the mature stage drops below 720 nm. Especially, the REPI at heading stage provides excellent separability between winter wheat and woodland, while NDVI has a serious commission error when distinguishing winter wheat from woodland. (2) It can not achieve satisfactory result when either parameter (REPI or NDVI) of single date is used to extract winter wheat over wide areas. However, the decision tree classifier constructed based on the combination of REPI and NDVI parameters derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data can extract winter wheat area with very high accuracy over wide areas, because other land cover types can be well excluded by the specific features presented by either REPI or NDVI of the key temporal phases, thus the effect of “different cover types with similar pectrum” associate with wide-area classification can be largely mitigated. This research demonstrates the significance of the red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 in discriminating winter wheat of wide-area. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

This study presents a detailed and an updated glacier inventory of 2020 for the Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB), Kashmir Himalayas using Sentinel-2 data and documents 308 glaciers. The glaciers range in size from 0.01 to 10.51 km2 and cover an area of 102.1 km2. All glaciers are located in the elevation zone between 3500 and 5000 masl. About 86% of glaciers are small in size (< 0.5 km2) and constitute 38.7% of total ice cover. However, glaciers with size greater than 0.5 km2 are only 14% but constitute a major proportion 61.3% of glacier area. Majority of small glaciers are a result of defragmentation of larger ones, hence more vulnerable to melting. Multi-date satellite images were used to assess glacier fluctuations of selected glaciers (≥ 0.3) for the period 1990–2020. The total glacier area has reduced from 85.25 to 68.17 km2 (20%) at the rate of 0.56 km2 a−1. Glaciers in the lower elevation zone (3800–4200 masl) have lost about 35% of their area at the rate of 0.22 km2 a−1. The analysis of meteorological data using Thel–Sen method and Mann–Kendall test before examining its impact on glacier mass loss reveals that a persistent warming trend in mean annual temperatures is observed over the region. This is strictly under the influence of global climate change having a potential to cause enhanced shrinking and thinning of glaciers in the study region. © 2021, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Himalayas; India; Jammu and Kashmir; Jhelum Basin; climate change; glacier; inventory; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Climate change; Glacier recession; Jhelum basin; Kashmir Himalayas; Sentinel-2; Updated glacier inventory","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118464604"

To distinguish mangroves from other areas, it is necessary to rely on biological properties: water and vegetation cover. This study develops a method by analyzing the time series of water and vegetation cover in specific areas to determine criteria for accurate mangrove extraction. For more detail, 5 criteria canopy, greenness, NDVI &gt; 0.6, NDVI &lt; 0.2, and LSWI &gt; 0.45 are extracted. These 5 indices are considered to correlate with annual mean NDVI to set thresholds for mangroves. Besides, terrain elevation data is also considered to filter out the mixed vegetation close to mangrove. This approach is applied to coastal areas of Vietnam to produce a mangrove forests map in 2020 using Google Earth Engine. Then 47 mangrove-reference points are used to check the mangrove map with an accuracy of about 85%. Finally, the mangrove map in 2020 is overlaid with the mangrove map in 2011 generated from Landsat images to determine the change of mangroves over 9 years. The results show that after 9 years, 95,000 ha of mangrove was preserved, approximately 120,000 ha disappeared, and approximately 67,000 ha of new forests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Forestry; Canopy; GEE; Greenness; LSWI; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; NDVI; Vegetation cover; Viet Nam; Water cover; Vegetation","Canopy; GEE; Greenness; LSWI; Mangrove; NDVI","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147847499"

Deep learning-based approaches have shown their usefulness in automatically segmenting large remote sensing images, helping to automatize these tasks. However, deep learning models require large amounts of labeled data to generalize well to unseen scenarios. The generation of global-scale remote sensing datasets with high intraclass variability presents a major challenge. For this reason, data augmentation techniques have been widely applied to artificially increase the size of the datasets. Among them, photometric data augmentation techniques such as random brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue have been traditionally applied aiming at improving the generalization against color spectrum variations, but they can have a negative effect on the model due to their synthetic nature. To solve this issue, sensors with high revisit times such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 can be exploited to realistically augment the dataset. Accordingly, this paper sets out a novel realistic multi-temporal color data augmentation technique. The proposed methodology has been evaluated in the building and road semantic segmentation tasks, considering a dataset composed of 38 Spanish cities. As a result, the experimental study shows the usefulness of the proposed multi-temporal data augmentation technique, which can be further improved with traditional photometric transformations.  © Authors 2022","Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Photometry; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Building footprint; Building footprint detection; Convolutional neural network; Data augmentation; Deep learning; Multi-temporal; Remote-sensing; Road network extraction; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Semantic Segmentation","Building Footprint Detection; Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Multi-temporal; Remote Sensing; Road Network Extraction; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131931027"

However, crop rotation mapping for smallholder agriculture systems remains challenging due to the diversity of crop types, complex cropping practices, and fragmented cropland. This research established a sub-seasonal crop information identification framework for crop rotation mapping based on time series Sentinel-2 imagery. The framework designed separate identification models based on the different growth seasons of crops to reduce interclass similarity caused by the same crops in a certain growing season. Features were selected separately according to crops characteristics, and finally explored rotations between them to generate the crop rotation map. This framework was evaluated in the study area of Shandong Province, China, a mix of single-cropping and double-cropping smallholder area. The accuracy assessment showed that the two crop maps achieved an overall accuracy of 0.93 and 0.85 with a Kappa coefficient of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The results showed that crop rotation practice mainly occurred in the plains of Shandong, and the predominant crop rotation pattern was wheat and maize. In addition, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI), red-edge, and other spectral bands during the peak growing season enabled better performance in crop mapping. This research demonstrated the capability of the framework to identify crop rotation patterns and the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 for crop rotation mapping under smallholder agriculture system. © 2022 by the authors.","Crop rotation; Farms; Food supply; Information management; Photomapping; Rotation; Surface waters; Vegetation mapping; A sub-seasonal framework; Crop rotation; Crop rotation mapping; Features selection; Google earth engine; Google earths; Information identifications; Sentinel-2; Smallholder agriculture; Times series; Time series","a sub-seasonal framework; crop rotation mapping; feature selection; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2; smallholder agriculture; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144814505"

The methodology observed inspection reports, images with different temporal and spatial resolutions and the ability of the images to integrate the inspection process of electricity generation in Brazil through photointerpretation. The results demonstrate that the processing of free images optimizes the human and financial resources, being able to verify three of the five stages of works supervised by the Agency to guarantee the schedule of implantation of the hydroelectric plants in any region of the country with the same capacity of use. In addition, remote sensing data are presented as an excellent tool in the management of regional development where the plants are implemented or other related management and monitoring applications, as they provide greater transparency and efficiency to the control over large areas, such as that exercised by the Agency, strengthening accountability and considerably reducing one of the most sensitive aspects to the regulatory body and the management of large areas: information asymmetry. © 2022, Universidade de Taubate.

Traditionally, some satellite observations can be easily affected by cloudy and rainy weather, thereby generating undesired images. These low-quality images can normally be excluded or reconstructed using the temporal filters for the remote sensing classification in practice. However, temporal filtering can also eliminate some useful information in the temporal trajectory of original images, leading to the uncertain identification of crop types. Meanwhile, the land cover mixtures within a pixel grid can pose a great influence on the performance of temporal filters, with the decrease in the spatial resolution of images. This study aims to comprehensively investigate the impacts of Savitzky-Golay (S-G) and Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) filter on the crop type mapping over different spatial resolutions using the random forest classifier, Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS, 30 m), and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 500 m) data. Specifically, six indices of time-series vegetation were selected to identify three crop types (soybeans, corn, and rice) in Heilongjiang Province in China. According to the derived maps of crop type, the temporal filtering posed a greater impact on the spatial distribution of crop classification in the decametric spatial resolution image (HLS) than that in MODIS. The evaluation results showed that the overall accuracy of the crop type maps derived by S-G and HANTS was reduced by 1.73 and 5.17 percentage points, compared with the original observations for decametric resolution images. By contrast, the overall accuracies were 84.73%, 85.51%, and 83.05% using the original, S-G, and HANTS observations over the low-resolution images, respectively, indicating no significant change in the crop type mapping before and after temporal filtering. Compared with the time-series vegetation indices over different crop types, both the intra- and inter-class differences of crop types changed significantly after temporal filtering in the decametric resolution images, indicating some great impacts on the accuracy of crop type mapping. Specifically, the inter-class difference between two similar crop types was incorrectly identified as the inherent noise by the temporal filtering. In this case, the temporal filtering had reduced the difference for the low accuracy of crop type mapping. For instance, the user's accuracies of soybeans and corn were reduced by 4.60 and 8.77 percentage points, respectively, before and after the HANTS filter. The temporal filtering had improved the accuracy of crop type identification (e.g., the user's accuracy of rice was improved after HANTS filter), because the significant intra-class difference of each crop type was further reduced in the time-series vegetation indices, compared with the observations without filtering. In terms of crop type mapping on the low-resolution images (i.e., MODIS), the temporal filtering posed no impacts on the accuracy of crop type identification, particularly for the larger effects of land cover mixtures in the pixel grid. Consequently, there were some impacts of temporal filtering on the performance of crop type mapping over different spatial scales. The finding can provide theoretical references and technical support for the spatial distribution of crop types. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Although the advantages of image segmentation to delineate agricultural fields in images are already known, the literature shows that it is rarely used to consider temporal changes in highly managed regions with the intensification of agricultural activities. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate a multitemporal segmentation method based on the coefficient of variation of spectral bands and vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 images, considering two agricultural years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) in an area with agricultural intensification. Images of the coefficient of variation represented the spectro-Temporal dynamics within the study area. These images were also used to apply an edge detection filter (Sobel) to verify their performance. The region-based algorithm Watershed Segmentation (WS) was used in the segmentation process. Subsequently, to assess the quality of the segmentation results produced, the metrics Potential Segmentation Error (PSE), Number-of-Segments Ratio (NSR), and Euclidean Distance 2 (ED2) were calculated from manually delineated reference objects. The segmentation achieved its best performance when applied to the unfiltered coefficient of variation images of spectral bands with an ED2 equal to 7.289 and 2.529 for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, respectively. There was a tendency for the WS algorithm to produce over-segmentation in the study area; however, its use proved to be effective in identifying objects in a dynamic area with the intensification of agricultural activities.  © Authors 2022.","Edge detection; Image segmentation; Vegetation; Agricultural activities; Agricultural intensification; Assesseg; Coefficients of variations; Multi-temporal; OBIA; Sobel; Spectral band; Vegetation index; Watershed segmentation; Agriculture","AssesSeg; Coefficient of Variation; Edge Detection; OBIA; Sobel; Vegetation Index; Watershed Segmentation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132047385"

A current constraint in understanding and modeling these changes is the lack of multi-temporal bathymetric data, or recursive observations. Often, it is difficult to obtain the repeat observations needed to quantify bathymetric change over time or events. However, the recent availability of ICE-Sat-2 bathymetric lidar creates the option to map coastal bathymetry from solely space-based measurements via satellite-derived bathymetry with multispectral imagery (IS-2/SDB). This composi-tional space-based bathymetric mapping technique can assess temporal change along the coasts without other remote sensing or in situ data. However, questions exist as to the accuracy of the technique relative to both quantitative uncertainties and the ability to resolve the spatial patterns of erosion and deposition in the nearshore environment, indicative of geomorphologic change. This paper addresses the concept using data from the Florida panhandle (Northern Gulf of Mexico) collected by Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 at two epochs to assess the feasibility of using IS-2/SDB for bath-ymetric change detection at scientifically relevant scales, spatial resolutions and accuracies.

We propose a multitask CNN architecture that can exploit unlabeled satellite imagery and that can be generalized to other multitemporal remote sensing image analysis contexts where the target parameter exhibits seasonal fluctuations. Specifically, Chl-a estimation is set as the main task, and an unlabeled sample’s month classification is set as an auxiliary network task. The proposed approach is validated with multitemporal/spectral Sentinel-2 images of Lake Balik in Turkey using in situ measurements acquired during 2017–2019.

However, cloudy/rainy climate conditions can easily lead to a lack of valid optical data, leading to crop classification difficulties. A general solution is taking advantage of all-weather synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. In practice, SAR and optical datasets are often applied in the agricultural field by the method of image fusion, but it is difficult to apply when the number of optical images is too small. To solve this problem, this research proposes a data-transfer and feature-optimize-based method, which deploy an RNN-based encoding-decoding network to add additional data to the ‘optical’ temporal features at the farmland parcel scale and improve the utilization of optical fragments. On the basis of this method, we mitigate inconsistencies in spatial scale among different datasets and optimize the time-series parameters without expert knowledge in the crop classification procedure. The experimental results illustrate the crop classification accuracy of this method, which achieves a 4.1% improvement over the traditional approach and is especially effective for dryland crops (e.g. corn and rapeseed). Thus, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined use of optical and SAR data for similar applications in cloudy/rainy mountainous areas. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Classification (of information); Crops; Data transfer; Deep learning; Farms; Geometrical optics; Image fusion; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Cloudy/rainy mountainoi area; Combined utilization; Crop classification; Feature transfers; Mountainous area; Multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Optical-; Optimisations; Sentinel-1; agricultural land; crop plant; data set; machine learning; mountain region; optimization; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","cloudy/rainy mountainous area; combined utilization; crop classification; feature transfer; multitemporal data; optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125641177"

However, these samples are difficult to acquire in the multitemporal case. A possible alternative is leveraging methods that exploit transfer learning for CD by reusing DL models pretrained for other tasks. However, the performance of the transfer-learning-based models decreases as much as the target images differ from the ones used for training the model. To overcome this limit, we propose an unsupervised CD method that exploits multiresolution deep feature maps derived by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). It automatically learns spatial features from the input during the training phase without requiring any labeled data. The proposed method processes the bitemporal images to obtain and compare multiresolution bitemporal feature maps. These feature maps are then analyzed by a feature-selection technique to select the most discriminant ones. Furthermore, an aggregated multiresolution difference image is computed and used for a detail-preserving multiscale CD. In the context of this CD approach, we propose two alternative strategies to retrieve multiscale reliability maps. We tested the proposed method on bitemporal multispectral images acquired by Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 representing burned areas and Sentinel-2 images representing deforested areas. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CD technique. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Job analysis; Remote sensing; Unsupervised learning; Auto encoders; Change detection; Convolutional autoencoder; Deep learning; Features extraction; Multi-temporal analysis; Remote-sensing; Task analysis; Unsupervised change detection; algorithm; detection method; image analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; training; unsupervised classification; Semantics","Convolutional autoencoder (CAE); Deep learning (DL); Multitemporal analysis; Remote sensing (RS); Unsupervised change detection (CD); Unsupervised learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122596684"

The method is based on maximizing Pearson’s correlation value when determining an optimal local displacement of the distorted image fragment by comparing with the reference image. To assess the effectiveness of the method when used over continental-scale and heterogeneous areas, three experiments were carried out providing quantitative estimates of imagery registration errors: an experiment with model datasets, an experiment to estimate the absolute registration error of MODIS reference imagery, and an experiment to estimate the registration error of geocorrected KMSS-M data. Experimental evaluation of the method based on model datasets of decameter-resolution Sentinel-2 (MSI) imagery demonstrated its robustness when used over a variety of environmental conditions over a one year-long observation period. The average georeferencing error of MODIS coarseresolution reference was shown to be less than 20 meters in Red and Near-infrared bands. Corrected KMSS-M imagery evaluation over the Russian Grain Belt within 2020 has shown, on average, the subpixel referencing accuracy both in Red and Near-infrared bands, while the average absolute georeferencing error of the original uncorrected KMSS-M imagery was shown to be about 3 kilometers. Subpixel registration accuracy of KMSS-M imagery, corrected with MODIS-based coarse-resolution reference, opens new prospects for using multi-temporal analysis of this multispectral surface reflectance data in a variety of scientific and practical applications associated with vegetation cover satellite monitoring. The technological flexibility of the method ensures its applicability to data from other satellite systems for Earth optical remote sensing. © 2022, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

Numerous supraglacial streams flowing directly over the NW GrIS surface drain a large lobe of grounded ice at Inglefield Land, into the proglacial Minturn River and the Nares Strait. Owing to the absence of moulins and crevasses, this continuous supraglacial-proglacial drainage system regulates the evacuation of surface meltwater from the ice sheet to the ocean. We examine this Inglefield Land coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system during the 2016–2019 melt seasons (July to August), using 137 Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 visible/near-infrared satellite images. Two surface water metrics (supraglacial meltwater area fraction Am and proglacial river effective width We) are used to track spatio-temporal variations of surface meltwater moving through this drainage system. Satellite-derived Am and We are also compared with daily surface runoff simulations from the MAR v3.11 and MERRA-2 climate/SMB models, to estimate meltwater routing lag times and assess model performance. Satellite-derived Am and We are highly correlated (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01), indicating that the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system evacuates meltwater directly from the ice surface to the ocean with negligible subglacial storage or delays. Both remotely sensed metrics are positively correlated with modeled runoff, especially MAR (r2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for Am and We, vs. 0.66 and 0.64 for MERRA-2). Lagged MAR runoff (2 days, r2 = 0.87 and 0.82) match both metrics better than simultaneous MAR runoff and the optimal time lag for both metrics are 2 d. We conclude that 1) unlike the southwest GrIS, the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system at Inglefield Land routes surface meltwater runoff directly off the ice surface to the proglacial zone, with virtually no subglacial capture of runoff by moulins; 2) most of the ∼2 d transit time occurs on the ice surface rather than in the proglacial zone; and 3) multi-temporal satellite imaging facilitates holistic, source-to-sink tracking of NW GrIS meltwater from the ice surface to the global ocean. © 2021 The Author(s)","Arctic; Greenland; Inglefield Land; drainage network; glacial hydrology; ice sheet; Landsat; mass balance; meltwater; proglacial environment; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis","Greenland runoff; Proglacial river; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial river; Surface mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122512966"

ANN provided the best accuracy for all wheat parameters and soybean LAI and canola wet biomass and LAI. RFR led to higher accuracy for soybean dry and wet biomass.

Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has long been used to map wetlands due to its sensitivity to surface inundation and ability to penetrate clouds, darkness, and certain vegetation canopies. Here, we track boreal wetland inundation by developing a two-step modified decision-tree algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) time-series data as inputs. This approach incorporates temporal as well as spatial characteristics of SAR backscatter and is evaluated for the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta (PAD), and Yukon Flats, Alaska (YF) from May 2017 to October 2019. Within these two boreal study areas, we map spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation classes of Open Water (OW), Floating Plants (FP), Emergent Plants (EP), and Flooded Vegetation (FV). Temporal variability, frequency, and maximum extents of transient wetland inundation are quantified. Retrieved inundation estimates are compared with in-situ field mapping obtained during the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a multi-temporal Landsat-derived surface water map. Over the 2017–2019 study period, we find that fractional inundation area ranged from 18.0% to 19.0% in the PAD, and from 10.7% to 12.1% in the YF. Transient wetland inundation covered ~595 km2 of the PAD, comprising ~9.1% of its landscape, and ~102 km2 of the YF, comprising ~3.6%. The implications of these findings for wetland function monitoring, and estimating landscape-scale methane emissions are discussed, together with limitations and uncertainties of our approach. We conclude that time series of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter, screened with Sentinel-2 MSI optical imagery and validated by field measurements, offer a valuable tool for tracking transient boreal wetland inundation. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, as far as the classification and extraction of multi-temporal cultivated land covers are concerned, the existing methods have limitations in the comprehensive expression of spatiotemporal features and the accurate modeling of spatiotemporal context relations among geographic objects, leading to the poor extraction accuracy of cultivated land covers. In addition, for the analysis of cultivated land change, the existing methods usually only focus on the statistical areal change of cultivated land cover based on administrative units, while consideration is seldom taken into the spatial correlation distribution characteristics of changes in cultivated land covers. Accordingly, first of all, this paper proposes a multi-temporal spatiotemporal context classification method, which comprehensively expresses and utilizes the multi-temporal spectral, texture, and spatial features of geographic objects, and models the contextual relations of features and semantics among geographic objects in both spatial and temporal dimensions of multi-temporal images, so as to improve the classification accuracy of cultivated land covers. Then, based on the extracted results of cultivated land covers, spatial statistical method of Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to analyze the spatial correlation characteristics of cultivated land changes in regular grids and administrative division units. Finally, Shunyi District of Beijing is taken as the study area while multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in 2015-2019 are used as the data sources to conduct verification of the proposed method. The results show that, compared with the two existing common multi-temporal classification methods, the proposed method achieves the highest accuracies in the classification of multi-temporal cultivated lands. The average user's accuracy and producer's accuracy reach 91.21% and 90.53%, respectively, while the overall accuracy of all categories is 90.79%, indicating that the proposed method can accurately extract the multi-temporal cultivated land cover information. Furthermore, according to the analysis of the spatial distribution characteristics of cultivated land changes, this study found a phenomenon of regional aggregation of the cultivated land change in Shunyi District from 2015 to 2019, which mainly presents the characteristics of concentrated reduction. The aggregation reduction phenomena of cultivated land covers in Zhaoquanying Town, Gaoliying Town, Mulin Town, and Yang Town are especially obvious, indicating that the problems of cultivated land encroachment and reduction are quite serious in these areas. © 2022, Science Press.

The Sundarbans is called the shelter of Bangladesh as it protects southern coastal regions from natural disasters such as Cyclones, and typhoons. However, the mighty Sundarbans are dying because of climate changes, excessive human activities and the overwhelming consumption of natural forest resources. The primary objective of this study is to classify and detect deforested areas due to natural and anthropogenic causes. This study used Sentinel 2A Imageries of year 2016 and 2022 to detect forest cover changes in between the time period. In this study, the transfer learning method was applied to classify deforested areas. The transfer learning method uses the knowledge of a pre-Trained model to build the new model. The UNet was the base model where weight from the pre-Trained ResNet34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset (https://www.image-net.org/) was used as the backend. The dataset was divided into two sets where 80% of data was used in training and 20% was used for model validation. Average training and validation accuracy for both 2016 and 2022 data were close to 98%. The predicted images and ground truth data were similar and the model captured rivers, deforested areas, and vegetation approximately. We found that there were 1426.71 sq. mi of forest covers in the year-2016 which reduced to 1394.26 sq. mi in 2022 (3.5% of total area). This study also found interesting information about natural reforestation. We found that between 2016-2022, 56.89 sq. mi of forest cover was deforested whereas 24.44 sq. mi of deforested land cover was converted back into forest cover. The outcome of this study can guide the policy makers to identify areas where rapid deforestation is happing and can help to implement policies to protect those areas.  © 2022 IEEE.","Climate change; Deforestation; Disasters; Learning systems; Machine learning; Reforestation; Storms; Bangladesh; Deforestation mapping; Forest; Forest cover; Machine learning learning; Machine-learning; Multi-temporal; Sundarbans; Transfer learning; Transfer learning methods; Mapping","Deforestation Mapping; Forest; Machine Learning Learning; Sundarbans; Transfer Learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137918061"

Remote sensing (RS) has extensively been employed for crop type classification. However, accurate mapping of crop types and extents is still a challenge, especially using traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, in this study, a novel framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a dual attention module (DAM) and using Sentinel-2 time-series datasets was proposed to classify crops. A new DAM was implemented to extract informative deep features by taking advantage of both spectral and spatial characteristics of Sentinel-2 datasets. The spectral and spatial attention modules (AMs) were respectively applied to investigate the behavior of crops during the growing season and their neighborhood properties (e.g., textural characteristics and spatial relation to surrounding crops). The proposed network contained two streams: (1) convolution blocks for deep feature extraction and (2) several DAMs, which were employed after each convolution block. The first stream included three multi-scale residual convolution blocks, where the spectral attention blocks were mainly applied to extract deep spectral features. The second stream was built using four multi-scale convolution blocks with a spatial AM. In this study, over 200,000 samples from six different crop types (i.e., alfalfa, broad bean, wheat, barley, canola, and garden) and three non-crop classes (i.e., built-up, barren, and water) were collected to train and validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 98.54% and 0.981, respectively. It also outperformed other state-of-the-art classification methods, including RF, XGBOOST, R-CNN, 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, and CBAM, indicating its high potential to discriminate different crop types. © 2022 by the authors.

In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve atmospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 ± 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals. © 2022 The Authors","France; Aerosols; Benchmarking; Calibration; Mean square error; Optical properties; Optical remote sensing; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Water vapor; Aerosol optical depths; Atmospheric corrections; Copernicu sentinel-2; Intercomparison exercise; Intercomparisons; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Surface reflectance; Uncertainty; Water vapour; AERONET; aerosol; atmospheric correction; calibration; Landsat; performance assessment; radiative transfer; remote sensing; Landsat","Aerosol optical depth; Atmospheric correction; Copernicus Sentinel-2; Intercomparison; Landsat 8; Surface reflectance; Water vapour","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144399947"

Utilizing the near real-time and cloud computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), this process facilitates data acquisition and enables large-scale flood monitoring in an expeditious manner. Two major hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast were evaluated: (1) the 2021 Hurricane Ida to the south of New Orleans, Louisiana and (2) the 2017 Hurricane Harvey to the east of Houston, Texas. We devised a change detection and thresholding framework using multi-temporal SAR imagery and validated the results with flood extent maps derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. We demonstrate that constant threshold values for flood extraction from SAR change detection indices are not ubiquitously suitable for all geographies, thus we outline a heuristic that can be used to select thresholds suitable for specific sites through a fully automated sensitivity analysis. The results indicated high agreement between the SAR and optical imagery (77&#x2013;80%), with SAR providing the benefit of under-cloud detection. Furthermore, our results contribute to scaling the SAR approach to produce rapid and accurate information for decision-makers and emergency responders during time-sensitive flood events.

Despite the widespread use of remote sensing data in estimating SOC variation, the predictive power of single-date and multi-temporal as well as the individual and combined effects of radar and optical images have rarely been investigated. This study created six two-month interval composite layers including VH and VV polarizations of Sentinel-1 (S1), spectral bands of Sentinel-2 (S2), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), slope and altitude for the target year of 2019–2020 to estimate the SOC variation. Based on 80 soil samples (0–20 cm) taken in a field survey from northern Iran, random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) were calibrated to estimate the SOC content. All models were fine-tuned using grid search and evaluated using spatial cross-validation. The results showed that multi-temporal data were more predictive than single-date data, and SVR outperformed the RF algorithm. SVR model using the multi-temporal S2 achieved the highest R2 and RMSE values of 57.59% and 0.94%, respectively. Feature selection has shown no benefit of adding S1 data and identified band-2 (green), band-3 (red), and band-10 (shortwave infrared) of S2 imagery as the most explanatory variables of SOC variation. The results of this study highlight the potential of freely available high-resolution S2 for mapping SOC variation using the SVR model. SVR is particularly suggested in small sample size studies, an issue which is dominant in soil studies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Iran; estimation method; inorganic carbon; NDVI; organic carbon; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Optic-radar imagery; SOC estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124223847"

For this, multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Polarimetric (PolSAR) Sentinel-1 imagery and multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data were jointly used. We applied the Cloude–Pottier polarimetric decomposition on PolSAR data to compute 23 polarimetric indicators and extracted vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 time-series to generate a big feature space of 818 features. In order to assess the relevance of the different features for the crop mapping task, we run a number of scenarios using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The model that was trained using only the polarimetric data demonstrates a very promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy over 82%. A genetic algorithm was also implemented as a feature selection method for deriving an optimal feature subset. To showcase the positive effect of using polarimetric data over areas suffering from cloud coverage, we contaminated the original Sentinel-2 time-series with simulated cloud masks. By incorporating the genetic algorithm, we derived a high informative feature subset of 120 optical and polarimetric features, as the corresponding classification model increased the overall accuracy by 5% compared to the model trained only with Sentinel-2 features. The feature importance analysis indicated that apart from the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, several polarimetric parameters, such as Shannon entropy, second eigenvalue and normalised Shannon entropy are of high value in identifying crops. In summary, the findings of our study highlight the significant contribution of Sentinel-1 PolSAR data in crop classification in areas with frequent cloud coverage and the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in discovering the most informative features. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feature Selection; Food supply; Optical remote sensing; Polarimeters; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Cloud cover; Common agricultural policy; Crop classification; Crop type mappings; Features selection; Polarimetric data; Radar polarimetry; Sentinel-1; Times series; Vegetation index; Genetic algorithms","cloud cover; common agricultural policy; crop type mapping; feature selection; genetic algorithm; radar polarimetry; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142677999"

Mugo Turra) is an important component of the alpine treeline ecotone and fulfills numerous ecosystem functions. To understand and quantify the impacts of increasing logging activities and climatic changes in the European Alps, accurate information on the occurrence and distribution of mountain pine stands is needed. While Earth observation provides up-to-date information on land cover, space-borne mapping of mountain pines is challenging as different coniferous species are spectrally similar, and small-structured patches may remain undetected due to the sensor’s spatial resolution. This study uses multi-temporal optical imagery from PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) and combines them with additional features (e.g., textural statistics (homogeneity, contrast, entropy, spatial mean and spatial variance) from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), topographic features (elevation, slope and aspect) and canopy height information) to overcome the present challenges in mapping mountain pine stands. Specifically, we assessed the influence of spatial resolution and feature space composition including the GLCM window size for textural features. The study site is covering the Sarntal Alps, Italy, a region known for large stands of mountain pine. Our results show that mountain pines can be accurately mapped (PlanetScope (90.96%) and Sentinel-2 (90.65%)) by combining all features. In general, Sentinel-2 can achieve comparable results to PlanetScope independent of the feature set composition, despite the lower spatial resolution. In particular, the inclusion of textural features improved the accuracy by +8% (PlanetScope) and +3% (Sentinel-2), whereas accuracy improvements of topographic features and canopy height were low. The derived map of mountain pines in the Sarntal Alps supports local forest management to monitor and assess recent and ongoing anthropogenic and climatic changes at the treeline. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of freely available Sentinel-2 data and image-derived textural features to accurately map mountain pines in Alpine environments. © 2022 by the authors.

Most co-seismic landslide mapping is primarily achieved via field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly over large areas. This paper proposed an automated co-seismic landslide mapping approach, which has three main advantages compared to state-of-the-art methods. First, it removes the dependence on the manual labeling for training samples through an unsupervised change detection process. Second, the approach takes the lead in introducing multi-scale extended morphological profiles to comprehensively describe the characteristics of various landslides induced by earthquake. Third, it is also the first attempt to employ ensemble strategy in landslide identification, which integrates the advantages of different machine learning-based classifiers, further improving the accuracy of recognition. Three experiments were carried out through multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images acquired in China and Haiti. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach compared to other methods, providing an effective solution for complicated co-seismic landslide mapping task in the future. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this context, remote sensing data provide valuable information on crops. This study investigates the relationship between the variables determined from both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images and crop height. For this purpose, backscatter (σVH, σVV, σVH / σVV) and coherence (ϒVH, ϒVV) of multi-temporal dual-polarized Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data are analyzed. Two indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVI with the red-edge band (NDVIred), are interpreted to identify the contribution of the red-edge band over the near-infrared band. The Zile District of Tokat province in Turkey where dominantly sunflower cultivation is carried out, was selected as the study area. In the analysis of the data, Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used. In the results of the study, ANN showed the lowest RMSE = 3.083 cm (RMSE%= 11.284) in the stem elongation period. The CNN followed the lowest RMSE for the Inflorescence development and flowering stages 19.223 cm (RMSE%=15.458) and 8.731 cm (RMSE%=5.821), respectively. In the ripening period, XGBoost achieved the lowest RMSE = 8.731 cm (RMSE%=6.091). All the best models in four methods were created using common variables of σVH, σVV, ϒVH, ϒVV and NDVIred, except ANN which exclude coherence variables. The results concluded that NDVIred contributed more than NDVI which is widely interpreted in previous studies. © 2022 COSPAR","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Geometrical optics; Infrared devices; Optical remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Convolutional neural network; Crop height; Edge bands; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; Multiple linear regressions; Normalized difference vegetation index; Red edge; Simple linear regression; Sunflower; Multiple linear regression","Artificial Neural Network; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Height; EXtreme Gradient Boosting; Multiple Linear Regression; Sunflower","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145334294"

Besides, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) studies the shoreline shift rate analysis. Multi-temporal satellite images have revealed accretion and erosion patterns in the areas of concern. Landsat images with different periods were geometrically and radiometrically corrected, then classified through assigning 8 different classes for the quantitative coastline delineation analysis from 1987 to 2019: (Landsat 5–TM, Thematic Mapper (TM)), Landsat7 ETM+, worldview 2, and Sentinel 2). To detect both land use and land cover change (LULCC) and shoreline growth, a maximum controlled classification tool is used. The DSAS was used to measure the coastal changing rate as a powerful statistical analysis tool, and thus to predict the behavior of the coastal shift over a long time. DSAS used two separate methods: EPR and LRR. The results concluded that, primarily as a consequence of unregulated landfill practices before tourist facilities, Hurghada's coastal region experienced an average accretion rate of 1.38 m/y. Moreover, the El-Gouna study revealed drastic modifications because of the development of its coastal zone's closed inland lagoons. Finally, the creation of the decision matrix reveals the evolution of the shorelines in the three last decades and the statistical projection for the three next decades.

Within the ESA-MOST Dragon 4 project, we addressed in particular changes of glaciers and proglacial lakes and their interaction. In ad-dition, we investigated rock glaciers in permafrost environments. Here, we focus on the detailed investigations which have been performed in the Poiqu River Basin, central Himalaya. We used in particular multi-temporal stereo satellite imagery, including high-resolution 1960/70s Corona and Hexagon spy images and contemporary Pleiades data. Sentinel-2 data was applied to assess the glacier flow. The results reveal that glacier mass loss continuously increased with a mass budget of −0.42 ± 0.11 m w.e.a−1 for the period 2004–2018. The mass loss has been primarily driven by an increase in summer temperature and is further accelerated by proglacial lakes, which have become abundant. The glacial lake area more than doubled between 1964 and 2017. The termini of glaciers that flow into lakes moved on average twice as fast as glaciers terminating on land, indicating that dynamical thinning plays an important role. Rock glaciers are abundant, covering approximately 21 km2, which was more than 10% of the glacier area (approximately 190 km2 ) in 2015.

However, mountain rice is limited by the complex terrain, and its distribution is fragmented. Therefore, it is necessary to fully use the abundant spatial, temporal, and spectral information of remote sensing imagery. This study extracted 22 classification features from Sentinel-2 imagery (spectral features, texture features, terrain features, and a custom spectral-spatial feature). A feature selection method based on the optimal extraction period of features (OPFSM) was constructed, and a multitemporal feature combination (MC) was generated based on the separability of different vegetation types in different periods. Finally, the extraction accuracy of MC for mountain rice was explored using Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and ExtraTrees (ET) machine learning algorithms. The results show that MC improved the overall accuracy (OA) by 3–6% when compared to the feature combinations in each rice growth stage, and by 7–14% when compared to the original images. MC based on the ET classifier (MC-ET) performed the best for rice extraction, with the OA of 86%, Kappa coefficient of 0.81, and F1 score of 0.95 for rice. The study demonstrated that OPFSM could be used as a reference for selecting multitemporal features, and the MC-ET classification scheme has high application potential for mountain rice extraction. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Feature Selection; Image enhancement; Landforms; Learning algorithms; Remote sensing; Textures; Extra-trees; Feature combination; Features selection; Machine-learning; Mountain rice; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal feature combination; Overall accuracies; Sentinel-2; Separability; Extraction","feature selection; machine learning; mountain rice; multitemporal feature combination; Sentinel-2; separability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140754333"

They prevent the development of water and wind erosion. Over the recent decades, the rates of PFPs development in Russia have decreased many times over as compared to the middle of the last century. At the same time, due to natural and anthropogenic factors, the existing PFPs are subject to large-scale degradation processes, while there is a lack of information about their current state. Land cover type information products and forest monitoring systems cover only a part of the PFPs. Protective forest belts with a width of 10–20 m are reflected very fragmentarily on the existing global and national satellite maps of forests. The well-known approaches to the mapping of PFPs are based on expert interpretation of Earth remote sensing (ERS) data of ultra-high spatial resolution or ground-based surveys using GPS receivers. Such methods are time consuming and cannot be applied over large areas. The paper proposes a new approach for mapping PFPs based on multi-season satellite ERS data using the BSFI (Bi-Season Forest Index). The index is calculated as the normalized difference between the minimum NDVI value for the vegetation period and the maximum albedo determined in winter when there is snow cover on the earth’s surface. Pixels with positive values of this index can be attributed to the areas covered with tree vegetation. We have compared the PFP area with the results of expert interpretation of detailed satellite images and widely used information products of satellite land cover mapping. The PFP area was identified on the basis of the BSFI using satellite imagery data obtained by the Sentinel-2 toolbox. The comparative analysis showed a close connection between the results obtained using the Sentinel-2 data and the estimates of the PFP area based on expert interpretation of detailed satellite images. The connection was characterized by a correlation coefficient R = 0.99. The analysis also allowed establishing the value of accuracy of forest identification based on this index at the level of 91 %. The relative error in identifying field-protective forest belts in the 50 m zone around the field boundaries was 9 %. The proposed approach is recommended for mapping PFPs in sparsely forested regions, where it is possible to obtain satellite images of the earth’s surface with snow cover. © 2022 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

This study comprehensively evaluated the performances of multiple factors for mapping shrub coverage across the Xilin Gol grassland based on the spectral and temporal signatures of Sentinel-2 imagery, and for the first time produced a large-scale shrub coverage mapping result in this region. Considering the regional differences and gradients in the types and sizes of shrub in the study area, the study area was divided into three subregions based on precipitation data, i.e., west, middle and east regions. The shrub coverage estimation accuracy from dry-and wet-year data, different types of vegetation indices (VIs) and multiple regression methods were compared in each subregion, and the key phenological periods were selected. We also compared the accuracy of four mapping strategies, which were pairwise combinations of zoning (i.e., subregions divided by precipitation) and non-zoning, and full time series of VIs and key phenological period. Results show that the mapping accuracy in a dry year (2017) is higher than that in a wet year (2018). The optimal VIs and key phenological periods show high spatial variability. In terms of mapping strategies, the accuracy of zoning is higher than that of non-zoning. The root mean square error (RMSE), overall accuracy (OA) and recall for ‘zoning + full time series (or + key phenological period)’ strategy were 0.052 (0.055), 76.4% (79.7%) and 91.7% (94.6%), respectively, while for ‘non-zoning + full time series (or + key phenological period)’ strategy were 0.057 (0.060), 75.5% (74.6%) and 91.7% (88.6%), respectively. The mapping using VIs in key phenological periods is better than that of using full time series in the low-value prediction of shrub cover. Based on the strategy of ‘zoning + key phenological period’, the shrub coverage map of the whole region was generated with a RMSE of 0.055, OA of 80% and recall of 95%.

Multi-temporal remote sensing is widely used for the phenological study of crops, especially in sugarcane and cassava. The development of crop growth monitoring is one of the capabilities of multi-temporal data. This study integrated the phenological characteristics from remote sensing data to develop the optimal classifier for the reliable classification of sugarcane and cassava. Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from October 2017 to September 2019 were used to classify the crop types. The random forest (RF) classifier provided the highest overall model performance accuracy than other algorithms when using the specific NDVI dataset. Furthermore, the ground truth data collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field survey was used to assess the classification performance and resulted in 68% accuracy for sugarcane and cassava classification. Multi-temporal remote sensing can aid in the mapping of sugarcane and cassava. The developed approach can be used for crop mapping, management, and estimation of crop production on a regional scale. Expectedly, our development could be practically adopted on a multi-crop plantation scale. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Cassava; Classification; Crop phenology; Multi-temporal; Sugarcane","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144024910"

The epicenter is located in the middle section of Qilian-Haiyuan fault in the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which is a seismic gap. It is of great significance to study this earthquake for understanding the tectonic deformation mechanism, strain release process and seismic hazards of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Methods: Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) is used to obtain the coseismic deformation along the line of sight (LOS) of the Menyuan earthquake from Sentinel-1 satellite images. The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation are used to obtain the EW coseismic deformation from the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Based on the coseismic deformation field derived from InSAR interferograms, we invert the slip distribution. Results: The LOS deformation fields showed that the Menyuan earthquake caused a surface rupture of about 20 km long and the maximum LOS displacement was 0.75 m. The maximum EW displacement derived from optical images was 2.5 m. The slip distribution model showed that the Menyuan earthquake was dominated by a sinistral strike-slip. The coseismic slip is concentrated at a depth of 0-10 km. The maximum slip was 3.25 m at a depth of 4.89 km and the rake angle was 10.44°. The estimated total seismic moment is 1.07×1019 N·m, corresponding to a magnitude of Mw 6.6. Conclusions: According to the results from aftershock relocation, field investigation and tectonic background, we infer that the seismogenic fault is the Lenglongling fault and the eastern segment of Tuolaishan fault is also ruptured. The stress on the eastern segment of the Lenglongling fault and the western segment of the Tuolaishan fault is enhanced, implying that there is the possibility of strong earthquakes in this region in the future. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

Its usage, however, is limited by cloud contamination, which results in low-quality images or missing values. Selecting cloud-free scenes or combining multi-temporal images to produce a cloud-free composite image can partially overcome this problem at the cost of the monitoring frequency. Predicting the spectral values of cloudy areas based on the spectral characteristics is a possible solution; however, this is not appropriate for water because it changes rapidly. Reconstructing cloud-covered water areas using historical water-distribution data has good performance, but such methods are typically only suitable for lakes and reservoirs, not over vast and complex terrain. This paper proposes a category-based approach to reconstruct the water distribution in cloud-contaminated images using a spatiotemporal dependence model. The proposed method predicts the class label (water or land) of a cloudy pixel based on the neighboring pixel labels and those at the same position in images acquired on other dates according to historical spatiotemporal water-distribution data. The method was evaluated through eight experiments in different study regions using Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The results demonstrated that the proposed method could yield high-quality cloud-free classification maps and provide good water-extraction accuracy and consistency in most hydrological conditions, with an overall accuracy of up to 98%. The accuracy and practicality of the method render it promising for applications across a wide range of future research and monitoring efforts. © 2021 The Authors","image analysis; image resolution; Landsat; mapping method; monitoring system; performance assessment; pixel; reconstruction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water","Cloud contamination; Remotely sensed optical images; Spatiotemporal dependence model; Water body mapping; Water map reconstruction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121745326"

It is necessary to grasp the dynamic change information of river suspended solids concentration in time for inland water quality monitoring and water environment management. This paper is based on field measured spectra and suspended matter concentration data, the band combination reflectance that is highly correlated with the concentration of suspended solids is selected as the independent variable. The remote sensing inversion model of suspended solids concentration is constructed based on CatBoost, random forest, and multiple linear regression algorithms. In order to determine the optimal parameter configuration for the models, the grid search method with cross-validation is used for hyperparameter tuning of two machine learning models, i.e., CatBoost and Random Forest, respectively. And the inversion accuracy of different models is compared to determine the optimal model. Based on the optimal model, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI remote sensing images from 2019 to 2020 are used to invert suspended matter concentrations in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River and analyse their spatial and temporal variation characteristics. The results indicate that: ① b4/b3, (b6-b3)/(b6+b3), (b4+b8)/b3, (1/b3-1/b4)×b5 are the best band combination reflectance for MSI inversion of TSM concentrations in the lower Minjiang River; ② Compared with the other two models, the suspended matter concentrations inversion model based on CatBoost algorithm with hyperparameter optimized has the highest accuracy, with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.95, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.32 mg/L and 19.68%, respectively; ③ The distribution of suspended matter concentrations in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River from 2019 to 2020 is ""low in the west and high in the east"", with a rising trend from Baisha to the mouth of the Langqi inlet; ④ The suspended matter concentration is highest in summer, followed by winter and autumn, and lowest in spring.

It can improve the quality of air, absorb and reduce carbon dioxide and alleviate urban heat islands. Previous studies that employ multi-spectral imagery have already evaluated different classification algorithms to identify tree species. But often the researches were conducted on small areas and a single image scene. In this study, the study area (Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) covered by 73.95% forests, of which approximately 18000 km2. Based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud computing platform, combined multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery with topography information, three machine learning classifiers, including Regression Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, were used to obtain nine tree species 10m meters of mapping products. An overall accuracy of 81.4% (a Cohen's kappa of 78.5%) was obtained for nine tree species classes. The addition of multi-temporal images improved the OA (over all accuracy) by 8.01%∼12.40%, and Kappa by 8.91%∼12.96%. After combining the terrain features, OA is improved by 9.39%∼14.72%, and Kappa by 10.95%∼18.19%. Obtaining high-quality cloud-free images is difficult for the cloudy and rainy southwest of China, so the composites of multi-temporal images and the combination of other morphoclimatic characteristics are of great significance for large-scale tree species classification. © 2021 IEEE.","Adaptive boosting; Carbon dioxide; Classification (of information); Engines; Forestry; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Random forests; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Topography; Area-based; Ecological environments; Google earth engine; Google earths; Machine-learning; Mountainous area; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Tree species; Urban heat island; Decision trees","Google Earth Engine; Machine Learning; Multi-temporal; Tree species","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132414616"

However, databases of landslide events are often spatially biased towards roads or other infrastructure, with few reported in remote areas. In this study, we demonstrate how Google Earth Engine can be used to create multi-temporal change detection image composites with freely available Sentinel-1 and-2 satellite images, in order to improve landslide visibility and facilitate landslide detection. First, multispectral Sentinel-2 images were used to map landslides triggered by a summer rainstorm in Jølster (Norway), based on changes in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between pre-and post-event images. Pre-and post-event multi-temporal images were then created by reducing across all available images within one month before and after the landslide events, from which final change detection image composites were produced. We used the mean of backscatter intensity in co-(VV) and cross-polarisations (VH) for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and maximum NDVI for Sentinel-2. The NDVI-based mapping increased the number of registered events from 14 to 120, while spatial bias was decreased, from 100% of events located within 500 m of a road to 30% close to roads in the new inventory. Of the 120 landslides, 43% were also detectable in the multi-temporal SAR image composite in VV polarisation, while only the east-facing landslides were clearly visible in VH. Noise, from clouds and agriculture in Sentinel-2, and speckle in Sentinel-1, was reduced using the multi-temporal composite approaches, improving landslide visibility without compromising spatial resolution. Our results indicate that manual or automated landslide detection could be significantly improved with multi-temporal image composites using freely available earth observation images and Google Earth Engine, with valuable potential for improving spatial bias in landslide inventories. Using the multi-temporal satellite image composites, we observed significant improvements in landslide visibility in Jølster, compared with conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, and applied this for the first time using VV-polarised SAR data. The GEE scripts allow this procedure to be quickly repeated in new areas, which can be helpful for reducing spatial bias in landslide databases. © 2022 by the authors.

Although open-satellite-based earth observation data in a spatially high resolution (i.e., Sentinel-2, ≤10 m) can cover some information needs, spatially very highresolution imagery (i.e., aerial imagery, ≤2 m) is needed to generate maps at a scale suitable for regional and local applications. In this study, we present the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) framework to stratify forests (needleleaf, broadleaved, non-forest) in Luxembourg. The framework is exclusively based on open data and free and open-source geospatial software. Although aerial imagery is used to derive image objects with a 0.05 ha minimum size, Sentinel-2 scenes of 2020 are the basis for random forest classifications in different single-date and multi-temporal feature setups. These setups are compared with each other and used to evaluate the framework against classifications based on features derived from aerial imagery. The highest overall accuracies (89.3%) have been achieved with classification on a Sentinel-2-based vegetation index time series (n = 8). Similar accuracies have been achieved with classification based on two (88.9%) or three (89.1%) Sentinel-2 scenes in the greening phase of broadleaved forests. A classification based on color infrared aerial imagery and derived texture measures only achieved an accuracy of 74.5%. The integration of the texture measures into the Sentinel-2-based classification did not improve its accuracy. Our results indicate that high resolution image objects can successfully be stratified based on lower spatial resolution Sentinel-2 single-date and multi-temporal features, and that those setups outperform classifications based on aerial imagery only. The conceptual framework of spatially high-resolution image objects enriched with features from lower resolution imagery facilitates the delivery of frequent and reliable updates due to higher spectral and temporal resolution. The framework additionally holds the potential to derive additional information layers (i.e., forest disturbance) as derivatives of the features attached to the image objects, thus providing up-to-date information on the state of observed forests. © 2022 by the authors.

In regression-based cloud removal, the selection of an appropriate regression model and the impact analysis of the input images significantly affect the prediction performance. This study evaluates the potential of Gaussian process (GP) regression for cloud removal and also analyzes the effects of cloud-free optical images and spectral bands on prediction performance. Unlike other machine learning-based regression models, GP regression provides uncertainty information and automatically optimizes hyperparameters. An experiment using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images was conducted for cloud removal in the two agricultural regions. The prediction performance of GP regression was compared with that of random forest (RF) regression. Various combinations of input images and multi-spectral bands were considered for quantitative evaluations. The experimental results showed that using multi-temporal images with multi-spectral bands as inputs achieved the best prediction accuracy. Highly correlated adjacent multi-spectral bands and temporally correlated multi-temporal images resulted in an improved prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of GP regression was significantly improved in predicting the near-infrared band compared to that of RF regression. Estimating the distribution function of input data in GP regression could reflect the variations in the considered spectral band with a broader range. In particular, GP regression was superior to RF regression for reproducing structural patterns at both sites in terms of structural similarity. In addition, uncertainty information provided by GP regression showed a reasonable similarity to prediction errors for some sub-areas, indicating that uncertainty estimates may be used to measure the prediction result quality. These findings suggest that GP regression could be beneficial for cloud removal and optical image reconstruction. In addition, the impact analysis results of the input images provide guidelines for selecting optimal images for regression-based cloud removal. © 2022 The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.","","Cloud removal; Gaussian process; Image reconstruction; Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138014797"

To capture both slow and fast changes, the investigations focused on the analysis of trends in NDVI time series, selected because they are extensively used for the assessment of post-fire dynamics mainly linked to the monitoring of vegetation recovery and fire resilience. The area considered for this study is the central–southern part of the Italian peninsula, in particular the regions of (i) Campania, (ii) Basilicata, (iii) Calabria, (iv) Toscana, (v) Umbria, and (vi) Lazio. For each fire considered, the study covered the period from the year after the event to the present. The multi-temporal analysis was performed using two main data processing steps (i) linear regression to extract NDVI trends and enhance changes over time and (ii) random forest classification to capture and categorize the various changes. The analysis allowed us to identify changes occurred in the selected case study areas and to understand and evaluate the trend indicators that mark a change in land use/land cover. In particular, different types of changes were identified: (i) woodland felling, (ii) remaking of paths and roads, and (ii) transition from wooded area to cultivated field.

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users. © 2022 by the authors.

Global forests are under increasing pressure from climate change, resource extraction, and anthropologically-driven disturbances. The results are dramatic losses of habitats accompanied with the reduction of species diversity. There is the urgent need for forest biodiversity monitoring comprising analysis on (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.) scale to identify hotspots of biodiversity. Remote sensing enables large-scale monitoring at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Concepts of remotely sensed spectral diversity have been identified as promising methodologies for the consistent and multi-temporal analysis of forest biodiversity. This review provides a first time focus on the three spectral diversity concepts “vegetation indices”, “spectral information content”, and “spectral species” for forest biodiversity monitoring based on airborne and spaceborne remote sensing. In addition, the reviewed articles are analyzed regarding the spatiotemporal distribution, remote sensing sensors, temporal scales and thematic foci. We identify multispectral sensors as primary data source which underlines the focus on optical diversity as a proxy for forest biodiversity. Moreover, there is a general conceptual focus on the analysis of spectral information content. In recent years, the spectral species concept has raised attention and has been applied to Sentinel-2 and MODIS data for the analysis from local spectral species to global spectral communities. Novel remote sensing processing capacities and the provision of complementary remote sensing data sets offer great potentials for large-scale biodiversity monitoring in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Monitoring; Optical remote sensing; Alpha diversity; Beta diversities; Forest; Gamma diversity; Optical diversity; Optical-; Remote-sensing; Satellite data; Spectral diversity; Spectral variation; Spectral variation hypothesis; Biodiversity","alpha diversity; beta diversity; biodiversity; forest; gamma diversity; optical diversity; remote sensing; satellite data; spectral diversity; spectral variation hypothesis","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141817805"

These tasks are well-suited for machine learning algorithms, however, the creation of large scale annotated satellite imagery datasets with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution is expensive. In this paper, we explore utilizing spatiotemporal self-supervised learning which leverages the natural chronology of the data collection to train generalizable feature extractors for various downstream tasks.

As well, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were used. The NDVI products obtained from these three sensors were validated and compared with land cover and land use map of the same area for visual interpretation. The main results of this study showed that the NDVI in the mid-2010 was low within area-of-the interests in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant, but the vegetated area continued to expand until 2021. It can be interpreted as a result of a decrease in human activities. In particular, the map of differences between the mid-2010 and 2021 of high-resolution images revealed detailed spatial features rather than those of the mid-resolution images. In disaster areas where access is restricted, such as the areas around the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and where it is difficult to collect field data, obtaining classification products with high accuracy using satellite images is challenging.

In Europe, member states of the European Union collect geospatial data in the framework of the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS) for agricultural management and subsidizing farmers. These data can be exploited as training datasets of machine learning classifiers for crop-type mapping applications. However, the way the LPIS data are being generated, concerning primarily errors in the farmers' declarations in terms of crop-type labels, exact geometries, etc, constrains their direct use in such classification frameworks. In this study, we present and assess a methodology for filtering LPIS data based on geometric and spectral criteria in order to build a trustworthy training dataset for machine learning crop-type classifiers. A new nomenclature was developed, oriented towards the spectral discrimination of crop-type classes and sub-classes in Greece. The filtering methodology was applied at national scale for the agricultural year of 2019 and resulted in the selection of a sub-set of the LPIS parcels that were assessed as the most suitable and reliable to represent the different levels of the nomenclature. The developed filtering procedure was validated against actual crop-type labels derived from field visits, while the resulted filtered data were successfully utilized on various crop-type mapping experiments in Greece.  © Authors 2022","Classification (of information); Information management; Machine learning; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Terminology; Time series analysis; Case-studies; Common agricultural policy; Crop monitoring; Crop type mappings; Land parcels; Multi-temporal analysis; Sentinel-2; Spectral profile; Times series; Training dataset; Crops","Common Agricultural Policy; Multitemporal Analysis; Sentinel-2; Spectral Profiles; Time Series","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131912268"

During the 5th of June 2015, an earthquake of 5.9 Richter scale hit the heart of Mount Kinabalu, Sabah. The tremors caused the surrounding area to be affected largely to the population that is located near the river stream site. This study maps the land cover in Kota Belud following the earthquake that occurred in 2015 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imagery (year 2014) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery data (2020). It was reported as one of the locations that severely impacted by the earthquake. Maximum likelihood algorithm was used to generate the map of land cover change of Kota Belud year 2014 and year 2020. Nine (9) classes of land cover were identified in the study area consisting of primary forest, secondary forest, shrubland, paddy, rubber plantation, bare rock, bare soil, built up, and river. The result obtained shows the most affected area is the river area, Sungai Panataran, that flow through Melangkap from Mount Kinabalu. Other land cover type also shows changes but mostly due to deforestation and agricultural activities. In conclusion, mapping the Kota Belud area using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) is useful for monitoring the landscape change of the site due to the vulnerability to natural disaster such as flood and earthquake.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Land use planning; monitoring; remote sensing; supervised classification","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134160784"

In recent decades, due to the combined effects of intensive human activities in sectors, such as industry, agriculture, aquaculture, and urbanization, the pattern of coastal wetland system and the suitable habitat for red-crowned cranes have changed dramatically. Therefore, the spatio-temporal variation pattern of coastal wetland system must be identified, and its key impact factors must be explored to protect the coastal wetland and conserve its biodiversity. Currently, research on land cover changes in the Yancheng coastal wetland is insufficient for species habitat monitoring. Thus, further study on the suitable habitat for red-crowned cranes in a long-term and large regional scale is warranted.In this study, multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data, such as Landsat TM/OLI data during 1989 to 2019 and Sentinel-2 data in 2019, were used to analyze the features of spatio-temporal variation in the Yancheng coastal wetland. First, the classification system and image interpretation symbols of the study area were established to draw the maps of classification and transfer distribution in six periods from 1989 to 2019. Then, the structural and functional connectivity of the suitable habitat for red-crowned cranes were evaluated on the basis of the species diffusion ability. Finally, the key ecological nodes for the overwintering of red-crowned cranes were evaluated.Results show that the eco-environment of natural wetland has degraded rapidly, with an area loss of 49.46%. Contrastingly, the artificial wetland increased by 69.24%, which was mainly realized by occupying the natural wetland and reclaiming the tidal flat. The center of reclamation tended to migrate from north to south and from coastal land to sea. The area of seepweed saltmarsh and alkaline land as suitable habitat decreased by 489.10 km², with a proportion decreased from 19.88% in 1989 to 4.36% in 2019. As for structural connectivity, our results reveal that the connectance index of suitable habitat patches decreased from 1.83 to 1.30, showing a downward trend. The distance between the patches increased and the fragmentation intensified. Concurrently, the estimations of functional connectivity index demonstrate that the integral and probability indexes of connectivity in 2019 are less than 0.01. The functional connectivity decreased, and the connection network was generally broken with only a small part of the connection network with high betweenness centrality index. They exist in the core area of UNESCO natural heritage site and the Tiaozini region. They are also the key ecological nodes for the habitat of red-crowned cranes.In summary, the connectivity of the suitable habitat for red-crowned cranes has decreased sharply because of land cover changes in the UNESCO natural heritage site-Yancheng coastal wetland in the past 30 years. However, the habitat for red-crowned cranes has been greatly improved since the core area has reverted aquaculture pond and cultivated land to natural wetland in 2014. In addition to enhancing the scientific conservation of the existing suitable habitat, such as the core area of UNESCO natural heritage site and Tiaozini region, the key ecological nodes in the natural wetland should be restored to improve the connectivity among the habitat patches. © 2021, Science Press.

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an $F1$ score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Media streaming; Remote sensing; Satellites; Urban growth; Change detection; Deep learning; Features extraction; Multispectral satellite image; Remote-sensing; Shape; Spatial pyramid pooling; Spatial pyramids; Streaming medium; multispectral image; Sentinel; Feature extraction","Change detection (CD); deep learning; multi-spectral satellite images; spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127087143"

These maps also allow us to assess the evolution of land cover and to quantify changes over time (such as urban sprawl), which is essential for having a precise understanding of a given territory. Few studies have combined information from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, but merging radar and optical imagery has been shown to have several benefits for a range of study cases, such as semantic segmentation or classification. For this study, we used a newly produced dataset, MultiSenGE, which provides a set of multitemporal and multimodal patches over the Grand-Est region in France. To merge these data, we propose a CNN approach based on spatio-temporal and spatio-spectral feature fusion, ConvLSTM+Inception-S1S2. We used a U-Net base model and ConvLSTM extractor for spatio-temporal features and an inception module for the spatio-spectral features extractor. The results show that describing an overrepresented class is preferable to map urban fabrics (UF). Furthermore, the addition of an Inception module on a date allowing the extraction of spatio-spectral features improves the classification results.

The information of vegetation type on the water-land ecotone is important for detecting the health of the wetland, and its protection. Seasonal flooding is a key factor in controlling the environment in water-land ecotone. Even preventing direct detection of the flooded vegetation with satellites, seasonal flooding has effects on the distribution of plants, which may provide potential information on vegetation classification with satellites. Therefore, the study induces flooding index in vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with satellites. We applied Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map vegetation in the Dongting Lake with random forest method. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to obtain the flooding index (i.e. inundation frequency), and Sentinel-2 images were applied to acquire the optical characteristic of vegetation. A comparative experiment based on whether the flooding index was added or not during vegetation mapping in the Dongting Lake was carried out to explore the role of flooding index in vegetation mapping. The results concluded that (1) seasonal flooding will hinder vegetation mapping using a single phase of optical information; (2) the classification accuracy of single phase scenario was significantly improved with the aid of flooding index especially in wet season; (3) the classification accuracy can be somewhat improved by adding flooding index for the multi-temporal scenario. The study implies that inundation frequency information can be used for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone, especially for complex regions with insufficient cloud-free satellite images. © 2022 The Author(s)","China; Dongting Lake; Hunan; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Floods; Image classification; Lakes; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Dongting lake; Flooding index; Floodings; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1 & 2 image; Single phasis; Vegetation classification; Vegetation mapping; Water-land ecotone; ecotone; flooding; Sentinel; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; Vegetation mapping","Dongting Lake; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1 & 2 images; Vegetation classification; Water-land ecotone","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138135447"

Monitoring vine growth and vineyard conditions can improve the precision of input deliveries and help predict crop productivity and quality trends. Covering vineyard with plastic sheets to protect foliage and grapes from adverse climatic conditions is an increasingly common practice, especially in table grape plantings. Detection by remote sensing of vineyards covered by plastic sheets is currently a challenging issue given the intrinsic nature of plastic covers that are expected to heavily impact reflectance from the underlying vegetation. Plastic sheets are expected to affect the radiative transfer process from vegetation to sensor, introducing new approximations. They can change both signal transmission and absorption, and possibly generate artifacts in reflection due to their close-to-specular reflecting behavior. In this context, when trying to measure features of the underlying vegetation by remote sensing, a multi-temporal approach is mandatory. This study was conducted in Apulia (South Italy) with a focus on table grape vineyards covered with polyethylene sheets. Air temperature and shoot growth, were monitored during the 2016 season. Fourteen suitable Copernicus Sentinel 2 (Level 2A product) images were used to investigate if vine phenology can be similarly described with and without plastic covers. A time series of S2 Level 2A images were used, and the correspondent NDVI maps generated. The spectral signal was analyzed by comparing responses of two vineyards covered with different plastic sheets with two uncovered ones. Three tests were performed, including a comparison of data obtained from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index version 2 (MSAVI2) spectral indices. All the results demonstrated that no significant limitations were introduced by plastic sheets while monitoring the spectral behavior of covered vineyards. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

Multi-temporal analysis of multispectral images and derived vegetation indices are becoming a useful tool to detect forestry vegetation types. However, the use of multi-temporal images is a time-consuming activity for searching and downloading data and need a huge amount of storage space and workstations with high computing performance. To solve the problem, in this paper, it is proposed the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as cloud platform for geospatial analysis, which allows visualization and processing of RS. The paper is articulated in three sections and presents the first results of an ongoing research, on the use of GEE to analyze Sentinel-2 images and derived vegetation indices time-series to compute a supervised classification in order to map forestry vegetation types. In the first section an introduction about RS and supervised and unsupervised classification methods to map forestry vegetation is given.

The detection stage is based on the definition of a residual sequence calculated from the novelty filter. A statistical approach based on the NFA test is then employed to detect significant changes. We then use these detections to classify the changes according to their nature: unique or lasting.

High-resolution radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images have the potential to investigate soil spatial distribution information over a large area, although Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data have rarely been combined to map either SOC or STN content. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to map both SOC and STN content in the southern part of Central Europe using digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, and evaluated the potential of different remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) to predict SOC and STN content. Four machine-learners including random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), support vector machine (SVM) and Bagged CART were used to construct predictive models of SOC and STN contents based on 179 soil samples and different combinations of environmental covariates. The performance of these models was evaluated based on a 10-fold cross-validation method by three statistical indicators. Overall, the BRT model performed better than RF, SVM and Bagged CART, and these models yielded similar spatial distribution patterns of SOC and STN. Our results showed that multi-source sensor methods provided more accurate predictions of SOC and STN contents than individual sensors. The application of radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images proved useful for predicting SOC and STN. A combination of Sentinel-1/2-derived predictors and DEM derivatives yielded the highest prediction accuracy. The prediction accuracy changed with and without the Sentinel-1/2-derived predictors, with the R2 for estimating both SOC and STN content using the BRT model increasing by 12.8% and 18.8%, respectively. Topographic variables were the main explanatory variables for SOC and STN predictions, where elevation was assigned as the variable with the most importance by the models. The results of this study illustrate the potential of free high-resolution radar Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 data as input when developing SOC and STN prediction models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision trees; E-learning; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Organic carbon; Radar; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Spatial distribution; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; nitrogen; organic carbon; 10-fold cross-validation; Applied machine learning; Boosted regression trees; Digital elevation model; High resolution radar; Remote sensing sensors; Spatial distribution patterns; Statistical indicators; algorithm; computer simulation; digital elevation model; machine learning; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil organic matter; algorithm; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; covariance; cross validation; data analysis; digital imaging; environmental factor; Europe; intermethod comparison; machine learning; measurement accuracy; multispectral imaging; prediction; priority journal; random forest; regression analysis; remote sensing; soil analysis; soil chemistry; statistical model; statistical parameters; support vector machine; topography; Learning systems","Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Soil total nitrogen","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084262550"

Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was used for the detection of flood prone area to calibrate HEC-RAS, due to the lack of data validation in the New Cairo City, Egypt. The thresholding water detection method was applied to two Sentinel-1 images, one pre- and one post-flash flood event from April 24 to 27, 2018. The threshold method was used to detect water areas from SAR Sentinel-1 images. Feature statistical agreement F1 and F2 values ranged from 73.4 to 77.7% between water areas extracted based on backscattering values between 19.97 and 16.53 in decibels (dB) and reference water areas obtained using an optical image of the Sentinel-2 satellite. The similarity between simulated HEC-RAS two-dimensional (2D) of water areas and reference water areas based on SAR data ranged between 74.2 and 89.7% using feature statistical agreement values F1 and F2. It provides a clear suggestion that, in the absence of field observations, SAR data can be used to calibrate the model. Two flood hazard maps created based on water velocity and depth were obtained from HEC-RAS 2D simulation. The obtained maps indicated that 11% of the roads and 50% of the buildings in New Cairo City are exposed to high hazard areas. Furthermore, 28% of the bare land is situated in a very high vulnerability area. We recommend the use of obtained hazard map in supporting emergency response, and designing effective emergency plans. © 2021 The Authors.

The crop growth cycle profiles were extracted from the multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) datasets. Results show that by 2020, the area of single cropping, double cropping, and triple cropping in the Henan Province are 52,236.9 km2, 74,334.1 km2, and 1927.1 km2, respectively; the corresponding producer accuracies are 86.12%, 93.72%, and 91.41%, respectively; the corresponding user accuracies are 88.99%, 92.29%, and 71.26%, respectively. The overall accuracy is 90.95%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.81. Using the sown area in the statistical yearbook data of cities in the Henan Province to verify the extraction results of this paper, the R2 is 0.9717, and the root mean square error is 1715.9 km2 .

Although different time-series spatial resolution satellite images have provided opportunities for tropical forests classification, the complexity and diversity of vegetation types still pose challenges, especially for distinguishing different vegetation types. In this paper, we proposed a Spectro-Temporal Feature Selection (STFS) method based on the Weighted Separation Index (WSI) using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for mapping tropical forests in Jianfengling area, Hainan Province. The results showed that the tropical forests were classified with an overall accuracy of 93% and an F1 measure of 0.92 with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. As our results also revealed, the WSI based STFS method could be efficient in tropical forests classification by using a fewer feature subset compared with Variable Selection Using Random Forest (14 features and all 40 features, respectively) to achieve the same accuracy. The analysis also showed it was not advisable to only pursue a higher WSI value while ignoring the heterogeneity and diversity of features. This study demonstrated that the WSI can provide a new feature selection method for multi-temporal remote sensing image classification. © 2021 by the authors.

Stem pests of coniferous plantations quickly took a dominant position, increasing the area of their cells in 5 years by 7.7 times leading to high ecological and economic losses. The available diagnosis of damage to pine trees by visual signs is ineffective. The exponential increase of bark beetle infestation hinders the implementation of costly field campaigns to prevent and mitigate its effects. Remote sensing may help to overcome such limitations as it provides frequent and spatially continuous data on vegetation condition. Using Sentinel-2 images as main input, two models have been developed to test the ability of this data source to test the ability of this data source to monitor the condition and damage of forests by bark beetle. The first approach was based on the selection (segmentation) of the affected areas using the method of automatic object recognition on satellite images, which is based on the pixel-oriented approach and artificial neural networks. And the second was based on the construction of a time trend of vegetation and forest moisture using cloud computing algorithms of Google Earth Engine.

The study area chosen is the Cameroon Estuary. This area represents a major ecological transition in the sub-region with the presence of protected natural reserves (mangroves, dense forest, wetlands) but also a strong anthropic activity (construction, agriculture, degraded forest). The methodological approach consisted of a chain of pre-processing and visual image analysis, followed by a combination of the bands from each sensor, a supervised Random Forest classification to draft a land use map and finally a digitization of the coastline. Overall, the results show that the classification with the Sentinel2 images using 10 bands and adding 4 vegetation indices is slightly more accurate (95.75 %) than the classification with the 13 initial bands (91.78 %). The classification performed with the Sentinel-1A multi-temporal image series (dual polarization (VV, VH) and VV/VH ratio) leads to an accuracy of 78.44 %. The combination of Sentinel-2 A&B bands (10 bands and 4 indices) and Sentinel-1 improves the results and leads to an accuracy of 98.76 %. Our results also show that the use of multi-temporal image time series significantly improves the classification accuracy compared to the use of a single image (mono-date), and this for both sensors, i.e. an additional gain of 13 % and 10 % respectively for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. However, this gain remains small for temporally stable classes. The results of the coastline evolution analysis show that the Cameroon estuary is disturbed by different levels of erosion (Cape Cameroon, North Manoka Island, Sanaga River mouth), and accretion (Limbe, and South Manoka Island) and also by weak internal variations. The fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data in the discrimination of land use classes, has shown that the construction zones are the most vulnerable to coastal erosion. On the other hand, the presence of vegetation (mangrove, forest) stabilizes and protects the coast from possible risks of this nature. © 2021 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

The study area selected is characterized by a subhumid Mediterranean climate and a very rough topography, making it especially difficult to classify land cover. In addition, it contains a protected area named Jbel Moussa and presents exceptional biological diversity. We have acquired and pre-processed optical and radar satellite images from January 1 to December 31, 2017, to track vegetation cover. Then to produce twelve scenarios, we combined the three satellites. Classification maps illustrate our approach. A total of thirty-six classifications were carried out, based on seven classes: water, building and infrastructure, bare soil, sparse vegetation, grasslands, sparse forest and dense forest. The results showed that the highest overall accuracy was provided for all scenarios by RF (53.03%-93.06%), followed by kNN (49.16%-89.63%), while the lowest classification accuracy was created by SVM (47.86%-86.08%).

Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) time series increase the probability to observe bare soil fields in croplands, and thus, monitor soil properties over large regions. In this regard, this work suggests an automated pixel-based approach to select only pure soil pixels in S2 and L8 time series, and to make a synthetic bare soil image (SBSI). The SBSIs and the soil properties measured in the framework of the European LUCAS survey were used to calibrate SOC, clay, and CaCO3 prediction models. The results highlight a high correlation between laboratory soil spectra and the SBSIs median spectra, especially for the SBSI obtained by a three-year S2 collection, which provides satisfactory results in terms of SOC prediction accuracy (RPD: 1.74). The comparison between S2 and L8 results demonstrated the higher capability of the S2 sensor in terms of SOC prediction accuracy, mainly due to the greater spatial resolution of the bands in the visible region. Whereas, neither S2 nor L8 could accurately predict the clay and CaCO3 content. This is because of the low spectral and spatial resolution of their SWIR bands that prevent the exploitation of the narrow spectral features related to these two soil attributes. The results of this study prove that large S2 time series can estimate and monitor SOC in croplands using an automated pixel-based approach that selects pure soil pixels and retrieves reliable synthetic soil spectra. © 2021 by the author.

Most of the conventional remote sensing software and land cover classification approaches, however, are only designed for single-date observations. To fully utilize the amount of data we receive and to improve land use/land cover mapping (LULC), technological advancements in machine learning, open-source processing, and GPU-accelerated hardware should be utilized. In this paper, a methodology for classification of temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 images was developed using open-source Python libraries. Light Gradient Boosting Machine, a machine learning algorithm that uses tree-based learning, was used to classify different land cover types based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Although the use of powerful machine learning algorithm resulted to more accurate land cover maps, temporal inconsistencies are still pervasive when dealing with time series outputs. To remove these temporal inconsistencies that resulted from misclassifications, temporal land cover filter based on transition probability matrix was applied on the time series land cover maps to modify the illogical land cover transitions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of the approach, which produced higher overall accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Image classification; Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM); Multivariate alteration detection (MAD); Sentinel 2 image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110027736"

On a broader scale, they are therefore one of the most important facilitators of the Digital Earth. However, the data quality and availability are not spatially and temporally homogeneous due to effects related to cloudiness, the position on the Earth or the acquisition plan. The spatio-temporal inhomogeneity of the underlying data may therefore affect any big remote sensing analysis and is important to consider. This study presents an assessment of the metadata for all accessible Sentinel-2 Level-1C scenes acquired in 2017, enabling the spatio-temporal coverage and availability to be quantified, including scene availability and cloudiness. Spatial exploratory analysis of the global, multi-temporal metadata also reveals that higher acquisition frequencies do not necessarily yield more cloud-free scenes and exposes metadata quality issues, e.g. systematically incorrect cloud cover estimation in high, non-vegetated altitudes. The continuously updated datasets and analysis results are accessible as a Web application called EO-Compass.

However, it is difficult to evaluate and monitor solely on the basis of field measurements. Remote sensing technologies can greatly contribute to the faster extraction and mapping of vegetation health status indicators, on the basis of which agronomy and forestry experts can draw conclusions about the condition of urban vegetation in larger areas. A new remote sensing‐based urban forest and vegetation cover monitoring framework is presented and applied to a case study of the city of Zagreb, Croatia. In this study, Sentinel‐2 multi‐temporal imagery was used to derive and analyze the current state of urban forest cover. Vegetation indices (NDVI, RVI, and GRVI) were calculated. K‐means unsupervised classification of the vegetation indices was con-ducted. In this way, the dimensionality of the vegetation indices was reduced, while all the data contained in it were used to represent their graded values. Vegetation that was in a poor condition stood out better that way. Finally, PCA‐based change detection was performed on the vegetation indices graded values, and a map of change was produced.

Consequently, the timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice extent and its productivity assessment is of utmost significance. In turn, this requires continuous area monitoring and large scale mapping, at the parcel level, through the processing of big satellite data of high spatial resolution. This work designs and implements a paddy rice mapping pipeline in South Korea that is based on a time-series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for the year of 2018. There are two challenges that we address; the first one is the ability of our model to manage big satellite data and scale for a nationwide application. The second one is the algorithm’s capacity to cope with scarce labeled data to train supervised machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we implement an approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning. First, we generate pseudo-labels for rice classification from a single site (Seosan-Dangjin) by using a dynamic k-means clustering approach. The pseudo-labels are then used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier that is fine-tuned to generalize in two other sites (Haenam and Cheorwon). The optimized model was then tested against 40 labeled plots, evenly distributed across the country. The paddy rice mapping pipeline is scalable as it has been deployed in a High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) environment using distributed implementations for both k-means and RF classifiers. When tested across the country, our model provided an overall accuracy of 96.69% and a kappa coefficient 0.87. Even more, the accurate paddy rice area mapping was returned early in the year (late July), which is key for timely decision-making. Finally, the performance of the generalized paddy rice classification model, when applied in the sites of Haenam and Cheorwon, was compared to the performance of two equivalent models that were trained with locally sampled labels. The results were comparable and highlighted the success of the model’s generalization and its applicability to other regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Advancements of remote sensing techniques have provided excellent tools for such purposes, reducing the required amount of time and labor, yet with high accuracy and the information richness. Sentinel-2 is one of the relatively new satellite missions, whose 13 spectral bands and short revisit time proved to be very useful when it comes to forest monitoring. In this study, the novel spatio-temporal classification framework for mapping woody vegetation from Sentinel-2 multitemporal data has been proposed. The used framework is based on the probability random forest classification, where temporal information is explicitly defined in the model. Because of this, several predictions are made for each pixel of the study area, which allow for specific spatio-temporal aggregation to be performed. The proposed methodology has been successfully applied for mapping eight potential forest and shrubby vegetation types over the study area of Serbia. Several spatio-temporal aggregation approaches have been tested, divided into two main groups: pixel-based and neighborhood-based. The validation metrics show that determining the most common vegetation type classes in the neighborhood of 5 × 5 pixels provides the best results. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient obtained from five-fold cross validation of the results are 82.97% and 0.75, respectively. The corresponding producer’s accuracies range from 36.74% to 97.99% and user’s accuracies range from 46.31% to 98.43%. The proposed methodology proved to be applicable for mapping woody vegetation in Serbia and shows a potential to be implemented in other areas as well. Further testing is necessary to confirm such assumptions. © 2020 by the authors.

Here, we utilized time-series Sentinel-2 images to map seagrass percentage cover at intra-annual basis in two years’ time frame based on empirical method, while also compared maximum likelihood and random forest classifier to map dominant benthic cover type and determined seagrass spatial extent. We found that random forest classifier outperformed maximum likelihood classifier. Furthermore, a pattern of seagrass percentage cover change was present.

Timely detection of newly infested trees is important for minimizing economic losses and effectively planning forest management activities to stop or at least slow outbreaks. With the advancement of Copernicus services, a pair of Sentinel-2 satellites provides a unique remote sensing data source of multi-temporal observations in high spatial resolution on the scale of individual forest stands (although not allowing for individual tree detection). This study investigates the potential for using seasonal trajectories of Sentinel-2 bands and selected vegetation indices in early detection of bark beetle infestation (so–called green-attack stage detection) in Norway spruce monoculture forests in the Czech Republic. Spectral trajectories of nine bands and six vegetation indices were constructed for the 2018 vegetation season using 14 satellite observations from April to November to distinguish four infestation classes. We used a random forest algorithm to classify healthy (i.e., stands not infested) and infested trees with various trajectories of decay. The seasonal trajectories of vegetation indices separated the infestation classes better than did the individual bands. Among the most promising vegetation indices we identified the tasselled cap wetness (TCW) component and normalized difference index constructed from near and shortwave infrared bands. Analysing the inter-annual change of the indices was more promising for early detection than is single-date classification. It achieved 96% classification accuracy on day of year 291 for the tested data set. The algorithm for early detection of tree infestation based on the assessment of seasonal changes in TCW was applied on the time series of Sentinel-2 observations from 2019 and its outputs were verified using field observations of forest conditions conducted on 80 spruce forest plots (located in spruce monoculture stands). The overall accuracy of 78% was achieved for the separation of healthy and green-attack classes. Our study highlights the great potential of multi-temporal remote sensing and the use of shortwave infrared wavelengths for early detection of spruce forest decline caused by bark beetle infestation. © 2021 The Authors","Central Europe; Coleoptera; Ips typographus; Picea abies; Satellites; Scolytinae; beetle; coniferous forest; detection method; remote sensing; Sentinel; time series analysis","Bark beetle; Green attack; Ips typographus; Norway spruce; Sentinel-2; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109770208"

Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data for the period from October-2018 to March-2019 was analysed in this study. The major objective of this study was to generate crop growth profiles of different crops and identify the relationships between crop phenology and crop growth stages by generating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles of wheat and mustard crops. The results of spectral behavior of wheat (normal & late sown) and mustard during active growth stages indicated that these winter crops have distinct spectral signatures in Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The NDVI growth profiles of wheat and mustard indicate the temporal variations during different growth stages of these crops. The maximum temporal variations were observed during early growth stages to flowering & grain filling stages. The difference in sowing dates of wheat and mustard crops result in different phenological stages of these winter crops. The NDVI curve of Rabi Season-2018-19 was divided into different phenological growth phases namely, i) Phase-I: G0 (Spectral emergence) to G1(Flag leaf emergence), Phase-II: G1 (Flag leaf emergence) to Gmax (Flowering and Grain filling), Phase-III: Gmax (Flowering and Grain filling) to G2 (Dough Stage) and Phase-IV: G2 (Dough Stage) to G3 (Physiological Maturity). The temporal changes in the NDVI was analysed by computing the Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) between different phenological phases from G0 to G3. Mean TNPI values of wheat crop for different phenological phases were computed which indicated that rising part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G0 to Gmax higher TNPI values whereas the declining part of NDVI profile of growth phases from Gmax to G3 showed lower TNPI values. The difference NDVI images were generated using the NDVI images of two different phenological phases of wheat crop which represent the temporal changes in wheat crop greenness, where “0” represents no temporal change and “1” represents the maximum temporal change in vegetation greenness across wheat crop areas in the study area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","Normalized Difference VVegetation II IIndex (NDVI); Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data; Temporal NDVI profile; Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093655104"

Sentinel-1&2 satellites provide frequent acquisitions to track water surface dynamics, proxy variables to enable water surface volume monitoring. How do we combine such observations along time for each sensor? What advantages and disadvantages of single-date, monthly or time-windowed estimations? In this context, we analysed the impact of merging information through different types and lengths of time-windows. Satellite observations were processed separately on optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) water detectors at 10 m resolution. The analysis has been applied at two scales. First, validating with 26 large scenes (110 × 110 km) in different climatic zones in France, time-windows yielded an improvement on radar detection (F1-score improved from 0.72 to 0.8 for 30 days on average logic) while optical performances remained stable (F1-score 0.89). Second, validating reservoir area estimations with 29 instrumented reservoirs (20–1250 ha), time-windows presented in all cases an improvement on both optical and radar error for any window length (5–30 days). The mean relative absolute error in optical area detection improved from 16.9% on single measurements to 12.9% using 15 days time-windows, and from 22.15% to 15.1% in radar detection). Regarding reservoir filling rates, we identified an increased negative bias for both sensors when the reservoir is nearly full. This work helped to compare accuracies of separate optical and radar capabilities, where optical statistically outperforms radar at both local and large scale to the detriment of less frequent measurements. Furthermore, we propose a geomorphological indicator of reservoirs to predict the quality of radar area monitoring (R2 = 0.58). In conclusion, we suggest the use of time-windows on operational water mapping or reservoir monitoring systems, using 10–20 days time-windows with average logic, providing more frequent and faster information to water managers in periods of crisis (e.g., water shortage) compared to monthly estimations. © 2021 by the authors.

Although the techniques offer cost and time effectiveness, the lack of consistency of inputted images can cause issues in successfully performing accurate multi-temporal mapping with minimum effort. This research aimed to assess the consistency of Sentinel-2 images for benthic habitat mapping in the waters of Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. We employed two approaches: 1) assessing the consistency of Sentinel-2 image used to map four classes of benthic habitat from 2017 to 2019 and 2) an in-depth analysis of three images in May 2019 to assess the consistency of four-class benthic habitat mapping (coral reef, seagrass, macroalgae and bare substratum). This research incorporated atmospheric, sunglint and water column corrections and four classification algorithms: Isodata, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Maximum Likelihood. The consistency of Sentinel-2 images was assessed using overall accuracy (OA), agreement percentage (AP) and total classification performance (TCP). Our results indicate that Sentinel-2 images are reliable enough for accurate benthic habitat mapping with OA >80% and consistent with agreement >80% in both approaches given the right image conditions, which are minimum cloud cover, haze, and sunglint. These factors strongly contribute to the consistency of the resulting benthic habitat classification from the Sentinel-2 images. Also, to maximize the rich image availability in the Sentinel-2 archive database, we suggest selecting images with minimal atmospheric and sunglint disturbances instead of performing image corrections that may introduce noise, leading to lower accuracy and consistency. Finally, we encourage the use of Sentinel-2 images in benthic habitat monitoring since the long-term plan of the Sentinel-2 mission guarantees the availability of these datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Accuracy assessment; Benthic habitat; Image consistency; Mapping; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108892337"

In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016–2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single-date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8-OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (~30–50%) when compared to the single-date images (~20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions.

However, in-season crop mapping over a large area is still challenging due to the insufficiency of ground truth in the early stage of a growing season. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient machine-learning workflow for the rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans fields without ground truth data for the current year. We use trusted pixels, a set of pixels that are predicted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data with high confidence in the current year's crop type, to label training samples on multi-temporal satellite images for crop type classification. The entire mapping process only involves a limited number of satellite images acquired within the growing season (normally 3–4 images per scene) and no field data needs to be collected. According to the investigation on 12 states of the U.S. Corn Belt, it is found that a considerable number of trusted pixels can be identified from the historical CDL data by the trusted pixel prediction model based on artificial neural network. According to the experiment on 49 Landsat-8 scenes and 31 Sentinel-2 tiles, the in-season maps of corn and soybeans are expected to reach 85%–95% agreement with CDL as well as field data by mid-July. Once the in-season satellite imagery becomes available, the crop cover map can be rapidly created even with limited computational resources. This study provides a new perspective and detailed guidance for rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans, which can be potentially applied to identify more diverse crop types and scaled up to the entire United States. © 2021","Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; land use change; Landsat; machine learning; maize; pixel; satellite data; Sentinel; soybean; vegetation mapping","Crop mapping; Cropland Data Layer; Land use and land cover; Landsat; Machine learning; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115787824"

Here, we present new deep learning algorithms and a multi-source data fusion driven flood inundation mapping approach by leveraging a large-scale publicly available Sen1Flood11 dataset consisting of roughly 4831 labelled Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery gathered from flood events worldwide in recent years.

This study aims to map the rice cultivated areas and give an estimate for the expected yield (ton/ha) using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study was carried out in an experimental site in the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate with a total area of 3240 ha. The multi-temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from nine Sentinel-2 imagery cover the whole summer season. The supervised nearest neighborhood object-based classification method was employed, resulting in a classification map with an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. Yield prediction was carried out by using an empirical yield prediction model using the NDVI and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). The LAI was calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and then validated against the measured LAI. the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MPAE) was calculated to estimate the error between the measured and predicted LAI and yield. The MPAE was found to be ±6.76% (i.e. ±0.28 m2/m2) with a high correlation between the measured and the calculated LAI with a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.94). While for the yield, the MPAE was found to be ±6.53% (i.e. ±0.66 ton/ha) and R2 of 0.95.

This is due to various factors. One factor which can influence land cover changes is coastline changes. The coastline and land cover influence each other. Coastline is a very important area in Indonesia which is a country consisted of many islands. The sea area in Indonesia is larger than the land area. That makes reliable information about the coastline is crucial for determining the boundary between the land and sea and the management of marine resources. Regarding land cover changes, coastline monitoring is required to observe the dynamics of land cover change in coastal areas. Through satellite remote sensing, land cover and coastline change can be monitored. The use of satellite imagery for monitoring land cover and coastline change is highly recommended because data collected through remote sensing using satellite provides more dynamic and near real-time data compared to data collected through an on-site observation. This study aimed to monitor land cover amendment due to coastline change in 1994-2018. Monitoring was carried out using Landsat satellites which had an acquisition period of those years. To obtain more detailed data, monitoring was also carried out using the Sentinel-2 satellite which had a greater spatial resolution than Landsat satellites. The result showed that there are three coastline changes phenomena happened i.e., erosion, accretion, and anthropogenic. The major changes occurred due to accretion. During 1994 to 2018, the pond class was the largest class among all of the land cover classes. The second largest class was the urban area class, and the smallest class was the vegetation class. © 2021. RIGEO.

In Europe, the Copernicus Program offers numerous territorial monitoring tools to users and decision makers, such as Sentinel data. This research aims at developing and implementing a land cover mapping and change detection methodology through the classification of Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. The goal is to create a versatile and economically sustainable algorithm capable of rapidly processing large amounts of data, allowing the creation of national-scale products with high spatial resolution and update frequency for operational purposes. Great attention was paid to compatibility with the main activities planned in the near future at the national and European level. In this sense, a land cover classification system con-sistent with the European specifications of the EAGLE group has been adopted. The methodology involves the definition of distinct sets of decision rules for each of the land cover macro-classes and for the land cover change classes. The classification refers to pixels’ spectral and backscatter charac-teristics, exploiting the main multi-temporal indices while proposing two new ones: the NDCI to distinguish between broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, and the Burned Index (BI) to identify burned areas. This activity allowed for the production of a land cover map for 2018 and the change detection related to forest disturbances and land consumption for 2017–2018, reaching an overall accuracy of 83%. © 2021 by the authors.

Previous studies to detect CPIS using deep learning used single-date optical images, containing limitations due to seasonal changes and cloud cover. Therefore, this research aimed to detect CPIS using Sentinel-2 multitemporal images (containing six dates) and instance segmentation, considering seasonal variations and different proportions of cloudy images, generalizing the models to detect CPIS in diverse situations. We used a novel augmentation strategy, in which, for each iteration, six images were randomly selected from the time series (from a total of 11 dates) in random order. We evaluated the Mask-RCNN model with the ResNext-101 backbone considering the COCO metrics on six testing sets with different ratios of cloudless (< 20\%) and cloudy images (>75\%), from six cloudless images and zero cloudy images (6:0) up to one cloudless image and five cloudy images (1:5). We found that using six cloudless images provided the best metrics [80% average precision (AP), 93% AP with a 0.5 intersection over union threshold (AP50)]. However, results were similar (74% AP, 88% AP50) even in extreme scenarios with abundant cloud presence (1:5 ratio). Our method provides a more adaptive and automatic way to map CPIS from time series, significantly reducing interference such as cloud cover, atmospheric effects, shadow, missing data, and lack of contrast with the surrounding vegetation.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Brazil; Deep learning; Geometrical optics; Irrigation; Iterative methods; Time series; Atmospheric effects; Automatic Detection; Center pivot irrigation systems; Different proportions; Multi-temporal image; Optical image; Seasonal changes; Seasonal variation; cloud cover; detection method; irrigation system; machine learning; seasonal variation; segmentation; Sentinel; time series; Image segmentation","Cloud; deep learning; mask R-CNN; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114801519"

Remote sensing techniques have long been important means of forest monitoring with their ability to quickly and efficiently collect the spatial-temporal variability of vegetation. Vegetation classification is a key issue for forest monitoring and is critical to many remote sensing applications in the domain of precision forestry such as vegetation area estimation. Remote sensing applications in vegetation classification have traditionally focused on the use of optical data such as MODIS. However, due to cloud and haze interference, optical images are not always available at phenological stages that are essential to vegetation identification, making it difficult to construct complete time-series vegetation growth and limiting the vegetation classification accuracy. Unlike passive visible and infrared wavelengths which are sensitive to cloud and light, active SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is particularly attractive for vegetation classification due to its all-weather, all-day imaging capabilities. In addition, SAR provides information on the stem and leaf structures of vegetation and is sensitive to soil roughness and moisture content, making it effective in forest applications. In this study, a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method employing multi-temporal SAR data is presented for forest vegetation classification in the Taibai Mountain (the main peak of Qinling Mountains). Firstly, Sentinel-2 optical images and digital elevation data in the study area were used for multi-scale segmentation to produce a precise farmland map. Then pre-processed SAR intensity images were overlaid with the farmland map to construct time-series vegetation growth for each parcel. Finally, a deep-learning-based classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was employed to learn time-series features of vegetation and to classify parcels to produce a final classification map. The experimental results show that: (1) Compared with traditional machine learning methods (such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), the classification accuracy of the deep-learning-based method proposed in this paper was improved by more than 10%; (2) Among different combinations of Sentinel-1A polarizations, VV+VH performed best, having a similar accuracy with the VV+VH+VV/VH; (3) Time-series classification using all images in the whole year achieved the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 82% using VV+ VH. The study shows that the combination LSTM network and time-series Sentinel-1A data can effectively improve the accuracy of vegetation classification and provide new ideas for forest vegetation classification from the perspectives of data source and classification method. © 2020, Science Press.

(steadily supported by the Hellenic Agricultural Organization—Demeter) towards offering precision farming services to rice growers. Within this framework, a new methodology for topdressing nitrogen prediction was developed based on machine learning. Nitrogen is a key element in rice culture and its rational management can increase productivity, reduce costs, and prevent environmental impacts. A multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale dataset was collected, including optical and radar imagery, soil data, and yield maps by monitoring a 110 ha pilot rice farm in Thessaloniki Plain, Greece, for four consecutive years. RapidEye imagery underwent image segmentation to delineate management zones (ancillary, visual interpretation of unmanned aerial system scenes was employed, too); Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery was modelled with Computer Vision to detect inundated fields and (through this) indicate the exact growth stage of the crop; and Sentinel-2 image data were used to map leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) exactly before topdressing applications. Several machine learning algorithms were configured to predict yield for various nitrogen levels, with the XGBoost model resulting in the highest accuracy. Finally, yield curves were used to select the nitrogen dose maximizing yield, which was thus recommended to the grower. Inundation mapping proved to be critical in the prediction process. Currently, Ecodevelopment S.A. is expanding the application of the new method in different study areas, with a view to further empower its generality and operationality. © 2021 by the authors.

An effective prediction method is necessary for food security. In this study, we extract the optimal vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to stripe rust at different time-periods, and develop a wheat stripe rust prediction model with satellite images to realize the multi-temporal prediction. First, VIs related to stripe rust stress are extracted as candidate features for disease prediction from time series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the optimal VI combinations are selected using sequential forward selection (SFS). Finally, the occurrence of wheat stripe rust in different time-periods is predicted using the support vector machine (SVM) method. The results of the features selected demonstrate that, before the jointing period, the optimal VIs are related to the biomass, pigment, and moisture of wheat. After the jointing period, the red-edge VIs related to the crop health status play important roles. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the prediction model, which is based on SVM, is generally higher than those of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The SVM method is more suitable for time series predictions of wheat stripe rust. The model obtained accuracy based on the optimal VI combinations and the SVM increased over time; the highest accuracy was 86.2%.

Understanding the effectiveness of different temporal and spectral features in detailed crop classification can help users optimize temporal window selection and spectral feature space construction in crop type mapping applications. Therefore, in this study, we used time-series Sentinel-2 image data from Yi'an County, Heilongjiang province, China, to analyze the effectiveness of the temporal and spectral features used in three common machine learning classification methods: classification and regression tree (CART) decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). For CART and SVM classifiers, the relative importance of the features was reflected by the order and frequency of attributes selected as the node and the square of the model weight. In RF, the change in prediction error as calculated by out of bag data is taken as the measure of feature importance. The standard deviation of the average value of all labeled pixels was used to evaluate the correctness of the unanimous conclusions drawn by these three methodologies. The quantitative evaluation results given by the confusion matrix show that random forest achieved the best overall accuracy, while support vector machine ranked second, and the decision tree algorithm yielded the least accurate classification results. From the perspective of feature importance, making full use of the discriminative information between different crops, and constructing a rational feature space, can help to improve classification accuracy significantly. In detail, the discriminative information between the different crop types is as follows: 1) images at the peak of the crop growth period are crucial in the classification of different crops; 2) the short-wave infrared bands are particularly suitable for fine crop classification; and 3) the red edge bands can effectively assist classification. Finally, our study achieved crop type mapping in the study area with an overall accuracy of 97.85% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.95. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Heilongjiang; Agricultural robots; Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Infrared radiation; Photomapping; Random forests; Support vector regression; Classification accuracy; Classification and regression tree; Classification results; Decision-tree algorithm; Machine learning classification; Quantitative evaluation; Short wave infrared bands; Spatial distribution patterns; agricultural application; crop plant; machine learning; mapping method; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial distribution; spectral analysis; time series; Support vector machines","Crop type mapping; Feature selection; Machine learning; Random forest; Sentinel-2; Short-wave infrared; Support vector machine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088010589"

The best way to detect changes is to compare images, obtained at the end of the last century from the Landsat/ETM satellite (resolution R = 30 m) and modern Sentinel-2/MSI images (R = 10 m). To identify the effect of differences in the resolution of the compared images on the accuracy of determining changes in the coastline, a graphical simulation of reproducing changes (areas of coastal erosion or sediment accumulation) at the pixel level was performed. Reproduction of changes had been simulated for coastlines, that coincide in the direction of the pixel grid lines and deviate from them at angles of 15°, 30°, 45°, when the coastline is shifted from 10 to 40 m. It has been revealed that it is possible to determine the displacement of the coastline starting from the value of 20 m from multitemporal images with a resolution of 30 and 10 m. For coastlines directed along the pixel grid lines, it is possible to downplay (or exaggerate) the washout (or accumulation) band by 1/2RL + 1/2LS = 20 m. Coastlines that are tilted to the pixel grid may show false changes, especially if the shoreline position is unchanged or the offset is small (10 m). The kind of the distortion strongly depends on the position of the real coastline within the large Landsat pixels. The greatest distortions are characteristic of coastlines that occupy a peripheral position in the cells of the pixel grid. The simulation results should be used when preparing palettes to determine changes from combined multi-temporal images. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Even landslides in remote mountains could have non-negligible impacts on populous regions by blocking large rivers and forming dam-breached mega floods. Usually, there are slope deformations before major landslides occur, and detecting precursors such as slope movement before major landslides is important for preventing possible disasters. In this work, we applied multi-temporal optical remote sensing images (Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2) and an image correlation method to detect subpixel slope deformations of a slope near the town of Mindu in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This slope is located on the right bank of the Jinsha River, span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""g1/480/span&thinsp;km downstream from the famous Baige landslide. We used a DEM-derived aspect to restrain background noise in image correlation results. We found the slope remained stable from November 2015 to November 2018 and moved significantly from November 2018. We used more data to analyse slope movement in 2019 and found retrogressive slope movements with increasingly large deformations near the riverbank. We also analysed spatial-temporal patterns of the slope deformation from October 2018 to February 2020 and found seasonal variations in slope deformations. Only the foot of the slope moved in dry seasons, whereas the entire slope was activated in rainy seasons. Until 24 August 2019, the size of the slope with displacements larger than 3&thinsp;m was similar to that of the Baige landslide. However, the river width at the foot of this slope is much narrower than the river width at the foot of the Baige landslide. We speculate it may continue to slide down and threaten the Jinsha River. Further modelling works should be carried out to check if the imminent landslide could dam the Jinsha River and measures should be taken to mitigate possible dam breach flood disasters.

The method assumes the availability of a pre-Trained LSTM model for a given year and aims to update the corresponding crop type map fora different year considering a small amount of recent reference data. To this end, the proposed approach combines Self-Paced Learning (SPL) and fine-Tuning (FT) techniques. While the SPL technique gradually incorporates samples from crop types that can be classified with high-confidence by the pre-Trained model, the FT strategy adapts the network to those classes having low-confidence accuracy. This condition allows us to reduce the labeled samples required to achieve accurate classification results. The experimental results obtained on three tiles of the Austrian country on TSs of Sentinel 2 data acquired in 2019 and 2020 (considering a model pre-Trained on images of 2018) demonstrate the capability of the LSTM to adapt to TS of images with different temporal and radiometric characteristic with respect to the one used to pre-Train the model, with a relatively small number of training samples.

In this sense, remote sensing products have shown their power to investigate soil properties, but the assessment of its spatial information can be hampered by the presence of other objects than soil. To overcome this issue, soil scientists have been studying spatial patterns from multi-temporal satellite images aiming at at improving soil property maps. In this work, we applied the cubist algorithm to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, organic matter and iron contents, and soil color components) in south-eastern Brazil using multi-temporal (Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) and single-date images (PlanetScope, Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI). We aimed to evaluate the influence of satellite's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on soil mapping. Predictive models were constructed with 120 soil samples and using four (vis-NIR) and six (vis-NIR-SWIR) spectral bands as predictors in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The multi-temporal image obtained from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite (with 10 m pixel size and six spectral bands), showed the best model performances in cross-validation (R2 between 0.48 and 0.78). The PlanetScope image, which has only four bands in the vis-NIR region and spatial resolution of 3 m did not improve model performances, although the R2 values were higher for soil color components (R2 > 0.5). Satellite images in different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution provides slightly different soil property maps which may promote different strategies regarding soil classification and management. However, satellite images should be used with caution, as they provide only surficial information about the soil variability and confirmation with field surveys is required. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Agronomy; Decision making; Image classification; Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil surveys; Cubist; Landsat 8-OLI; Multi-temporal image; Planetscope; Property maps; Sentinel 2-MSI; Soil classification; Soil management; Soil mapping; Soil property; algorithm; image classification; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil classification; soil color; soil organic matter; soil property; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; topsoil; Soils","Cubist; Landsat 8-OLI; Multi-temporal images; PlanetScope; Sentinel 2-MSI; Soil classification; Soil management; Soil mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103422737"

This study first obtained images from the Sentinel-2 satellites for the period 2015–2020 with the objective of applying multi-temporal spectral indices to assess areas burned in wildfires and prescribed fires in the Margalla Hills of Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using those images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which are often used to assess the severity of fires, were calculated for wildfires and prescribed fires. For each satellite image, spectral indices values were extracted for the 5th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th and 95th percentiles of pixels of each burned area. Then, boxplots representing the distribution of these values were plotted for each satellite image to identify whether the regeneration time subsequent to a fire, also known as the burn scar, and the severity of the fire differed between the autumn and summer wildfires, and with prescribed fires. A statistical test revealed no differences for the regeneration time amongst the three categories of fires, but that the severity of summer wildfires was significantly different from that of prescribed fire, and this, for both indices. Second, SAR images were obtained from the Sentinel-1 mission for the same period as that of the optical imagery. A comparison of the response of 34 SAR variables with official data on wildfires and prescribed fires from the Capital Development Authority revealed that the 95th percentile of the Normalized Signal Ratio (NSR p_95) was found to be the best variable to detect fire events, although only 50% of the fires were correctly detected. Nonetheless, when the occurrence of fire events according to the SAR variable NSR p_95 was compared to that from the two spectral indices, the SAR variable was found to correctly identify 95% of fire events. The SAR variable NSR p_95 is thus a suitable alternative to spectral indices to monitor the progress of wildfires and assess their severity when there are limitations to the use of optical images due to cloud coverage or smoke, for instance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, in the arid and semi-arid regions flows occurring on these rivers are an important resource that have to be managed judiciously. The lack of data on magnitudes, timing and frequency of non-perennial river flows constrain sustainable management of their water resources. The availability of moderate resolution satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager) offers an opportunity to monitor the surface water availability specifically changes in surface areas covered with water in pools along these rivers. In this study, we investigated the use of remote sensing data to detect and monitor changes of water surface areas of pools along three non-perennial rivers and one perennial river in the Western Cape, South Africa, from 2016 to 2017, using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. We assessed a range of image pre-processing and image classification techniques to determine the most suitable method for surface water identification and pool area estimation along the selected rivers. The following indices were used; Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Automated Water Extraction Index for shadowed (AWEIsh), non-shadowed regions (AWEInsh), and the Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI). The NDWI computed from Sentinel-2 TOA reflectance datasets was found to be the most suitable index for mapping pools, with an overall accuracy ranging between 60 and 86%. This index was used successfully to establish the variations of surface areas of pools covered with water along the Breede, Nuwejaars, Tankwa and Touws Rivers during the 2016–2017 period. The temporal variations of pool areas could be explained as expected by changes of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Overall, the study demonstrated the feasibility of using moderate resolution datasets to monitor pool changes of areas covered with water in non-perennial rivers, which contributes to improved management of water resources particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

More than 50% of forests in the Czech Republic are seriously threatened by this pest, leading to high ecological and economic losses. The exponential increase of bark beetle infestation hinders the implementation of costly field campaigns to prevent and mitigate its effects. Remote sensing may help to overcome such limitations as it provides frequent and spatially continuous data on vegetation condition. Using Sentinel-2 images as main input, two models have been developed to test the ability of this data source to map bark beetle damage and severity. All models were based on a change detection approach, and required the generation of previous forest mask and dominant species maps. The first damage mapping model was developed for 2019 and 2020, and it was based on bi-temporal regressions in spruce areas to estimate forest vitality and bark beetle damage. A second model was developed for 2020 considering all forest area, but excluding clear-cuts and completely dead areas, in order to map only changes in stands dominated by alive trees. The three products were validated with in situ data. All the maps showed high accuracies (acc > 0.80). Accuracy was higher than 0.95 and F1-score was higher than 0.88 for areas with high severity, with omission errors under 0.09 in all cases. This confirmed the ability of all the models to detect bark beetle attack at the last phases. Areas with no damage or low severity showed more complex results. The no damage category yielded greater commission errors and relative bias (CEs = 0.30–0.42, relB = 0.42–0.51). The similar results obtained for 2020 leaving out clear-cuts and dead trees proved that the proposed methods could be used to help forest managers fight bark beetle pests. These biotic damage products based on Sentinel-2 can be set up for any location to derive regular forest vitality maps and inform of early damage. © 2020 by the authors.

However, for large area operational mapping, partial cloud cover and different image extents can pose challenges. Therefore, methods are needed to assimilate new images in a straightforward way without requiring a total spatial coverage for each new image. This study shows that Bayesian inference applied sequentially has the potential to solve this problem. To test Bayesian inference for tree species classification in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden, field data from the study area of Remningstorp (58°27′18.35″ N, 13°39′8.03″ E) were used. By updating class likelihood with an increasing number of combined Sentinel-2 images, a higher and more stable cross-validated overall accuracy was achieved. Based on a Mahalanobis distance, 23 images were automatically chosen from the period of 2016 to 2018 (from 142 images total). An overall accuracy of 87% (a Cohen's kappa of 78.5%) was obtained for four tree species classes: Betula spp., Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, and Quercus robur. This application of Bayesian inference in a boreo-nemoral forest suggests that it is a practical way to provide a high and stable classification accuracy. The method could be applied where data are not always complete for all areas. Furthermore, the method requires less reference data than if all images were used for classification simultaneously. © 2021 The Authors","Betula; Picea abies; Pinus sylvestris; Quercus robur; Bayesian analysis; image classification; imagery; land cover; maximum likelihood analysis; satellite data; Sentinel; tree","Bayesian; Classification; Land cover; Maximum likelihood; Multi-temporal; Satellite; Sequential","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109888475"

However, due to the geographic heterogeneity, the spectral profiles of the same crop can vary spatially, and thus using the spectral features alone can limit the model performance in mapping crops in large scales. Moreover, it is a challenge for traditional deep learning models to accurately capture the important information from a large number of features. To address these issues, in this study, we developed a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) approach (Geo-CBAM-CNN) for crop classification using time series Sentinel-2 images. Specifically, geographic information of crops was first integrated into an advanced attention module, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to form a Geo-CBAM module which can help mitigate the impacts of geographic heterogeneity and restrain unnecessary information. Then, the developed Geo-CBAM module was embedded into a CNN model to boost the model's attention both spectrally and spatially. The proposed Geo-CBAM-CNN model was validated on four main crops over six counties with different geographic environments in the U.S. Also, it was compared to three other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, including CBAM-CNN, CNN and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that the proposed model achieved the best performance, reaching 97.82% overall accuracy, 96.82% Kappa coefficient and 96.96% Macro-average F1 score. Moreover, the developed Geo-CBAM-CNN model showed strong spatial adaptability, indicating its superior performance in large scale applications. Furthermore, by visualizing the structure of the Geo-CBAM-CNN, we found that the model automatically allocated different weights to the features, and generally, the red-edge features in the middle of the year obtained more attention. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Classification (of information); Convolution; Decision trees; Deep learning; Neural networks; Photomapping; Time series; Attention-based convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network; Crop classification; Crop mapping; Geographic heterogeneity; Geographics; Neural network modelling; Performance; Sentinel-2; Times series; artificial neural network; automation; crop production; heterogeneity; image classification; machine learning; satellite imagery; Sentinel; time series analysis; Crops","Attention-based CNN; Crop classification; Geographic heterogeneity; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102899408"

The available Spanish official cartography is based on photointerpretation which is inaccurate in terms of chestnut forest location and classification. However, remote sensing has recently been proven to be an effective tool for this purpose. Sentinel 2 multi-Temporal classification is recently acquiring importance as a method to classify tree species. This project intends to detect chestnut forests using LiDAR and Sentinel 2 multi-Temporal data and to compare these results with those obtained using the official cartography. It also intends to assess how the use of different phenological stages could improve classification results. The results obtained provide an overall accuracy of 76% when a three-month combination is used: (March, July and September) leaf-off stage, flowering and leaf-on stage. Overlapping of the current map and the official cartography lead to an accuracy and precision increase; highlighting the utility of the presented methodology to acquire knowledge about chestnut forests location. © Authors 2020.

In the maize production system of the Netherlands, an effective establishment of a winter cover crop is important for reducing nitrogen leaching to groundwater. Cover crop establishment after maize cultivation is obliged by law for sandy soils and consequently implemented on nearly all maize fields, but the winter-time vegetative ground cover varies significantly between fields. The objectives of this study are to assess the variability in winter vegetative cover and evaluate to what extent this variability can be explained by the timing of cover crop establishment and weather conditions in two growing seasons (2017–2018). We used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to construct NDVI time series for fields known to be cultivated with maize within the province of Overijssel. We fitted piecewise logistic functions to the time series in order to estimate cover crop sowing date and retrieve the fitted NDVI value for 1 December (NDVIDec). We used NDVIDec to represent the quality of cover crop establishment at the start of the winter season. The Sentinel-2 estimated sowing dates compared reasonably with ground reference data for eight fields (RMSE = 6.6 days). The two analysed years differed considerably, with 2018 being much drier and warmer during summer. This drought resulted in an earlier estimated cover crop sowing date (on average 19 days) and an NDVIDec value that was 0.2 higher than in 2017. Combining both years and all fields, we found that Sentinel-2 retrieved sowing dates could explain 55% of the NDVIDec variability. This corresponded to a positive relationship (R2 = 0.50) between NDVIDec and the cumulative growing degree days (GDD) between sowing date and 1 December until reaching 400 GDD. Based on cumulative GDD derived from two weather stations within Overijssel, we found that on average for the past three decades a sowing date of 19 September (± 7 days) allowed to attain these 400 GDD; this provides support for the current legislation that states that from 2019 onwards a cover crop should be sown before 1 October. To meet this deadline, while simultaneously ascertaining a harvest-ready main crop, in practice implies that undersowing of the cover crop during spring will gain importance. Our results show that Sentinel-2 NDVI time series can assess the effectiveness and timing of cover crop growth for small agricultural fields, and as such has potential to inform regulatory frameworks as well as farmers with actionable information that may help to reduce nitrogen leaching. © 2020 The Authors","Netherlands; Overijssel; Zea mays; alternative agriculture; cover crop; growing season; maize; NDVI; phenology; satellite imagery; Sentinel; sowing; temperature effect; time series analysis; winter","Catch crop; Growing degree days; NDVI time series; Phenological analysis; Sentinel-2; Sowing time; Sustainable agriculture; Temperature","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090458903"

This study analyzes the potential use of multitemporal Sentinel-2 images to detect and control forest cuts in very small pine and eucalyptus plots located in southern Galicia. The proposed approach is based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 NDVI time series in 4231 plots smaller than 3 ha (average 0.46 ha). The methodology allowed us to detect cuts, allocate cut dates and quantify plot areas due to different cutting cycles in an uneven-aged stand. An accuracy of approximately 95% was achieved when the whole plot was cut, with an 81% accuracy for partial cuts. The main difficulty in detecting and dating cuts was related to cloud cover, which affected the multitemporal analysis. In conclusion, the proposed methodology provides an accurate estimation of cutting date and area, helping to improve the monitoring system in sustainable forest certifications to ensure compliance with forest management plans. © 2021, MDPI AG.

However, it is quite challenging to map crops accurately by high-resolution remote sensing images because of the ecological gradient and ecological convergence between crops and non-crops. The purpose of this study is to explore the combining application of high-resolution multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 (S2) optical reflectance images for maize mapping in highly complex and heterogeneous landscapes in the middle reaches of Heihe River, northwest China. We proposed a new two-step method of vegetation extraction and followed by maize extraction, that is, extract the vegetation-covered areas first to reduce the inter-class variance by using a Random Forest (RF) classifier based on S2 data, and then extract the maize distribution in the vegetation area by using another RF classifier based on S1 and/or S2 data. The results demonstrate that the vegetation extraction classifier successfully identified vegetation-covered regions with an overall accuracy above 96% in the study area, and the accuracy of the maize extraction classifier constructed by the combined multi-temporal S1 and S2 images is significantly improved compared with that S1 (alone) or S2 (alone), with an overall accuracy of 87.63%, F1_Score of 0.86, and Kappa coefficient of 0.75. In addition, with the introduction of multi-temporal S1 and/or S2 images in crop growing season, the constructed RF model is more beneficial to maize mapping. © 2021 by the authors.

The vegetation analysis in a region for a particular period of time to process a large amount of data is remaining as a bottleneck and involves a series of timeconsuming steps that delay the output. To overcome this challenge, this study aims to automate the process and estimate the area of sparse and dense vegetation of a certain area of interest and to assess the vegetation dynamics in this region by using the Sentinel-2 data. Python with its opensource libraries are utilized for downloading and processing the satellite data. Mandal (sub-district) level Mean NDVI, area under sparse and dense vegetation are estimated at the peak vegetative growth stage in Rabi season (February) from 2017 to 2020. In the assessment of satellite data, it was observed that the Godavari delta region has shown a decrease in the sparse vegetative area (11094 ha.) and an increase in dense vegetation area (3272 ha.) in 2018 as compared with 2019 assessment. However, in the Krishna delta region, it was observed that the sparse vegetation area was decreased (90600 ha) and an increased dense area (161915 ha.) in 2020 as compared with 2017. The process involves downloading Sentinel-2 data using SentinelHub and SentinelSat API, pre-processing and segmenting NDVI images to classify vegetation areas and the calculation of Mandal (sub-district) level statistics. © 2020 IEEE.","Data handling; High level languages; Image analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series analysis; Area of interest; Automated techniques; Level statistics; Open-source libraries; Remote sensing images; Vegetation analysis; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetative growth; Vegetation","K-means clustering; multi-spectral remote sensing image processing; multi-temporal vegetation analysis; NDVI; Python process automation; sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099564462"

At present, the concept and delineation of urban boundaries do not follow a unified method or standard. However, many scholars have made use of multi-source remote sensing images of various scales and social auxiliary data such as point of interest (POI) data to achieve large-scale, high-resolution, and high-precision land cover mapping and impermeable water surface mapping. The accuracy of small-and medium-scale urban boundary mapping has not been improved to an obvious extent. This study uses multi-temporal Sentinel-2 high-resolution images and POI data that can reflect detailed features of human activities to extract multi-dimensional features and use random forests and mathematical morphology to map the urban boundaries of the city of Zhengzhou. The research results show that: (1) the urban construction land extraction model established with multi-dimensional features has a great improvement in accuracy; (2) when the training sample accounts for 65% of the sample data set, the urban construction land extraction model has the highest accuracy, reaching 96.25%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.93; (3) the optimized boundary of structural elements with a size of 13 × 13 is selected, which is in good agreement in terms of scope and location with the boundary of FROM-GLC10 (Zhengzhou) and visual interpretations.

The only recent available country-wide LC map of Iran was generated in 2016 by the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with a considerably low accuracy. Therefore, the production of an up-to-date and accurate Iran-wide LC map using the most recent remote sensing, machine learning, and big data processing algorithms is required. Moreover, it is important to develop an efficient method for automatic LC generation for various time periods without the need to collect additional ground truth data from this immense country. Therefore, this study was conducted to fulfill two objectives. First, an improved Iranian LC map with 13 LC classes and a spatial resolution of 10 m was produced using multi-temporal synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets applied to an object-based Random forest (RF) algorithm. For this purpose, 2,869 Sentinel-1 and 11,994 Sentinel-2 scenes acquired in 2017 were processed and classified within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform allowing big geospatial data analysis. The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (KC) of the final Iran-wide LC map for 2017 was 95.6% and 0.95, respectively, indicating the considerable potential of the proposed big data processing method. Second, an efficient automatic method was developed based on Sentinel-2 images to migrate ground truth samples from a reference year to automatically generate an LC map for any target year. The OA and KC for the LC map produced for the target year 2019 were 91.35% and 0.91, respectively, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method for automatic LC mapping. Based on the obtained accuracies, this method can potentially be applied to other regions of interest for LC mapping without the need for ground truth data from the target year. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The study was conducted during nine months when Israel experienced massive pyro-terrorism attacks of more than 1100 fires from the Gaza Strip. The current project strives at developing and using an advanced Earth observation approach for accurate post-fire spatial and temporal assessment shortly after the event ends while eliminating the influence of biomass burning smoke on the ground signal. For fulfilling this goal, the Aerosol-Free Vegetation Index (AFRI), which has a meaningful advantage in penetrating an opaque atmosphere influenced by biomass burning smoke, was used. On top of it, under clear sky conditions, the AFRI closely resembles the widely used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and it retains the same level of index values under smoke. The relative differenced AFRI (RdAFRI) set of algorithms was implemented at the same procedure commonly used with the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdBRN). The algorithm was applied to 24 Sentinel-2 Level-2A images throughout the study period. While validating with ground observations, the RdAFRI-based algorithms produced an overall accuracy of 90%. Furthermore, the RdAFRI maps were smoother than the equivalent RdNBR, with noise levels two orders of magnitude lower than the latter. Consequently, applying the RdAFRI, it is possible to distinguish among four severity categories. However, due to different cloud cover on the two consecutive dates, an automatic determination of a threshold level was not possible. Therefore, two threshold levels were considered through visual inspection and manually assigned to each imaging date. The novel procedure enables calculating the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fire scars along with the statistics of the burned vegetation species within the study area. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosols; Fires; Vegetation; Automatic determination; Biomass burning smokes; Burned-area mapping; Ground observations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Orders of magnitude; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Temporal assessment; Smoke","AFRI; Burn severity; Change detection; Multi-temporal; Normalized burn ratio; RdAFRI; RdNBR; Sentinel-2; Wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090556458"

Studies conducted at global scale demonstrate the increasing pressure of the agricultural frontier on tropical forest, endangering their continuity and biodiversity within. The Paraguayan Chaco has been identified as one of the regions with the highest rate of deforestation in South America. Uninterrupted deforestation activities over the last 30 years have resulted in the loss of 27% of its original cover. The present study focuses on the assessment of vegetation structure characteristics for the complete Paraguayan Chaco by fusing Sentinel-1,-2 and novel spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) samples from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI). The large study area (240,000 km²) calls for a workflow in the cloud computing environment of Google Earth Engine (GEE) which efficiently processes the multi-temporal and multi-sensor data sets for extrapolation in a tile-based random forest (RF) regression model. GEDI-derived attributes of vegetation structure are available since December 2019, opening novel research perspectives to assess vegetation structure composition in remote areas and at large-scale. Therefore, the combination of global mapping missions, such as Landsat and Sentinel, are predestined to be combined with GEDI data, in order to identify priority areas for nature conservation. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of the vegetation structure of the Paraguayan Chaco has not been conducted yet. For that reason, the present methodology was developed to generate the first high-resolution maps (10 m) of canopy height, total canopy cover, Plant-Area-Index and Foliage-Height-Diversity-Index. The complex ecosystems of the Paraguayan Chaco ranging from arid to humid climates can be described by canopy height values from 1.8 to 17.6 m and canopy covers from sparse to dense (total canopy cover: 0 to 78.1%). Model accuracy according to median R² amounts to 64.0% for canopy height, 61.4% for total canopy cover, 50.6% for Plant-Area-Index and 48.0% for Foliage-Height-Diversity-Index. The generated maps of vegetation structure should promote environmental-sound land use and conservation strategies in the Paraguayan Chaco, to meet the challenges of expanding agricultural fields and increasing demand of cattle ranching products, which are dominant drivers of tropical forest loss. © 2021 by the authors.

The influence of comprehensive multi-features and feature optimization on the extraction accuracy of autumn crop planting area were analyzed. In order to reduce the influence of high-dimensional features on the performance of the classifier, a filter hybrid feature selection model (ReEMISE) based on improved separability and thresholds combined with the Relief F algorithm was proposed. Firstly, the Relief F dimensionality reduction algorithm was used to select the features. Secondly, the improved separability and thresholds (EMISE) combined with image entropy was used to further optimize the preliminary feature set, and then the EMISE feature importance value was given a Relief F feature weight. Finally, the random forest model was used to extract the crop planting area from the optimized feature subset, and compared with the random forest classification accuracy of the Relief F dimensionality reduction algorithm and the EMISE dimensionality reduction algorithm. The purpose was to ensure the accuracy of classification, minimize the feature dimensions and improve the classification efficiency. Six different types of feature variables were generated based on the Sentinel-2 data with multi-phase and rich spectral information, including multi-temporal spectral features, traditional index features, red-edge index features, texture features, difference features of different time-phase bands, and ratio features of different time-phase bands. On the basis of multi-temporal spectral features, adding different features, totally six groups of different feature combination experiments were constructed to extract autumn crop planting area and verify the classification accuracy of different feature combination. At the same time, the influence of different features on the extraction accuracy of crop planting area was analyzed from two aspects: the importance of features and the classification accuracy of different feature combinations. The results showed that the best correlation coefficient threshold of the ReEMISE's feature-optimized random forest model(RF_ReEMISE) was 0.96. The accuracy was the highest when the number of feature variables was 9 and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 95.391 8% and 0.939 7, respectively. The advantages of the RF_ReEMISE mainly included two aspects, i. e., the least number of feature variables at the highest accuracy, and the classification accuracy index of ReEMISE algorithm was the highest when the number of different feature variables of the three algorithms attained the best accuracy. Comprehensive multi-feature was the key to improve the accuracy of crop classification. Based on the multi-temporal spectral features, the traditional index features and the red-edge index features were added respectively, and the overall accuracy was improved by 1.502 1 percentage points and 1.571 5 percentage points, and the Kappa coefficient was increased by 0.019 8 and 0.020 7. The accuracy was slightly reduced when adding the texture features, the difference features of different time-phases bands, and the ratio features of different time-phase bands. The RF_ReEMISE can reduce the feature dimensions, improve the classification accuracy, and achieve the balance between efficiency and accuracy. The spectral differences of crops at different phenological stages can be better reflected by introducing the ratio features of different time-phase bands than the difference features of different time-phase bands. It was found that correlation between the red-edge vegetation index and chlorophyll was stronger, and the importance of features was higher. The RF_ReEMISE with multi-features can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of autumn crop classification. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

Shadows are used as a shielding ratio for direct solar irradiance, but, at shorter wavelengths, the amount of diffuse solar irradiance is greater, so the shielding ratio cannot be ignored. The shielding ratio of direct and diffuse solar irradiance is called Cast Shadow (CS) and Self Cast Shadow (SCS), respectively; however, it has been pointed out that the effect of these shadows is greater at higher resolutions, such as Sentinel-2. In addition, the Bottom Of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance is greatly affected by shadows, because it is corrected for atmospheric effects. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial variability of CS and SCS and simulate the Sentinel-2BOA reflectance with these shadows. The target forest was a greenness season of a deciduous broadleaf forest in Thailand. First, we obtained a point cloud of the forest by Structure from Motion while using the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Next, we created a voxel model with CS and SCS as attributes. CS was calculated as the percentage of area where the plane that is assumed per voxel is shielded from direct solar irradiance by other voxels. SCS was calculated as the percentage of area where the hemispheric radiant environment is shielded by other voxels. Subsequently, using solar irradiance and leaf spectral reflectance data, the reflectance of each band of Sentinel-2 was simulated. Nine leaves were used to investigate the effect of leaf species on the simulation. The reflectance acquired by Sentinel-2 is not at the leaf level; however, we used this spectral reflectance data because the reflectance was simulated at the same spatial resolution as the voxel size. Voxel sizes of 20 cm, 50 cm, 100 cm, and 200 cm were used. Our result showed that (1) the spatial variability of SCS was smaller than that of CS when the sun position is fixed and the view zenith angle is changed. SCS was mostly 0.12 at different zenith angles, while the CS had a maximum value of 0.45 and a minimum value of 0.15. (2) The accuracy of the simulations was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The best RMSE is 0.020 ± 0.015 and the worst one is 0.084 ± 0.044. It was found that the error is larger in short wavelength infrared bands.

In this study, we look at this event from an environmental perspective by analyzing the impact of the artificial barrier made by the ship over the channel and of operations like dredging on the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM). In this context, multitemporal Sentinel-2 images are used to study short-term variations of TSM within a time window spanning before, during, and after the blockage event. A well-established neural network-based processor called Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) is employed to derive remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and then TSM concentrations from Sentinel-2 imagery. The results indicate that the stuck ship acted as an artificial barrier leading to very different TSM conditions north and south of the canal. Furthermore, the blockage of the Suez Canal and subsequent dredging caused an abrupt increment (+400%) in the concentration of TSM moving north from the ship’s location. We also identified a very high contrast between the TSM concentration in the north and south of the vessel during the blockage event. © 2021 by the authors.

However, monitoring the frequency and locality of this practice poses a major challenge, as these events are typically unreported. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 imagery for the detection of EOM amendments. Specifically, we investigated the spectral shift resulting from GWC and manure application at two spatial scales, satellite and proximal. At the satellite scale, multispectral Sentinel-2 image pairs were analyzed before and after EOM application to six cultivated fields in the Versailles Plain, France. At the proximal scale, multi-temporal spectral field measurements were taken of experimental plots consisting of 14 total treatments: EOM variety, amendment quantity (15, 30 and 60 t.ha−1 ) and tillage. The Sentinel-2 images showed significant spectral differences before and after EOM application. Exogenous Organic Matter Indices (EOMI) were developed and analyzed for separative performance. The best performing index was EOMI2, using the B4 and B12 Sentinel-2 spectral bands. At the proximal scale, simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, which were created using field measurements, successfully monitored all EOM treatments for three days, except for the buried green waste compost at a rate of 15 t.ha−1. © 2021 by the authors.

However, information loss caused by clouds largely decreases the availability of usable optical images so reconstructing the missing information is important. Existing reconstruction methods can hardly reflect the real-time information because they mainly make use of multitemporal optical images as reference. To capture the real-time information in the cloud removal process, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can serve as the reference images due to the cloud penetrability of SAR imaging. Nevertheless, large datasets are necessary because existing SAR-based cloud removal methods depend on network training. In this paper, we integrate the merits of multitemporal optical images and SAR images to the cloud removal process, the results of which can reflect the ground information change, in a simple convolution neural network. Although the proposed method is based on deep neural network, it can directly operate on the target image without training datasets. We conduct several simulation and real data experiments of cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images with multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images and Sentinel-2 optical images. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms those state-of-the-art multitemporal-based methods and overcomes the constraint of datasets of those SAR-based methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Using a random forest classifier as the backbone, experiments were designed to analyze the impact of the segmentation scale, features (including spectral and temporal features), categories, frequency, and acquisition timing of optical satellite images. Based on our analyses, the following findings are reported: (1) Optical Sentinel images acquired over four seasons can make a significant contribution to the classification of agricultural areas, even though this contribution varies between spectral bands for the same period.

For this reason, temporal and spatial determination of LAI are required to improve the understanding of several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics and crop growth. Despite the large number of retrieved LAI products and the efforts to develop new and updated algorithms for LAI estimation, the available products are not yet capable of capturing site-specific variability, as requested in many agricultural applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of non-parametric approaches for multi-temporal LAI retrieval by Sentinel-2 multispectral data, in comparison with a VI-based parametric approach. For this purpose, we built a large database combining a multispectral satellite data set and ground LAI measurements collected over two growing seasons (2018 and 2019), including three crops (i.e., winter wheat, maize, and alfalfa) characterized by different growing cycles and canopy structures, and considering different agronomic conditions (i.e., at three farms in three different sites). The accuracy of parametric and non-parametric methods for LAI estimation was assessed by cross-validation (CV) at both the pixel and field levels over mixed-crop (MC) and crop-specific (CS) data sets. Overall, the non-parametric approach showed a higher accuracy of prediction at pixel level than parametric methods, and it was also observed that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) did not provide any significant difference (p-value > 0.05) between the predicted values of LAI in the MC and CS data sets, regardless of the crop. Indeed, GPR at the field level showed a cross-validated coefficient of determination (R2CV) higher than 0.80 for all three crops. © 2021 by the authors.

Operational coregistration of Sentinel-2A and-2B imagery is thus required. We present a modification of the established Landsat Sentinel Registration (LSReg) algorithm. The modifications enabled LSReg to be included in an operational preprocessing workflow to automatically coregister large volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery with Landsat base images that represent multiannual monthly spectral average values. The modified LSReg was tested for the complete Sentinel-2 archive covering Crete, Greece, which is a particularly challenging region due to steep topographic gradients and high shares of water in Sentinel-2 tiles. A coregistration success rate of 87.5% of all images was obtained with a mean coregistration precision of 4.4 m. The mean shifts of 14.0 m in the x-direction and 13.4 m in the y-direction before coregistration were found, with maxima exceeding four pixels. Time series noise in locations with land cover transitions ( n = 585 ) was effectively reduced by 43% using the presented approach. The multitemporal geometric consistency of the Sentinel-2 data set was substantially improved, thus enabling time series analyses within the Sentinel-2 data record, as well as integrated Landsat and Sentinel-2A and-2B data sets.

Mill.). Remote sensing satellite imagery represents a valuable data source for seamless regional-scale mapping of forest composition. This study developed and evaluated new models to map the distribution and abundance of SBW host species at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery in combination with several site variables for a total of 191 variables in northern New Brunswick, Canada using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found Sentinel-2 multi-temporal single spectral bands and numerous spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) yielded the classification of SBW host species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 72.6% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.65. Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 variables coupled with elevation, only marginally improved the performance of the model (OA: 73.0% and K: 0.66). The use of Sentinel-1 SAR data with elevation resulted in a reasonable OA of 57.5% and K of 0.47.

Economic growth resulted in the addition of external water resources from the Tajo River (1979) as part of the National Water Plan (1933). Irrigation water has caused the water table to rise since 1979. Furthermore, water resources have boosted urban touristic expansion, industrial estates, and road infrastructures. This study presents a diagnosis of the official flood hazard maps by applying remote sensing techniques that enable the identification of (i) areas flooded during recent events; and (ii) the possible effects of anthropogenic actions on fluvial processes affecting flooding (land use and land cover change—LULCC). The flooded areas were identified from a multispectral satellite image taken by a sensor on Sentinel-2. A multi-temporal analysis of aerial photographs (1929, 1956, 1981, 2009, and 2017) showing the fluvial and anthropic environment at a detailed scale (1:25,000) was used to define the fluvial geomorphology and the main anthropic alterations on the Rebollos ephemeral stream. Official inputs from geographical information repositories about land use were also gathered (LULC). The result was compared to the official flood hazard maps (SNCZI) and this revealed floodable areas that had not been previously mapped because official maps rely only on the hydraulic method.

Yet, on-board yield monitoring for sugarcane can be challenging. At the same time, orbital images have been widely used for indirect crop yield estimation for many crops like wheat, corn, and rice, but not for sugarcane. Due to this, the objective of this study is to explore the potential of multi-temporal imagery data as an alternative for sugarcane yield mapping. The study was based on developing predictive sugarcane yield models integrating time-series orbital imaging and a machine learning technique. A commercial sugarcane site was selected, and Sentinel-2 images were acquired from the beginning of the ratoon sprouting until harvesting of two consecutive cropping seasons. The predictive yield models RF (Random forest) and MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) were developed using orbital images and yield maps generated by a commercial sensor-system on harvesting. Original yield data were filtered and interpolated with the same spatial resolution of the orbital images. The entire dataset was divided into training and testing datasets. Spectral bands, especially the near-infrared at tillering crop stage showed greater contribution to predicting sugarcane yield than the use of derived spectral vegetation indices. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained for the RF regression based on multiple spectral bands was 4.63 Mg ha−1 with an R2 of 0.70 for the testing dataset. Overall, the RF regression had better performance than the MLR to predict sugarcane yield. © 2021 by the authors.

To exploit the free availability of Sentinel imagery, it is worth considering deep learning techniques for single-image super-resolution tasks, allowing the spatial enhancement of low-resolution (LR) images by recovering high-frequency details to produce high-resolution (HR) super-resolved images. In this work, we implement and train a model based on the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) with pairs of WorldView-Sentinel images to generate a super-resolved multispectral Sentinel-2 output with a scaling factor of 5. Our model, named RS-ESRGAN, removes the upsampling layers of the network to make it feasible to train with co-registered remote sensing images. Results obtained outperform state-of-the-art models using standard metrics like PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS, SAM and CC. Moreover, qualitative visual analysis shows spatial improvements as well as the preservation of the spectral information, allowing the super-resolved Sentinel-2 imagery to be used in studies requiring very high spatial resolution. © 2020 by the authors.","Deep learning; Image analysis; Image resolution; Network layers; Open Data; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Commercial satellites; Data distribution policies; Low resolution images; Multi-temporal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Spectral information; Very high spatial resolutions; Image enhancement","Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Sentinel-2; Super-resolution; WorldView","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089853089"

While a few studies have demonstrated the potential of optical and SAR data for crop lodging assessment, large-scale crop lodging assessment has been hampered by the unavailability of dense satellite time series data. The unprecedented availability of free Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data may provide a basis for operational detection and monitoring of crop lodging. In this context, this study aims to understand the effect of lodging on backscatter/coherence and spectral reflectance derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data and to detect lodging incidence in wheat using time-series analysis. Crop biophysical parameters were measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara, Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were further categorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles of backscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severity classes throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukey tests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed that red edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularly healthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarity of VV and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging in wheat.

Timely and accurate mapping of its spatial distribution and planting area is of great significance to local economy and ecology. As a special tree species planted in the Grain for Green Program of China, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture (Linxia) in Gansu Province of China has vigorously developed ZBM cultivation since the launch of the program. However, lacking the accurate ZBM planting information hinders the assessment of the benefits and losses of the program to local people. Therefore, this study investigated the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) to accurately map ZBM in the study area in 2019. We first investigated the classification accuracies of four alternative Random Forest (RF) classifications using either alone or in combination, spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and topographical variables. The importance of the three categories of features was examined based on the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) metric. The classification results with the most important features were further assessed for their consistency by considering the voting rates of 800 trees based on testing samples. Results show that the sole use of the spectral bands (40 input features) already achieves a satisfactory classification accuracy of 95.43%. Adding extra VIs and topographical variables further improves the results, but only to a small extent. However, certain VIs and topographic variables are far more effective in classification compared with the original spectral bands, especially the Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705) and Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI). The classification accuracy achieves nearly 95% when using only the top 15 most important features. The desirable periods for differencing of ZBM and other land cover types are fruit coloring and ripening periods. The final map shows that the ZBM planting in Linxia is mainly distributed along the Yellow River and around the Liujiaxia reservoir. The total mapped acreages of ZBM is 51,601 ha, covering 9.51% of the study area. 99% of ZBM tends to grow between 1500 and 2400 m altitude, and 67% of ZBM are planted in areas with slopes between 5 and 25°. Voting rates show that the percentages of classification results with strong and good consistency are generally over 70% for all land cover types, proving the derived land cover map's high credibility, including ZBM. Altogether, our results demonstrate the high potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in accurate mapping of ZBM, which can serve as a reference for other specialty crops or tree species. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Instrument (OLI) data offer unique opportunities for investigating certain in-water constituents (e.g., TSM and chlorophyll-a) owing to their spatial resolution (10-60 m). In this framework, we assessed the potential of MSI-OLI combined data in characterizing the multi-temporal (2014-2018) TSM variability in Pertusillo Lake (Basilicata region, Southern Italy). We developed and validated a customized MSI-based TSM model (R2 = 0.81) by exploiting ground measurements acquired during specific measurement campaigns. The model was then exported as OLI data through an intercalibration procedure (R2 = 0.87), allowing for the generation of a TSM multi-temporal MSI-OLI merged dataset. The analysis of the derived multi-year TSM monthly maps showed the influence of hydrological factors on the TSM seasonal dynamics over two sub-regions of the lake, the west and east areas. The western side is more influenced by inflowing rivers and water level fluctuations, the effects of which tend to longitudinally decrease, leading to less sediment within the eastern sub-area. The achieved results can be exploited by regional authorities for better management of inland water quality and monitoring systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Biogeochemistry; Ecology; Water levels; Water quality; Biogeochemical cycle; Ecological functioning; Hydrological factors; Measurement campaign; Multispectral instruments; Regional authorities; Total suspended matter; Water-level fluctuation; Lakes","Inland water reflectance; Multi-sensor; Multi-temporal; Optical satellite data; TSM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087544690"

This paper highlighted the methodological problems that arise at using satellite images for research and mapping of underwater relief; the ways of their solution are offered. Consideration of the depth of penetration of sunlight into the water and analysis of the spectral brightness of underwater objects allow for the determination of the spectrum zone (red zone) optimal for interpreting sandy riverbanks and options for color synthesis. At a limited choice of cloudless images in the Arctic to have images obtained during the minimum water level, not only the imaging season (low-water period) but also interannual runoff fluctuations are taken into account. The water turbidity limits the possibility to interpret the underwater relief. Images obtained with minimal turbidity are selected, and in the case of spreading of turbid waters, multi-temporal images are compared to separate the image of volatile turbid waters from more stable bottom objects; color synthesis is applied at different times. The identification of sandbanks, ridged forms of relief, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpreting based on the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. The identification of sandbanks, ridged relief forms on them, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpretation of the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. To highlight the fuzzy boundaries between the shallows and core zones of streams, the brightness quantization of images is applied. Comparison of the Yenisei River delta shallows map compiled from modern photographs with topographic and pilot maps of the 1970–1980th shows a reduction in the area of shallows adjacent to the tips of large islands in the eastern part of the delta.

This wood biomass has not yet been systematically inventoried. The aim of this study was to experimentally prove and validate the concept of the satellite-based estimation of woody above-ground biomass (AGB) on AAL in the Western Carpathian region. The analysis is based on Sentinel-1 and-2 satellite data, supported by field research and airborne laser scanning. An improved AGB estimate was achieved using radar and optical multi-temporal data and polarimetric coherence by creating integrated predictive models by multiple regression. Abandonment is represented by two basic AAL classes identified according to overgrowth by shrub formations (AAL1) and tree formations (AAL2). First, an allometric model for AAL1 estimation was derived based on empirical material obtained from blackthorn stands. AAL2 biomass was quantified by different procedures related to (1) mature trees, (2) stumps and (3) young trees. Then, three satellite-based predictive mathematical models for AGB were developed. The best model reached R2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 41.2 t·ha−1 (35.1%), parametrized for an AGB range of 4 to 350 t·ha−1 . In addition to 3214 hectares of forest land, we identified 992 hectares of shrub– tree formations on AAL with significantly lower wood AGB than on forest land and with simple shrub composition. © 2021 by the authors.

Wetland maps are essential for the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems. This study is to obtain an accurate wetland map using an object-based stacked generalization (Stacking) method on the basis of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) is used to get time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, from which the vegetation phenology variables are derived by the threshold method. Subsequently, both vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizontal receive (VH) polarization backscatters (σ0 VV, σ0 VH) are obtained using the time series Sentinel-1 images. Speckle noise inherent in SAR data, resulting in over-segmentation or under-segmentation, can affect image segmentation and degrade the accuracies of wetland classification. Therefore, we segment Sentinel-2 multispectral images to delineate meaningful objects in this study. Then, in order to reduce data redundancy and computation time, we analyze the optimal feature combination using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images, Sentinel-2 NDVI time series, phenological variables and other vegetation index derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral images, as well as time series Sentinel-1 backscatters at the object level. Finally, the stacked generalization algorithm is utilized to extract the wetland information based on the optimal feature combination in the Dongting Lake wetland. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the object-based stacked generalization method are 92.46% and 0.92, which are 3.88% and 0.04 higher than that using the pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based stacked generalization algorithm is superior to single classifiers in classifying vegetation of high heterogeneity areas. © 2020 The Authors","algorithm; image classification; mapping; optical method; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; wetland","Classification; Multi-Temporal; Object-Based; Sentinel-1/2; Stacked generalization; Wetland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120703255"

Then, cloud-free images from optical satellite sensors, including Landsat 7 the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat 8 the Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instrument (MSI), were collected to derive LAI through inversion of the PROSAIL radiation transfer model using a look-up-table (LUT) approach. Finally, field LAI data were used to validate the multi-temporal LAI retrieved from remote-sensing data acquired by different satellite sensors. The results indicate that good accuracy was obtained using different inversion strategies for each sensor, while Green Chlorophyll Index (CIgreen) and a combination of three red-edge bands perform better for Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 LAI inversion, respectively. Furthermore, the estimated LAI has good consistency with in situ measurements at vegetative stage (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.74, and root mean square error RMSE = 0.53 m2 m−2). At the reproductive stage, a significant underestimation was found (R2 = 0.41, and 0.89 m2 m−2 in terms of RMSE). This study suggests that time-series LAI can be retrieved from multi-source satellite data through model inversion, and the LAINet instrument could be used as a low-cost tool to provide continuous field LAI measurements to support LAI retrieval. © 2020 by the authors.

This study investigated clay content prediction at three spectral acquisition levels: laboratory, airborne, and spaceborne. Two approaches were tested, the use of prediction models developed with local and regional spectral libraries (52 samples for local scale and 950, 200 e 224 samples for regional scale), termed internal and external models respectively. Local soil samples (52), were collected in a smallholder area, 83 ha, located in southeastern Brazil. Spectral data in the visible (Vis), near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions were acquired in the laboratory using FieldSpec 3 sensor, and the clay content was determined by sedimentation technique. Afterward, bare soil images from AISA-FENIX, Planetscope, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were obtained. The clay content determined in the laboratory was related to the soil spectra acquired by each of the sensors and was predicted using the Cubist regression tree algorithm. The results obtained from local spectral libraries showed good predictions using FieldSpec 3 and AISA-FENIX sensors. Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI provided satisfactory results, while PlanetScope gave poor results. For the prediction using regional spectral libraries, only lab-based FieldSpec 3 sensor provided a fair prediction, while other sensors gave poor results. This study demonstrated that soil sensing is possible at any level taking into account its advantages and limitations.

Notable changes in these techniques involve the automation of different steps, yielding promising results in terms of accuracy, class detection and efficiency. The most successful methodologies that have arisen rely on the use of multi-temporal data. Several different approaches have proven successful. In this study, one of the most recently developed methodologies is tested in the region of Galicia (in Northwestern Spain), with the aim of filling gaps in the mapping needs of the Galician forestry sector. The methodology mainly consists of performing a supervised classification of individual images from a selected time series and then combining them through aggregation using decision criteria. Several of the steps of the methodology can be addressed in multiple ways: pixel resolution selection, classification model building and aggregation methods. The effectiveness of these three tasks as well as some others are tested and evaluated and the most accurate and efficient parameters for the case study area are highlighted. The final land cover map that is obtained for Galicia has high accuracy metrics (an overall accuracy of 91.6%), which is in line with previous studies that have followed this methodology in other regions. This study has led to the development of an efficient open-access solution to support the mapping needs of the forestry sector. © 2021 by the authors.

Multiple studies have used reference datasets to extract training data automatically in an efficient way. However, automatic extraction might be inappropriate for some classes. Furthermore, classes can have distinct spectral characteristics across large areas. Thus, dividing the study area into subregions can be beneficial. This study proposes to assess the impact of the introduction of spatial stratification and manually collected training data on classification performance. Two classifications were conducted with the Random Forest classifier and multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 data. The classifications' performance was evaluated by accuracy metrics and visual inspection of the maps. The results indicate that introducing spatial stratification and manual training yielded a higher overall accuracy (66.7%) when compared to the accuracy of a benchmark classification (60.2%) conducted without stratification and with training data collected exclusively by automatic methods. Visual inspection of the maps also revealed some advantages of the novel approach, namely constraining some land cover classes to be present only within specific strata, which avoids commission errors of the class to spread freely across the map. Most of the classification improvements were observed in subregions with specific landscapes and spectral patterns, although these strata represent a small fraction of the study area, which might have contributed to the small increase in accuracy.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Burn area mapping is a major parameter in carrying out mitigation measures and regrowth activities by forest officials or fire managers post fire event. In this study, multi-Temporal satellite datasets such as images acquired from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) missions are used to map the burn areas. Two thematic indices such as Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) are implemented on the study area. The entire analysis, i.e., accessing the datasets, preprocessing, and calculation of indices for brunt area mapping is carried out on Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Rather than ground survey, the active fire product VIIRS product (VNP14IMGTDL) is used as a proxy for the actual fire indices in accuracy assessment. Results revealed that RBR showed better accuracy than dNBR for both the datasets (S2 and L8). S2 burn severity maps of dNBR and RBR showed better accuracy than L8 burn severity maps because of S2 having a higher spatial resolution. Thus, S2 datasets can be useful for rapid mapping of burn areas with improved spatial as well as temporal resolution. © 2020 IEEE.","Arid regions; Deforestation; Engines; Environmental management; Fire hazards; Mapping; Accuracy assessment; Cloud platforms; Differenced normalized burn ratios (dnbr); Eastern Australia; Forest officials; Mitigation measures; Spatial resolution; Temporal resolution; Fires","Forest fires; Google Earth Engine; Rapid Mapping; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099579020"

Whereas traditional agricultural systems mainly rely on scarce ground-survey data, freely available multi-temporal and multi-spectral remote sensing images are excellent tools to support these vulnerable systems by accurately monitoring and estimating crop yields before harvest. In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation. Thirdly, we study the effect of considering different temporal, climate and soil data configurations in terms of the performance achieved by the proposed approach and several state-of-the-art regression and CNN-based yield estimation methods.

Wetlands in Zhenlai county, with the Momoge National Nature Reserve, which was included on the Ramsar list, have degraded by nearly 30%. Wetland degradation is a long-term continuous process with annual or interannual changes in water area, water level, or vegetation presence and growth. Therefore, it requires sufficiently frequent and high-spatial-resolution data to represent its dynamics. This study mapped yearly land-use maps with 30-m resolution from 1985 to 2018 using Landsat data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore the wetland degradation process and mapped 12-day interval land-use maps with 15-m resolution using the Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 data in GEE and other assistant platforms to study the characteristics of wetland dynamics in 2018. Four sets of maps were generated using Sentinel-1B (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), the combination of Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 (S12), and S12 with multitemporal remote sensing (S12’). All of the classifications were performed in the Random Forest Classification (RFC) method using remote sensing indicators. The results indicate that S12’ was the most accurate. Then, the impact of the historic land-use degradation process on current wetland change dynamics was discussed. Stable, degradation, and restoration periods were identified according to the annual changes in wetlands. The degraded, stable, restored, and vulnerable zones were assessed based on the transformation characteristics among wetlands and other land-use types. The impact of historical land-use trajectories on wetland change characteristics nowadays is diverse in land-use types and distributions, and the ecological environment quality is the comprehensive result of the effect of historical land-use trajectories and the amount of rainfall and receding water from paddy fields. This study offers a new method to map high-spatiotemporal-resolution land-use (S12’) and addresses the relationship between historic wetland change characteristics and its status quo. The findings are also applicable to wetland research in other regions. This study could provide more detailed scientific guidance for wetland managers by quickly detecting wetland changes at a finer spatiotemporal resolution. © 2021 by the authors.

Our proposed approach combines random forest for soil classification using multitemporal multispectral Sentinel-2 data and a deep learning model using YOLOv3 on LiDAR data previously pre-processed using a multi–scale relief model. The resulting algorithm significantly improves previous attempts with a detection rate of 89.5%, an average precision of 66.75%, a recall value of 0.64 and a precision of 0.97, which allowed, with a small set of training data, the detection of 10,527 burial mounds over an area of near 30,000 km2, the largest in which such an approach has ever been applied.

Any combination of the different algorithms tested increased the values of classification, although they may help with separability between some pairs of classes. © 2021 by the authors.

Direct or indirect effects can be related to climate change, biodiversity loss, soil erosion, floods, landslides, etc. As such a significant process, timely and continuous monitoring of forest dynamics is important, to constantly follow existing policies and develop new mitigation measures. The present work had the aim of mapping and monitoring the forest change from 2000 to 2019 and of simulating the future forest development of a rainforest region located in the Pará state, Brazil. The land cover dynamics were mapped at five-year intervals based on a supervised classification model deployed on the cloud processing platform Google Earth Engine. Besides the benefits of reduced computational time, the service is coupled with a vast data catalogue providing useful access to global products, such as multispectral images of the missions Landsat five, seven, eight and Sentinel-2. The validation procedures were done through photointerpretation of highresolution panchromatic images obtained from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite). The more than satisfactory results allowed an estimation of peak deforestation rates for the period 2000- 2006; for the period 2006-2015, a significant decrease and stabilization, followed by a slight increase till 2019. Based on the derived trends a forest dynamics was simulated for the period 2019-2028, estimating a decrease in the deforestation rate. These results demonstrate that such a fusion of satellite observations, machine learning, and cloud processing, benefits the analysis of the forest dynamics and can provide useful information for the development of forest policies.  © 2020 by the authors.","","Deforestation; Forest change detection; Google Earth Engine; Land cover dynamics; Landsat; Sentinel-2; Supervised classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092420606"

The Sential-2 images were used as data sources in this paper. Firstly, spectral curve analysis of the features in the study area was performed and non-vegetated areas were excluded by using decision tree method. Since the same texture feature in each band had a certain autocorrelation, the principal component analysis method was used to reduce the dimension. In the end, 49 features including original band, vegetated band, texture feature could be achieved, then 3 models with different input which were classified by random forest method could be set up. The result showed that the model which used original band, vegetation index and decreased dimension texture feature had the highest accuracy. The total classification accuracy and Kappa index was 91.03% and 0.81771 respectively. Therefore, some conclusions were figured out: (1) the classification method based on multiple features was helpful to improve the accuracy; (2) the time series characteristics of vegetation index could help improve the classification accuracy of non-main crops; (3) decreasing the dimension of texture feature could improve the efficiency and cartographic quality of the classification. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.  © 2021 IEEE.","Data handling; Emergency services; Engines; Geometrical optics; Landslides; Mapping; Orbits; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Tracking radar; Case-studies; Google earth engine; Google earths; Landslide identification; Landslide mapping; Mapping accuracy; Optical image; Radar data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic aperture radar","Google Earth Engine; Landslide Mapping; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126097463"

However, synthesized overviews of biomass patterns across circumpolar sites have been limited. Based on data from eight study sites in Europe, Siberia and Canada, we ask (1) how biomass is divided between plant functional types (PFTs) and (2) how well biomass patterns can be detected with widely available, moderate spatial resolution (3–10 m) satellite imagery and topographic data. We explain biomass patterns using random forest regressions with the predictors being spectral bands and indices calculated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery and topographic information calculated from ArcticDEM data. Our results indicate that there are notable differences in vegetation composition between northern landscapes with mosses, graminoids and deciduous shrubs being the most dominant PFTs. Remote sensing data detects biomass patterns, but regression performance varies between sites (explained variance 36–70%, normalized root mean square error 9–19%). There is also variability between sites whether Sentinel-2 or PlanetScope data is more suitable to detect biomass patterns and which the most important predictors are. Topographic information has a minor or negligible importance in most of the sites. Our results suggest that there is no easily generalizable relationship between satellite-derived vegetation greenness and biomass. © 2021 The Author(s).

Species discrimination has shown promising results using both HyperSpectral (HS) and MultiSpectral (MS) images. Airborne HS instruments enable high spatial and spectral resolution imagery while time series of satellite MS images provide high temporal resolution and phenological information. This paper aims to compare supervised classification results obtained with non-parametric (Random Forest, RF, Support Vector Machine, SVM) and parametric methods (Regularized Logistic Regression, RLR) applied on both kinds of images acquired on an industrial brownfield. The studied site is a complex vegetated environment due to species diversity: 8 dominant species are retained. The performance obtained by preliminary feature selection based on principal component analysis and vegetation indices, to improve separability of spectral or temporal information according to species, is analysed. The best performance is obtained by RLR method applied on HS data without feature selection (global accuracy of 93 %). Feature selection is found to be a necessary step to perform classification with time series of MS images. Species that are difficult to distinguish from the HS image, namely Salix and Populus, are well separated using Sentinel-2 images (precision around 70%). © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

It has a 5-day revisit time, spatial resolution of 10 m, free data, etc. In this study, Sentinel-2 imagery was investigated for bleaching detection through simulations and a case study over the Lizard Island, Australia. The spectral and image simulations based on the semianalytical (SA) model and the sensor spectral response function, respectively, confirmed that coral bleaching cannot be detected only using one image, and the change analysis was proposed for detection because there will be a featured change signal for bleached corals. Band 2 of Sentinel-2 is superior to its other bands for the overall consideration of signal attenuation and spatial resolution. However, the detection capability of Sentinel-2 is still limited by the water depth. With rapid signal attenuation due to the water absorption effect, the applicable water depth for bleaching detection was recommended to be less than 10 m. The change analysis was conducted using two methods: one radiometric normalization with pseudo invariant features (PIFs) and the other with multi-temporal depth invariant indices (DII). The former performed better than the latter in terms of classification. The bleached corals maps obtained using the PIFs and DII approaches had an overall accuracy of 88.9 and 57.1%, respectively. Compared with the change analysis based on two dated images, the use of a third image that recorded the spectral signals of recovered corals or corals overgrown by algae after bleaching significantly improved the detection accuracy. All the preliminary results of this article will aid in the future studies on coral bleaching detection based on remote sensing. © Copyright © 2021 Xu, Zhao, Wang, Chen and Lee.","","change detection; coral reef bleaching; Lizard Island; multi-temporal; remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103839580"

As a large seasonal ice-covered lake located in Northern Mongolia, Lake Khovsgol not only provides important freshwater resources for the local population but also serves as a means of water transportation in summer and an important land-based activity for residents in winter. In this study, we used the sub-pixel offset technique with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 optical images to estimate the time-series displacement of lake ice in Lake Khovsgol from 7 December 2020 to 17 June 2021. With the processing of 112 Sentinel-2 images, we obtained 27 pairs of displacement results at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 days. These lake ice movement results covered three stages from ice-on to ice-off. The first stage was the lake ice growth period, which lasted 26 days from 7 December 2020 to 3 January 2021. Ice formation started from the south and extended northward, with a displacement of up to 10 m in 5 days. The second stage was the active phase of the ice cover, which took place from 3 January 2021 to 18 April 2021. Maximum displacement values reached 12 m in the east and 11 m in the north among all observations. The value of the lake ice movement in the north–south direction (NS) was found to be larger than in the east–west direction (EW). The third stage was the melting period, which closed on 17 June 2021. In comparison to the freezing date of November in past years, our results demonstrate the ice-on date of Lake Khovsgol has been delayed to December, suggesting a possible reason that the seasonal ice-covered lake located at the middle latitude has been affected by global warming. In addition, the lake ice movement of our results can reveal the regional climate characteristic. This study is one of the few cases to reveal the distribution characteristics and changing trends of lake ice on the Mongolia Plateau, providing a rare reference for lake ice research in this region. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we present the results of the preliminary RST algorithm implementation to thermal infrared (TIR) data, at 90 m spatial resolution, from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Results achieved under the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment, by analyzing 20 years of satellite observations over three active volcanoes (i.e., Etna, Shishaldin and Shinmoedake) located in different geographic areas, show that the RST-based system, hereafter named RASTer, detected a higher (around 25% more) number of thermal anomalies than the well-established ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA). Despite the availability of a less populated dataset than other sensors, the RST implementation on ASTER data guarantees an efficient identification and mapping of volcanic thermal features even of a low intensity level. To improve the temporal continuity of the active volcanoes monitoring, the possibility of exploiting RASTer is here addressed, in the perspective of an operational multi-satellite observing system. The latter could include mid-high spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2/MSI, Landsat-8/OLI), as well as those at higher-temporal (lower-spatial) resolution (e.g., EOS/MODIS, Suomi-NPP/VIIRS, Sentinel-3/SLSTR), for which RASTer could provide useful algorithm’s validation and training dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

In an effort to create a sustainable environment, there are various pressures on vegetation that cause a decrease in vegetation area. Economic activity, population growth and other anthropogenic activities trigger the dynamics of vegetation cover in an area that causes land cover changes from vegetation to non-vegetation. Majalengka Regency as one of the areas with intensive regional physical development in line with the operation of BIJB Kertajati and the Cipali toll road became the study area in this research. This study aims to monitor the dynamics of vegetation cover with the proposed method namely the integration of the OBIA and Random Forest classifier using multi temporal Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The results show that there is a decrease in the area of vegetation in the research area as much as 4,329.6 hectares to non-vegetation areas in the period 2016-2020. The vegetation area in 2020 is 84,716.07 hectares and non-vegetation area is 35,708 hectares.

A long-standing challenge in the remote sensing community is about how to efficiently exploit multiple sources of information and leverage their complementarity, in order to obtain the most out of radar and optical data. In this work, we propose to deal with land cover mapping in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) setting via a deep learning framework designed to leverage the multi-source complementarity provided by radar and optical satellite image time series (SITS). The proposed architecture is based on an extension of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) enriched via a modified attention mechanism capable to fit the specificity of SITS data. Our framework also integrates a pretraining strategy that allows to exploit specific domain knowledge, shaped as hierarchy over the set of land cover classes, to guide the model training. Thorough experimental evaluations, involving several competitive approaches were conducted on two study sites, namely the Reunion island and a part of the Senegalese groundnut basin. Classification results, 79% of global accuracy on the Reunion island and 90% on the Senegalese site, respectively, have demonstrated the suitability of the proposal. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper aims to investigate the use of reflective wavelength Sentinel-2 data to classify unambiguous active fire areas from inactive areas at 20 m spatial resolution. A multi-criteria approach based on the reflectance of several bands (i.e. B4, B11, and B12) is proposed to demonstrate the boundary constraints in several representative biomes. It is a fully automatic algorithm based on adaptive thresholds that are statistically determined from 11 million Sentinel-2 observations acquired over corresponding summertime (June 2019 to September 2019) across 14 regions or countries. Biome-based parameterizations avoid high omission errors (OE) caused by small and cool fires in different landscapes. It also takes advantage of the multiple criteria whose intersection could reduce the potential commission errors (CE) due to soil dominated pixels or highly reflective building rooftops. Active fire detection performance was mainly evaluated through visual inspection on eight illustrative subsets because of unavailable ground truth. The detection results revealed that CE and OE could be kept at a low level with 0.14 and 0.04 as an acceptable trade-off. The proposed algorithm can be employed for rapid active fire detection as soon as the image is obtained without the requirement of using multi-temporal imagery, and can even be adapted to onboard processing in the future. © 2021 The Authors","algorithm; detection method; fire behavior; multicriteria analysis; pixel; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis","Active fire detection; Biome; Multi-criteria; MultiSpectral instrument; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114877598"

An established approach to map invasive species across large areas is based on the combination of satellite or aerial remote sensing data with ground truth data from fieldwork. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, also referred to as unmanned aerial systems (UAS)) may represent an interesting and low-cost alternative to labor-intensive fieldwork. Despite the increasing use of UAVs in the field of remote sensing in the last years, operational methods to combine UAV and satellite data are still sparse. Here, we present a new methodological framework to estimate the fractional coverage (FC%) of the invasive shrub species Ulex europaeus (common gorse) on Chiloé Island (south-central Chile), based on ultra-high-resolution UAV images and a medium resolution intra-annual time-series of Sentinel-2. Our framework is based on three steps: 1) Land cover classification of the UAV orthoimages, 2) reduce the spatial shift between UAV-based land cover classification maps and Sentinel-2 imagery and 3) identify optimal satellite acquisition dates for estimating the actual distribution of Ulex europaeus. In Step 2 we translate the challenging co-registration task between two datasets with very different spatial resolutions into an (machine learning) optimization problem where the UAV-based land cover classification maps obtained in Step 1 are systematically shifted against the satellite images. Based on several Random Forest (RF) models, an optimal fit between varying land cover fractions and the spectral information of Sentinel-2 is identified to correct the spatial offset between both datasets. Considering the spatial shifts of the UAV orthoimages and using optimally timed Sentinel-2 acquisitions led to a significant improvement for the estimation of the current distribution of Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, we found that the Sentinel-2 acquisition from November (flowering time of Ulex europaeus) was particularly important in distinguishing Ulex europaeus from other plant species. Our mapping results could support local efforts in controlling Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, the proposed workflow should be transferable to other use cases where individual target species that are visually detectable in UAV imagery are considered. These findings confirm and underline the great potential of UAV-based groundtruth data for detecting invasive species. © 2020 The Authors","Chile; Ulex europaeus; aerial survey; angiosperm; invasive species; mapping method; orthophoto; phenology; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shrub; texture; time series analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index","Chile; Co-registration; Invasive species; Plant phenology; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Time-series; UAV texture parameters; UAV vegetation indices; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105550185"

They consist of poikilohydric organisms capable of adjusting their metabolic activities depending on the water availability. However, they, and with them, their ecosystem functions, are endangered by climate change and land‐use intensification. Remote sensing (RS)‐ based studies estimated the BSC cover in global drylands through various multispectral indices, and few of them correlated the BSCsʹ activity response to rainfall. However, the allocation of BSCs is not limited to drylands only as there are areas beyond where smaller patches have developed under intense human impact and frequent disturbance. Yet, those areas were not addressed in RS-based studies, raising the question of whether the methods developed in extensive drylands can be transferred easily. Our temperate climate study area, the ‘Lieberoser Heide’ in northeastern Germany, is home to the country’s largest BSC‐covered area. We applied a Random Forest (RF) classification model incorporating multispectral Sentinel‐2 (S2) data, indices derived from them, and topographic information to spatiotemporally map the BSC cover for the first time in Central Europe. We further monitored the BSC response to rainfall events over a period of around five years (June 2015 to end of December 2020). Therefore, we combined datasets of gridded NDVI as a measure of photosynthetic activity with daily precipitation data and conducted a change detection analysis. With an overall accuracy of 98.9%, our classification proved satisfactory. Detected changes in BSC activity between dry and wet conditions were found to be significant. Our study emphasizes a high transferability of established methods from extensive drylands to BSC‐covered areas in the temperate climate. Therefore, we consider our study to provide essential impulses so that RS‐based biocrust mapping in the future will be applied beyond the global drylands. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and timely obtain the LULC maps on the earth's surface, in particular for those regions where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level new area, Xiong'an New Area, was established in China, which would inevitably lead to some LULC changes in this region. In order to better understand what kinds of LULC change in this region with more details and further evaluate the potential impacts that the LULC changes will bring, this study makes full use of the 10-m multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images on the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the powerful classification capability of Random Forest (RF) models, to generate the continuous LULC maps in Xiong'an New Area from 2017 to 2020. The derived LULC map for each year in Xiong'an New Area achieves high accuracy, with OA and Kappa values less than 0.9. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years. It revealed that the estimated dry farmland has decreased from 2017 to 2018 and then kept almost stable, and the majority of it has converted to non-cropland, especially to the tree seedlings and landscape dual-use regions. The estimated impervious areas that were mainly composed of buildings and transport infrastructures first increased due to the newly constructed Xiong'an Station with some high-speed roads and then decreased from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the relocation of some small villages. Accordingly, some building groups and aggregations were going to show in this region, and are expected to further developed in the future. Other LULC types such as lakes and forests have not changed dramatically, indicating that the environmental protection in Xiong'an New Area was, to date, satisfactory. The obtained 10-m and 4-year LULC maps in this study can provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of changes were and will be undergoing in Xiong'an New Area, and can also be used for evaluating the potential impacts and challenges such as environmental protection. Additionally, the utilization of GEE and the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images can help to achieve LULC mapping in this region in an accurate and timely manner, which can be used in future studies. © 2021 IEEE.","Climate change; Decision trees; Engines; Environmental protection; Seed; Building groups; Earth's surface; Human activities; Land use and land cover; Land use and land cover change; Potential impacts; Spatial and temporal changes; Transport infrastructure; Land use","Google Earth Engine; Land Use and Land Cover Change; Multi-temporal classification; Xiong'an New District","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115805840"

Therefore, wetland mapping and monitoring are essential for their con-servation. In this regard, remote sensing offers efficient solutions due to the availability of cost-efficient archived images over different spatial scales. However, a lack of sufficient consistent training samples at different times is a significant limitation of multi-temporal wetland monitoring. In this study, a new training sample migration method was developed to identify unchanged training samples to be used in wetland classification and change analyses over the International Shadegan Wetland (ISW) areas of southwestern Iran. To this end, we first produced the wetland map of a reference year (2020), for which we had training samples, by combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and the Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (KC) of this reference map were 97.93% and 0.97, respectively. Then, an automatic change detection method was developed to migrate unchanged training samples from the reference year to the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021. Within the proposed method, three indices of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the mean Standard Deviation (SD) of the spectral bands, along with two similarity measures of the Euclidean Distance (ED) and Spectral Angle Distance (SAD), were computed for each pair of reference–target years. The optimum threshold for unchanged samples was also derived using a histogram thresholding approach, which led to se-lecting the samples that were most likely unchanged based on the highest OA and KC for classifying the test dataset. The proposed migration sample method resulted in high OAs of 95.89%, 96.83%, and 97.06% and KCs of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.96 for the target years of 2018, 2019, and 2021, respectively. Finally, the migrated samples were used to generate the wetland map for the target years. Overall, our proposed method showed high potential for wetland mapping and monitoring when no training samples existed for a target year. © 2021 by the authors.

Meanwhile, the development of new image processing techniques and the broad availability of high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery provide an unprecedented setup for the development of effective and scalable forest cover change monitoring systems. This is especially relevant in regions with large forested areas with high rates of deforestation, such as in the region of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. In this context, existing forest cover change monitoring methods are based on a combination of visual inspection, spectral profiles, statistics, and machine learning techniques, which offer alternative backbones to deal with deforestation monitoring. Given the recent advances in the field of image processing by Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs), the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the U-Net architecture for the mapping of forest cover aimed at identifying deforestation polygons in multi-temporal satellite imagery. To this end, 10-m resolution imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite covering portions of the Legal Amazon region were employed. The U-Net could identify and draw polygons of forest areas and forest fragments with high accuracy (0.9470), precision (0.9356), recall (0.9676), and F1-score (0.9513), thus outperforming largely applied and well-know supervised and unsupervised image classification methods. The results indicate and we further discuss that U-Nets have the potential to run as the backbone for efficient forest cover change monitoring initiatives and support the deployment of near real-time deforestation warning systems. © 2021","Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; climate change; deforestation; forest cover; image classification; image processing; numerical method; satellite imagery; segmentation; Sentinel; spectral resolution; unsupervised classification; vegetation mapping","Deforestation; GIS; Machine learning; Rainforest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104942807"

Moreover, with the introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request. Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in the field, surveys are a time-consuming solution that pose strict limitations to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data, accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art self-attention-based models for LC&CC to different target zones where labeled data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution of extracted features. © 2021 by the authors.

Although turbid water column corrections can be applied on regions with seasonal turbidity by performing multi-temporal analysis, different approaches are needed in regions where the water is constantly turbid or only exhibits subtle turbidity variations through time. This study aims to detect these turbid zones (TZs) in optically shallow coastal waters using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 surface reflectance datasets to improve the aforementioned studies. The herein framework can be paired with other aquatic ecology remote sensing studies to establish the clear water focus area and can also be used by decision makers to identify rehabilitation areas. We selected the coastlines of Guinea-Bissau, Tunisia, and west Madagascar as our case studies which feature wide-ranging turbidity intensities across tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean waters and applied three different methods for the TZ detection: Otsu’s method for bimodal thresholding, linear spectral unmixing, and Random Forest (RF) machine learning method on Google Earth Engine as an end-to-end process. Based on our experiments, the RF method yields good results in all study regions with overall accuracies ranging between 88 and 96% and F1-scores between 0.87 and 0.96. TZ detection is highly site-specific due to the inter-class variability that is mainly affected by the nature of the suspended materials and the environmental characteristics of the site. © Copyright © 2021 Pertiwi, Lee and Traganos.","","Google Earth Engine; machine learning; multi-temporal data; Sentinel-2; spectral unmixing; turbidity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115712409"

Essential to RRN are the pseudo-invariant features (PIFs)–ground objects with invariant reflectance across the acquisition dates of multiple images. To meet the requirements of RRN for change detection in multi-temporal images, this paper proposed a novel automatic method for PIF extraction: first, we calculated spectral, spatial, and visual features for the images. Next, a set of change vectors were generated to quantify the features’ differences. Then, the initial PIF was obtained by synthesizing similar pixels from each change vector. Finally, an iterative linear regression was performed to generate the final PIFs. Furthermore, we employed the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to establish the RRN model for normalizing the target image. The methods and workflow of PIF extraction and the RRN model establishment were validated with two TripleSat-2 multi-spectral images with a spatial resolution of 3.2 metres. The applicability of the proposed PIF extraction method was further validated by Landsat-8 OLI, GF-1 WFV, Sentinel-2 MSI, and WorldView-2 images. The results showed that: (1) The proposed PIF extraction method can automatically obtain the PIFs with high precision. Based on the extracted PIFs, the RANSAC algorithm is capable of building the RRN model with a significant linear relationship. (2) The PIF extraction method is applicable to multi-spectral images with different spatial resolutions. (3) Compared with the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) and the iteratively reweighted MAD (IR-MAD), the proposed PIF extraction method achieved a better performance in selecting the pixels with smaller radiometric differences, which is helpful to reach a higher accuracy of the RRN model. (4) Differences in image brightness, spectral domain, and spatial domain are considered in the PIF extraction method with fewer parameters and high portability. (5) Spectral features are dominant to obtain ideal PIFs, and feature combinations can get the advantages to enhance the effectiveness of the PIFs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Extraction; Iterative methods; Pixels; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Alteration detections; High resolution image; Linear relationships; Multi-temporal image; Multispectral images; Pseudo-invariant features; Random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm; Relative radiometric normalization; automation; data acquisition; data processing; image analysis; Landsat; multispectral image; pattern recognition; radiometer; remote sensing; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108061612"

The results are then checked against a validation set independently extracted by multiple teams in different geographical areas using high resolution imagery.Quantitative results over four regions of interest, each with the geographical extension of 100 × 100 km2, confirm the validity of the proposed procedure. These regions, located in Siberia, Italy, Africa and Brazil, were selected to test the methodology over completely different climate regions.

The European Space Agency Sentinel-2 mission, thanks to its spatial (10-20 m) and spectral resolution (12 spectral bands registered in visible-, near-, and mid-infrared spectrum) and primarily its short revisit time (5 days), helps to provide reliable and accurate material for the identification of mountain vegetation. Using the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm and reference data (botanical map of non-forest vegetation, field survey data, and high spatial resolution images) it was possible to classify eight vegetation types of Giant Mountains: bogs and fens, deciduous shrub vegetation, forests, grasslands, heathlands, subalpine tall forbs, subalpine dwarf pine scrubs, and rock and scree vegetation. Additional variables such as principal component analysis (PCA) bands and selected vegetation indices were included in the best classified dataset. The results of the iterative classification, repeated 100 times, were assessed as approximately 80% median overall accuracy (OA) based on multi-temporal datasets composed of images acquired through the vegetation growing season (from late spring to early autumn 2018), better than using a single-date scene (70%-72% OA).

However, large datasets needed to accurately assess SOC at high resolution across scales are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Ancillary geodata, including remote sensing spectral indices (RS-SIs) and topographic indicators (TIs), have been proposed as spatial covariates. Reported relationships between SOC and RS-SIs are erratic, possibly because single-date RS-SIs do not accurately capture SOC spatial variability due to transient confounding factors in the soil (e.g., moisture). However, multitemporal RS-SI data analysis may lead to noise reduction in SOC versus RS-SI relationships. This study aimed at: i) comparing single-date versus multitemporal RS-Sis derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for assessment of topsoil (0–0.2 m) SOC in two agricultural fields located in south-eastern Brazil; ii) comparing the performance of RS-SIs and TIs; iii) using adequate RS-SIs and TIs to compare sampling schemes defined on different collection grids; and iv) studying the temporal changes of SOC (0–0.2 m and 0.2–0.4 m). Results showed that: i) single-date RS-SIs were not reliable proxies for topsoil SOC at the study sites. For most of the tested RS-SIs, multitemporal data analysis produced accurate proxies for SOC; e.g., for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the 4.5th multitemporal percentile predicted SOC with an R2 of 0.64; ii) The best TI was elevation (ranging from 643 to 684 m) with an R2 of 0.70; iii) The multitemporal SI and elevation maps indicated that the different sampling schemes were equally representative of the topsoil SOC's distribution across the entire area; and iv) From 2012 through 2019, topsoil SOC increased from 19.3 to 24.1 g kg−1. The ratio between SOC in the topsoil and subsoil (0.2–0.4 m) decreased from 1.7 to 1.1.

Remote sensing can be a potent tool employed in the field of environmental compliance. However, to extract and distribute relevant information to potential stakeholders, simple, yet efficient and robust approaches are needed. The focus of our research is the development of EO algorithms and the corresponding EO processing chains that could be used operationally for providing cost-efficient information to end-users to address environmental compliance and tackle environmental violations over specific thematic domains using freely available Copernicus data.

The case considers several sites along the border to Albania, from the coastal area of Velika Plau3/4a to the North Lake Skadar National Park. All sites have been designated in the past as protected areas, due to their rich biodiversity and threatened habitats.

High temporal and spectral resolution remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 mission enables the derivation of accurate and timely maps of tree species in forests in a cost-efficient way. However, there is still a lack of studies regarding forest stand species mapping for large areas like the Polish Carpathian Mountains (approx. 20,000 km2). In this study, we aimed to develop a workflow to obtain forest stand species maps with machine learning algorithms applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-2 products and environmental data at regional scale. Using variable importance techniques - Variable Importance Using Random Forests (VSURF) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) - we assessed three Sentinel-2 Best Available Pixel composites (April, July and October), eight annual spectral-temporal metrics (STM; mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, range, first quartile, third quartile and interquartile range), and four environmental topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, distance to water bodies), i.e. 114 variables in total. Following a variable importance assessment, we produced maps of eleven tree species with the use of three Machine Learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) on nine different variable subsets, i.e. in total 27 classifications. The results showed that SVM outperformed the other two classifiers - the highest overall accuracy exceeded 85% for SVM classification of all variables (86.9%), and 64 variables (85.6%). Including elevation information improved the accuracies. From the best five classifications we created a final ensemble map (overall accuracy of 86.6%) and a precision map based on the Simpson Index, which indicates where the five models agree. This ensemble approach allowed us to determine that the lowest precision occurred in foothills and basins with lower forest cover, in the areas with lack of good quality imagery, and at the borders of stands with homogenous species composition. On the other hand, the highest precision occurred in regions with homogenous stands with high forest and canopy cover. The study demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery and topographic data in mapping forest stand species in large mountainous areas with high accuracy. Furthermore, it demonstrates the usefulness of the ensemble approach, which enables to assess the classification precision. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Carpathians; Adaptive boosting; Biodiversity; Biohazards; Decision trees; Forestry; Mapping; Random forests; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Classification precision; Inter quartile ranges; Management strategies; Recursive feature elimination; Species composition; Species distributions; Temporal and spectral resolutions; Variable importances; accuracy assessment; algorithm; biodiversity; classification; forest management; machine learning; management practice; precision; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; stand structure; vegetation cover; vegetation mapping; Learning systems","Classification; Ensemble; Extreme gradient boosting; Mountains; Random forest; Support vector machines; Vegetation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091593190"

Fuzzy classification models that infer sub-pixel composition could further be used to compensate for small channel widths imaged at 10 m of spatial resolution. A major challenge to this approach is the acquisition of suitable training data useable in machine learning models that can predict land-cover type information from image radiance values. In this contribution, we present a method which combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Sentinel-2 imagery in order to develop a fuzzy classification approach capable of large-scale investigations. Our approach uses hyperspatial UAV imagery in order to derive high-resolution class information that can be used to train fuzzy classification models for Sentinel-2 data where all bands are super-resolved to a spatial resolution of 10 m. We use a multi-temporal UAV dataset covering an area of 5.25 km2. Using a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, we predict sub-pixel membership for Sentinel-2 pixels in the fluvial corridor as divided into classes of water, vegetation and dry sediment. Our CNN model can predict fuzzy class memberships with median errors from −5% to +3% and mean absolute errors from 10% to 20%. We also show that our CNN fuzzy predictor can be used to predict crisp classes with accuracies from 95.5% to 99.9%. Finally, we use an example to show how a fuzzy CNN model trained with localized UAV data can be applied to longer channel reaches and detect new vegetation growth. We therefore argue that the novel use of UAVs as field validation tools for freely available satellite data can bridge the scale gap between local and regional fluvial studies. © 2020 The Authors.

However, there is a lack of tools based on objective observations for assessing cropland C budgets at the plot scale over large areas. Such tools would allow us to more precisely establish the contribution of an agricultural plot to net CO2 emissions according to the plot management and identify levers for improving the C budget. In this study, we present a diagnostic regional modelling approach, called SAFY-CO2, that assimilates high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) optical remote sensing data in a simple crop model and evaluate the performance of this approach in quantifying crop production and the main components of the annual carbon budget for winter wheat. The SAFY-CO2 model simulates daily crop development (biomass, partition to leaves, etc.), the components of net ecosystem CO2 fluxes, and the annual yield and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB). Multi-temporal green area index (GAI) maps derived from HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to calibrate the light-use efficiency and phenological parameters of the model. Data from the literature were used to set a priori values for a set of model parameters, and a large dataset of in situ data was used for model validation. This dataset includes 8 years of eddy-covariance net CO2 flux measurements and GAI, biomass and yield data acquired at 2 instrumented sites in southwest France. Biomass and yield data from 16 fields in the study area between 2005 and 2014 were also used for validation. The SAFY-CO2 model is able to reproduce both GAI dynamics (RRMSE = 14%, R2 = 0.97) and biomass production and yield (RRMSE of 27% and 21%, respectively) with high precisions under contrasting climatic, environmental and management conditions. Additionally, the net CO2 flux components estimated by the model generally agreed well with in situ data and presented very good and significant correlations (RMSE of 1.74, 1.13 and 1.29 gC.m−2.d-1 for GPP, Reco and NEE, respectively; R2 of 0.90, 0.75 and 0.85 for GPP, Reco and NEE, respectively) over the 8 studied years. This study also highlights the importance of accounting for post-harvest vegetative events (spontaneous re-growth, weed development and cover crops) for an accurate calculation of the annual net CO2 flux. This approach requires a limited number of input parameters for estimating yield and net CO2 flux components, which is promising for regional/global-scale applications based on Sentinel 2-like data; however, the approach requires plot-scale data concerning organic amendments and straw management (exportation) in animal farming systems to calculate field C budgets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","France; Animalia; Triticum aestivum; Agricultural robots; Biomass; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Large dataset; Remote sensing; Accurate calculations; Biomass productions; CO2 flux measurement; Light use efficiency; Optical remote sensing data; Remote sensing data; Soil carbon storage; Spatial and temporal resolutions; agricultural soil; carbon budget; carbon emission; carbon flux; data assimilation; estimation method; greenhouse gas; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; soil carbon; wheat; winter; Information management","Carbon budget; Crop modelling; Remote sensing monitoring; Winter wheat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086892814"

Vegetation traits (structural characteristics such as spatial cover and repartition; biochemical parameters—pigment and water contents, growth rate, phenological cycle…) and plant species identity are indirect and powerful indicators of residual contamination detection in soil. Multi-temporal multispectral satellite imagery, such as the Sentinel-2 time series, is an operational environment monitoring system widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. For this purpose, methodology based on a multi-temporal fusion method at the feature level is applied to vegetation monitoring for several years from the closure and revegetation of an ore processing site. Features are defined by 26 spectral indices from the literature and seasonal and annual change detection maps are inferred. Three indices—CIred-edge (CIREDEDGE), IRECI (Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index) and PSRI (Plant Senescence Reflectance Index)—are particularly suitable for detecting changes spatially and temporally across the study area. The analysis is conducted separately for phyto-stabilized vegetation zones and natural vegetation zones.

Development of novel approach to Monitor wildfire progressions in near real-time is therefore of critical importance for emergency responses. The objective of this research is to investigate continuous learning with U-Net by exploiting both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI time series for increasing the frequency and accuracy of wildfire progression mapping. In this study, optical-based burned areas prior to each SAR acquisition (when available) were accumulated into SAR-based pseudo progression masks to train a deep residual U-Net model. Unlike multi-temporal fusion of SAR and optical data, the temporal fusion of progression masks allows us to track as many wildfire progressions as possible. Specifically, two approaches were investigated to train the deep residual U-Net model for continuous learning: 1) Continuous joint training (CJT) with all historical data (including both SAR and optical data); 2) Learning without forgetting (LwF) based on newly incoming data alone (SAR or optical). For LwF, a mean squared loss was integrated to keep the capabilities learned before and prevent it from overfitting to newly incoming data only. By fusing optical-based burned areas, SAR-based progression pseudo masks improve significantly, which benefits both data sampling and model training, considering the challenges in SAR-based change extraction attributed to the variability in SAR backscatter of the surrounding environments. Pre-trained ResNet was frozen as the encoder of the U-Net model, and the decoder part was trained to further refine the derived burned area maps in a progression-wise manner. The experimental results demonstrated that LwF has the potential to match CJT in terms of the agreement between SAR-based results and optical-based ground truth, achieving a F1 score of 0.8423 on the Sydney Fire (2019–2020) and 0.7807 on the Chuckegg Creek Fire (2019). We also observed that the SAR cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) shows good capability in suppressing multiplicative noise and detecting burned areas when VH and VV have diverse temporal behaviors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Varanidae; Climate change; Deep learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Burned areas; Change detection; Deep learning; Near-real time; Net model; Optical-; SAR; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2.; U-net; algorithm; climate change; detection method; real time; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series; time series analysis; wild population; wildfire; Fires","Burned area; Change detection; Deep learning; SAR; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2.; U-Net; Wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105352138"

Accurate and timely extraction of the garlic planting area is critical for adjusting the agricultural planting structure and implementing rural policy actions. Crop extraction methods based on remote sensing usually use spectral–temporal features. Still, for garlic extraction, most methods simply combine all multi-temporal images. There has been a lack of research on each band’s function in each multi-temporal image and optimal bands combination. To systematically explore the potential of the multi-temporal method for garlic extraction, we obtained a series of Sentinel-2 images in the whole garlic growth cycle. The importance of each band in all these images was ranked by the random forest (RF) method. According to the importance score of each band, eight different multi-temporal combination schemes were designed. The RF classifier was employed to extract garlic planting area, and the accuracy of the eight schemes was compared. The results show that (1) the Scheme VI (the top 39 bands in importance score) achieved the best accuracy of 98.65%, which is 6% higher than the optimal mono-temporal (February, wintering period) result, and (2) the red-edge band and the shortwave-infrared band played an essential role in accurate garlic extraction. This study gives inspiration in selecting the remotely sensed data source, the band, and phenology for accurately extracting garlic planting area, which could be transferred to other sites with larger areas and similar agriculture structures. © 2021 by the authors.

Owing to the ever-growing availability of free data and software, remote sensing (RS) techniques have been primarily used to map, analyse, and monitor natural resources for conservation purposes. The need to adopt multi-scale and multi-temporal approaches to detect different phenological as-pects of different vegetation types and species has also emerged. The time-series composite image approach allows for capturing much of the spectral variability, but presents some criticalities (e.g., time-consuming research, downloading data, and the required storage space). To overcome these issues, the Google Earth engine (GEE) has been proposed, a free cloud-based computational platform that allows users to access and process remotely sensed data at petabyte scales. The application was tested in a natural protected area in Calabria (South Italy), which is particularly representative of the Mediterranean mountain forest environment. In the research, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) algorithms were used to perform supervised pixel-based classification based on the use of Sentinel-2 images. A process to select the best input image (seasonal composition strategies, statistical operators, band composition, and derived vegetation indices (VIs) information) for classification was implemented. A set of accuracy indicators, including overall accuracy (OA) and multi-class F-score (Fm ), were computed to assess the results of the different classifications. GEE proved to be a reliable and powerful tool for the classification process. The best results (OA = 0.88 and Fm = 0.88) were achieved using RF with the summer image composite, adding three VIs (NDVI, EVI, and NBR) to the Sentinel-2 bands. SVM and RF produced OAs of 0.83 and 0.80, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant.

Secondly, the forest cover was sub-classified into coniferous forest and broad-leaved forest. In the end, eight types of coniferous forests (Cupressus funebris forest, Abies forest, Pinus densata forest, Picea forest, Pinus yunnanensis forest, Larix forest, Pinus armandi forest, Tsuga dumosa forest) were identified within the cover of coniferous forest.

Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km × 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116′000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2. We compare our proposed hierarchical convRNN model with several baselines, including methods designed for imbalanced class distributions.

However, accurate map of paddy rice is a long-term challenge because of its spatiotemporal discontinuity and short duration. To solve this problem, this study proposed a paddy rice area extraction approach by using the combination of optical vegetation indices and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This method is designed to overcome the data-missing problem due to cloud contamination and spatiotemporal discontinuities of the traditional optical remote sensing method. More specifically, the Sentinel-1A SAR and the Sentinel-2 multispectral imager (MSI) Level-2A imagery are used to identify paddy rice with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Three vegetation indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI), are estimated from optical bands. Two polarization bands (VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical)) are used to overcome the cloud contamination problem. This approach was applied with the random forest machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform for the Jianghan Plain in China as an experimental area. The results of 39 experiments uncovered the effect of different factors. The results indicated that the combination of VV and VH band showed a better performance compared with other polarization bands; the average producer's accuracy of paddy rice (PA) is 72.79%, 1.58% higher than the second one VH. Secondly, the combination of three indices also showed a better result than others, with average PA 73.82%, 1.42% higher than using NDVI alone. The classification result presented the best combination is EVI, VV, and VH polarization band. The producer's accuracy of paddy rice was 76.67%, with the overall accuracy (OA) of 66.07%, and Kappa statistics of 0.45. However, NDVI, EVI, and VH showed better performance in mapping the morphology. The results demonstrated the method developed in this study can be successfully applied to the cloud-prone area for mapping paddy rice to overcome the data missing caused by cloud and rain during the paddy growing season. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision trees; Engines; Machine learning; Mapping; Morphology; Polarization; Radar imaging; Random forests; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Vegetation; Water management; Classification results; Cloud contamination; Enhanced vegetation index; Land surface water index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical remote sensing; Temporal and spatial; Waterresource management; Synthetic aperture radar","EVI; Google Earth Engine; LSWI; NDVI; Paddy rice; Precision farming; SAR; SAR data; Sentinel images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092076309"

Many studies have investigated the feasibility of retrieving leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) using vegetation indices (VIs) of multiple plant species, yet very few studies have examined the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for mapping LCC of mangrove forests. With field collected leaf SPAD values (relative chlorophyll content), this study explored the relationship of leaf SPAD values against five types of newly-developed VIs derived from leaf hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 data of four periods (May 2018, January 2019, August 2019, and December 2019). Linear regression with best-performing VIs and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) were developed to construct the SPAD retrieval model in each period. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was employed to compare the estimation results of VIs and KRR method, and the four periods of SPAD maps were produced by the best-performing model. The results showed that the newly-developed index (ratio of single-band reflectance to the sum of two bands reflectance, RSSI) achieved the high correlation coefficient with leaf SPAD value at both leaf and canopy level. At canopy level, the linear model using RSSI (B8/(B2 + B5), B8a/(B2 + B4), B8/(B2 + B5), and B8/(B2 + B3)) outperformed than that using traditional broadband indices and KRR model with R2adjust = 0.496, 0.742, 0.681, and 0.801; RMSE = 5.75, 4.29, 4.00, and 3.46; and RE = 7.67%, 5.68%, 4.97%, and 4.63% in each period. We concluded that there are great potentials of newly-developed index of RSSI using Sentinel-2 data for regional retrieving and mapping LCC of mangrove forests across different time periods, which is essential for mangrove ecological conservation and restoration. © 2021 The Author(s)","Indicator indicator; chlorophyll; leaf; mangrove; mapping; Sentinel","Leaf chlorophyll content; Mangrove forests; Sentinel-2; SPAD value; Vegetation index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120675520"

The multi-temporal satellite data and image processing techniques are usually employed to monitor changes in vegetation dynamics. In this study, the decadal changes of mangrove forests were accomplished along the Odisha coast, India using the Landsat–5 and Sentinel–2A satellite data for 2009 and 2019, respectively. The satellite data were obtained and processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This study aims to derive the spatial extent of mangrove using the high-resolution satellite data and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The result reveals that the total mangrove extent increased from 222.43 km2 (2009) to 252.47 km2 (2019) which indicates an increase in area by 30.04 km2 (or 13.5%) during the last one decade. The highest increase in mangrove area was in Hatamudia Reserve Forest (15.54 km2) and coastal belt of Bhadrak (9.46 km2) followed by Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara (3.05 km2), Baranaula and Akumi River estuary in Jagatsinghpur (1.12 km2), and Subarnarekha River intertidal zone in Baleshwar (0.87 km2). A significant increase in mangrove forests occurred due to plantation, awareness, restoration, and coastal zone management plan.

Because this classification is frequently required to be completed within a specific time frame, performance is also essential. In this work, we propose a new method that creates synthetic images by extracting satellite data at the pixel level, processing all available bands, as well as their data distributed over time considering images from multiple dates. With this approach, data from images of Sentinel-2 are used by a deep convolutional network system, which will extract the necessary information to discern between different types of crops over a year after being trained with data from previous years. Following the proposed methodology, it is possible to classify crops and distinguish between several crop classes while also being computationally low-cost.

Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and in a timely manner obtain the LULC maps where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level area, Xiong’an New Area, was established in China. In order to better characterize the LULC changes in Xiong’an New Area, this study makes full use of the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images, the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and the powerful classification capability of random forest (RF) models to generate the continuous LULC maps from 2017 to 2020. To do so, a novel multiple RF-based classification framework is adopted by outputting the classification probability based on each monthly composite and aggregating the multiple probability maps to generate the final classification map. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzes the spatio-temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years and the different change patterns in three counties. Experimental results indicate that the derived LULC maps achieve high accuracy for each year, with the overall accuracy and Kappa values no less than 0.95. It is also found that the changed areas account for nearly 36%, and the dry farmland, impervious surface, and other land-cover types have changed dramatically and present varying change patterns in three counties, which might be caused by the latest planning of Xiong’an New Area. The obtained 10-m four-year LULC maps in this study are supposed to provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of LULC changes have taken place in Xiong’an New Area. © 2021 by the authors.

In New Zealand, knowledge of forest composition and extent informs predator control measures to protect native bird life, particularly in forests dominated by Southern beeches (Nothofagaceae). As high-resolution (> 1:50,000) maps of beech cover do not exist at national scale, we present a method to identify and map beech cover that combines multi-temporal spectral signatures from ESA's Sentinel-2 satellite with forest plot survey data. A temporal stack of satellite imagery from 2016 to 2019 is used to derive annual metrics (mean and standard deviation) of vegetation indices which are used as input to a pixel-wise classification. A random forest classification, discriminating between beech/non-beech areas (with a beech relative cover threshold of 25%), and trained using 880 forest plots from the Land Use and Carbon Analysis System (LUCAS) natural forest network, achieved an accuracy of 87.7% (± 2.2%).

There is a need to move towards near real-time monitoring of land degradation using new sensors to detect degraded landscapes. Recently launched Sentinel-2 sensor presents the opportunity to collect high-resolution data regularly. Multi-temporal datasets provide crucial information to isolate evidence of land degradation from temporal changes in vegetation cover incurred as a result of climatic and phenological variability. This study applied an integrated approach involving multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 data with environmental variables (i.e. soil moisture, rainfall, slope, evapotranspiration, elevation, soil temperature, rainfall, soil temperature, aspect and albedo). A stratified random sampling approach based on dominant land cover types were used to assess land degradation. Field plots of 20 m × 20 m were setup with three 50 cm × 50 cm quadrants inside. In each quadrant, the percentage estimation of vegetation cover and Leaf Area Index was measured. The model training and validation was implemented using the Random Forest algorithm based on default parameters. The pooled model represents the dry and wet seasons combined.

Conversion to cropland, coupled with secondary dependencies on and scarcity of wood products, has driven the deforestation and degradation of natural forests in Southeast Asia. Concomitantly, forest plantations have been established both within and outside of forests, with the latter (as contiguous blocks) and are the focus of this study. Accurately mapping smallholder forest plantations in South and Southeast Asia is difficult using remotely sensed data due to the plantations' small size (average of 2 hectares), short rotation ages (4–7 years for timber species), and spectral similarities to croplands and natural forests. Cloud-free Harmonized landsat sentinel-2 (HLS) S10 data were acquired over six dates, from different seasons, over four years (2015–2018). Available in situ data on forest plantations was supplemented with additional training data resulting in 2230 high-quality samples aggregated into three land cover classes: nonforest, natural forest, and forest plantations. Image classification used random forests on a thirty-band stack consisting of the VNIR bands and NDVI images for all six dates. The median classification accuracy from the 5-fold cross-validation was 94.3%. Our results, predicated on high-quality training data, demonstrate that (mostly smallholder) forest plantations can be separated from natural forests even using only the sentinel-2 VNIR bands when multitemporal data (across both years and seasons) are used. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Andhra Pradesh; India; Decision trees; Deforestation; Infrared devices; Classification accuracy; Cross validation; Forest plantation; Multi-temporal data; Multispectral instruments; Remotely sensed data; Spectral similarity; Visible and near infrared; agricultural land; data; forestry; Landsat; machine learning; NDVI; plantation; remote sensing; Sentinel; smallholder; temporal analysis; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; Photomapping","classification; JULIA machine learning; NDVI; random forest; remote sensing; trees outside forests","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113134330"

However, with the increasing volume of remote sensing data, a key emerging issue in the field of crop classification is how to find useful information from massive data to balance classification accuracy and processing time. To address this challenge, we developed a novel crop classification method, combining optimal feature selection (OFSM) with hybrid convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) networks for multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. This research used 234 features including spectral, segmentation, color, and texture features from three scenes of Sentinel-2 images to identify crop types in the Jilin province of northeast China. To effectively extract the effective features of remote sensing data with lower time requirements, the use of OFSM was proposed with the results compared with two traditional feature selection methods (TFSM): random forest feature importance selection (RF-FI) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). Although the time required for OFSM was 26.05 s, which was between RF-FI with 1.97 s and RF-RFE with 132.54 s, OFSM outperformed RF-FI and RF-RFE in terms of the overall accuracy (OA) of crop classification by 4% and 0.3%, respectively. On the basis of obtaining effective feature information, to further improve the accuracy of crop classification we designed two hybrid CNN-RF networks to leverage the advantages of one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) with random forest (RF), respectively. Based on the selected optimal features using OFSM, four networks were tested for comparison: Conv1D-RF, VGG-RF, Conv1D, and VGG. Conv1D-RF achieved the highest OA at 94.27% as compared with VGG-RF (93.23%), Conv1D (92.59%), and VGG (91.89%), indicating that the Conv1D-RF method with optimal feature input provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation for multi-temporal crop-type classification. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image segmentation; Random forests; Remote sensing; Textures; Classification accuracy; Crop classification methods; Crop type classification; Feature selection methods; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Optical remote sensing; Optimal feature selections; Random forest-recursive feature eliminations; Classification (of information)","Convolutional neural network; Crop classification; Data fusion; Feature selection; Multi-temporal remote sensing images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092509573"

Existing paddy rice mapping methods are often remote sensing technologies based on optical images. However, the availability of high-quality remotely sensed paddy rice growing area data is limited due to frequent cloud cover and rain over the southwest China. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a paddy rice field mapping method by combining a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm and a phenology-based algorithm. First, a modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator (MNSPI) time series approach was used to remove clouds on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images in 2020. A flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) model was used to fuse Sentinel-2 data and MODIS data to obtain multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. Then, the fused remote sensing data were used to construct fusion time series data to produce time series vegetation indices (NDVI\LSWI) having a high spatiotemporal resolution (10 m and ≤16 days). On this basis, the unique physical characteristics of paddy rice during the transplanting period and other auxiliary data were combined to map paddy rice in Yongchuan District, Chongqing, China. Our results were validated by field survey data and showed a high accuracy of the proposed method indicated by an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.85. The paddy rice planting area map was also consistent with the official data of the third national land survey; at the town level, the correlation between official survey data and paddy rice area was 92.5%. The results show that this method can effectively map paddy rice fields in a cloudy and rainy area. © 2021 by the authors.

Current methods take a holistic approach to landscape heritage and promote an interdisciplinary dialogue to facilitate complementary landscape management strategies.

The advent of freeware cloud computing services has enabled significant improvements in landscape research allowing the rapid exploration and processing of satellite imagery such as the Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel datasets. This research represents one of the first applications of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python application programming interface (API) in studies of historic landscapes.

Habitats integrate both the environmental conditions and the related biodiversity. However, it remains challenging to map certain habitats such as inland wetlands due to spectral, spatial and temporal variability in the vegetation cover. Currently, no satellite constellations optimize the spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions required to map wetlands according to the habitats discriminated from in situ surveys. Our approach aims to combine satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to exceed their respective limitations. Both data sources were combined through a spectral unmixing algorithm with the hypothesis that endmembers from UAV data are pure enough to enhance plant community abundances estimated from satellite data. The experiment was conducted on the regional preserve of the Sougéal marsh, a wet grassland of 174 ha located upstream of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay. Two satellite data sources - Sentinel-2 and Pleiades - and three acquisition periods - November 2017, April 2018 and May 2018 - were considered. A reference map of plant community distribution was produced from UAV multitemporal data and floristic surveys to validate the unmixing of satellite data. This study shows innovative results and perspectives: while UAV can improve habitat discrimination, results vary among acquisition periods and habitats. Results illustrate well the great potential of combined UAV and satellite data but also demonstrate the influence of endmembers on the unmixing process and technical limitations (e.g. spectral mismatches between sensors), which can be overcome using domain adaptation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","France; Manche; Mont Saint Michel Bay; Normandie; Antennas; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Mapping; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wetlands; Domain adaptation; Environmental conditions; Mont-saint-michel bays; Multi-temporal data; Satellite constellations; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial and temporal variability; Technical limitations; abundance; biodiversity; data acquisition; ecosystem management; environmental conditions; grassland; in situ measurement; plant community; Pleiades; satellite data; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation cover; wetland; Satellites","Endmember; Habitat mapping; LTSER Armorique; Sensor synergy; Spectral unmixing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Wetlands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083375195"

For that, not only remote sensing images are needed, but also ground truth information, which is a key factor for the development and improvement of methodologies using remote sensing data. While a variety of images are current available, inclusive cost-free images, field reference data is scarcer. For agricultural applications, especially in tropical regions such as Brazil, where the agriculture is very dynamic and diverse (recent agricultural frontiers, crop rotations, multiple cropping systems, several management practices, etc.), and cultivated over a vast territory, this task is not trivial. One way of boosting the researches in agricultural remote sensing is to stimulate people to share their data, and to foster different groups to use the same dataset, so distinct methods can be properly compared. In this context, our group created the LEM Benchmark Database (a project funded by the ISPRS Scientific Initiative project-2017) from the Luiz Eduardo Magalhães (LEM) municipality, Bahia State, Brazil. The database contains a set of pre-processed multitemporal satellite images (Landsat-8/OLI, Sentinel-2/MSI and SAR band-C Sentinel-1) and shapefiles of agricultural fields with their correspondent monthly land use classes, covering the period of one Brazilian crop year (2017-2018).

These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area ~ 3 × 104 km2) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (~7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (~400 m) to high elevations (~1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32–45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84–96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800–1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400–800 m) elevation bands, and the 800–1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Climate models; Flow velocity; Glaciers; Ice; Lakes; Runoff; Area fraction; Flow regimes; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Rivers and lakes; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface meltwater; Surface runoffs; climate modeling; correlation; flow control; flow velocity; ice flow; ice sheet; melting; meltwater; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; temporal analysis; water depth; Rivers","Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface runoff","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111800258"

Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types.

This paper proposes a new unsupervised change detection framework based on the joint use of SAR and optical images. The framework exploits a contrastive learning algorithm and the assumption of the scarcity of relevant changes. The proposed architecture is a pseudo-Siamese network, which is trained to regress the feature vector of bi-temporal concatenated SAR-optical input data. The output feature vectors from two branches of the pseudo-Siamese network are used to calculate change intensity maps. Then, the binary change map is obtained by setting a proper threshold. The proposed method is validated by using a multi-sensor dataset made up of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images that is also compared with the single use of each modality image. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of the multisensor approach over single modality and confirm the potentiality of the joint use of SAR and optical images in change detection. © 2021 IEEE.","","Change Detection; Data fusion; Remote sensing; Self-supervised Learning; Sentinel-1/-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126011595"

Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical “coffee belt,” hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural information and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences. © 2021","Viet Nam; Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Cultivation; Data fusion; Data integration; Decision trees; Deforestation; Engines; Feedstocks; Mapping; Remote sensing; Supply chains; Textures; Topography; Agroforestry; Crop mask; Google earth engine; Google earths; Production system; Random forests; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Smallholder agriculture; Viet Nam; coffee; crop production; livelihood; mapping method; radar altimetry; satellite data; Sentinel; smallholder; synthetic aperture radar; Crops","Agroforestry; Crop mask; Data fusion; Google Earth Engine; Random forest; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Smallholder agriculture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115794946"

Crop mapping is used to identify the croplands and their spatial distribution. For a reliable analysis and forecast for projection, multi-temporal data play a key role. Even current open and frequent optical satellite data such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat support monitoring, they are not always operational due to atmospheric conditions (rain, cloud cover, haze, etc.). On the other hand, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites provide alternative data sets compared to optical satellites since they can acquire images under all weather conditions. In this study, an annual cropland monitoring study is conducted using Sentinel-1 SAR. For the investigation, Tokat Province an agricultural region of Turkey, where the main source of income is agriculture, was selected. There are 4 different vegetation species (wheat, sunflower, sugar beet, corn) in the study area. Sentinel-1 data was used to generate time-series of each class and phenological structures of the crops. In this context, backscatter images of both vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarized data, and coherence of both VV and VH were produced from Sentinel-1 data. Time-Weighted Dynamic Time-Warping (TWDTW) classification approach was used over cropland. The produced time-series are classified under different scenarios. The results showed that only coherence has provided higher accuracies about 81% compared to using only backscatter images as 49%.  © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The detection of these vegetation types in semi-arid mountainous areas is challenging as trees are heavily mixed with other land cover types. Their mapping requires therefore high-resolution imagery. We propose to leverage the advantages and synergies of freely available Sentinel-2 data and a light-weight consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a simple red–greenblue (RGB) camera to detect these vegetation types. In our approach, an object-based random forest land cover classification is first developed over smaller sites using very high-resolution UAV data. The resulting maps are afterwards used as training data for multi-temporal Sentinel-2 based classifications at regional scale. We tested the approach in five different riparian landscapes of a semi-arid mountainous area in Iran. For comparison, mono- and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data were also used alone – without support from UAV data – to build pixel-based random forest classification models at regional scale. Our results show that compared to the best mono-temporal results, the multi-temporal classification approach improved the overall accuracy and Kappa values of Sentinel-2 classifications from 77.0% to 83.9% and 0.72 to 0.81, respectively. The producer's and user's accuracy of the riparian forest class were also improved from 64.0% to 70.0% and 57.1% to 73.7%, respectively. Combining UAV and Sentinel-2 data improved the overall accuracy only slightly, but enabled a much better detection of Persian oak stands – for this class, the producer's accuracy increased by 13.0 percentage points. Overall, we recommend the combined use of UAV and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data to detect Persian oak forest stands. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Iran; Antennas; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forestry; Random forests; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; High resolution imagery; Land-cover types; Multitemporal classification; Overall accuracies; Percentage points; Random forest classification; Riparian forests; Very high resolution; accuracy assessment; deciduous forest; image resolution; mountain region; photogrammetry; remotely operated vehicle; riparian zone; semiarid region; Sentinel; Aircraft detection","Mono- and multi-temporal; Random forest classification; Riparian landscapes; Sentinel-2; UAV","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089507537"

Remote sensing has historically been a source of data on land cover and recognized as the only practical systematic and wall-to-wall source for crop mapping. The European Copernicus programme and its free data policy for Sentinel-2 made accessible large volumes of imagery for frequent mapping and updating, generating new challenges. One such challenge is timely mapping through supervised image classification. The need for a prompt classification workflow requires training to become automatic, which typically relies on samples collected manually via fieldwork or image interpretation. Another challenge is to map land cover classes that traditionally have been troublesome to identify when satellite observations were sparse. For instance, crops have a spectral response that changes substantially throughout the year or during narrow time windows, which cannot be observed with few image acquisitions. This paper presents research ongoing in Portugal to develop a methodology for automatic image classification using training samples labelling with no human intervention. Rather, auxiliary datasets are used to randomly extract labelled points from large training samples to produce a land cover and crop map in raster format at 10 m spatial resolution using 2018 Sentinel-2 images. The proposed methodology was tested with the Random Forest classifier achieving an overall accuracy of 76%. These results are promising and support the idea of refining the methodology to move towards an annual land cover map production at the national scale. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Crops; Decision trees; Large dataset; Mapping; Remote sensing; Sampling; Automatic image classification; Image interpretation; Land cover informations; Overall accuracies; Random forest classifier; Satellite observations; Spatial resolution; Supervised image classifications; Image classification","Crop Mapping; Land Cover Mapping; Multi-temporal datasets; Portugal; Random Forest; Sentinel-2; Supervised Classification","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091167941"

This study presents a scalable classification framework, producing novel 10 m resolution land cover maps for Kobbefjord, Disko, and Zackenberg in Greenland.

Rice maps produced using low spatial resolution data cannot well delineate the detailed distribution of rice, while pixel-based mapping using medium and high resolutions has significant salt-and-pepper noise. (3) The cropping system is complex, and rice has a rotation schedule with other crops. Therefore, the Phenology-, Object-and Double Source-based (PODS) paddy rice mapping algorithm is implemented, which consists of three steps: (1) object extraction from multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images where the extracted objects (fields) are the basic classification units; (2) specifying the phenological stage of transplanting from Savitzky–Golay filtered enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series using the PhenoRice algorithm; and (3) the identification of rice objects based on flood signal detection from time-series microwave and optical signals of the Sentinel-1/2.

Processing was carried out using the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine geoservice. Results. Multi-temporal index images were obtained for the territory of inner mountain Dagestan. The time series of seasonal changes in the indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) were analyzed, making it possible to reveal the phenological patterns of vegetation and to map the vegetation cover on this basis. Schemes for decoding vegetation have been created by which areas are distinguished according to the following characteristics: devoid of vegetation, herbaceous vegetation of varying degrees of density or woody (deciduous and coniferous).

However, support for this agricultural sector is hampered by lack of reliable information on the distributions and acreage of smallholder fields. This information is essential in not only monitoring food security and informing markets but also in guiding the determination of levels of support required from government by individual farmers. There is urgent need for robust techniques that can be used to cost-effectively and time-efficiently map smallholder crop fields especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This study attempts to do this by using an approach in which optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are systematically combined and classified using Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost). We also investigated model stacking as another technique to improve classification accuracy. We combined Xgboost with Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The combined use of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 bands, spectral indices, and Sentinel-1 produced better results than exclusive use of optical data (α = 0.95, p = 0.0005). Furthermore, stacking of classification algorithms based on model comparisons achieved higher accuracy than stacking the algorithms indiscriminately (α = 0.95, p = 0.0100). Through systematic fusion of SAR and optical data and hyper-parameter tuning of Xgboost, we achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 97.71%, while achieving a maximum accuracy of 96.06% through model stacking. This highlights the importance of multi-sensor data fusion and multi-classifier systems when mapping fragmented agricultural landscapes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision trees; Food supply; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Mapping; Radar imaging; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural sector; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Maximum accuracies; Multiclassifier system; Multisensor data fusion; Poverty alleviation; agricultural land; artificial neural network; crop; food security; image processing; mapping method; smallholder; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; Sensor data fusion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090785369"

Rice production is facing a myriad of problems, including water shortage, climate, and land-use change. Accurate maps of rice growth stages are critical for monitoring rice production and assessing its impacts on national and global food security. Rice growth stages are typically monitored by coarse-resolution satellite imagery. However, it is difficult to accurately map due to the occurrence of mixed pixels in fragmented and patchy rice fields, as well as cloud cover, particularly in tropical countries. To solve these problems, we developed an automated mapping workflow to produce near real-time multi-temporal maps of rice growth stages at a 10-m spatial resolution using multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, MOD13Q1, and Sentinel-1). This study was investigated between 1 June and 29 September 2018 in two (wet and dry) areas of Java Island in Indonesia. First, we built prediction models based on Sentinel-2, and fusion of MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 using the ground truth information. Second, we applied the prediction models on all images in area and time and separation between the non-rice planting class and rice planting class over the cropping pattern. Moreover, the model’s consistency on the multitemporal map with a 5–30-day lag was investigated. The result indicates that the Sentinel-2 based model classification gives a high overall accuracy of 90.6% and the fusion model MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1 shows 78.3%. The performance of multitemporal maps was consistent between time lags with an accuracy of 83.27–90.39% for Sentinel-2 and 84.15% for the integration of Sentinel-2/MOD13Q1/Sentinel-1. The results from this study show that it is possible to integrate multisource remote sensing for regular monitoring of rice phenology, thereby generating spatial information to support local-, national-, and regional-scale food security applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) can support this activity, particularly when using data from a platform, like the Sentinel-2A/B twin mission of the Copernicus programme, which provides routine and repetitive image acquisition at 10 m spatial resolution. As a result, SDB can expand on the temporal and spatial scope of more conventional mapping methods, such as lidar (or multi-beam). In this study, we use SDB, in comparison with high-resolution airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB), to quantify bathymetric changes at two inlets in North Carolina following the impacts of the devastating Hurricane Florence in September 2018. A recently developed multi-temporal SDB model that overcomes problems associated with turbidity and noise effects (whitecaps, ships, cloud shadows, etc.) is used with Sentinel-2 imagery. We identify bathymetric changes in shallow areas with navigation channels in two of the most dynamic inlets in the Outer Banks, Oregon and Hatteras. Multiple lidar surveys are used to validate the SDB method and for an assessment of accuracy and vertical uncertainty. The multi-temporal SDB products and ALB both show similar results in the erosion/accretion patterns. Comparing the change determined from the two methods, gives a median absolute error of ~0.5 m of SDB compared with ALB, with bias of ±0.2 m for depths ≤7 m; errors that are equivalent to those associated with the SDB estimated absolute depths. The composited SDB yields greater spatial coverage than lidar because it can retrieve data in areas where the lidar mission may have been constrained by turbidity or surf, and also because of the 300-km swath width. The Sentinel-2 constellation provides five-day revisit at the equator (more frequent at higher latitudes), allowing rapid construction of a bathymetric map as well as developing an archive for retrospective analysis. By implementing the multi-temporal turbidity correction, SDB based on Sentinel-2 may substantially enhance existing survey methods for change detection and support operational and recursive coastal monitoring on local to regional scales. © 2021 The Authors","North Carolina; United States; Rosa carolina carolina; Satellites; Mapping; Maps; Optical radar; Surveys; Turbidity; Coastal monitoring; Conventional mapping; Design applications; Navigation channels; Rapid construction; Retrospective analysis; Spatial resolution; Temporal and spatial; accretion; bathymetry; detection method; erosion; hurricane; lidar; mapping; satellite data; Sentinel; survey; Bathymetry","Airborne lidar bathymetry; Copernicus programme; Erosion/accretion; Hurricane Florence; Recursive mapping; Satellite-derived bathymetry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111196932"

We aimed to distinguish fields of two C4 gramineae with similar plant structure and crop calendar, maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), in an agricultural area of the state of Guanajuato, in central México. One hundred and forty-three fields of these two crops were identified and their average spectral signatures were derived at different phenological stages, using digital information from 11 Sentinel 2A/B images, corresponding to the 2019 spring-summer cycle. We also calculated the temporal profile of six spectral indices for each crop, to evaluate seasonal variations and conducted a cropland classification, using the random forests algorithm and different combinations of dates and indices. Results show that segregation of maize and sorghum fields can be achieved due to small differences in the near-infrared region of their spectral signatures and disparities in the rate of decay during the senescence stage. Classification results also confirmed the separability of these two crops, obtaining a very high overall accuracy and kappa values (98.43% and 97.07%, correspondingly) based on the reflectance of nine images and only three spectral indices: the normalized difference vegetation index, the normalized difference water index, and the structure insensitive pigment index. This investigation demonstrates that the combined use of time series of high-resolution images and spectral indices can contribute to distinguish fields of similar crop species. © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Grain (agricultural product); Infrared devices; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Classification results; Digital information; High resolution image; Near infrared region; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; Optical remote sensing; Phenological stage; Crops","crop classification; maize; random forests algorithm; Sentinel-2; sorghum; spectral indices","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109000188"

The declarations used in the research were randomly divided into two independent sets (training and test). Based on the training set, supervised classification of both single images and their combinations was performed using random forest algorithm in SNAP (ESA) and our own Python scripts. A comparative accuracy analysis was performed on the basis of two forms of confusion matrix (full confusion matrix commonly used in remote sensing and binary confusion matrix used in machine learning) and various accuracy metrics (overall accuracy, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, etc.). The highest overall accuracy (81%) was obtained in the simultaneous classification of multitemporal images (three Sentinel-2 and one Sentinel-1). An unexpectedly high accuracy (79%) was achieved in the classification of one Sentinel-2 image at the end of May 2018. Noteworthy is the fact that the accuracy of the random forest method trained on the entire training set is equal 80% while using the sampling method ca. 50%. Based on the analysis of various accuracy metrics, it can be concluded that the metrics used in machine learning, for example: Specificity and accuracy, are always higher then the overall accuracy. These metrics should be used with caution, because unlike the overall accuracy, to calculate these metrics, not only true positives but also false positives are used as positive results, giving the impression of higher accuracy. Correct calculation of overall accuracy values is essential for comparative analyzes. Reporting the mean accuracy value for the classes as overall accuracy gives a false impression of high accuracy.

For decades now, remote sensing has been largely used to investigate spatial and temporal changes in land use and water resources. Today, different satellite products provide fast and crucial knowledge for the study of hydrological disasters over large areas, possibly in remote regions, with high spatial resolution and high revisit frequency. Yet, until now, few works have sought to detect the full range of extreme rainfall-related damages with optical imagery, especially those caused by intense rainwater runoff beyond the direct vicinity of major waterways. The work presented in this paper focuses on the Aude severe weather event of October 15th, 2018, in the South of France, for which more than a thousand claims for agricultural disaster were registered, both related to river overflowing and rainwater runoff. The full resources of ground truths, contextual information, land use as well as digital elevation model (DEM) combined to high resolution and high frequency optical imagery (Sentinel-2, Pléiades) are used to develop an automatic damage detection method based on supervised classification algorithms. Through the combination of several indicators characterizing heterogeneous spectral variations among agricultural plots following the event, a Gaussian process classifier achieved various classification accuracies up to 90% on a large comparable and independent photo-interpreted validation sample.

This goal can be achieved through a better knowledge of vineyard spatial variability. Traditional platforms such as airborne, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) solutions are useful investigation tools for vineyard site specific management. These remote sensing techniques are mainly exploited to get the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is useful for describing the morpho-vegetational characteristics of vineyards. This study was conducted in a vineyard in Tuscany (Italy) during the 2017, 2018 and 2019 seasons. Ground data were acquired to detect some agronomic variables such as yield (kg/vine), total soluble solids (TSS), and pruning weight (kg/vine). Remote sensed multispectral images acquired by UAV and Sentinel 2 (S2) satellite platform were used to assess the analysis of the vegetative variability. The UAV NDVI was extracted using both a mixed pixels approach (both vine and inter-row) and from pure canopy pixels. In addition to these UAV layers, the vine thickness was extracted. The aim of this study was to evaluate both classical Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and spatial statistical methods (Moran Index-MI and BILISA) to assess their performance in a multi-temporal comparison between satellite and ground data with UAV information. Good correlations were detected between S2 NDVI and UAV NDVI mixed pixels through both methods (R2 = 0.80 and MI = 0.75). Regarding ground data, UAV layers showed low and negative association with TSS (MI = - 0.34 was the lowest value) whereas better spatial autocorrelations with positive values were detected between UAV layers and both yield (MI ranged from 0.42 to 0.52) and pruning weight (MI ranged from 0.45 to 0.64).

Building on existing reviews which mainly focused on the crop’s spectral behavior, a comprehensive review is provided which considers the progress made using novel data analysis techniques and improved data sources. To complement the available reviews, and to make the large body of research more easily accessible for both researchers and practitioners, in this review (i) we summarized remote sensing applications from 1981 to 2020, (ii) discussed key strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing approaches in the sugarcane context, and (iii) described the challenges and opportunities for future earth observation (EO)-based sugarcane monitoring and management. More than one hundred scientific studies were assessed regarding sugarcane mapping (52 papers), crop growth anomaly detection (11 papers), health monitoring (14 papers), and yield estimation (30 papers). The articles demonstrate that decametric satellite sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 enable a reliable, cost-efficient, and timely mapping and monitoring of sugarcane by overcoming the ground sampling distance (GSD)-related limitations of coarser hectometric resolution data, while offering rich spectral information in the frequently recorded data. The Sentinel2 constellation in particular provides fine spatial resolution at 10 m and high revisit frequency to support sugarcane management and other applications over large areas. For very small areas, and in particular for up-scaling and calibration purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are also useful. Multi-temporal and multi-source data, together with powerful machine learning approaches such as the random forest (RF) algorithm, are key to providing efficient monitoring and mapping of sugarcane growth, health, and yield. A number of difficulties for sugarcane monitoring and mapping were identified that are also well known for other crops. Those difficulties relate mainly to the often (i) time consuming pre-processing of optical time series to cope with atmospheric perturbations and cloud coverage, (ii) the still important lack of analysis-ready-data (ARD), (iii) the diversity of environmental and growth conditions—even for a given country—under which sugarcane is grown, superimposing non-crop related radiometric information on the observed sugarcane crop, and (iv) the general ill-posedness of retrieval and classification approaches which adds ambiguity to the derived information. © 2021 by the authors.

The French Theia land data center, and the German Earth Observation Center (EOC) started delivering Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products to users in 2016 in France and 2019 in Germany respectively. Both centers produce and distribute these data sets in near real time, over large regions requested by French users such as Western Europe, Maghreb, Sahel, Madagascar… Theia's and EOC products include an instantaneous surface reflectance product (Level-2A), and a monthly cloud free synthesis of surface reflectance (Level-3A). This article shortly describes the methods used to generate the Level-2A products with the MAJA processor, and the Level-3A products with theWASP processor. The MAJA processor is based on multi-temporal methods, that use the slow variation of surface reflectance to detect clouds and estimate aerosol depth, while WASP, thanks to the quality of MAJA cloud mask, calculates a weighted average of all the cloud free observations over 45 days, every month. The article also provides validation results for Level-2A and Level-3A products, resulting from comparison with in-situ data and with other methods.

This approach is particularly important for historical rural landscapes having a recognized ecological and cultural value. To do this, it is first necessary to apply a chronological methodology since, by definition, landscapes result from an interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors over time. Thanks to the constant evolution of Geographic Information Systems and of different geodata available, the monitoring of historical landscapes is increasingly effective and inclusive. Using as a case study an historical forest landscape recognized at Italian level for its high value (Lucanian Apennines's beech forest-Basilicata Region), a diachronic analysis was applied to evaluate its multi-temporal evolution. Starting from historical cartographies up to Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, a GIS-based approach was implemented to evaluate the spatial variations of forest cover in this landscape. The techniques applied have allowed to reconstruct the original structure of the beech forests, useful for a possible restoration in some areas, but also to monitor the processes in place by using vegetation indices derived from remote sensing. © 2021 Public Recreation and Landscape Protection - With Sense Hand in Hand!

The Shiyang River Basin, an inland river basin, is one of the most prominent water resource shortage regions with intensive agriculture activities in northwestern China. However, a free crop map with high spatial resolution is not available in the Shiyang River Basin. The European Space Agency (ESA) satellite Sentinel-2 has multi-spectral bands ranging in the visible-red edge-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-RE-NIR-SWIR) spectrum. Understanding the impact of spectral-temporal information on crop classification is helpful for users to select optimized spectral bands combinations and temporal window in crop mapping when using Sentinel-2 data. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data acquired in the growing season in 2019 were applied to the random forest algorithm to generate the crop classification map at 10 m spatial resolution for the Shiyang River Basin. Four experiments with different combinations of feature sets were carried out to explore which Sentinel-2 information was more effective for higher crop classification accuracy. The results showed that the augment of multi-spectral and multi-temporal information of Sentinel-2 improved the accuracy of crop classification remarkably, and the improvement was firmly related to strategies of feature selections. Compared with other bands, red-edge band 1 (RE-1) and shortwave-infrared band 1 (SWIR-1) of Sentinel-2 showed a higher competence in crop classification. The combined application of images in the early, middle and late crop growth stage is significant for achieving optimal performance. A relatively accurate classification (overall accuracy = 0.94) was obtained by utilizing the pivotal spectral bands and dates of image. In addition, a crop map with a satisfied accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.9) could be generated as early as late July. This study gave an inspiration in selecting targeted spectral bands and period of images for acquiring more accurate and timelier crop map. The proposed method could be transferred to other arid areas with similar agriculture structure and crop phenology. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes and the corresponding spatio-temporal pattern of suspended sediment concentration of the southern Kerala coast using Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0–10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.85 with the field data.

In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast.

Previously successful in Doñana and Camargue Biosphere Reserves, this study examines the transferability of unsupervised inundation mapping through automatic local thresholding in discriminating inundated areas from non-inundated ones in Kerkini Lake. Nine different alternatives of this approach are employed on Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-2A images (2016-2019). The best fit alternative was derived by the validation against local and on-site registered attributes. To overcome unfavourable atmospheric conditions, Sentinel-1 (S1) images were examined in tandem with derived S2 inundation maps (S2m), using the best fit alternative. Two S2m, one preceding and one following a target S1 image, were used to train random forest models (per pixel) to be applied to the target S1 image and derive the respective inundation map (S1m). S1m was validated against a S2m for the same date; not previously used in the training process. Classification performance reached k [0.77-0.94] and overall accuracy [88.05-97.16%] for the S2m. The evaluation of S1m showed k of 0.99 and overall accuracy between 99.71-99.88%.

In this study, the native and invasive species in the Yellow River Delta were examined for their spatiotemporal characteristics and succession patterns. First, multi-temporal SENTINEL-2 and LANDSAT-8 images from 2018 were selected. A random forest algorithm was used to verify the image spectral band's significance and separability to determine the native and invasive species. Then, the spatiotemporal variation of habitat structure of the species was discussed in depth from the perspective of landscape ecology. Finally, the expansion direction and expansion mode of S. alterniflora were further analyzed. The main results obtained were as follows: (a) SENTINEL-2 images with red-edge bands had obvious advantages in vegetation community extraction as compared to LANDSAT-8 images (SENTINEL-2, OA = 82.86%, kappa coefficient = 0.79; LANDSAT-8, OA = 78.77%, kappa coefficient = 0.74). (b) The expansion pattern of the S. alterniflora community became spatially continuous, more regularized, and aggregated over time. (c) The expansion in the north shore mainly faced toward the sea, and the south bank mainly faced toward the land, and this phenomenon was closely related to the sedimentation of the Yellow River Delta. Marginal and external expansion both occurred, but marginal expansion predominated.

There is, therefore, a clear need for the continuous and reliable monitoring of land cover and land cover changes. The growing availability of high resolution, regularly collected remote sensing data can support the increasing number of applications that require high spatial resolution products that are frequently updated (e.g., annually). However, large‐scale operational mapping requires a highly‐automated data processing workflow, which is currently lacking. To address this issue, we developed a methodology for the automated classification of multi‐temporal Sentinel‐2 imagery. The method uses a random forest classifier and existing land cover/use databases as the source of training samples. In order to demonstrate its operability, the method was implemented on a large part of the European continent, with CORINE Land Cover and High‐Resolution Layers as training datasets. A land cover/use map for the year 2017 was produced, composed of 13 classes. An accuracy assessment, based on nearly 52,000 samples, revealed high thematic overall accuracy (86.1%) on a continental scale, and average overall accuracy of 86.5% at country level. Only low‐frequency classes obtained lower accuracies and we recommend that their mapping should be improved in the future. Additional modifications to the classification legend, notably the fusion of thematically and spectrally similar vegetation classes, increased overall accuracy to 89.0%, and resulted in ten, general classes. A crucial aspect of the presented approach is that it embraces all of the most important elements of Earth observation data processing, enabling accurate and detailed (10 m spatial resolution) mapping with no manual user involvement. The presented methodology demonstrates possibility for frequent and repetitive operational production of large‐scale land cover maps. © 2020 by the authors.

The following MS image for the same region can be acquired with respect to the satellite revisit period. The images captured at different times over the same region are called multitemporal images. Traditional compression methods generally benefit from spectral and spatial correlation within the MS image. However, there is also a temporal correlation between multitemporal images. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based prediction method called MultiTempGAN for compression of multitemporal MS images. The proposed method defines a lightweight GAN-based model that learns to transform the reference image to the target image. Here, the generator parameters of MultiTempGAN are saved for the reconstruction purpose in the receiver system. Due to MultiTempGAN has a low number of parameters, it provides efficiency in multitemporal MS image compression. Experiments were carried out on three Sentinel-2 MS image pairs belonging to different geographical regions. We compared the proposed method with JPEG2000-based conventional compression methods and three deep learning methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, mean spectral angle, mean spectral correlation, and laplacian mean square error metrics. Additionally, we have also evaluated the change detection performances and visual maps of the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MultiTempGAN not only achieves the best metric values among the other methods at high compression ratios but also presents convincing performances in change detection applications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Geographical regions; Image compression; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Change detection; Compression methods; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Multispectral images; Multispectral-image compression; Reflected energy; Remote-sensing; Spectral correlation; Remote sensing","Big data; Generative adversarial networks; Multispectral image compression; Multitemporal images; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119176940"

In recent decades the cultivation of this crop has led to the loss of vast tracts of forest areas in both countries. Efficient and accurate methods for remotely identifying cocoa plantations are essential to the implementation of sustainable cocoa practices and for the periodic and effective monitoring of forests. In this study, a method for cocoa plantation identification was developed based on a multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and a multi-feature Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and second-order texture features were assessed for their importance in an RF classification, and their optimal combination was used as input variables for the RF model to identify cocoa plantations in both countries. The RF model-based cocoa map achieved 82.89% producer's and 62.22% user's accuracy, detecting 3.69 million hectares (Mha) and 2.15 Mha of cocoa plantations for Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively. The results demonstrate that a combination of an RF model and multi-feature classification can distinguish cocoa plantations from other land cover/use, effectively reducing feature dimensions and improving classification efficiency. The results also highlight that cocoa farms largely encroach into protected areas (PAs), as 20% of the detected cocoa plantation area is located in PAs and almost 70% of the PAs in the study area house cocoa plantations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Cote dIvoire; Ghana; Classification (of information); Cocoa; Conservation; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Textures; Cash crops; Cocoa mapping; Encroachment; Forest area; Multi features; Protected areas; Random forest modeling; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; West Africa; algorithm; alternative agriculture; cocoa; cultivation; detection method; image classification; implementation process; NDVI; plantation; protected area; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Crops","Cash crops; Cocoa mapping; Encroachment; Protected areas; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; West Africa","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108733844"

The complexity increases with urban and peri-urban forests because of the variety of features that exist in remote sensing images. The success of forest management that includes forest preservation depends strongly on the accuracy of forest-type classification. Several classification methods are used to map urban and peri-urban forests and to identify healthy and non-healthy ones. Some of these methods have shown success in the classification of forests where others failed. The successful methods used specific remote sensing data technology, such as hyper-spectral and very high spatial resolution (VHR) images. However, both VHR and hyper-spectral sensors are very expensive, and hyper-spectral sensors are not widely available on satellite platforms, unlike multi-spectral sensors. Moreover, aerial images are limited in use, very expensive, and hard to arrange and manage. To solve the aforementioned problems, an advanced method, self-organizing–deep learning (SO-UNet), was created to classify forests in the urban and peri-urban environment using multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and medium spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images. SO-UNet is a combination of two different machine learning technologies: artificial neural network unsupervised self-organizing maps and deep learning UNet. Many experiments have been conducted, and the results showed that SO-UNet overwhelms UNet significantly. The experiments encompassed different settings for the parameters that control the algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

With the development of remote sensing and cloud computing technologies, Google Earth Engine, as a global-scale geospatial analysis cloud platform, overcomes the disadvantages of traditional single-machine computing and brings new opportunities for rapid remote sensing classification. In this study, taking Qi County in Henan province as the study area, the NDVI time series difference index of different crops is constructed according to the characteristics of time series NDVI curve of each crop to extract crop planting information and distinguish different crop types using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in 2019-2020 based on the Google Earth Engine platform. The extraction accuracy is verified and compared with other existing methods. The results show that the NDVI time series difference index is based on crop phenology information and developed using GEE's high-performance computing capability, which forms a framework for rapid crop planting information extraction and has obvious advantages over traditional local computing. The winter wheat and garlic planting areas in Qi County have obvious spatial variation. The winter wheat planting areas are mainly concentrated in the northwest and southern rural residential areas of the study area. While the garlic in Qi County is mainly concentrated in the central and northeastern part of the study area due to the needs of transportation. Compared with other methods using support vector machine and maximum likelihood, the overall accuracy of crop planting area extraction using the NDVI time series difference index reaches 83.72%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.67. The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient are 10.02% and 0.21 respectively higher than the maximum likelihood method, and are 4.18% and 0.09 respectively higher than the support vector machine method, which indicates that our method can extract crop planting information with high efficiency and high accuracy. We develop an efficient and accurate monitoring method for regional crop planting information extraction and expand the application of remote sensing data in the agricultural field, which has significant value for future agricultural applications. © 2021, Science Press.

Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each independently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km2 Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated start- and end-of-season for the series using a 50% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat photography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of ~8 days for SOS50 and ~15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grassland surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous rangeland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity. © 2020 The Author(s)","Kenya; Machakos; Hyperbolic functions; Rain; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Chromatic coordinate; Hyperbolic tangent models; Interannual variability; Observation frequencies; Repeat photographies; Satellite constellations; Vegetation dynamics; Vegetation phenology; annual variation; growing season; mapping method; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; rangeland; satellite constellation; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral resolution; vegetation dynamics; Forestry","Digital repeat photography; Landscape variability; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI time series; Phenology; PlanetScope; Semi-arid rangelands; Sentinel-2; Spatial resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088386376"

The main reasons of long-term catastrophic shallowing of the reservoir and the drop in its level to values less than the dead volume level (DVL) in the summer and autumn of 2020 were highlighted. The current situation was provoked by both natural and anthropogenic factors. The permanent natural factors of reservoir degradation include long-term accumulation of 95-98 % of the average annual sediment runoff from the main tributaries (about 6 million m3/year), episodic one is the coming of dry years with low precipitation. Anthropogenic reasons include constructive design errors, underestimation of the reservoir bowl siltation rate, decrease in the normal retaining level by 0.9 m in 1993, water consumption for household needs disproportionate to real conditions, etc. The combination of these factors against the background of a long dry period made conditional upon decrease in the volume of water in 2020 to 6-10 % of the total reservoir volume and drainage of shallow waters, which led to severe environmental consequences. Analysis of space information from the Sentinel-2 satellite, identification of the water mirror using the MNDWI index and determination of the reservoir area showed that its open water surface decreased by 58 % of the design value. It is noted that the documentary character of space information and its regular use make it possible timely recording changes of the reservoir condition, which should certainly be taken into account in the water management practice of the region for making realistic decisions. © 2021 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In order to develop novel tools, implementing the use of information layers from current and future Earth Observation (EO) missions is necessary. The EOxposure project that has been created and funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program covers this porpoise. Several topics involving human exposure to environmental risks are being studied, including water quality and pollution, which is addressed in this paper. The high productivity of biomass registered in eutrophic water bodies, leads to qualitative and quantitative changes in the phytoplankton community, resulting in massive algae blooms. This research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the temporal and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced data mining techniques to study the turbid and productive water of San Roque reservoir, Argentina.

Accurate maps of grazing lawn distribution is essential to enhance understanding of important ecosystem processes such as mega-herbivore population dynamics, nutrient cycling and plant community composition. The inherent heterogeneity of savannah landscapes however creates significant challenges for accurate discrimination of vegetation components and thus grazing lawn detection. Recent studies favour very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-spectral imagery for dealing with this challenge. However, such data are costly for use in operational management. Planet Labs, through Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), now grant free access to high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics over the tropics, with great potential for fine-scale vegetation mapping. However, the spectral characteristics of these data are limited and fail to resolve the spectral similarity of different savannah vegetation components. We address these issues using Gram-Schmidt transformation to fuse Planet Basemaps and Sentinel-2A images for grazing lawn detection within the Lower Sabie region of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The original and fused images were classified using a random forest approach. Overall, the fused image achieved the best grazing lawn detection accuracy (0.85) and general map accuracy (0.72) results compared to Sentinel-2 (0.67 and 0.62) and Planet basemap (0.64 and 0.62 respectively). Our findings provide a foundation for cost-effective and accurate high spatial resolution vegetation mapping in heterogenous savannah landscapes. Further studies will investigate the potential of multi-temporal fused data and object-based approaches for enhanced savannah vegetation mapping. © 2021 IEEE","Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image resolution; Open Data; Photomapping; Random forests; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Fused images; Grazing lawn; High resolution; OpenAccess; Planet basemap; Random forests; Savannah; Sentinel-2; Vegetation components; Vegetation mapping; Image fusion","grazing lawn; Image fusion; Planet basemaps; Random forest; savannah; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129887543"

First, we propose applying a temporal averaging filter that allows the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g., due to tides or vegetation, to be encapsulated, and, at the same time, the speckle to be reduced, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land pixels, we will employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes using bimodal distribution. The distribution is then segmented by a thresholding and region-growing procedure to separate the sea and land classes. A large-scale quantitative comparison between the SAR-derived and open street map (OSM) coastlines allows for a numerical evaluation of the results, i.e., an overall agreement ranging from 80% to 90%. In addition, Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the estimated SAR coastline qualitatively.

Results proved that nVVI is negatively correlated to tree age (r = −0.815, p < 0.001): older or unhealthy trees showed low nVVI values; younger trees showed high nVVI possibly related to vigour increase. nVVI was, finally used within a Decision Support System (DSS) specifically designed to support tree failure risk management in wide areas, like the natural parks. It was found that such approach can result in an economic saving of about 52% compared to more traditional tree stability surveys.

This information can be obtained through the analysis of images obtained through optical satellite remote sensing. Activities such as accurate discrimination of crops require dense time-series of satellite data which can capture the diverse crop phenology. However, given the presence of clouds at important periods of crops’ development, the required time-series is impossible to obtain from just one optical satellite sensor. The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project by NASA provides fused data from both Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument optical sensors of Landsat and Sentinel systems respectively. The present study used a multi-temporal HLS data and a target-oriented cross-validation (TOV) modelling approach with random forest algorithm to discriminate 13 crop types. 15 phenological metrics derived from time-series HLS data, together with 48 spectral and 2 topographic information were used as predictors in the model. A forward feature selection (FFS) procedure of the TOV was used to improve the classification model. 16 predictors comprising of spectral, phenological and topographic information were selected as useful for the crop discrimination. An independent accuracy assessment of the final model based on the selected predictors by the FFS procedure resulted in an overall accuracy of 76%. While most of the crop classes, achieved higher producer's and user's accuracies (>80%), the discrimination accuracies of potato, summer oat and winter triticale were comparatively low (<60%). Based on the outcome of the FFS, three models consisting of different predictor combinations, were further developed to ascertain the contribution of the predictors. A comparison of the models showed that the addition of phenological metrics increased the discrimination performance of the model as a whole and for cereals in particular. However, the inclusion of the topographic information did not have any significant effect on the overall model performance. Therefore, future crop type discrimination research in areas with similar terrain characteristics like Northern Hesse should reconsider the use of topographic predictors. Overall, our findings depict that the TOV modelling approach based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data is promising for effective, accurate and practical crop type discrimination. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Germany; Hesse; Solanum tuberosum; Triticosecale; Agricultural robots; Decision making; Decision trees; NASA; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Classification models; Discrimination accuracy; Forward feature selections; Multispectral instruments; Operational land imager; Random forest algorithm; Terrain characteristics; Topographic information; accuracy assessment; algorithm; alternative agriculture; decision making; discriminant analysis; Landsat; satellite data; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial distribution; Crops","Forward feature selection; Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2; Machine learning; Phenological metrics; Target oriented cross-validation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095715357"

However, use of these data has always been a challenge in tropical regions owing to the complexity of the biophysical environment, clouds, and haze, and atmospheric moisture content, all of which impede accurate LULC classification. We tested a parametric classifier (logistic regression) and three non-parametric machine learning classifiers (improved k-nearest neighbors, random forests, and support vector machine) for classification of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery into LULC categories in Dak Nong province, Vietnam. A total of 446 images, 235 from the year 2017 and 211 from the year 2018, were pre-processed to gain high quality images for mapping LULC in the 6516 km2 study area.

Eleven different LULC classes were discriminated of which five were forest classes. For each combination of temporal image set and classifier, a confusion matrix was constructed using independent reference data and pixel classifications, and the area on the ground of each class was estimated.

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known.

The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds.

This paper presents a combined Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithm. The data handling integrates recent research on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 pre-processing to generate registered, surface nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) sensor time series that are used as an input. The different sensor data are combined through a random forest change regression, trained with synthetic data built from laboratory and field spectra and using a spectral model of fire effects on reflectance. The random forest regression is applied independently at each gridded 30 m pixel location on a temporally rolling basis considering three months of sensor data to map the central month. Temporal consistency checks are used to reduce commission errors due to non-fire related spectral changes, and a region growing algorithm is used to reduce omission errors due to temporally sparse observations. In the resulting product, each 30 m pixel is labelled as burned, unburned or unmapped. At burned pixels the estimated day of burning, and a single value that provides an estimate of the product of the subpixel fraction burned (f) and the combustion completeness (cc), henceforth termed “f.cc”, and an associated quality measure, are defined. The algorithm is demonstrated using six months of every available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A acquisition over 10° × 10° of Southern Africa. Experiments comparing the mapped burned areas considering Sentinel-2A only and both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data indicate a greater area burned and a smaller number of unmapped pixels when both sensors are used. The results are compared with contemporaneous NASA MODIS fire products to gain insights into their temporal and spatial reporting differences. Temporally, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product reports the day of burning on average three days later than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, because of the lower revisit frequency of the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 observations. Spatially, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product captures more detail than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, with systematically higher burned area estimates. Despite the areal differences, the spatial pattern of the two products is similar, as reflected by the correlation (r2 ~ 0.7) and slope (>0.8) of regressions of the proportions of area burned defined in coarse resolution cells between the two products, taking into account the 3 day temporal bias. A comparison with multi-date PLANET 3 m data, shows high visual agreement in the location and approximate day of burning and higher f.cc values in the interiors of distinct burns than at the edges, and lower values in areas containing mixes of burned and unburned 3 m pixels. The Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A burned area mapping results are validated by comparison with burned areas interpreted visually from two date Sentinel-2A data, over 30 km × 30 km boxes selected by systematic sampling. The results mapped less area burned than the interpreted maps, as reflected by a 0.24 omission error and a negative relative bias (−0.19), with a small 0.06 commission error. Regression between the proportions of area burned defined in 1.5 km cells provide a high correlation (r2 = 0.89) and slope close to unity (0.82) and indicate that the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A results identified similar burned area spatial patterns as the interpreted maps. © 2019 The Authors","Southern Africa; Conformal mapping; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision trees; Errors; Image segmentation; NASA; Planets; Radiometers; Random forests; Reflection; Burned areas; Burned-area mapping; LANDSAT; MODIS; Region growing algorithm; Sentinel-2; Temporal and spatial; Temporal consistency; algorithm; detection method; Landsat; mapping method; MODIS; pixel; satellite data; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; Pixels","Burned area; Landsat; MODIS; PLANET; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068583922"

While field surveys are time consuming and expensive, remote sensing techniques offer an efficient and fast alternative. The Copernicus programme provides large amounts of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data that can be used for this purpose. This study presents two methods for forest cover classification, one using a multitemporal dataset of SAR images from one orbit, and the other combining SAR images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits and almost cloud-free (<10%) multi-spectral images. The SAR-LC classification system, a rule-based decision tree which is designed to classify land cover types using radar backscatter is used to extract forest cover extent from the 2016 dataset. For the second method, Sentinel-1 images from 2017 in both ascending and descending orbits are combined with 10 m resampled almost cloud free Sentinel-2 images to form one multi-temporal dataset with 88 bands. This is then segmented into objects before forest extent is classified using a rule-based classification. The SAR-LC thresholds were optimised to include the ReNDVI values from the Sentinel-2 images for this purpose. While the final objective of this study is to produce forest cover maps for the whole of Germany, this paper will only focus on the forests around the region of Frankfurt. The challenges, limitations and accuracy of each method is reported and discussed. © 2018 SPIE.","Budget control; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forestry; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; Copernicus; Forest; Rule-based classification; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Radar imaging","Copernicus; Forest; Rule-Based Classification; SAR; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052675759"

The spatial distribution ofwinterwheat planting areas is closely related to food security; however, mapping winter wheat with time-series finer spatial resolution satellite images across large areas is challenging. This paper explores the potential of combining temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data available via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for mapping winter wheat in Shandong Province, China. First, six phenological median composites of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measures were generated by a temporal aggregation technique according to the winter wheat phenological calendar, which covered seedling, tillering, over-wintering, reviving, jointing-heading and maturing phases, respectively. Then, Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to classify multi-temporal composites but also mono-temporal winter wheat development phases and mono-sensor data. The results showed that winter wheat could be classified with an overall accuracy of 93.4% and F1 measure (the harmonic mean of producer's and user's accuracy) of 0.97 with temporally aggregated Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datawere combined. As our results also revealed, itwas always good to classifymulti-temporal images compared to mono-temporal imagery (the overall accuracy dropped from 93.4% to as low as 76.4%). It was also good to classify Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery combined instead of classifying them individually. The analysis showed among the mono-temporal winter wheat development phases that the maturing phase's and reviving phase's data were more important than the data for other mono-temporal winter wheat development phases. In sum, this study confirmed the importance of using temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data combined and identified key winter wheat development phases for accurate winter wheat classification. These results can be useful to benefit on freely available optical satellite data (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and prioritize key winter wheat development phases for accurate mapping winter wheat planting areas across China and elsewhere. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision trees; Food supply; Image classification; Mapping; Accurate mapping; Development phasis; Optical satellites; Overall accuracies; Satellite images; Shandong province; Spatial resolution; Temporal aggregation; Crops","Crop development phase; Google earth engine; Multi-temporal; Temporal aggregation; Winter wheat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088273943"

Sentinel-2 products available for users are distributed by the European Space Agency (ESA) as Top Of Atmosphere reflectance values in cartographic geometry (Level-1C product). In order to obtain Bottom Of Atmosphere reflectance images (Level-2A product) derived from this Level-1C products, ESA provides the SEN2COR module, which is implemented in the Sentinel Application Platform. Alternatively, ESA recently distributes Level-2A products processed by SEN2COR with a default configuration. On the other hand, the conversion from Level-1C to Level-2A product can be generated using alternative atmospheric correction methods, such as MAJA, 6S, or iCOR. In this context, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of Level-2A products obtained through different methods in Mediterranean shrub and grasslands by comparing data obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery with field spectrometry data. For that purpose, six plots with different land covers (asphalt, grass, shrub, pasture, and bare soil) were analyzed, by using synchronous imagery to fieldwork (from July to September 2016). The results suggest the suitability of the applied atmospheric corrections, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.90 and root mean square error lower than 0.04 achieving a relative error in bottom of atmosphere reflectance of only 2–3%. Nevertheless, minor differences were observed between the four tested methods, with slightly varying results depending on the spectral band and land cover. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","assessment method; atmospheric correction; cartography; grassland; Mediterranean environment; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shrub; spectrometry","6S; Atmospheric correction; Field spectrometry; iCOR; MAJA; Mediterranean shrub and grasslands; SEN2COR; Sentinel 2A-MSI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064094818"

Although several methods in the literature allow an accurate image restoration, they are usually time-consuming and thus impractical for operational applications. In this paper, we propose a Fast Cloud Removal Approach (FCRA) that exploits the multitemporal information in an efficient way to sharply reduce the computational burden. In greater details, the proposed unsupervised method: (i) generates a short time series (TS) of cloud free images temporally close to the cloudy one (i.e., the target image), (ii) detects ground-clear pixels in the target image similar to the missing pixels using the multitemporal information (i.e., similar temporal patterns), and (iii) restores the occluded pixels using the most similar ground-clear spectral values from the same image. The method reduces the computational effort by focusing on short image TS and by detecting similar temporal patterns in a fast and effective way by using the KD-Trees. Moreover, since the method restores the missing pixels with ground clear pixels belonging to the same image, no computational demanding approaches are needed to adjust the replacement information (i.e., regression). Experimental results obtained on Sentinel-2 images on simulated clouds acquired over two test areas located in Italy demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","Image analysis; Pixels; Remote sensing; Restoration; Time series; Time series analysis; Image time-series; K-d tree; Multi-temporal analysis; Multispectral images; Similarity search; Image reconstruction","Image restoration; image time series; KD-Tree; multitemporal analysis; Remote Sensing; satellite multispectral images; similarity search","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074270909"

A multi-temporal set of 87 images, acquired by Sentinel-2 satellites over three years (2016–2018), provided quantitative information for assessing the temporal evolution of key ecosystem variables in the perialpine Lake Mezzola (northern Italy), which has suffered from the impacts of a massive landslide that took place upstream of the lake basin in summer 2017. Sentinel-2 derived products revealed an increase in lake turbidity triggered by the landslide that amounted to twice the average values scored in the years preceding and following the event. Hotspots of turbidity within the lake were in particular highlighted. Moreover, both submerged and riparian vegetation showed harmful impacts due to sediment deposition. A partial loss of submerged macrophyte cover was found, with delayed growth and a possible community shift in favor of species adapted to inorganic substrates. Satellite-derived seasonal dynamics showed that exceptional sediment load can overwrite climatic factors in controlling phenology of riparian reed beds, resulting in two consecutive years with shorter than normal growing season and roughly 20% drop in productivity, according to spectral proxies. Compared to 2016, senescence came earlier by around 20 days on average in 2017 season, and green-up was delayed by up to 50 days (20 days, on average) in 2018, following the landslide.

Results, achieved studying a number of active volcanoes located in different geographic areas and characterized by a different eruptive behavior, demonstrated the NHI capacity in mapping both subtle and more intense volcanic thermal anomalies despite some limitations (e.g., missed detections because of clouds/volcanic plumes). In addition, the study shows that the performance of NHI might be further increased using some additional spectral/spatial tests, in view of a possible usage of this algorithm within a known multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis.

The analysis of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) changes has been crucial to describe the environmental impacts concerning endemic vegetation loss, damages to agricultural heritage, and transformations to landscape patterns. Moreover, a survey was useful to collect eyewitness accounts aimed to define the LU and to obtain detailed information about eruption-induced damages. Detection of burnt areas was based on PLEIADES-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and field surveys. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) allowed mapping areas impacted by fires. LC and LU classification involved the detection of new classes, following the environmental units of landscape, being the result of the intersection between CORINE Land Cover project (CLC) and local landscape patterns. The results of multi-temporal comparison show that fire-damaged areas amount to 39% of the total area of the island, mainly affecting agricultural and semi-natural vegetated areas, being composed by endemic Aeolian species and abandoned olive trees that were cultivated by exploiting terraces up to high altitudes.

Therefore, cloudy pixels should be identified and eliminated before any further data processing can be achieved. Although several threshold, multi-temporal and machine learning applications have been developed to tackle this issue, it still remains a challenge. The main challenges are imposed by the difficulty to detect thin clouds and to separate bright clouds from bright non-cloud objects. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be one of the most promising methods for image classification tasks and their use is rapidly increasing in remote sensing problems. CNNs present interesting properties for image processing since they directly exploit not only the spectral information but also the spatial covariance of the data. In this work, we study the applicability of CNNs in cloud detection of Sentinel-2 imagery, a complex remote sensing problem with crucial spatial context. A patch-to-pixel CNN architecture consisting of three convolutional layers and two fully connected layers is trained on a recently available manually created public dataset. The results were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively through comparison with ground truth cloud masks and state-of-the art pixel-based algorithms (Fmask, Sen2Cor). It was shown that the proposed architecture even though simpler than the deep learning architectures proposed by recent literature, performs very favorably, especially in the challenging cases. Besides the evaluation of the results, feature maps where observed as an initial effort to extract the weights of the useful kernels for cloud masking applications.  © 2020 SPIE.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Deep learning; Network architecture; Pixels; Cloud contamination; Difficulty to detect; Learning architectures; Machine learning applications; Proposed architectures; Remotely sensed data; Spatial covariance; Spectral information; Remote sensing","Bright surfaces detection; Cloud masking; Convolutional neural networks; Feature maps; Sentinel satellite imagery; Thin cloud detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086986350"

This paper is aimed at comparing, validating and discussing different LAI satellite products from operational services and customized solution based on innovative Earth Observation (EO) data such as Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A. The comparison was performed to assess overall quality of LAI estimates for rice, as a fundamental input of different scale (regional to local) operational crop monitoring systems such as the ones developed during the ""An Earth obseRvation Model based RicE information Service"" (ERMES) project. We adopted a multiscale approach following international recognized protocols of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) guidelines in different steps: (1) acquisition of representative field sample measurements, (2) validation of decametric satellite product (10-30 m spatial resolution), and (3) exploitation of such data to assess quality of medium-resolution operational products (~1000 m). The study areas were located in the main European rice areas in Spain, Italy and Greece. Field campaigns were conducted during three entire rice seasons (2014, 2015 and 2016-from sowing to full-flowering) to acquire multi-temporal ground LAI measurements and to assess Landsat-7/8 LAI estimates. Results highlighted good correspondence between Landsat-7/8 LAI estimates and ground measurements revealing high correlations (R2 ≥ 0.89) and low root mean squared errors (RMSE ≤ 0.75) in all seasons. Landsat-7/8 as well as Sentinel-2A high-resolution LAI retrievals, were compared with satellite LAI products operationally derived from MODIS (MOD15A2), Copernicus PROBA-V (GEOV1), and the recent EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) LAI product. Good agreement was observed between high- and medium-resolution LAI estimates. In particular, the EPS LAI product was the most correlated product with both Landsat/7-8 and Sentinel-2A estimates, revealing R2 ≥ 0.93 and RMSE ≤ 0.53 m2/m2. In addition, a comparison exercise of EPS, GEOV1 and MODIS revealed high correlations (R2 ≥ 0.90) and RMSE ≤ 0.80 m2/m2 in all cases and years. The temporal assessment shows that the three satellite products capture well the seasonality during the crop phenological cycle. Discrepancies are observed mainly in absolute values retrieved for the peak of rice season. This is the first study that provides a quantitative assessment on the quality of available operational LAI product for rice monitoring to both the scientific community and users of agro-monitoring operational services. © 2018 by the authors.","Crops; Information services; Mean square error; Observatories; Radiometers; Satellites; Eumetsat polar systems; GEOV1; LandSat 7; Leaf Area Index; MODIS; Rice crops; Sentinel-2A; Validation; Remote sensing","EUMETSAT Polar System; GEOV1; Landsat-7/8; Leaf Area Index (LAI); MODIS; Rice crops; Sentinel-2A; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047517757"

Their technical capabilities and tools are improving all the time and provide more accurate results. By the recent arrival of the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 series, available free, processing and methods of analysis must be increased more and more in the field of cartography. This paper aims to present vegetation mapping method in the Pays de Brest area by using a time series stacking of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 satellites data using the algorithm Random Forest supervised classification. The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free. © SPIE.

A possible alternative is to benefit from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In many real-world applications, critical decisions are made based on some informative optical or radar features related to items such as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based features are not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants. In this work, we propose to estimate missing optical features through data fusion and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken into account-optical sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model-so as to exploit both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to perform the desired estimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired over an agricultural region of Burkina Faso from May-November 2016. Several fusion schemes are considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding to different operating conditions. Experimental results are very promising, showing a significant gain over baseline methods according to all performance indicators. © 2018 by the authors.","Data fusion; Deep learning; Neural networks; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Coregistration; Multi-sensor fusion; Multi-temporal image; Normalized difference vegetation index; Pan-sharpening; Synthetic aperture radar","Coregistration; Deep learning; Multi-sensor fusion; Multitemporal images; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Pansharpening","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042529724"

In particular, we propose for the first time in remote sensing a multi-temporal W-Net approach for the segmentation of Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) Sentinel-1 data collected along ascending/descending orbit to discriminate rice, water, and bare soil.

Climate characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances lead forest environments to display high vulnerability to wildfires, with their sustainability being threatened by the loss of vegetation, changes on soil properties, and increased soil loss rates. Moreover, wildfires are a great threat to property and human life, especially in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas. In light of the impacts and trends mentioned above, this study aims to assess the impact of the Mati, Attika wildfire on soil erosion. The event caused 102 fatalities, inducing severe consequences to the local infrastructure network; economy; and natural resources. As such, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented (pre-; post-fire) at the Rafina, Attika watershed encompassing the Mati WUI. Fire severity was evaluated based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). This index was developed utilizing innovative remotely sensed Earth Observation data (Sentinel-2). The high post-fire values indicate the fire's devastating effects on vegetation loss and soil erosion. A critical “update” was also made to the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) v. 2018, by introducing a new land use class namely “Urban Forest”, in order to distinguish the WUI configuration. Post-fire erosion rates are notably higher throughout the study area (4.53–5.98 t ha−1 y−1), and especially within the WUI zone (3.75–18.58 t ha−1 y−1), while newly developed and highly vulnerable cites now occupy the greater Mati area. Furthermore, archive satellite data (Landsat-5) revealed how the repeated (historical) wildfires have ultimately impacted vegetation recovery and erosional processes. To our knowledge this is the first time that RUSLE is used to simulate soil erosion at a WUI after a fire event, at least at a Mediterranean basin. The realistic results attest that the model can perform well at such diverse conditions, providing a solid basis for soil loss estimation and identification of high-risk erosion areas. © 2019 The Authors","Attica; Greece; anthropogenic effect; disturbance; fire; forest fire; Landsat; mapping method; Mediterranean environment; nature-society relations; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; satellite data; Sentinel; soil erosion; vulnerability; watershed; wildfire","Mati Attika; Mediterranean; Remote sensing; RUSLE; Wildlife-urban interface","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075449602"

Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91). The RF method had the best performance in terms of identity classification. In addition, the indices feature dominated the classification results. The combination of phenological period information with multi-source remote sensing data can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season. The results of crop classification can be used to analyze the density and distribution of crops. This study can also allow to determine crop growth status, improve crop yield estimation accuracy, and provide a basis for crop management. © 2019 by the authors.

Combining optical and microwave satellite data can help with mapping and monitoring the biophysical characteristics of wetlands and wetlands' vegetation. Also, fusing radar and optical remote sensing data can increase the wetland classification accuracy. In this paper, data from the fine spatial resolution optical satellite, Sentinel-2 and the Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite, Sentinel-1, were fused for mapping wetlands. Both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed. After the pre-processing, vegetation indices were calculated using the Sentinel-2 bands and the results were included in the fusion data set. For the classification of the fused data, three different classification approaches were used and compared. The results showed significant improvement in the wetland classification using both multispectral and microwave data. Also, the presence of the red edge bands and the vegetation indices used in the data set showed significant improvement in the discrimination between wetlands and other vegetated areas. The statistical results of the fusion of the optical and radar data showed high wetland mapping accuracy, showing an overall classification accuracy of approximately 90% in the object-based classification method.

The core of the image fusion was an orthogonal transform of the reflectance channels from optical sensors on hypercomplex bases delivered in Kennaugh-like elements, which are well-known from polarimetric radar. In this way, SAR and Optics could be fused to one image data set sharing the characteristics of both: the sharpness of Optics and the texture of SAR. The special properties of Kennaugh elements regarding their scaling-linear, logarithmic, normalized-applied likewise to the newelements and guaranteed their robustness towards noise, radiometric sub-sampling, and therewith data compression. This study combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on an Octonion basis as well as Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2 on a Sedenion basis. The validation using signatures of typical land cover classes showed that the efficient archiving in 4 bit images still guaranteed an accuracy over 90% in the class assignment.

In this study, we proposed an object-based random forest (RF) method for paddy rice mapping using time series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) was used to blend MODIS and Sentinel-2 data for achieving multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Subsequently, the Savitzky-Golay filter (S-G) was applied to smooth the time series Sentinel-2 NDVI data. And the phenological parameters were derived from the filtered time series NDVI using the threshold method. Then, the optimum feature combination for paddy mapping was formed on the basis of Sentinel-2 MSI images, time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, phenology data and time series Sentinel-1 SAR backscattering images by using the JBh distance. Finally, an object-based Random Forest classifier was used to extract paddy rice with the optimum feature combination. The result showed that fused Sentinel-2 NDVI time series using RASTFM has a high correlation with the original Sentinel-2 image.

Geo-statistical approaches and remote sensing (RS) techniques have provided fast, accurate and economic prediction and mapping of soil salinity within the last two decades. Obtaining multi-temporal data via satellite images in different spatial domains with various scales is one of the key developments of monitoring spatial variability of soil salinity. In addition, geo-statistical methods have the capability of producing prediction surfaces from limited sample data. This study aims to map spatial distribution of soil salinity in the selected pilot area which is located in the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, by applying geo-statistical methods. A kriging based map and three different co-kriging based maps were produced using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements as primary variable and three different soil salinity index values as secondary variable. Three soil salinity indices were created by using Sentinel-2A image that were acquired in the same date of field measurements to generate 3 various soil salinity prediction maps. Salinity maps obtained from geo-statistical methods were compared and validated to understand the performance of these approaches for soil salinity prediction. The results of this study demonstrated that co-kriging can provide promising estimation of spatial variability of soil salinity especially when there is relevant and abundant set of secondary data derived from satellite images. © 2019 IEEE.","Forecasting; Interpolation; Lakes; Remote sensing; Soils; Statistics; Sustainable development; Co-Kriging; Lake basins; Salinity indices; Sentinel 2-A; Soil salinity; Soil surveys","Co-kriging; Remote Sensing; Salinity Indices; Sentinel 2-A; Soil Salinity; Urmia Lake Basin","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072921515"

Clarifying the magnitude of sugarcane planting will likely provide very evident supports for local land use management and policy-making. However, sugarcane growth environment in complex landscapes with frequent rainy weather conditions poses many challenges for its rapid mapping. This study thus tried and used 10-m Sentinel-2 images as well as crop phenology information to map sugarcane in Longzhou county of China in 2018. To minimize the influences of cloudy and rainy conditions, this study firstly fused all available images in each phenology stage to obtain cloud-free remote sensing images of three phenology stage (seedling, elongation and harvest) with the help of Google Earth Engine platform. Then, the study used the fused images to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each stage. A three-band NDVI dataset along with 4000 training samples and 2000 random validation samples was finally used for sugarcane mapping. To assess the robustness of the three-band NDVI dataset with phenological characteristics for sugarcane mapping, this study employed five classifiers based on machine learning algorithms, including two support vector machine classifiers (Polynomial-SVM and RBF-SVM), a random forest classifier (RF), an artificial neural network classifier (ANN) and a decision tree classifier (CART-DT). Results showed that except for ANN classifier, Polynomial-SVM, RBF-SVM, RF and CART-DT classifiers displayed high accuracy sugarcane resultant maps with producer's and user's accuracies of greater than 91%. The ANN classifier tended to overestimate area of sugarcane and underestimate area of forests. Overall performances of five classifiers suggest Polynomial-SVM has the best potential to improve sugarcane mapping at the regional scale. Also, this study observed that most sugarcane (more than 75% of entire study area) tends to grow in flat regions with slope of less than 10°. This study emphasizes the importance of considering phenology in rapid sugarcane mapping, and suggests the potential of fine-resolution Sentinel-2 images and machine learning approaches in high-accuracy land use management and decision-making. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","cash cropping; machine learning; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; sugar cane; temporal analysis; vegetation mapping","Crop phenology; Land use; Machine learning approach; Sentinel-2 images; Sugarcane mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071667146"

In order to improve the accuracy and applicability of cotton yield estimation model, this paper proposes a new method called SENP (Seedling Emergence and Number of Peaches) based on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Firstly, using the high-resolution visible light data obtained by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the spatial position of each cotton seedling in the region was extracted by U-Net model of deep learning. Secondly, Sentinel-2 data were used in analyzing the correlation between the multi-temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the actual yield, so as to determine the weighting factor of NDVI in each period in the model. Subsequently, to determine the number of bolls, the growth state of cotton was graded. Finally, combined with cotton boll weight, boll opening rate and other information, the cotton yield in the experimental area was estimated by SENP model, and the precision was verified according to the measured data of yield. The experimental results reveal that the U-Net model can effectively extract the information of cotton seedlings from the background with high accuracy. And the precision rate, recall rate and F1 value reached 93.88%, 97.87% and 95.83% respectively. NDVI based on time series can accurately reflect the growth state of cotton, so as to obtain the predicted boll number of each cotton, which greatly improves the accuracy and universality of the yield estimation model. The determination coefficient (R2) of the yield estimation model reached 0.92, indicating that using SENP model for cotton yield estimation is an effective method. This study also proved that the potential and advantage of combining the AWS platform with SENP, due to its powerful cloud computing capacity, especially for deep learning, time-series crop monitoring and large scale yield estimation.

As Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are now both operating in twin mode, they can provide an unprecedented data source to build dense spatial and temporal high-resolution time series across a variety of wavelengths. This study investigates (i) the ability of the individual sensors and (ii) their joint potential to delineate forest cover for study sites in two highly varied landscapes located in Germany (temperate dense mixed forests) and South Africa (open savanna woody vegetation and forest plantations). We used multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and single time steps of Sentinel-2 data in combination to derive accurate forest/non-forest (FNF) information via machine-learning classifiers. The forest classification accuracies were 90.9% and 93.2% for South Africa and Thuringia, respectively, estimated while using autocorrelation corrected spatial cross-validation (CV) for the fused data set. Sentinel-1 only classifications provided the lowest overall accuracy of 87.5%, while Sentinel-2 based classifications led to higher accuracies of 91.9%. Sentinel-2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)) and the lower spectrum of the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series were found to be most distinctive in the detection of forest cover. In contrast to homogenous forests sites, Sentinel-1 time series information improved forest cover predictions in open savanna-like environments with heterogeneous regional features. The presented approach proved to be robust and it displayed the benefit of fusing optical and SAR data at high spatial resolution. © 2020 by the authors.","Data fusion; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Forest cover; Germany; Savanna; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Temperate forests; Classification (of information)","Data fusion; Forest cover; Germany; Machine-learning; Savanna; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Temperate forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081077628"

In the Alps Perennial Snow Patches have been considered to protect permafrost from solar radiation and are used as an indicator for the occurrence of local permafrost. In this study perennial snow fields are detected and classified based on aerial and satellite images. Effects of climatic and topographic factors on the snow field occurrence are investigated aiming to provide insight into the distribution of local permafrost in northern Iceland. Multi-temporal optical satellite images (Landsat-5/-7/-8 and Sentinel-2, 1984–2017) have revealed a time-variable distribution of perennial snow patches as possible permafrost indicators on the Tröllaskagi Peninsula in northern Iceland. Calculated normal-ized difference snow index in combination with different threshold values at the end of summer season within six selected study areas show that several snow patches are present in a time period of over 30 years. Perennial snow patches in the study areas exhibit strong fluctuations in extent due to different local characteristics, e.g. elevation, aspect or topography (plateau/open slopes vs. valleys/cirques). In three of the six study areas snow patches have a high probability of occurrence and the pattern of the distribution is very similar in each time period. Comparison with climate data from nearby weather stations indicates that perennial snow patches can be used in combination with mean annual air temperatures as indicators for local permafrost distributions. © 2019, Iceland Glaciological Society.

Their limited resources and rainfall dependent farming practices make them sensitive to climate change-related effects. Data and research linking yield, human health, and nutrition are scarce but can provide a basis for adaptation and risk management strategies. In support of studies on child undernutrition in Burkina Faso, this study analyzed the potential of remote sensing-based yield estimates at household level. Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data from the growing season 2018 were used to model yield of household fields (median 1.4 hectares (ha), min 0.01 ha, max 12.6 ha) for the five most prominent crops in the Nouna Health and Demographic Surveillance (HDSS) area in Burkina Faso. Based on monthly metrics of vegetation indices (VIs) and in-situ harvest measurements from an extensive field survey, yield prediction models for different crops of high dietary importance (millet, sorghum, maize, and beans) were successfully generated producing R2 between 0.4 and 0.54 (adj. R2 between 0.32 and 0.5). The models were spatially applied and resulted in a yield estimation map at household level, enabling predictions of up to 2 months prior to harvest.

The procedure was applied to detect the increase of HRBs between 2017 and 2019 in 39 counties in the center of the Xiong'an new area. The detected increases were validated and then analyzed in terms of their quantities, spatial distribution and driving forces at the county level. The results indicate that our method can effectively detect the increase of HRBs in large urban areas. The quantity and spatial distribution of the increased HRBs varies a lot in the 39 counties. Most of the increase is located in the north-east and the mid-west of the study region. As to the driving forces, it seems that no single factor can fully explain the increase. Among the five selected factors, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and transportation accessibility have clear high impacts than others. Number of Permanent Residents (NPR) and policy follow as the secondary group. The terrain has the lowest influence on the increase. Our method provides a useful tool to dynamically monitor HRBs in large areas and also the increase of HRBs can be employed as a new indicator to characterize urban development. © 2020 by the authors.","accessibility; artificial neural network; building; Gross Domestic Product; resident population; Sentinel; terrain; urban development","Change detection procedure; Fully convolutional networks; High-rising buildings; The xiong'an new area; Urban dynamic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085957296"

Large scale reduction in forest cover and landscape changes pose severe threat to the biodiversity of the basin. Accurate estimation of long-term changes occurring in large river basin is a big challenge. The difficulties involved in accurate quantification of land use and land cover changes are: range of data, procedural and analytical complications associated with diverse phenomena, space–time patterns and social and biophysical processes. In the present study, multi-temporal satellite imageries were used to assess Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in Shingla river basin from 1975 to 2018. Satellite imageries viz., Lands at 1 MSS (1975), IRS-Resources at 1 LISS III (2008) and Sentinel 2-A MSI (2018) were used to assess the LULC changes in Shingla river basin. Maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), a supervised classification method in QGIS SCP (Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin) was used to generate LULC maps of Shingla river basin for the year 1975, 2008 and 2018. Four LULC classes were selected for assessing LULC changes. Results reveal that vegetation cover in SRB witnessed a steady decrease from 72.45% in 1975 to 58.91% in 2018. Built-up areas increased linearly from 3.71% in 1975 to 12.24% in 2018. However, temporal changes in croplands and water bodies were not linear. Croplands increased from 17.46% (1975) to 22.49% (2008) and then decreased to 19.18% (2018). Similarly, water bodies increased from 6.37% (1975) to 11.06% (2008) and then decreased to 9.65% (2018). Using Kappa statistics, overall accuracy for the result was found to be 93.77% with a Kappa co-efficient value as 0.86. The findings of the present study are useful for planners and decision makers in sustainable natural resource management and degradation mitigation strategies. © 2020, Research Trend.

Furthermore, regularly updated wetland inventories are of particular importance given that wetlands comprise a dynamic, rather than permanent, land condition. Accordingly, satellite-derived wetland maps are greatly beneficial, as they capture a synoptic and multi-temporal view of landscapes. Leveraging state-of-the-art remote sensing data and tools, this study produces a high-resolution 10-m wetland inventory map of Canada, covering an approximate area of one billion hectares, using multi-year, multi-source (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) Earth Observation (EO) data on the Google Earth Engine™ cloud computing platform. The whole country is mapped using a large volume of reference samples using an object-based random forest classification scheme with an overall accuracy approaching 80% and individual accuracies varying from 74% to 84% in different provinces. This nationwide wetland inventory map illustrates that 19% of Canada’s land area is covered by wetlands, most of which are peatlands dominate in the northern ecozones. Importantly, the resulting ever-demanding wetland inventory map of Canada provides unprecedented details on the extent, status, and spatial distribution of wetlands and thus, is useful for many stakeholders, including federal and provincial governments, municipalities, NGOs, and environmental consultants. ©, Copyright © CASI.","Big data; Cloud computing; Decision trees; Engines; Information management; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Sustainable development; Cloud computing platforms; Earth observation data; Environmental consultants; Random forest classification; Remote sensing data; Resource assessments; Spatial resolution; Sustainable management; Wetlands","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078462757"

Traditionally, maps have been created using field-based approaches which, due to limitations in costs and time, restrict the size of the area for which they can be created and frequency at which they can be updated. With the increasing availability of satellite sensors providing multi-spectral imagery with high temporal frequency, new methods for efficient and accurate vegetation mapping have been developed. The objective of this study was to investigate to what extent multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery can assist in mapping complex compositional classifications at fine spatial scales. We deliberately chose a challenging case study, namely a visually and structurally homogenous scrub vegetation (known as kwongan) of Western Australia. The classification scheme consists of 24 target classes and a random 60/40 split was used for model building and validation. We compared several multi-temporal (seasonal) feature sets, consisting of numerous combinations of spectral bands, vegetation indices as well as principal component and tasselled cap transformations, as input to four machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines; SVM, Nearest Neighbour; NN, Random Forests; RF, and Classification Trees; CT) to separate target classes. The results show that a multi-temporal feature set combining autumn and spring images sufficiently captured the phenological differences between the classes and produced the best results, with SVM (74%) and NN (72%) classifiers returning statistically superior results compared to RF (65%) and CT (50%). The SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, the greenness indices captured during spring and the tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image emerged as most informative, which suggests that ecological factors (e.g. shared species, patch dynamics) occurring at a sub-pixel level likely had the biggest impact on class confusion. However, despite these challenges, the results are auspicious and suggest that seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery has the potential to predict compositional vegetation classes with high accuracy. Further work is needed to determine whether these results are replicable in other vegetation types and regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Western Australia; imagery; multispectral image; phenology; Sentinel; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; vegetation type","Mapping; Multispectral; Phenology; Tasselled cap; Vegetation classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081916210"

Data were comprised of high-spatial-resolution (QUICKBIRD) and moderate spatial resolution (SENTINEL-2) satellite images that allowed for the mapping of areas that were affected by major lithological and morphological changes. PLEIADES tri-stereo and LiDAR DEMs have been quantitatively and qualitatively compared and, although there are artefacts in the smaller structures (e.g., ridges and valleys), there is still a clear consistency between the two DEMs for the larger structures (as the main valleys and ridges).

Otherwise, between May 2012 and May 2017, large topographic changes occurred that were related to the emplacement of the 2014 lava flow in the NE part of the Sciara del Fuoco and to the accumulation of a volcaniclastic wedge in the central part of the Sciara del Fuoco.

This study utilised indices derived from multi-temporal Optical, Thermal and Radar data for developing model for Wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain yield using Machine learning approaches i.e., Random Forest Regression (RFR). Time series of Sentinel-2 derived Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized difference water Index (NDWI), Landsat-8 derived GPP using LST-EVI relationship (Temparature-Greeness model) and Sentinel-1 derived cross-polarization backscatter ratio (σVH/σVV) were used as predictor for wheat yield estimation. Actual grain yield measurements at ground were carried out at the end of the season over 178 locations. Seventy five percent of ground yield data were used for training of the model and rest twenty five percent data were used for its validation. All the datasets were grouped into ten fortnightly datasets ranging from November 2017 to March 2018. Through the random forest regression using time-series of NDVI alone, wheat grain yields were estimated with an RMSE of 9.8 Q ha-1. Subsequently by adding the multi-temporal NDWI, GPP and σVH/σVV led to the improvement of RMSE to 8.7, 7.6 and 7.4 Q ha-1 respectively. Variable importance based on the out of box error showed the significance of NDVI, NDWI and GPP during Dec-Jan and σVH/σVV during Feb for wheat grain estimation. It was concluded that the RFR algorithm together with the indices from optical, thermal and microwave satellite data can able to produced significantly accurate estimates of wheat grain yield. © Authors 2019.

Some land cover elements, as the vegetation and, in particular crops, are changing over seasons and over the growing cycle and may be characterized by their spectral temporal variability. In such cases, the spectral temporal variability can be used to model the crop's phenology and predict the crop type using both spatial and temporal spectral data. In this paper we aim to exploit the temporal dimension on the crop type classification using multi-temporal multispectral data and machine learning techniques. The high revisiting frequency of Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities on the exploitation of high temporal resolution multispectral data. In this investigation, we evaluated the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) methods, for mapping 18 summer crops using Sentinel-2 data.

In particular, we assume that there is a large undiscovered potential in multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) for topographic mapping. In this study, automated change detection from multitemporal multispectral ALS data was tested for the first time. The results showed that direct comparisons between height and intensity data from different dates reveal even small changes related to the development of a suburban area. A major challenge in future work is to link the changes with objects that are interesting in map production. In order to effectively utilize multisource remotely sensed data in mapping in the future, we also investigated the potential of satellite images and ground-based data to complement multispectral ALS. A method for continuous change monitoring from a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed and tested. Finally, a high-density point cloud was acquired with terrestrial mobile laser scanning and automatically classified into four classes. The results were compared with the ALS data, and the possible roles of the different data sources in a future map updating process were discussed. © The Authors.

The study area is abandoned Kizel coal basin, which is located in the Perm region, Russia. For the last 15-20 years, the acid mine drainage (AMD) and mine tailings leachate have caused extreme contamination of rivers with iron, alumini-um and heavy metals. Multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for 1987‒2017 and the results of hydrochemical monitoring of surface water bodies for 2006‒2013 are used as initial data. The Acid Mine Water Index (AMWI) is proposed to estimate the AMD-induced river contamination. This index is based on the reflectance values in blue and red spectral bands of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The AMWI values are compared with the iron concentration measurements in several streams flowing through of Kizel coal basin. The statistically significant correlation between the AMWI values and iron concentration is found for Yayva river. We have analyzed the temporal changes of AMWI for 1987‒2017, and found that AMWI values for Yayva and Kos'va rivers varied sometime in different directions. These variations can be explained by the difference of AMD regime. Also we outlined some areas (around 20 ha) of degraded soil and vegetation cover from high-resolution images. The largest areas of degraded soil and vegetation occurred in 2006‒2010 in association with the change of AMD regime. After 2010, the degradation process slowed down. © 2018 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

New cities are appearing in desert areas while existing cities and villages within the Nile floodplain are growing and pushing agricultural areas into the desert. To enable control and planning of the urban transformation, these rapid changes need to be mapped with high precision and frequency. Urban detection in rural areas in optical remote sensing is problematic when urban structures are built using the same materials as their surroundings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-temporal classification approach based on satellite data fusion and artificial neural networks. We applied the proposed methodology to data of the Egyptian regions of El-Minya and part of Asyut governorates collected from 1998 until 2015. The produced multi-temporal land cover maps capture the evolution of the area and improve the urban detection of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Sentinel-2 Prototype Land Cover 20 m map of Africa and the Global Human Settlements Layer from the Joint Research Center (JRC). The extension of urban and agricultural areas increased over 65 km2 and 200 km2, respectively, during the entire period, with an accelerated increase analysed during the last period (2010-2015). Finally, we identified the trends in urban population density as well as the relationship between farmed and built-up land. © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture; Climate change; Data fusion; Land reclamation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Neural networks; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Satellites; Structures (built objects); AI4EO; Egypt; Google earths; Land cover mapping; Landscape dynamics; Satellite data; Urban growth","AI4EO; Egypt; Google earth engine; Land reclamation; Landscape dynamics; Machine learning; Multi-temporal land cover mapping; Satellite data fusion; Urban growth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080961762"

In developing countries with fragmented land holdings there exists constant pressure on available water and land resources. Obtaining field scale crop specific information is challenging task. Advent of open freely available multi-temporal remote sensing observations with improved radiometric resolution the possibilities for near real / real time applications has increased. In this study and an attempt has been made to establish operational model for field level crop growth monitoring using integrated approach of crowd sourcing and time series of remote sensing observations. The time series of Sentinel 2 (A and B) satellite has been used to estimate crop growth related components such as vegetation indices and crop growth stage and crop phenology. In initial stage high valued cereal crop Wheat has been selected. The field level information (i.e. 108 Wheat fields) collected using mobile based agro-advisory platform mKRISHI® has been used to extract time series of Sentinel 2 observations (44 scenes for year 2016 and 2018). The moving average has been used for filling gaps in the time series of vegetation indices. The BFAST and GreenBrown package in R were used for detecting breaks in vegetation index time series and estimating crop growth stages. Analysis shows that the estimated crop phenology parameters were in better agreement with the field observations. In future more crops from different agro-climatic conditions will be considered for providing field level crop management advisory. © Authors 2018.","Crops; Developing countries; Forestry; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Water resources; Climatic conditions; Crop growth; Integrated approach; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Participatory Sensing; Radiometric resolution; Sentinel; Specific information; Time series analysis","Crop growth stage; Crop pehnology; Remote sensing; Sentinel; Time series analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056199548"

The Level 2A product is a basic product requested by many Sentinel-2 users: it provides surface reflectance after atmospheric correction, with a cloud and cloud shadow mask. The cloud/shadow mask is a key element to enable an automatic processing of Sentinel-2 data, and therefore, its performances must be accurately validated. To validate the Sentinel-2 operational Level 2A cloud mask, a software program named Active Learning Cloud Detection (ALCD) was developed, to produce reference cloud masks. Active learning methods allow reducing the number of necessary training samples by iteratively selecting them where the confidence of the classifier is low in the previous iterations. The ALCD method was designed to minimize human operator time thanks to a manually-supervised active learning method. The trained classifier uses a combination of spectral and multi-temporal information as input features and produces fully-classified images. The ALCD method was validated using visual criteria, consistency checks, and compared to another manually-generated cloud masks, with an overall accuracy above 98%. ALCD was used to create 32 reference cloud masks, on 10 different sites, with different seasons and cloud cover types. These masks were used to validate the cloud and shadow masks produced by three Sentinel-2 Level 2A processors: MAJA, used by the French Space Agency (CNES) to deliver Level 2A products, Sen2Cor, used by the European Space Agency (ESA), and FMask, used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The results show that MAJA and FMask perform similarly, with an overall accuracy around 90% (91% for MAJA, 90% for FMask), while Sen2Cor's overall accuracy is 84%.

In this study, we quantify wildfire damage to vegetation and soil based on the analysis of burn severity, using multitemporal and multispectral satellite data and species distribution models, particularly maximum entropy (MaxEnt). We studied a mega-wildfire (9000 ha burned) in North-Western Spain, which occurred from 21 to 27 August 2017. Burn severity was measured in the field using the composite burn index (CBI). Burn severity of vegetation and soil layers (CBIveg and CBIsoil) was also differentiated. MaxEnt provided the relative contribution of each pre-fire and post-fire input variable on low, moderate and high burn severity levels, as well as on all severity levels combined (burned area). In addition, it built continuous suitability surfaces from which the burned surface area and burn severity maps were built. The burned area map achieved a high accuracy level (κ = 0.85), but slightly lower accuracy when differentiating the three burn severity classes (κ = 0.81). When the burn severity map was validated using field CBIveg and CBIsoil values we reached lower κ statistic values (0.76 and 0.63, respectively).

The Autochange method outputs the pre-change land cover class, the change magnitude, and the change type. Pre-change land cover information is transferred to post-change imagery based on classes derived by unsupervised clustering, enabling using data from different instruments for pre-and post-change. The change magnitude and change types are computed by unsupervised clustering of the post-change image within each cluster, and by comparing the mean intensity values of the lower level clusters with their parent cluster means. A computational approach to determine the change magnitude threshold for the abrupt change was developed. The method was demonstrated with three summer image pairs Sentinel-2/Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-2/ALOS 2 PALSAR in a study area of 12,372 km2 in southern Finland for the detection of forest clear cuts and tested with independent data.

This study assesses the PAI Autonomous System from Transmittance Sensors at 57° (PASTiS-57) instrument as a low-cost transmittance sensor for simultaneous monitoring of LSP and LAI in forest ecosystems. In a field experiment, spring leaf flush and autumn senescence in a Dutch beech forest were observed with PASTiS-57 and illumination independent, multi-temporal Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) measurements in five plots. Both time series agreed to less than a day in Start Of Season (SOS) and End Of Season (EOS). LAI magnitude was strongly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98. PASTiS-57 summer and winter LAI were on average 0.41m2m-2 and 1.43m2m-2 lower than TLS. This can be explained by previously reported overestimation of TLS. Additionally, PASTiS-57 was implemented in the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) model for sensitivity analysis. This confirmed the robustness of the retrieval with respect to non-structural canopy properties and illumination conditions. Generally, PASTiS-57 fulfilled the CEOS LPV requirement of 20% accuracy in LAI for a wide range of biochemical and illumination conditions for turbid medium canopies. However, canopy non-randomness in discrete tree models led to strong biases. Overall, PASTiS-57 demonstrated the potential of autonomous devices for monitoring of phenology and LAI at daily temporal resolution as required for validation of satellite products that can be derived from ESA Copernicus' optical missions, Sentinel-2 and -3. © 2018 by the authors.","Biology; Correlation methods; Ecosystems; Leaf springs; Radiative transfer; Seebeck effect; Sensitivity analysis; Surface measurement; Surveying instruments; Forest; Ground based; Land surface phenology; Leaf Area Index; Radiative transfer model; Validation; Forestry","DART model; Forest; Ground-based; Land surface phenology; Leaf area index; Radiative transfer model; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050458625"

In this study, multitemporal cloud masking (MCM) used to detect cloud and cloud shadow masking for Landsat 8 was improved to detect cloud and cloud shadow for Sentinel-2 data. This improvement takes advantages of the spectral similarity between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. To assess the reliability of the new MCM algorithm, several data selected from different environments such as sub-tropical South, tropical, and sub-tropical North were evaluated. Moreover, these data have heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types. In visual assessment, the algorithm can detect cloud and cloud shadow accurately. In the statistical assessment, the user’s and producer’s accuracies of sample in sub-tropical environments of cloud masking was 99% and 96%, respectively, and cloud shadow masking was 99% and 98%, respectively. In addition, the user’s and producer’s accuracies of sample in tropical environments of cloud masking was 100% and 95%, respectively, and cloud shadow masking was 100% and 92%, respectively. Compared to Fmask, MCM has higher accuracies in most of the results of cloud and cloud shadow masking in both sub-tropical and tropical environments. The results showed that the improved-MCM algorithm can detect cloud and cloud shadow for Sentinel-2 data accurately in all scenarios and the accuracies are significantly high. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Remote sensing; Sensors; Cloud masking; Complementary data; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Spectral similarity; Statistical assessment; Tropical environments; Visual assessments; algorithm; CloudSat; data set; image analysis; Landsat; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; Tropics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076914037"

The Kairouan plain, a semi-arid region in central Tunisia (North Africa), was selected as a test area for this study. Firstly, an algorithm for the direct inversion of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was developed for the spatialization of the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. The soil moisture retrieved from these observations was first validated using ground measurements, recorded over 20 reference fields of cereal crops. A second method, based on the use of neural networks, was also used to confirm the initial validation. The results reported here show that the soil moisture products retrieved from remotely sensed data are accurate, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 5% between the two moisture products. In addition, the analysis of soil moisture and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products over cultivated fields, as a function of time, led to the classification of irrigated and rainfed areas on the Kairouan plain, and to the production of irrigation maps at the scale of individual fields. This classification is based on a decision tree approach, using a combination of various statistical indices of soil moisture and NDVI time series. The resulting irrigation maps were validated using reference fields within the study site. The best results were obtained with classifications based on soil moisture indices only, with an accuracy of 77%. © 2018 by the authors.","Arid regions; Cloud computing; Decision trees; Irrigation; Mapping; Mean square error; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural fields; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remotely sensed data; Root mean square errors; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Water cloud models; Soil surveys","Irrigation; NDVI; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Soil moisture; Water cloud model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058895722"

Furthermore, many mapping applications, such as object-based classification, crop type distinction, or large-scale yield prediction benefit significantly from the accurate delineation of fields. Still, most existing field maps and observation systems rely on historic administrative maps or labor-intensive field campaigns. These are often expensive to maintain and quickly become outdated, especially in regions of frequently changing agricultural patterns. However, exploiting openly available remote sensing imagery (e.g., from the European Union's Copernicus programme) may allow for frequent and efficient field mapping with minimal human interaction. We present a new approach to extracting agricultural fields at the sub-pixel level. It consists of boundary detection and a field polygon extraction step based on a newly developed, modified version of the growing snakes active contours model we refer to as graph-based growing contours. This technique is capable of extracting complex networks of boundaries present in agricultural landscapes, and is largely automatic with little supervision required. The whole detection and extraction process is designed to work independently of sensor type, resolution, or wavelength. As a test case, we applied the method to two regions of interest in a study area in the northern Germany using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. Extracted fields were compared visually and quantitatively to ground reference data. The technique proved reliable in producing polygons closely matching reference data, both in terms of boundary location and statistical proxies such as median field size and total acreage. © 2020, by the authors.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Complex networks; Data visualization; Extraction; Image segmentation; Mapping; Active contours model; Agricultural landscapes; Environmental Monitoring; Mapping applications; Object-based classifications; Observation systems; Regions of interest; Remote sensing imagery; Remote sensing","Active contours; Boundary detection; Field extraction; Graph-based growing contours; Growing snakes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084257610"

Yet these forests are threatened due to rapid population growth and predicted changes in rainfall patterns. As such, large-scale woody cover monitoring of tropical dry forests is urgently required. Although promising, remote sensing-based estimation of woody cover in tropical dry forest ecosystems is challenging due to the heterogeneous woody and herbaceous vegetation structure and the large intra-annual variability in the vegetation due to the seasonal rainfall. To test the capability of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for producing accurate woody cover estimations, two contrasting study sites in Ethiopia and Tanzania were used. The estimation accuracy of a linear regression model using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and a Random Forest regression model using both single-date and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images were compared. Additionally, the robustness and site transferability of these methods were tested. Overall, the multi-temporal PLSR model achieved the most accurate and transferable estimations (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 4.12%). This model was then used to monitor the potential increase in woody coverage within several reforestation projects in the Degua Tembien district. In six of these projects, a significant increase in woody cover could be measured since the start of the project, which could be linked to their initial vegetation, location and shape. It can be concluded that a PLSR model combined with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is capable of monitoring woody cover in these tropical dry forest regions, which can be used in support of reforestation efforts. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision trees; Ecosystems; Least squares approximations; Population statistics; Rain; Reforestation; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Tropics; Vegetation; Herbaceous vegetation; Intra-annual variability; Linear regression models; Normalised difference vegetation index; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Rapid population growth; Sub-saharan africa; Tropical dry forest; Satellite imagery","Method comparison; Model transferability; PLSR; Random forest; Reforestation monitoring; Sentinel-2; Tropical dry forests; Woody cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084476533"

Land and crops classification using satellite images is a recent important subject. From the other side, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) is a powerful technique for understanding images. This paper describes a pixel based crops and land cover classification originating from one source satellite imagery represented by Sentinel satellite and based on several dates for the same agricultural season. We propose a DCNN architecture based on multi-temporal data that was fed to a one-dimension (1-D DCNN). The proposed architecture is compared with other methods of satellite image classification algorithms; such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NNs). Experiments are conducted for the mutual experiment of major crops and land cover classification for Al-Fayoum governorate in Egypt. The 1-D DCNN achieves about 89% accuracy using 10 spectral bands from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery database for the area of interest. The proposed architecture although it outperforms other methods, needs further research to optimize the memory usage. © 2018 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Crops; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Nearest neighbor search; Network architecture; Neural networks; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Crop classification; Egypt; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; TensorFlow; Image classification","Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crop Classification; Egypt; Remote Sensing (RS); Satellite Images; Sentinel-2; TensorFlow","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063160114"

The log-ratio method for SDB, which allows use of minimal calibration information from lidar surveys (25 points in this study), is applied to several Sentinel-2A/B scenes at 10 m spatial resolution. The overall performance during a one-year study period depends on the image quality and AC. Three AC processors were evaluated: ACOLITE Exponential model (EXP), ACOLITE Dark Spectrum Fitting model (DSF), and C2RCC model. ACOLITE EXP and ACOLITE DSF produce greater consistency and repeatability with accurate results in a scene-by-scene analysis (mean errors ∼1.1 m) for depths up to 23 m (limit of lidar surveys). In contrast, C2RCC produces lower accuracy and noisier results with generally higher (>50%) errors (mean errors ∼2.2 m), but it is able to retrieve depth for scenes in Buck Island that have moderately severe sunglint. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a multi-temporal compositing model for SDB mapping, using ACOLITE for the input scenes, could achieve overall median errors <1 m for depths ranging 0-23 m. The simple and effective compositing model can considerably enhance coastal SDB estimates with high reliability and no missing data, outperforming the traditional single image approaches and thus eliminating the need to evaluate individual scenes. The consistency in the output from the AC correction indicates the potential for automated application of the multi-scene compositing technique, which can apply the open and free Sentinel-2 data set for the benefit of operational and scientific investigations. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","Bathymetry; Errors; Optical radar; Satellites; Surveys; Atmospheric corrections; Automated applications; Calibration information; Compositing techniques; Exponential models; Log-ratio method; Scientific investigation; Spatial resolution; article; calibration; Caribbean; image quality; reliability; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083292478"

Increasing trends in both expansion and logging of Moso bamboo have occurred over the past four decades due to its rapid growth rate and short harvest rotation period. The spatial and temporal distribution of bamboo forest is the basis for the study of the carbon cycle in bamboo forest ecosystems. Previous studies have consistently focused on different influences of scale, data and algorithms for bamboo forest mapping; however, there is still considerable uncertainty in bamboo forest mapping due to the unique on-year and off-year phenomena and their significant differences in spectral characteristics. Northwestern Zhejiang Province has the most widely distributed bamboo forest and was selected as the study area. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time-series data, changes in the spectral characteristics during the growth cycle of bamboo forest were analyzed and the optimum time window for the classification of the bamboo forest was determined. The seasonal index of the bamboo forest based on spectral differences was the proposed approach, and on-year and off-year bamboo forest mapping was conducted seasonally using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that (1) the best period to distinguish bamboo forest from other forest types is April–May, followed by December–February, and the best month for distinguishing between on-year and off-year bamboo forests is May; (2) the spectral differences between bamboo forest and other forest types are mainly reflected in the red-edge 3 near-infrared (NIR) and NIR narrow bands (740–865 nm); (3) Sentinel-2 data have obvious advantages over Landsat 8 data in distinguishing the bamboo forest because of better spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions; and (4) the multi-temporal bamboo forest index has a better overall classification accuracy (OA = 91.2) for distinguishing on-year and off-year bamboo forests than the mono-temporal index and can be applied to other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","China; Zhejiang; Phyllostachys pubescens; Bamboo; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Photomapping; Time series; Tropics; LANDSAT; Moso bamboo; Multi-temporal; On-year and off-year; Sentinel-2; bamboo; crop rotation; forest ecosystem; growth rate; index method; Landsat; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial distribution; subtropical region; time series analysis; vegetation mapping; Forestry","Landsat 8; Moso bamboo forest; Multi-temporal index; On-year and off-year; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067576255"

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development.

In this study, Sentinel-2 images were employed to assess the damage from a wildfire, which occurred in the coniferous forest of Gangneung, Gangwon Province, South Korea on April 2019. The images were captured from both Sentinel-2A and-2B, shortening the temporal interval of available pre-and post-fire images. Multi-temporal image analysis was performed in both object and pixel-based with two commonly used spectral indices, NDVI and NBR. Additional image pair from the same period of 2018 was used to distinguish the fire-affected regions from the naturally changed area and compared with the results from using only one pair of images from 2019. The experimental results showed that the change detection performance could be affected by the number of image pairs and spectral indices used to discriminate burned region from unburned region. Thus it verified the significance of adequately employing annual multi-pair satellite images for wildfire damage assessment. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Climate change; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecology; Fires; Image analysis; Change detection; Multitemporal image analysis; OBIA; Sentinel-2; Wildfire damages; Damage detection","Change detection; Multi-temporal image analysis; OBIA; Sentinel-2; Wildfire damage assessment","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074298942"

In this paper, we investigate feasibility of delivering early and along the season crop specific maps using available free satellite data over multiple years, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. For this study, a test site in Kyiv region (Ukraine) is selected, for which we have been collecting ground data on crop types every year since 2011. Crop type maps are generated through a supervised classification of multi-temporal multi-source satellite data using previously developed artificial neural network algorithms. It is shown, how multi-year crop classification maps are used for crop rotation violation detection. The study shows that in case of considerable cloud cover, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, for example acquired by Sentinel-1 satellite, can be interchangeably used with optical imagery to achieve the target 85% accuracy for crop classification. © 2018 The Author(s).

This type of data is often available from coarse spatial resolutioninstruments (MODIS) (250-500m) and mediumuch as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer spatial resolution instruments such as the Landsat series (30m), but with many applications finer spatial details aredesired. With the launch of European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel series, higher spatial resolution data (10m)at high temporal frequency provide new opportunities for agricultural applications.To improve available regional information and methods, we explored high temporal resolution radar and opticalobservations from the Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectralInstrument (MSI) for mapping major crop types (corn, soybean, and rice) in Eastern and Northeastern China. Toaccomplish this, we construct Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 growing season time series data sets, and usedunsupervised clustering for our exploratory land cover/crop type classification. Moving forward, we plan to buildsupervised models for Eastern and Northeastern China to account for difference in crop phenology.

To this date, the monitoring at large scale of fire events is mainly performed using low spatial resolution sensors such as MODIS and VIIRS and ancillary data like active fire maps. However, the data produced by the new generation of spaceborne multispectral missions can be used for burned area detection at a finer spatial and temporal scale with respect to existing methods. In this paper we present a method that analyzes time-series of optical images acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to detect burned areas in a fully automatic and unsupervised way. The method analyzes each image in the time-series to extract Candidate Burned Areas (CBAs). CBAs are analyzed accounting for the temporal correlation to reduce the number of false alarms. In particular, only pixels that have a temporal profile consistent with the physical event of a fire are selected. Moreover, the time variable is used to compute the confidence of the detection. The method has been tested on a time-series of the Attica region, Greece, which was affected by large fires in 2018.

The military conflict in South-Eastern Ukraine has been on-going since 2014, with a major socio-economic impact on the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In this study, we quantify land cover land use changes in those regions related to cropland changes. Cropland areas account for almost 50% of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and with the declining industry between 2014 and 2017, the role of agriculture to the regional economy has increased. We use freely available satellite data and machine learning methods to map cropland extent in 2013 and 2018 and derive corresponding changes in cropland areas. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify multi-temporal Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 images into cropland and non-cropland areas, and a sampling-based approach to estimate the areas of cropland change. We found that net cropland losses were not uniform across the regions, and were more substantial in the areas not under control of the Ukrainian Government (22% of net cropland area loss compared to cropland areas in 2013) and within a buffer zone along the conflict border line (46%), where combat activities occur. These results highlight the impact of the conflict on agriculture and the utility of spatially explicit information acquired from Earth observation satellites, especially for areas, where collecting ground-based data is impractical. © Copyright © 2019 Skakun, Justice, Kussul, Shelestov and Lavreniuk.","Doneck; Luhansk [Ukraine]; Ukraine; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Economics; Land use; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Regional planning; Satellites; cropland abandonment; Land cover land use; LANDSAT; Military conflicts; Sentinel-2; Ukraine; agricultural land; land cover; land use change; Landsat; machine learning; military intervention; satellite data; Sentinel; Economic and social effects","agriculture; cropland abandonment; land cover land use; Landsat 8; military conflict; Sentinel-2; Ukraine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076676605"

This study evaluates the capabilities of PlanetScope CubeSat data to estimate canopy height derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) by comparing estimates using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data. Random forest (RF) models using a single composite, multi-seasonal composites, and time-series data were investigated at different spatial resolutions of 3, 10, 20, and 30 m. The highest prediction accuracy was obtained by the PlanetScope multi-seasonal composites at 3 m (relative root mean squared error: 51.3%) and Sentinel-2 multi-seasonal composites at the other spatial resolutions (40.5%, 35.2%, and 34.2% for 10, 20, and 30 m, respectively). The results show that RF models using multi-seasonal composites are 1.4% more accurate than those using harmonic metrics from time-series data in the median.

Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and}{Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products.

These dense Time Series (TS) of multispectral data are used for a wide range of applications enabling multi-temporal monitoring of physical phenomena. Nevertheless, one of the main challenges in their usage is related to missing information caused by cloud occlusions. In the literature, many cloud restoration approaches have been proposed. However, to properly recover missing information, sophisticated and usually computationally intensive techniques should be used. In this work, we consider the deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifier which is very promising for classification of dense time series of images, and investigate its robustness to the cloud presence without any cloud restoration. Indeed, this classifier has proven to be able to handle the presence of clouds. However, no work which extensively analyzes the robustness of LSTM to clouds can be found in the literature. In this study, we aim to quantitatively asses the capability of the network of handling different amount of cloud coverage under different lengths of the TS. In greater detail, we analyze the effect of the cloud coverage on the classification maps produced by the LSTM by considering: (i) simulated cloud values, (ii) detected clouds represented by zeros values, and (iii) restored images by simple linear temporal gap filling (i.e., average of the spectral values acquired in the previous and following cloud-free images in the TS). The obtained results demonstrate that the capability of the LSTM to handle the cloud cover depends on: (i) the length of the TS, (ii) the position of the cloudy images in the TS, and (iii) the cloud representation values. For example, when clouds are restored with very simple and fast linear temporal gap filling, the map agreement between the cloud-free and the cloudy map is 96% even when the 40% of images in the TS are covered with clouds, regardless of their position. © SPIE.

The area concerned (Loukkos), in addition to its strategic position, is characterized by a Mediterranean climate with a strong ecological value. It presents an intense agricultural activity with a great diversity of cultures whose functioning could be affected by climate change. To quantify water requirements, we used the series of satellite images acquired during 09/2017 to 08/2018. Maps produced for three classification levels illustrate our approach. The study showed that the 10 optical channels, at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution, of the data acquired by Sentinel-2 provide good performance, with a kappa index > 85% for all (sub)classes and an overall accuracy > 86%. These performances are superior to those obtained with radar data acquired by Sentinel-1, with F-score deviations of 9% lower on average, and up to 29% (on cork oak/SSC level). Neither the addition of optical radiometric indices, nor the optical and radar combination data provide a significant improvement in performance obtained with Sentinel-2 data. In order to exploit the data obtained, future work would focus on studying the temporal profiles of each type of crop. © 2020 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

Heavy metal stress in crops poses a serious threat to crop quality and human health. However, differentiating between heavy metal and non-heavy metal stress presents a great challenge, since responses to environmental stress in crops are complex and uncertain, with different stressors possibly triggering similar canopy reflectance responses. This study aims to infer the occurrence probability of heavy metal stress (i.e., Cd stress) on a regional scale by integrating satellite-derived vegetation index and spatio-temporal characteristics of different stressors with a Bayesian method. The study area is located in the Hunan Province, China. Seven scenes of Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2016 to 2017 were collected, as well as Cd concentrations in the soil. First, the probability of rice being stressed was screened using the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE) at all the growth stages of rice. Further, the stressed rice was used as input, along with the coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from NDRE, for a Bayesian method to infer rice exposed to Cd pollution. The results demonstrated that NDRE was a sensitive indicator for assessing stress levels in rice crops. The CSTV with a threshold of 2.7 successfully detected rice under Cd as well as abrupt stress on a regional scale. A high map accuracy for Cd induced stress in rice was achieved with an accuracy of 81.57%. This study suggests that vegetation index obtained from satellite images can assist in capturing crop stress, and that the used Bayesian method can be very useful for distinguishing a specific stressor in crops by incorporating temporal-spatial characteristic of different stressors in crops into satellite-derived vegetation index. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bayes Theorem; China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Oryza; Satellite Imagery; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Stress, Physiological; Bayesian networks; Cadmium; Health risks; Satellites; Vegetation; cadmium; heavy metal; heavy metal; Bayesian methods; Heavy metal stress; Multi-temporal satellite images; Occurrence probability; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Temporal-spatial characteristics; Bayesian analysis; heavy metal; probability; rice; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial variation; temporal variation; vegetation index; accuracy; Article; Bayes theorem; biological monitoring; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; nonhuman; normalized difference red edge index; plant growth; plant stress; rice; satellite imagery; screening test; sensitivity analysis; soil chemistry; vegetation; analysis; Bayes theorem; crop; environmental monitoring; human; Oryza; physiological stress; physiology; pollution; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; statistics and numerical data; Crops","Bayesian method; Coefficients of spatio-temporal variation; Heavy metal stress; Sentinel-2 images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060544485"

The high availability of free medium-high spatial resolution optical satellite data, offered by the Copernicus Programme, has enabled the development of more detailed post-fire mapping. This research study deals with the exploitation of Sentinel-2 time series to map burned areas, taking advantages from the high revisit frequency and improved spatial and spectral resolution of the MSI optical sensor. A novel procedure is here presented to produce medium-high spatial resolution burned area mapping using dense Sentinel-2 time series with no a priori knowledge about wildfire occurrence or burned areas spatial distribution. The proposed methodology is founded on a threshold-based classification based on empirical observations that discovers wildfire fingerprints on vegetation cover by means of an abrupt change detection procedure. Effectiveness of the procedure in mapping medium-high spatial resolution burned areas at the national level was demonstrated for a case study on the 2017 Italy wildfires. Thematic maps generated under the Copernicus Emergency Management Service were used as reference products to assess the accuracy of the results. Multitemporal series of three different spectral indices, describing wildfire disturbance, were used to identify burned areas and compared to identify their performances in terms of spectral separability. Result showed a total burned area for the Italian country in the year 2017 of around 1400 km2, with the proposed methodology generating a commission error of around 25% and an omission error of around 40%. Results demonstrate how the proposed procedure allows for the medium-high resolution mapping of burned areas, offering a benchmark for the development of new operational downstreaming services at the national level based on Copernicus data for the systematic monitoring of wildfires. © 2020 by the authors.","Image resolution; Mapping; Maps; Risk management; Time series; Abrupt change detection; Burned-area mapping; Emergency management; High spatial resolution; High-resolution mapping; Multi-temporal series; Spectral separability; Supporting knowledge; Fires","BAIS2; Burned area mapping; Fire monitoring; Italy wildfires; Operational service; Sentinel-2; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072382295"

While bringing huge economic benefits to China, aquaculture has caused serious damage to the coastal ecological environment, such as eutrophication of seawater and a series of water pollution problems. How to effectively monitor the pollution of offshore aquaculture to guide fishery production and prevent red tide is an urgent problem to be studied and solved. Remote sensing, with its advantages of wide coverage, periodicity and low cost, can effectively monitor the spatial and temporal changes of offshore polluted water bodies, which is conducive to the comprehensive analysis of Marine phenomena. In recent years, the eutrophication of waters of Zhelin Bay has intensified, which has become a red tide area, bringing serious economic losses to fishery. It is of great significance to study the distribution of chlorophyll a concentration and its spatiotemporal variation. Take the Zhelin Bay culture area in eastern Guangdong as an example, it is an important aquaculture base in China. Based on the measured hyperspectral data and the concentration of water quality parameters, the spectral characteristics of water body analyzed in Zhelin Bay.Remote sensing inversion model established by the optical classification theory. The accuracy of the inversion model verified by using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images. The distribution characteristics and the temporal and spatial variation of Chlorophyll-a concentration were studied. The results show the reflectivity ratio at the wavelength of 705 nm has a good correlation with the chlorophyll a concentration, and the correlation coefficient is 0.7. For the sentinel-2 data, the model constructed with (Rrs(705)-Rrs(665))/(Rrs(705)+Rrs(665)) as the inversion factor has the best fitting effect, the determination coefficient R2 is 0.891, and the average relative error is 13.25%. Spatial distribution pattern of chlorophyll a concentration: chlorophyll a concentration is higher in the western and northern coastal aquaculture areas of Zhelin Bay, followed by the central net box culture area in the bay, and the shellfish culture area is lower. Spatial and temporal variation characteristics of chlorophyll a concentration: higher concentration of chlorophyll a found in the late stage of breeding, followed by the middle stage and the early stage.

Crop type mapping using RS at various temporal and spatial resolutions plays an important role spanning from environmental to economical. The main objective of the current study was to evaluate the significance of optical data in a multi-temporal crop type classification-based on very high spatial resolution and high spatial resolution imagery. With this aim, three images from WorldView-3 and Sentinel-2 were acquired over Coalville (UK) between April and July 2016. Three vegetation indices (VIs); the normalized difference vegetation index, the green normalized difference vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index were generated using red, green and near-infrared spectral bands; then a supervised classification was performed using ground reference data collected from field surveys, Random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classification algorithms. Accuracy assessment was undertaken by comparing the classified output with the reference data. An overall accuracy of 91% and κ coefficient of 0·90 were estimated using the combination of RF and DT classification algorithms. Therefore, it can be concluded that integrating very high- and high-resolution imagery with different VIs can be implemented effectively to produce large-scale crop maps even with a limited temporal-dataset.

Such information can be derived from remote sensing data. In spite of topic's relevance, not enough efforts have been invested to exploit modern pattern recognition and machine learning methods for agricultural land-cover mapping from multi-temporal, multi-sensor earth observation data. Furthermore, only a small proportion of the works published on this topic relates to tropical/subtropical regions, where crop dynamics is more complicated and difficult to model than in temperate regions. A major hindrance has been the lack of accurate public databases for the comparison of different classification methods. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to share a multi-temporal and multi-sensor benchmark database that can be used by the remote sensing community for agricultural land-cover mapping. Information about crops in situ was collected in Luís Eduardo Magalhães (LEM) municipality, which is an important Brazilian agricultural area, to create field reference data including information about first and second crop harvests. Moreover, a series of remote sensing images was acquired and pre-processed, from both active and passive orbital sensors (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2/MSI, Landsat-8/OLI), correspondent to the LEM area, along the development of the main annual crops. In this paper, we describe the LEM database (crop field boundaries, land use reference data and pre-processed images) and present the results of an experiment conducted using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. © Authors 2018.

This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica. With the future development of tailored machine learning approaches of feature extraction and pattern detection, Sentinel-2 can become extremely useful to screen wider regions with short revisiting times and to undertake comparative condition assessment analyses of different heritage sites. © 2018 by the authors.","Damage detection; Extraction; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Change detection; Cultural heritages; Damage assessments; Google earths; Libya; Multi-spectral imagery; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Syria; Urban growth","Change detection; Cultural heritage; Damage assessment; Feature extraction; Google Earth; Libya; Multispectral imagery; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Syria","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046004988"

The level of spatial detail afforded by these observations at fine resolution (10-30m) allows a much in deep understanding of the timing and importance of turbidity plumes. The results indicate that the proposed approach is effective for fusing both missions (MAE of 5.21 mg/L and 3.89 mg/L in estuary and bay, respectively), producing more frequency for continuous monitoring, which is particularly valuable at these latitudes that are severely covered (~50%) by clouds and sunglint. These findings encourage further research with great implications to establish a continuous framework for the upcoming high-resolution services relying on both missions. © 2018 IEEE.","Geology; Turbidity; Atmospheric corrections; Cadiz; Continuous monitoring; Guadalquivir estuary; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2; SW Iberian Peninsula; Total suspended solids; Remote sensing","Cadiz; Landsat-8; Sentinel-2; Total suspended solids; Turbidity plumes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064147219"

Considerable amount of experimental research, obtained by using primary scanning data from satellites (geodata), require the effective application of automated processing methods using GIS technologies and deep interpretation. This can significantly change the process of background monitoring of changes occurring in the territory of the NPP, which can be a test subregional object of the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. In protected areas, landscape changes can serve as indicators of the state and changes in geo-ecological situations. There are two key issues: the selection of representative objects and the indication of changes. To solve the problem of choosing local landscape units and indicating their changes, the authors used a large environmental protection test object - the Slobozhansky national natural park. It was created less than 10 years ago in the basin of the Merla River, a second-order tributary of the Dnieper River. The study used high-resolution processing of geodata obtained by scanning the territory from the satellite Sentinel-2. The research methodology is described, various methods of geodata processing are experimentally verified and compared. Their rational complex has been selected in the context of the purpose of the study. It is determined that the interpretation of satellite images can be effectively used to recognize landscape units through the identification of plant communities (as the most informative component of the landscape). For this purpose, combinations of spectral channels that were most effective for recognizing vegetation cover were selected experimentally. Under field conditions, a correspondence between vegetation cover and certain landscape stands was established. Spectral methods for comparing multi-temporal data were selected to establish seasonal differences and to track temporary (temporal) changes. Significant amount of experimental studies using primary satellite information in combination with automated processing with the use of GIS technologies made it possible to monitor and control the entire process of highly accurate information processing. As additional information, maps of the relief, soil cover, and wetlands were digitized, and then they were subjected to overlay analysis. At the most characteristic key points, the results of the interpretation were verified by the terrestrial landscape survey. The results of the complex were processed with the use of geo-information technologies and supplemented by the use of overlay analysis of the attribute data that had been displayed earlier on the relief maps, vegetation, and water bodies (primarily of lowland marshes). Thus, a landscape map-hypothesis of the facies level - the topologically smallest natural territorial complex of the complex landscape of the territory - was compiled. Founding on the research and analysis of world and domestic experience, the authors suggested using wetlands as an object of monitoring, and contours and condition (aspect) of their surface, recognized semi-automatically using GIS technologies, as indicators. © 2019, National Academy of Sciences.

In terms of consumption of natural resources and pollution, cities are seen as entities with most significant impact to the natural environment. Strategic policies focused on tackling the challenges induced by climate change suggest in fact the necessity to start from the management and operating models of the cities themselves. This study illustrates an initial evaluation of parameters for purposes of urban generation studies using optical multi-spectral satellite imagery from Landsat-5, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 missions. The changes in land occupation and urban density are the first aspects chosen to be examined for the period 1985–2020. The focus was given on possible modifications occurred in occasion of Milano Expo 2015. The paper firstly explores the known best band combination for observation of urban fabric. Suggestions derived have then been calibrated with reference to ground truth data, while the image pairs over the 35 years span were then build with selected bands. Finally, all image pairs have been processed for Principal Component Analysis in order to identify possible “hot-spots” of significant changes. The results found on the image pair 2006–2015 have been explored in detail and checked upon official orthophotos. Monitoring of changes in urban fabric using multispectral optical imagery can provide valuable insights for further evaluation of single urban generation interventions.

Sinop Nuclear Power Plant, which will be built on Sinop Ä°nceburun peninsula at the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is one of the three different nuclear power plants planned to be built in Turkey. The Sinop Nuclear Power Plant consist of four different reactors. The construction of the first unit is expected to be completed by 2023, and the fourth unit is planned to be activated by 2028. On the other hand, the construction of the nuclear power plant will alter the land use at the actual plant site and its surroundings and hence may cause significant environmental changes. As an indicator, more than 650000 trees have been cut so far for the construction of nuclear power plant, and this can adversely affect the ecological balances of the region by endangering habitats and creating ecological damages. The aim of this study is to analyse the land use/land cover changes (LULC) in the forestry-dominated areas due to the construction of nuclear power plants using the multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images. For this purpose, different change detection methods such as SAR intensity image differencing, supervised image classification method (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were applied to Sentinel 1 satellite image datasets (2016-2019) to evaluate the annual changes due to construction. In addition, a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy structure and vegetation biomass using Sentinel 2 NDVI dataset (2016-2019) and calibrated Sentinel 1 backscatter values.

The assessment of biodiversity is an important and essential goal to achieve but it can results difficult, time consuming and expensive when based on field data. Remote sensing covers large areas and provides consistent quality and standardized data, which can be used to estimate species diversity. One method to estimate species diversity from remote sensing data is based on the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), which assumes that the higher the spectral variation of an image, the higher the environmental heterogeneity and the species diversity of the considered area. SVH has been tested using different spectral heterogeneity (SH) indices and measures, recently the Rao's Q index has been proposed as a new spectral variation measure to be applied to remote sensing data. In this paper, we tested the SVH in an alpine coniferous forest to estimate tree species diversity. We evaluated the performance of the Rao's Q index and compared it with another widely used SH index, the Coefficient of Variation (CV), validating them against values of Shannon's H (used as species diversity index) derived from in-situ collected data. A NDVI time-series (for 2016 and 2017) derived from the Sentinel-2A and 2B and Landsat 8 OLI satellites has been used to test the effect of the spatial grain of both the sensors and to understand the seasonality of the SVH. The results showed that the SVH is season and sensor dependent. For both years and satellites, the relation between Rao's Q and field data reached the highest R2 between June and July, decreasing towards winter and spring similarly to the NDVI time-series. This relationship could be given because, when NDVI reaches its highest values, it is able to capture small variation in reflectance of different leaf traits typical of specific trees. The relation between field and spectral diversity reached a value of R2 = 0.70 (2017) and R2 = 0.48 (2016) for Sentinel-2 and of R2 = 0.42 (2017) and R2 = 0.47 (2016) for Landsat 8. CV showed the same NDVI temporal tendency. However, the relation between field-derived Shannon's H and CV was on average lower than that we found for Rao's Q. This research underlined the goodness of the Rao's Q index, the relevance of the NDVI in the study of the SVH and the importance of the multi-temporal approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Coniferophyta; alpine environment; biodiversity; coniferous forest; data quality; diversity index; estimation method; forest cover; heterogeneity; index method; Landsat; NDVI; remote sensing; Sentinel; species diversity; spectral reflectance; terrestrial ecosystem; time series analysis","Alpine ecosystems; Biodiversity; Environmental heterogeneity; Remote sensing; Spectral heterogeneity index; Time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065048906"

Most land use and land cover classification (LULC) approaches, however, are designed for cloud-free and mono-temporal observations. The increasing temporal capabilities of today’s sensors enable the use of temporal, along with spectral and spatial features.Domains such as speech recognition or neural machine translation, work with inherently temporal data and, today, achieve impressive results by using sequential encoder-decoder structures. Inspired by these sequence-to-sequence models, we adapt an encoder structure with convolutional recurrent layers in order to approximate a phenological model for vegetation classes based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel 2 (S2) images. In our experiments, we visualize internal activations over a sequence of cloudy and non-cloudy images and find several recurrent cells that reduce the input activity for cloudy observations. Hence, we assume that our network has learned cloud-filtering schemes solely from input data, which could alleviate the need for tedious cloud-filtering as a preprocessing step for many EO approaches. Moreover, using unfiltered temporal series of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data, our experiments achieved state-of-the-art classification accuracies on a large number of crop classes with minimal preprocessing, compared to other classification approaches. © 2018 by the authors.","","Crop classification; Deep learning; Land cover classification; Land use; Multi-temporal classification; Recurrent networks; Sentinel 2; Sequence encoder; Sequence-to-sequence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046448909"

However, NDVI-based C factor (Cndvi) estimation per se is sensitive to various biophysical variables, such as soil condition, topographic features, and vegetation phenology. As a result, Cndvi often results in incorrect values that affect the quality of soil erosion prediction. The aim of this study is to multi-temporally estimate Cndvi values and compare the values with those of literature values (Clit) in order to quantify discrepancies between C values obtained via NDVI and empirical-based methods. A further aim is to quantify the effect of biophysical variables such as slope shape, erodibility, and crop growth stage variation on Cndvi and soil erosion prediction on an agricultural landscape scale. Multi-temporal Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 data, from 2013 to 2016, were used in combination with high resolution agricultural land use data of the Integrated Administrative and Control System, from the Uckermark district of north-eastern Germany. Correlations between Cndvi and Clit improved in data from spring and summer seasons (up to r = 0.93); nonetheless, the Cndvi values were generally higher compared with Clit values. Consequently, modelling erosion using Cndvi resulted in two times higher rates than modelling with Clit. The Cndvi values were found to be sensitive to soil erodibility condition and slope shape of the landscape. Higher erodibility condition was associated with higher Cndvi values. Spring and summer taken images showed significant sensitivity to heterogeneous soil condition. The Cndvi estimation also showed varying sensitivity to slope shape variation; values on convex-shaped slopes were higher compared with flat slopes. Quantifying the sensitivity of Cndvi values to biophysical variables may help improve capturing spatiotemporal variability of C factor values in similar landscapes and conditions. © 2020, by the authors.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biophysics; Forecasting; Land use; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Springs (components); Vegetation; Agricultural land use; Agricultural landscapes; Bio-physical variables; Normalized difference vegetation index; North-eastern germany; Spaceborne earth observations; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal variability; Erosion","C factor; Germany; IACS; Landsat 7; Landsat 8; Sentinel 2; Slope shape; Soil erodibility; Soil erosion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084262972"

There are concerns that this DEM is not accurate enough for this purpose, especially over mountainous regions like in Austria. In this study, we investigate the height accuracy of PlanetDEM in Austria by comparing it with a reference DEM that is derived from airborne laser scanning. Afterwards, we predict the errors in the Sentinel orthophotos that are caused by these DEM errors: 99.8% of all pixels have a PlanetDEM-induced displacement between ±10 m (i.e. one Sentinel-2 pixel) for all investigated four satellite tracks over Austria. Still, at a few spots, the location errors can reach 60 m. ESA’s goal is to achieve a multi-temporal geo-registration quality (for Level-1C products) of 3 m (95.5% confidence) once the Global Reference Image is established. If we assume that this error budget consists partly of a georeferencing and partly of a DEM-induced error and both are equal, then the DEM-induced error may only amount to 2 m. In this case, PlanetDEM would not allow for this accuracy in the mountainous regions, because there, according to the predictions of this study, 95.5% of the errors are between ±3.8 m. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis.","Austria; Budget control; Error analysis; Errors; Image registration; Photogrammetry; Pixels; Airborne Laser scanning; Digital elevation model; European Space Agency; Geo-registration; Mountainous regions; Ortho-rectification; Satellite images; simulation; accuracy assessment; digital elevation model; elevation; error analysis; image processing; laser method; model; mountain region; orthophoto; photogrammetry; pixel; satellite imagery; Sentinel; simulation; Surveying","digital elevation models; error analysis; image registration; Orthorectification; photogrammetry; simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049854345"

Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of non-photosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology. © 2018 The Authors","Friesland; Frisian Islands; Netherlands; Schiermonnikoog; West Frisian Islands; Cameras; Image resolution; Orbits; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Systems engineering; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Wetlands; Landscape variability; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI time series; Phenology; Radiative transfer modelling; Repeat photographies; Salt marshes; Sentinel-2; Spatial resolution; barrier island; chlorophyll; EOS; instrumentation; landscape; modeling; NDVI; phenology; photograph; photography; saltmarsh; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; vegetation type; Forestry","Digital repeat photography; Landscape variability; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI time series; Phenology; Radiative transfer modelling; Salt marsh; Sentinel-2; Spatial resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043984473"

The main challenges faced by cities currently and towards the future are the rapid urbanization, the increase in urban temperature and the urban heat island. Mapping and monitoring urban fabric (UF) to analyze the environmental impact of these phenomena is more necessary than ever. This coupled with the increased availability of Earth observation data and their growing temporal capabilities leads us to consider using temporal features for improving land use classification, especially in urban environments where the spectral overlap between classes makes it challenging. Urban land use classification thus remains a central question in remote sensing. Although some research studies have successfully used multi-temporal images such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 to improve land cover classification, urban land use mapping is rarely carried using the temporal dimension. This paper explores the use of Sentinel-2 data in a deep learning framework, by firstly assessing the temporal robustness of four popular fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) trained over single-date images for the classification of the urban footprint, and secondly, by proposing a multi-temporal FCN. A performance comparison between the proposed framework and a regular FCN is also conducted. In this study, we consider four UF classes typical of many European Western cities. Results show that training the proposed multi-date model on Sentinel 2 multi-temporal data achieved the best results with a Kappa coefficient increase of 2.72% and 6.40%, respectively for continuous UF and industrial facilities. Although a more definitive conclusion requires further testing, first results are promising because they confirm that integrating the temporal dimension with a high spatial resolution into urban land use classification may be a valuable strategy to discriminate among several urban categories. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric temperature; Convolutional neural networks; Environmental impact; Image enhancement; Integration testing; Land use; Mapping; Remote sensing; Urban growth; Earth observation data; High spatial resolution; Land cover classification; Landuse classifications; Multi-temporal; Performance comparison; Sentinel-2; Urban fabrics; Deep learning","Deep-learning; Multi-temporal approach; Sentinel-2; Urban fabric","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080903816"

In order to control these losses, their timely detection is important. Thrips is one of the major pests in capsicum which is unable to detect in initial phase as the symptoms are not visible to naked eyes. Thrips not only causes plant damage but for the serious plant diseases it vectors. In this paper, we address the problem of detection of low infestation of thrips on capsicum leaves using multi-temporal hyperspectral remote sensing data simulated to multispectral sensors such as Sentinel-2 and Tetracam RGB+3. The reectance data from capsicum leaves with healthy and low infestations of thrips has been collected using handheld spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm and bandwidth varying from 3.22 nm to 3.346 nm during the period of 17 Mar to 13 Apr 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multi-temporal data difficult. We have evaluated the performance of tuned random forest classifier for various set of features such as full feature set of 213 bands, features selected by Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) from 213 bands, features simulated to broad bands similar to Sentinel 2 and features simulated to multispectral bands similar to Tetracam RGB+3 (a camera which can be placed on drones). Results suggests that an overall classification accuracy of 92.81 % has been achieved on validation dataset using full feature set whereas accuracy slightly dips down to 90.3, 85.13 and 87.45 % when using selected features by LASSO, bands simulated to Sentinel-2 and Tetracam-RGB+3 respectively.

In this study, a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data set was used to classify common tree species over a mature forest in central Sweden. The tree species to be classified were Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus silvestris), Hybrid larch (Larix × marschlinsii), Birch (Betula sp.) and Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). Four Sentinel-2 images from spring (7 April and 27 May), summer (9 July) and fall (19 October) of 2017 were used along with the Random Forest (RF) classifier. A variable selection approach was implemented to find fewer and uncorrelated bands resulting in the best model for tree species identification. The final model resulting in the highest overall accuracy (88.2%) came from using all bands from the four image dates. The single image that gave the most accurate classification result (80.5%) was the late spring image (27 May); the 27 May image was always included in subsequent image combinations that gave the highest overall accuracy. The five tree species were classified with a user's accuracy ranging from 70.9% to 95.6%. Thirteen of the 40 bands were selected in a variable selection procedure and resulted in a model with only slightly lower accuracy (86.3%) than that using all bands. Among the highest ranked bands were the red edge bands 2 and 3 as well as the narrow NIR (near-infrared) band 8a, all from the 27 May image, and SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands from all four image dates. This study shows that the red-edge bands and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 are of importance, and confirms that spring and/or fall images capturing phenological differences between the species are most useful to tree species classification. © 2018 by the authors.","Decision trees; Forestry; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Plants (botany); Superconducting materials; Boreo-nemoral; Multi-temporal; Phenology; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Tree species; Variable selection; Classification (of information)","Boreo-nemoral; Multi-temporal; Phenology; Random Forest; Sentinel-2; Tree species classification; Variable selection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057097174"

Evaluating uncertainties of different Sentinel-2 biophysical products over various regions and vegetation types is pivotal in the application of land surface models. In this study, we quantified the performance of Sentinel-2-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) estimates using global ground observations with consistent measurement criteria. Our results show that the accuracy of vegetation and non-vegetated classification based on Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products is greater than 95%, which indicates the vegetation identification is favorable for the practical application of biophysical estimates, as several LAI, FAPAR, and FVC retrievals were derived for non-vegetated pixels. The rate of best retrievals is similar between LAI and FAPAR estimates, both accounting for 87% of all vegetation pixels, while it is almost 100% for FVC estimates. Additionally, the Sentinel-2 FAPAR and FVC estimates agree well with ground-measurements-derived (GMD) reference maps, whereas a large discrepancy is observed for Sentinel-2 LAI estimates by comparing with both GMD effective LAI (LAIe) and actual LAI (LAI) reference maps. Furthermore, the uncertainties of Sentinel-2 LAI, FAPAR and FVC estimates are 1.09 m2/m2, 1.14 m2/m2, 0.13 and 0.17 through comparisons to ground LAIe, LAI, FAPAR, and FVC measurements, respectively. Given the temporal difference between Sentinel-2 observations and ground measurements, Sentinel-2 LAI estimates are more consistent with LAIe than LAI values.

Satellite determination of glacier snow cover, derived over large regions, can reveal its spatial variability and temporal trends. Accordingly, snow mapping on glaciers has been widely applied using several satellite sensors. However, as glacier ice originates from compressed snow, both have very similar spectral properties and standard methods to map snow struggle to distinguish snow on glaciers. Hence, most studies applied manual delineation of snow extent on glaciers. Here we present an automated tool, named 'ASMAG' (automated snow mapping on glaciers), to map SC on glaciers and derive the related snow line altitude (SLA) for individual glaciers using multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM). The method has been developed using the example of the ötztal Alps, where an evaluation of the method is possible using field-based observations of the annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and the accumulation area ratio (AAR) measured for three glaciers for more than 30 years. The tool automatically selects a threshold to map snow on glaciers and robustly calculates the SLA based on the frequency distribution of elevation bins with more than 50% SC. The accuracy of the SC mapping was about 90% and the SLA was determined successfully in 80% of all cases with a mean uncertainty of ±19 m. When cloud-free scenes close to the date of the highest snowline are available, a good to very good agreement of SC ratios (SCR)/SLA with field data of AAR/ELA are obtained, otherwise values are systematically higher/lower as useful images were often acquired too early in the summer season. However, glacier specific differences are still well captured. Snow mapping on glaciers is impeded by clouds and their shadows or when fresh snow is covering the glaciers, so that more frequent image acquisitions (as now provided by Sentinel-2) would improve results. © 2019 by the authors.","Automation; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Glaciers; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Satellite imagery; Snow; Surveying; Digital elevation model; Equilibrium line altitudes; LANDSAT; Mass balance; Multi-temporal analysis; Snow covered area; Snow mapping; Snowline; Mapping","Digital elevation model; Equilibrium line altitude; Glacier; Landsat; Mass balance; Multi-temporal analysis; Snow line altitude; Snow mapping; Snow-covered area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068190805"

In this study, we developed and tested a method for tea plantation identification based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images and a multi-feature Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We used phenological patterns of tea cultivation in China’s Shihe District (such as the multiple annual growing, harvest, and pruning stages) to extracted multi-temporal Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived first spectral derivative, NDVI and textures, and topographic features. We then assessed feature importance using RF analysis; the optimal combination of features was used as the input variable for RF classification to extract tea plantations in the study area. A comparison of our results with those achieved using the Support Vector Machine method and statistical data from local government departments showed that our method had a higher producer’s accuracy (96.57%) and user’s accuracy (96.02%).

Information on the proportion of broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models obtained from 3D photogrammetric point clouds. However, the broadleaf-conifer information cannot be obtained from photogrammetric point clouds alone. Furthermore, spectral information of aerial images is too inconsistent to be used for automatic broadleaf-conifer classification over larger areas. In this study we combined multi-temporal Sentinel 2 optical satellite images, 3D photogrammetric point clouds from digital aerial stereo photographs, and forest inventory plots representing an area of 35,751 km2 in south-west Germany for (1) modelling the percentage of broadleaf tree volume (BL%) using Sentinel 2 time series and (2) modelling timber volume per hectare using 3D photogrammetric point clouds. Forest inventory plots were surveyed in the same years and regions as stereo photographs were acquired (2013-2017), resulting in 11,554 plots. Sentinel 2 images from 2016 and 2017 were corrected for topographic and atmospheric influences and combined with the same forest inventory plots. Spectral variables from corrected multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images were calculated, and Support VectorMachine (SVM) regressions were fitted for each Sentinel 2 scene estimating the BL% for corresponding inventory plots. Variables from the photogrammetric point clouds were calculated for each inventory plot and a non-linear regression model predicting timber volume per hectare was fitted. Each SVMregression and the timber volume model were evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation (CV). The SVMregression models estimating the BL% per Sentinel 2 scene achieved overall accuracies of 68%-75% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 21.5-26.1. The timber volumemodel showed a RMSE% of 31.7%, amean bias of 0.2%, and a pseudo-R2 of 0.64. Application of the SVMregressions on Sentinel 2 scenes covering the state of Baden-Württemberg resulted in predictions of broadleaf tree percentages for the entire state. These predicted values were used as additional predictor in the timber volume model, allowing for predictions of timber volume for the same area. Spatially high-resolution information about growing stock is of great practical relevance for forest management planning, especially when the timber volume of a smaller unit is of interest, for example of a forest stand or a forest districtwhere not enough terrestrial inventory plots are available to make reliable estimations. Here, predictions from remote-sensing based models can be used. Furthermore, information about broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models and reduces model errors and, thereby, prediction uncertainties. © 2019 by the authors.","Air Craft; Forecasts; Forestry; Photogrammetry; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Coniferophyta; Aerial photography; Antennas; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Mean square error; Photogrammetry; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Stereo image processing; Support vector machines; Timber; Time series; 3D point cloud; Forest inventory data; Forest management plans; Satellite images; Stereo-photographs; forest canopy; forest inventory; forest management; height determination; numerical model; photogrammetry; regression analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; time series analysis; Forestry","3D point clouds; Digital aerial stereo photographs; Forest inventory data; Forest management plans; Remote sensing; Satellite images; Time series; Tree genera classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072568303"

Biophysical properties provide a good understanding of physics of the interaction between vegetation and solar radiation. Crop canopy properties can be collected through inversion using nadir reflectance in various bands. NDVI is sensitive to the light, angle of view, sensor after canopy peak is touched. Rice crop biophysical parameters are autonomous from viewing angle and light conditions. The major rice crop biophysical parameters are leaf area index (LAI), Chlorophyll content, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), canopy water content (CWC), fraction of cover (FCover), and crop biomass respectively. Biophysical parameters are known as mirrors of plant health construction and crop yield. Regression model was developed using chlorophyll, CWC, FAPAR, LAI and FCover with coefficient of determination 0.83 to accurately predict crop biomass.

They acquire imagery at spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m in a temporal and spatial coverage that could before only be realized on the basis of lower resolution Earth observation data ((Formula presented.) 250 m). However, images gathered by these modern missions rapidly add up to data volume that can no longer be handled with standard work stations and software solutions. Hence, this contribution introduces the TimeScan concept which combines pre-existing tools to an exemplary modular pipeline for the flexible and scalable processing of massive image data collections on a variety of (private or public) computing clusters. The TimeScan framework covers solutions for data access to arbitrary mission archives (with different data provisioning policies) and data ingestion into a processing environment (EO2Data module), mission specific pre-processing of multi-temporal data collections (Data2TimeS module), and the generation of a final TimeScan baseline product (TimeS2Stats module) providing a spectrally and temporally harmonized representation of the observed surfaces. Technically, a TimeScan layer aggregates the information content of hundreds or thousands of single images available for the area and time period of interest (i.e. up to hundreds of TBs or even PBs of data) into a higher level product with significantly reduced volume. In first test, the TimeScan pipeline has been used to process a global coverage of 452,799 multispectral Landsat–8 scenes acquired from 2013 to 2015, a global data-set of 25,550 Envisat ASAR radar images collected 2010–2012, and regional Sentinel–1 and Sentinel–2 collections of (Formula presented.) 1500 images acquired from 2014 to 2016. The resulting TimeScan products have already been successfully used in various studies related to the large-scale monitoring of environmental processes and their temporal dynamics. © 2018 The Author(s).

Despite many efforts there is currently no operational CWC product available to users. In the context of the Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), we have developed an algorithm to produce a global dataset of CWC based on data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board Meteorological–Operational (MetOp) satellites forming the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS). CWC reflects the water conditions at the leaf level and information related to canopy structure. An accuracy assessment of the EPS/AVHRR CWC indicated a close agreement with multi-temporal ground data from SMAPVEX16 in Canada and Dahra in Senegal, with RMSE of 0.19 kg m−2 and 0.078 kg m−2 respectively. Particularly, when the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) was included the algorithm was better constrained in semi-arid regions and saturation effects were mitigated in dense canopies. An analysis of spatial scale effects shows the mean bias error in CWC retrievals remains below 0.001 kg m−2 when spatial resolutions ranging from 20 m to 1 km are considered. The present study further evaluates the consistency of the LSA-SAF product with respect to the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) product, and demonstrates its applicability at different spatio-temporal resolutions using optical data from MSI/Sentinel-2 and MODIS/Terra & Aqua. Results suggest that the LSA-SAF EPS/AVHRR algorithm is robust, agrees with the CWC dynamics observed in available ground data, and is also applicable to data from other sensors. We conclude that the EPS/AVHRR CWC product is a promising tool for monitoring vegetation water status at regional and global scales. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Particularly, the effects of the characteristics of input image pairs on the prediction performance are investigated by considering the principle of spatiotemporal fusion. An experiment on the fusion of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images in agricultural fields was conducted to evaluate the prediction performance. Three representative fusion models, including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), SParse-representation-based SpatioTemporal reflectance Fusion Model (SPSTFM), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), were applied to this comparative experiment. The three spatio-temporal fusion models exhibited different prediction performance in terms of prediction errors and spatial similarity. However, regardless of the model types, the correlation between coarse resolution images acquired on the pair dates and the prediction date was more significant than the difference between the pair dates and the prediction date to improve the prediction performance. In addition, using vegetation index as input for spatio-temporal fusion showed better prediction performance by alleviating error propagation problems, compared with using fused reflectance values in the calculation of vegetation index. These experimental results can be used as basic information for both the selection of optimal image pairs and input types, and the development of an advanced model in spatio-temporal fusion for crop monitoring. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

Drylands are usually sparsely vegetated, and biological soil crusts (biocrusts) – that is, soil surface communities of cyanobacteria, mosses and/or lichens – can cover up to 70% of dryland cover. As they control key ecosystem processes, monitoring their spatial and temporal distribution can provide highly valuable information. In this study, we examine the potential of European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S2) data to characterize the spatial and temporal development of biocrust and vascular plant greening along a rainfall gradient of the Negev Desert (Israel). First, the chlorophyll a absorption feature in the red region (CRred) was identified as the index mostly sensitive to changes in biocrust greening but minimally affected by changes in soil moisture. This index was then computed on the S2 images and enabled monitoring the phenological dynamics of different dryland vegetation components from August 2015 to August 2017. The analysis of multi-temporal S2 images allowed us to successfully track the biocrust greening within 15 days from the first seasonal rain events in the north of Negev, and to identify the maximum development of annual vascular plants and greening of perennial ones. These results show potential for monitoring arid and semi-arid environments using the newly available S2 images, allowing new insights into dryland vegetation dynamics. © The Author(s) 2019.","Israel; Negev; Southern District; Bryophyta; Cyanobacteria; Tracheophyta; monitoring; multispectral image; phenology; remote sensing; Sentinel; soil crust; vegetation dynamics","Biological soil crust; continuum removal; drylands; hyperspectral; multispectral; phenology; remote sensing; satellite","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064637679"

Sentinel-2 satellite constellation launched lately, provides optical images with short revisit cycle, high spatial resolution, large coverage and free accessibility. Thus it has great potential in surface deformation mornitoring. Based on the coregistration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) software package, we obtained the ground deformation field of the 2016 MW7.8 Kaikoura, New Zealand Earthquake from the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, using the sub-pixel cross-correlation technique. We systematically analyzed the system error sources of Sentinel-2 image pairs and proposed a modified subtraction method to mitigate the satellite attitude jitter distortions in the deformation field. Then, we compared the results of four bands(Band 2/3/4/8)with the spatial resolution of 10-meter and the statistic results show that Band8 is the optimum band for ground deformation monitoring. Moreover, we mapped the coseismic displacement field of the earthquake from Sentinel-2 optical images, and analyzed the slip distribution along the major faults. The results indicate that the maximum horizontal slip is up to 10 meters. For accuracy evaluation, we also calculated the coseismic displacement field of this event using the Landsat8 panchromatic images. The results indicate that Sentinel-2 has higher precision for the ground deformations monitoring.

The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure = 91.86% on average). The high classification accuracy obtained to distinguished debris-covered glaciers using our approach will be useful to determine the actual available water resources which can be further helpful for hazard and water resource management. © 2013 IEEE.","Cost effectiveness; Debris; Decision trees; Floods; Global warming; Learning algorithms; Mapping; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Sea level; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Textures; Water management; Actual available waters; Automatic classification; Cost-effective solutions; High performance computing; Random forests; Remote sensing technology; Supervised machine learning; Waterresource management; Machine learning","Artificial neural network (ANN); glacier mapping and remote sensing; random forest (RF); support vector machine (SVM)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078782963"

Time-series of vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are widely used for crop mapping, as they can characterize the growth cycle of crops. However, with the moderate spatial resolution optical imagery acquired by Landsat and Sentinel-2, it is difficult to obtain complete time-series curves for vegetation indices due to the influence of the revisit cycle of the satellite and weather conditions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method for compositing the multi-temporal NDVI, in order to map winter crop planting areas with the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images. The algorithm composites the multi-temporal NDVI into three key values, according to two time-windows-a period of low NDVI values and a period of high NDVI values-for the winter crops. First, we identify the two time-windows, according to the time-series of the NDVI obtained from daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations. Second, the 30 m spatial resolution multi-temporal NDVI curve, derived from the Landsat-7 and -8 and Sentinel-2 optical images, is composited by selecting the maximal value in the high NDVI value period, and the minimal and median values in the low NDVI value period, using an algorithm of the Google Earth Engine. Third, a decision tree classification method is utilized to perform the winter crop classification at a pixel level. The results indicate that this method is effective for the large-scale mapping of winter crops. In the study area, the area of winter crops in 2018 was determined to be 207,641 km2, with an overall accuracy of 96.22% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The method proposed in this paper is expected to contribute to the rapid and accurate mapping of winter crops in large-scale applications and analyses. © 2019 by the authors.","Decision trees; Engines; Food supply; Forestry; Geometrical optics; Image resolution; Mapping; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Vegetation; Google earths; LandSat 7; NDVI; Sentinel-2; Winter crops; Crops","Google Earth Engine; Landsat-7and8; NDVI; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Winter crops","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063991729"

In particular, publicly available data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications. However, there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes. In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar’s chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 ± 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 ± 0.017), random forests (0.739 ± 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 ± 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar’s test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified.

Crop classification based on deep learning can further improve the estimation accuracy of production. In this paper, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF2 data are used as data sources. Sentinel-2 data is used as training data, and GF-2 data is used as validation data. Jilin Province in Northeast of China is selected as the experimental area. The experimental area is classified as rice, towns, corn and soy. Firstly, the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and GF-2 data is preprocessed. Then, the Sentinel-2 data is used to classify crops based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group (VGG). The red edge band, multiple indexes including normalization difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI) and difference vegetation index (DVI) are added respectively to compare with the classification results of original multitemporal Sentinel-2 data.

Accordingly, the applicability of the proposed classification-feature selection ensemble procedure with different feature sets for crop mapping is investigated. Here, we produced various feature sets including spectral bands, spectral indices, variation of spectral index, texture, and combinations of features to map different types of crops. By using various feature sets and the random forest (RF) classifier, the crop maps were created. In aiming to determine the most relevant and distinctive features, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and RF-variable importance measure feature selection methods were examined. The classification-feature selection ensemble procedure was adapted to combine the outputs of different feature sets from the better feature selection method using majority votes. Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data has been used in Ghale-Nou county of Tehran, Iran. The performance of RF was efficient in crop mapping especially by spectral bands and texture in combination with other feature sets. Our results showed that the PSO-based feature selection leads to a more accurate classification than the RF-variable importance measure, in almost all feature sets for all crop types. The RF classifier-PSO ensemble procedure for crop mapping outperformed the RF classifier in each feature set with regard to the class-wise and overall accuracies (OA) (of about 2.7-7.4% increases in OA and 0.48-3.68% (silage maize), 0-1.61% (rice), 2.82-15.43% (alfalfa), and 10.96-41.13% (vegetables) improvement in F-scores for all feature sets). The proposed method could mainly be useful to differentiate between heterogeneous crop fields (e.g., vegetables in this study) due to their more obtained omission/commission errors reduction. © 2020 by the author.","Agricultural robots; Crops; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Information management; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photomapping; Random forests; Textures; Vegetables; Agricultural resources; Classification features; Feature selection methods; Multi-temporal; Overall accuracies; Spectral indices; Tehran , Iran; Variable importances; Classification (of information)","Crop mapping; Feature selection; Multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image; Particle swarm optimization; Random forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086004557"

In this study, Yellow River Delta wetlands, as a typical estuary wetland in the north part of China, are considered the study area. The random forest method, which has evident advantages in feature selection and classification, was chosen to extract wetland information from the study area. First, five different characteristic variables, namely, spectral features, vegetation index, water index, red edge index, and texture features, were generated based on Sentinel-2 data with rich multi-temporal and spectral information. Then, six different classification schemes were constructed based on the preceding characteristic information. Finally, random forest classifier was used to extract the wetland information of the Yellow River Delta and verify the extraction accuracy of different results. The purpose is to select the best plan to improve the effect of wetland information extraction. Results are as follows: (1) The effective use of multiple feature variables is the key to improving the extraction of wetland information. The contribution of different characteristics to the wetland information extraction is described as follows: the red edge index > vegetation index and water index > spectral feature > texture feature. (2) The preferred features based on the random forest algorithm are crucial to extraction accuracy, with an overall accuracy of up to 90.93%, and Kappa coefficient of 0.90. This result shows that the random forest algorithm can effectively process feature selection. In feature variable data mining, the accuracy of the wetland information extraction can be guaranteed, and the operation efficiency can be improved. This study also provides a new idea, method, and technology for the selection of data sources and feature and method selections for wetland information extraction. © 2019, Science Press.

The glacier lake inventory is based on Landsat 7 and 8 (15 m spatial resolution), and Sentinels 2A (10 m spatial resolution) satellite imageries. The data revealed that during the years 2002–2017, the number of glacial lakes increased from 215 to 255. The glacial lake area also increased from ~ 9.0 km2 in 2003 to ~ 9.36 km2 in 2013 and ~ 11.27 km2 in 2017. During 2002–2017, the lake area increased by ~ 2.27 km2, out of which ~ 1.9 km2 increase is recorded between 2013 and 2017 accounts for almost 84% of the total increase. The lakes with an area of ≥ 0.2 km2 have been considered for glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility studies and volume estimation. Analyses of the data show a progressive increase in number of glacial lakes and their areal extent.

The objective of this short communication is to assess the value of multi-temporal information for crop type classification using Sentinel-2 data. The analysis is carried out in an agricultural region in Austria and considers nine crop types during two years (2016 and 2017). To assess the impact of multi-temporal information, we applied a Random Forest (RF) classifier and analysed the results by using the RF out-of-bag error to calculate the overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score. The models were also validated using an independent reference dataset. Results show how the addition of multi-temporal information increases the crop type classification accuracy with similar trends for 2016 and 2017. At the very beginning of the crop growing season (March–April), the classification achieves relatively low accuracies (OA: ∼0.50). Significant increases in OA can be obtained between May and June, until the OA reaches its highest value in July. The final RF model was able to predict with very high confidence nine crop types for both years (OA: 0.95–0.96 and F1 score: 0.83–1.00). The independent validation dataset with more than 5000 reference plots showed comparable results (OA: 91–95% and F1 score: 0.74–0.99). We conclude that the multi-temporal crop type classification efficiently mitigates negative effects observed when using single-date acquisition within sub-optimal temporal windows. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Austria; accuracy assessment; algorithm; classification; crop; data acquisition; data set; numerical model; satellite data; Sentinel","Crop type; Multi-temporal classification; Random forest; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051638516"

Wet and active river channels are obtained from the processing of imagery datasets. Information about channel widths and active channel surface subdivision in water, vegetation and gravel coverage classes are evaluated along with channel centerline lengths and sinuosity indices. The analysis is carried out on a series of optical remotely-sensed imagery acquired by different satellite missions during the time period between 1968 and 2017. Data from the CORONA, LANDSAT and Sentinel-2 missions were considered. Besides satellite imagery, a digital elevation model and aerial ortho-photos were also used. The procedure was applied to three, highly dynamic, Albanian rivers: Shkumbin, Seman and Vjosë, showing a high potential for application in contexts with limitations in ground data availability. The results of the procedure were assessed against reference data produced by means of expert interpretation of a reference set of river reaches. The results differ from reference values by just a few percentage points (<6%). The time evolution of hydromorphological parameters is well characterized, and the results support the design of future studies aimed at the understanding of the relations between climatic and anthropogenic controls and the response of river morphological trajectories. Moreover, the high spatial and temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 mission motivates the development of an automatic monitoring system based on a rolling application of the defined procedure. © 2018 by the authors.","","Albanian rivers; Geomatics; Image processing; River morphological trajectories; River morphology; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051736067"

Unfortunately, geospatial data of natural habitats of the GBHs are often outdated, imprecise, and coarse, and need updating for improved management and protection actions. Recent developments in satellite image availability, combined with enhanced machine learning algorithms and computing capacity, enable cost-efficient updating of geospatial information of these already severely fragmented habitats. This study aimed to develop a more accurate method for mapping closed canopy evergreen natural forest (CCEF) of the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) ecoregion in Tanzania and Kenya, and to update the knowledge on its spatial extent, level of fragmentation, and conservation status. We tested 1023 model possibilities stemming from a combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery, spatial texture of S1 and S2, seasonality derived from Landsat-8 time series, and topographic information, using random forest modelling approach. We compared the best CCEF model with existing spatial forest products from the EAM through independent accuracy assessment. Finally, the CCEF model was used to estimate the fragmentation and conservation coverage of the EAM. The CCEF model has moderate accuracy measured in True Skill Statistic (0.57), and it clearly outperforms other similar products from the region. Based on this model, there are about 296,000 ha of Eastern Arc Forests (EAF) left. Furthermore, acknowledging small forest fragments (1-10 ha) implies that the EAFs are more fragmented than previously considered. Currently, the official protection of EAFs is disproportionally targeting well-studied mountain blocks, while less known areas and small fragments are underrepresented in the protected area network. Thus, the generated CCEF model should be used to design updates and more informed and detailed conservation allocation plans to balance this situation. The results highlight that spatial texture of S2, seasonality, and topography are the most important variables describing the EAFs, while spatial texture of S1 increases the model performance slightly. All in all, our work demonstrates that recent developments in Earth observation allows significant enhancements in mapping, which should be utilized in areas with outstanding biodiversity values for better forest and conservation planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Textures; Topography; Biodiversity values; Conservation planning; Conservation status; Eastern arc mountains; Geo-spatial informations; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Terrestrial biodiversity; Topographic information; Mapping","Conservation; East Africa; Eastern arc; Forest remote sensing; Machine learning; Multi-sensor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085345764"

The two identical European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites provide data with unprecedented spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we investigated the potential benefits of using high temporal resolution data for classification of five coniferous and seven broadleaved tree species in a diverse Central European Forest. To run the classification, 18 cloud-free S2 acquisitions were analyzed in a two-step approach. The available scenes were first used to stratify the study area into six broad land-cover classes. Subsequently, additional classification models were created separately for the coniferous and the broadleaved forest strata. To permit a deeper analytical insight in the benefits of multi-temporal datasets for species identification, classification models were developed taking into account all 262,143 possible permutations of the 18 S2 scenes. Each model was fine-tuned using a stepwise recursive feature reduction. The additional use of vegetation indices improved the model performances by around 5 percentage points. Individual mono-temporal tree species accuracies range from 48.1% (January 2017) to 78.6% (June 2017). Compared to the best mono-temporal results, the multi-temporal analysis approach improves the out-of-bag overall accuracy from 72.9% to 85.7% for the broadleaved and from 83.8% to 95.3% for the coniferous tree species, respectively. Remarkably, a combination of six-seven scenes achieves a model quality equally high as the model based on all data; images from April until August proved most important. The classes European Beech and European Larch attain the highest user's accuracies of 96.3% and 95.9%, respectively. The most important spectral variables to distinguish between tree species are located in the Red (coniferous) and short wave infrared (SWIR) bands (broadleaved), respectively. Overall, the study highlights the high potential of multi-temporal S2 data for species-level classifications in Central European forests. © 2019 by the authors.","Forestry; Infrared radiation; Biosphere reserve; Central European forests; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-2; Short wave infrared bands; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Tree species; Tree species composition; Classification (of information)","Multi-temporal; Sentinel-2; Tree species classification; Wienerwald biosphere reserve","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075341548"

However, as different rice varieties share highly similar spectral/temporal patterns, distinguishing one variety from another is highly challenging. In this study, a deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) is constructed in both spectral and time domains. The purpose is to learn the fine features of each rice variety in terms of its spectral reflectance characteristics and growing phenology, which is a new attempt aiming for agriculture intelligence. An experiment was conducted at a major rice planting area in southwest New South Wales, Australia, during the 2016-17 rice growing season. Based on a ground reference map of rice variety distribution, more than one million labelled samples were collected. Five rice varieties currently grown in the study area are investigated and they are Reiziq, Sherpa, Topaz, YRM 70, and Langi. A time series of multitemporal remote sensing images recorded by the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2A satellite was used as inputs. These images covered the entire rice growing season from November 2016 to May 2017. Experimental results showed that a good overall accuracy of 92.87% was achieved with the proposed approach, outperforming a standard support vector machine classifier that produced an accuracy of 57.49%. The Sherpa variety showed the highest producer's accuracy (98.46%), while the highest user's accuracy was observed for the Reiziq variety (97.93%).

Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons. In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos-Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier.

Accurate detection of clouds and cloud shadows can help exclude these contaminated pixels in further applications. Existing cloud screening methods are challenged by cloudy regions where most of satellite images are contaminated by clouds. To solve this problem for landscapes where the typical frequency of cloud-free observations of a pixel is too small to use existing methods to mask clouds and shadows, this study presents a new Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA) method to screen clouds and cloud shadows in multi-temporal optical images. ATSA has five main steps: (1) calculate cloud and shadow indices to highlight cloud and cloud shadow information; (2) obtain initial cloud mask by unsupervised classifiers; (3) refine initial cloud mask by analyzing time series of a cloud index; (4) predict the potential shadow mask using geometric relationships; and (5) refine the potential shadow mask by analyzing time series of a shadow index. Compared with existing methods, ATSA needs fewer predefined parameters, does not require a thermal infrared band, and is more suitable for areas with persistent clouds. The performance of ATSA was tested with Landsat-8 OLI images, Landsat-4 MSS images, and Sentinel-2 images in three sites. The results were compared with a popular method, Function of Mask (Fmask), which has been adopted by USGS to produce Landsat cloud masks. These tests show that ATSA and Fmask can get comparable cloud and shadow masks in some of the tested images. However, ATSA can consistently obtain high accuracy in all images, while Fmask has large omission or commission errors in some images. The quantitative accuracy was assessed using manual cloud masks of 15 images. The average cloud producer's accuracy of these 15 images is as high as 0.959 and the average shadow producer's accuracy reaches 0.901. Given that it can be applied to old satellite sensors and it is capable for cloudy regions, ATSA is a valuable supplement to the existing cloud screening methods. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Geometrical optics; Masks; Pixels; Satellites; Time series; Cloud detection; Cloud shadows; Geometric relationships; Optical satellite images; Quantitative accuracy; Satellite images; Satellite sensors; Thermal infrared bands; accuracy assessment; algorithm; detection method; Landsat; numerical method; pixel; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Sentinel; time series; Time series analysis","Cloud detection; Cloud shadow; Mask; Optical satellite images; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047476197"

This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an 'all-in-one' solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyondARDspecification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

For decades, the lack of appropriate remote sensing data sources compromised C3 and C4 grasses AGB estimation, over space and time. This resulted in uncertainties in understanding their potential and contribution to the provision of services. This study therefore examined the utility of the new multi-temporal Sentinel 2 to estimate and map C3 and C4 grasses AGB over time, using the advanced Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLSR) model. Overall results have shown the variability in AGB between C3 and C4 grasses, estimation accuracies and the performance of the SPLSR model, over time. Themeda (C4) produced higher AGB from February to April, whereas from May to September, Festuca produced higher AGB. Both species also showed a decrease in AGB in August and September, although this was most apparent for Themeda than its counterpart. Spectral bands information predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies and an improvement was observed when both spectral bands and vegetation indices were applied. For instance, in the month of May, spectral bands predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies for Festuca (R2 = 0.57; 31.70% of the mean), Themeda (R2 = 0.59; 24.02% of the mean) and combined species (R2 = 0.61; 15.64% of the mean); the use of spectral bands and vegetation indices yielded 0.77; (18.64%), 0.75 (14.27%) and 0.73 (16.47%), for Festuca, Themeda and combined species, respectively. The red edge (at 0.705 and 0.74 μm) and derived indices, NIR and SWIR 2 (2.19 μm) were found to contribute more to grass species AGB estimation, over time. Findings have also revealed the potential of the SPLSR model in estimating C3 and C4 grasses AGB using Sentinel 2 images, over time. The AGB spatial variability maps produced in this study can be used to quantify C3 and C4 forage availability or accumulating fuel, as well as for developing operational management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Drakensberg; Festuca; Poaceae; Themeda; aboveground biomass; carbon isotope; environmental change; forage; remote sensing; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity","Environmental changes; Forage availability; Red edge; Seasonal variations; Species functional types","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057652713"

Satellite images are nowadays massively used by archaeologists to systematically document sites affected by looting. In parallel, remote sensing scientists are increasingly developing processing methods with a certain degree of automation to quantify looting using satellite imagery. To capture the state-of-the-art of this growing field of remote sensing, in this work 47 peer-reviewed research publications and grey literature are reviewed, accounting for: (i) the type of satellite data used, i.e., optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR); (ii) properties of looting features utilized as proxies for damage assessment (e.g., shape, morphology, spectral signature); (iii) image processing workflows; and (iv) rationale for validation. Several scholars studied looting even prior to the conflicts recently affecting the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Regardless of the method used for looting feature identification (either visual/manual, or with the aid of image processing), they preferred very high resolution (VHR) optical imagery, mainly black-and-white panchromatic, or pansharpened multispectral, whereas SAR is being used more recently by specialist image analysts only. Yet the full potential of VHR and high resolution (HR) multispectral information in optical imagery is to be exploited, with limited research studies testing spectral indices. To fill this gap, a range of looted sites across the MENA region are presented in this work, i.e., Lisht, Dashur, and Abusir el Malik (Egypt), and Tell Qarqur, Tell Jifar, Sergiopolis, Apamea, Dura Europos, and Tell Hizareen (Syria). The aim is to highlight: (i) the complementarity of HR multispectral data and VHR SAR with VHR optical imagery, (ii) usefulness of spectral profiles in the visible and near-infrared bands, and (iii) applicability of methods for multi-temporal change detection. Satellite data used for the demonstration include: HR multispectral imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation, VHR X-band SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed mission, VHR panchromatic and multispectral WorldView-2 imagery, and further VHR optical data acquired by GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3, available through Google Earth. Commonalities between the different image processing methods are examined, alongside a critical discussion about automation in looting assessment, current lack of common practices in image processing, achievements in managing the uncertainty in looting feature interpretation, and current needs for more dissemination and user uptake. Directions toward sharing and harmonization of methodologies are outlined, and some proposals are made with regard to the aspects that the community working with satellite images should consider, in order to define best practices of satellite-based looting assessment. © 2019 by the authors.","Damage detection; Feature extraction; Image processing; Infrared devices; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Processing; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Cosmo skymed; Looting; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2; Radar imaging","Archaeological remote sensing; Change detection; COSMO-SkyMed; Feature extraction; Looting; Pattern recognition; SAR; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074207846"

While many studies have demonstrated the ability of optical and SAR remotely sensed data to estimate crop parameters, these data have not been compared or combined to predict crop phenological stages. Despite the high sensitivity of SAR polarimetric data to crop phenological stages, no study has used high temporal resolution data. The freely available SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series provide a unique opportunity to monitor crop phenology at a high spatial resolution on a weekly basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use to predict wheat and rapeseed phenological stages. We first analyzed temporal profiles of spectral bands, vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) derived from S-2 data, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 data. Then, an incremental procedure was used to estimate the contribution of S-1 and S-2 features to the classification of principal and secondary phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed. Results for both crops showed that the classification obtained with combined S-1 & 2 data (mean kappa = 0.53–0.82 and 0.74–0.92 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) was more accurate than those obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa = 0.54–0.75 and 0.67–0.86 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) or S-1 data alone (mean kappa = 0.48–0.61 and 0.61–0.64 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively). Combining S-1 & 2 data allowed better identification of the beginning and end of tillering for wheat and the beginning and end of ripening for rapeseed. Among S-2 features, the most important were LAI for wheat and the NDVI for rapeseed. For both crops, the S2REP index was one of the most important vegetation indices, while MCARI was less important. For S-1 features, results highlighted the large contribution of the backscatter ratio (σ◦VH:σ◦VV) and the value of using polarimetric indicators (Shannon entropy and span) to monitor rapeseed and wheat phenology. The main novelties of this work are the use of S-1 polarimetric indicators to identify phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed and the mapping of wheat and rapeseed secondary phenological stages using remotely sensed data. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

On the one hand, they protect the soil against erosion, promote rainwater infiltration, carbon sequestration and support animal life. On the other hand, after the shrubs' density reaches a particular size for the canopy to touch and the shrubs' biomass accumulates more than 10 Mg ha-1, they create the necessary conditions for severe wild fires to occur and spread. The creation of a methodology suitable to identify former burnt areas and to track shrubs' regrowth within these areas in a regular and a multi temporal basis would be beneficial. The combined use of geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) supported by dedicated land survey and field work for data collection has been identified as a suitable method to manage these tasks. The free access to Sentinel images constitutes a valuable tool for updating the GIS project and for the monitoring of regular shrubs' accumulated biomass. Sentinel 2 VIS-NIR images are suitable to classify rural areas (overall accuracy = 79.6% and Cohen's K = 0.754) and to create normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images to be used in association to allometric equations for the shrubs' biomass estimation (R2 = 0.8984, p-value < 0.05 and RMSE = 4.46 Mg ha-1). Five to six years after a forest fire occurrence, almost all the former burnt area is covered by shrubs. Up to 10 years after a fire, the accumulated shrubs' biomass surpasses 14 Mg ha-1. The results described in this paper demonstrate that Northwest Portugal presents larger shrubland areas and greater shrub biomass accumulation (average 18.3 Mg ha-1) than the Northeast (average 7.7 Mg ha-1) of the country. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass; Data Processing; Deforestation; GIS; Portugal; Remote Sensing; Portugal; Animalia; Biomass; Deforestation; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information use; Remote sensing; Allometric equations; Biomass estimation; Carbon sequestration; Data collection; Images processing; Normalized difference vegetation index; Overall accuracies; Rainwater infiltrations; biomass; GIS; image classification; image processing; NDVI; remote sensing; Sentinel; shrub; Image classification","Bioenergy; GIS; Landsat; Remote sensing; Sentinel 2; Shrubs biomass; Vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085649960"

Long-term flooding and lodging can cause a substantial reduction in rice yield or even destroy the harvest completely. It is therefore urgent to obtain accurate information about paddy rice flooding and lodging as soon as possible after the passing of the storm. This paper proposes a workflow in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for mapping the flooding and lodging area of paddy rice in Wenzhou City, Zhejiang, following super typhoon Maria (Typhoon No.8 in 2018). First, paddy rice in the study area was detected by multi-temporal Sentinel-1 backscatter data combined with Sentinel-2-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the Random Forests (RFs) algorithm. High classification accuracies were achieved, whereby rice detection accuracy was calculated at 95% (VH + NDVI-based) and 87% (VV + NDVI-based). Secondly, Change Detection (CD) based Rice Normalized Difference Flooded Index (RNDFI) and Rice Normalized Difference Lodged Index (RNDLI) were proposed to detect flooding and lodged paddy rice. Both RNDFI and RNDLI were tested based on four different remote sensing data sets, including the Sentinel-1-derived VV and VH back-scattering coefficient, Sentinel-2-derived NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Overall agreement regarding detected area between the each two different data sets was obtained, with values of 79% to 93% in flood detection and 64% to 88% in lodging detection. The resulting flooded and lodged paddy rice maps have potential to reinforce disaster emergency assessment systems and provide an important resource for disaster reduction and emergency departments. © 2019, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Wenzhou; Zhejiang; accuracy assessment; backscatter; cloud cover; crop production; data set; detection method; disaster management; flooding; NDVI; paddy field; Sentinel; typhoon","flooding; Google Earth Engine; lodging; paddy rice; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; typhoons","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076604195"

In recent years, the scheme has also become a starting point for the development of higher-level products, as the LCZ classes can help provide a generalized understanding of urban structures and land uses. LCZ mapping can therefore theoretically aid in fostering a better understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics of cities on a global scale. However, reliable LCZ maps are not yet available globally. As a first step toward automatic LCZ mapping, this work focuses on LCZ-derived land cover classification, using multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 images. We propose a recurrent residual network (Re-ResNet) architecture that is capable of learning a joint spectral-spatial-temporal feature representation within a unitized framework. To this end, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) are combined into one end-to-end architecture. The ResNet is able to learn rich spectral-spatial feature representations from single-seasonal imagery, while the RNN can effectively analyze temporal dependencies of multi-seasonal imagery. Cross validations were carried out on a diverse dataset covering seven distinct European cities, and a quantitative analysis of the experimental results revealed that the combined use of the multi-temporal information and Re-ResNet results in an improvement of approximately 7 percent points in overall accuracy. The proposed framework has the potential to produce consistent-quality urban land cover and LCZ maps on a large scale, to support scientific progress in fields such as urban geography and urban climatology. © 2019 The Author(s)","Climatology; Convolution; Image classification; Land use; Mapping; Network architecture; Convolutional neural network; Land cover; Local climate; Multi-seasonal; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel-2; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial neural network; heat island; image classification; land classification; land cover; land use; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; urban climate; urban geography; Long short-term memory","Land cover; Local climate zones (LCZs); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Multi-seasonal; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Residual convolutional neural network (ResNet); Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067229502"

Located in Sardinia (Italy) and Crete (Greek), respectively, Mulargia and Aposelemis represent vital resources to supply drinking water in downstream valleys. A total of 400 cloud-free satellite images were turned into information on water quality by using an image processing chain implementing physically based methods for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), turbidity, Secchi disk depth (SDD) and surface water temperature. These estimates have been successfully validated (the lower Pearson correlation r was 0.88 for Chl-a) with 23 match-ups of in situ and satellite data. Results of the multi-temporal analyses showed a decrease of SDD due to the increase of Chl-a in Aposelemis or an increase of turbidity in Mulargia. For both freshwater reservoirs, the satellite-derived trophic state index assigned both lakes to mesotrophic conditions.

The satellite platforms considered for this study exhibit different but complementary strengths. Proba-V allowed fast processing over a large number of stations in order to screen or rank EC stations as function of the spatial heterogeneity. The fine spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 allowed more in-depth spatial analysis. Three methods were implemented to explore the spatial heterogeneity with Sentinel-2 NDVI: The analysis of simple NDVI histogram, spatial heterogeneity index (SHI) and fitting a semi-variogram. The analysis with Proba-V resulted in a ranking of flux tower stations on the basis of NDVI Interquartile Range. This study was conducted in the framework of a research programme aiming at improving estimates of net primary productivity across different biomes. The methods appeared to complement each other: histograms were simple to interpret and offered a clear view on the spread and shape of data (often bi-model in cropped sites); SHI plots enable the visualization of heterogeneity changes throughout a period of time and semi-variograms allow the analysis at different distances and orientations. © SPIE.

This study illustrates how applied geomatics integrating earth observation and geographical information systems (GIS) can be used to quantify this threat in an UNESCO protected archeological site as well as on cultural routes such as the ancient Hellenistic-Roman Road network. Both study sites are located in the western part of Cyprus, and specifically in Paphos district, which is an area with undergoing major pressure caused by soil erosion and soil loss. Multi-temporal earth observation methods were applied for identification, mapping and estimation of the possible soil loss caused by soil erosion in the period of the past 30 years. The soil loss was estimated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. Special attention was given to the land use/land cover factor (C) and its impact on the overall estimation of the soil loss. Cover factor represents the effect of soil-disturbing activities, plants, crop sequence and productivity level, soil cover, and subsurface bio-mass on soil erosion. Urban areas have a definite role in retarding the recharge process, leading to increased runoff and soil loss in the broader area. On the other hand, natural vegetation plays a predominant role in reducing water erosion. In specific, cover factor was estimated for the cultural routes, classified and observed in years 1987 and 2016 in the District of Paphos. The variance of the values between 2 years was then calculated in order to identify the areas under major pressure of soil erosion caused by the changes in land use and land cover. In addition, high-resolution optical data were analyzed in order estimate the multi-temporal changes in soil loss in the archeological site of Nea Paphos. The results shows that integrated earth observation and GIS can be used as a systematic tool for monitoring cultural heritage sites against natural threats such as soil loss. © 2018, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","Cyprus; Paphos; cultural landscape; GIS; land use change; protected area; quantitative analysis; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; soil erosion; UNESCO","C-factor; Cultural landscapes; Earth observation; GIS; Land-use change; Landsat; RUSLE; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Soil erosion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056361278"

Satellite remote sensing is an effective source of information to detect surface water over large areas and document their evolution in time. Recently, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched freely available SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical sensors (Sentinel-1 & 2) with high revisiting time and spatial resolution. The objective of this paper is to explore the contribution of multi-temporal and multi-source (passive and active) Sentinel observations for improving the detection and mapping of surface waters by applying decision-level image fusion techniques. The approach is tested over Central Ireland using a time series of 16 Sentinel-1 images and a few Sentinel-2 images for the period 2015–2016. Compared to a mono-date approach, the combination of Sentinel-1 & 2 observations provides better accuracy for mapping permanent surface water. Decision level fusion technique allows mapping temporary surface water (such as flooding) with a high accuracy.

Forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon is mainly due to selective logging of intact/un-managed forests and to uncontrolled fires. The deforestation contribution to carbon emission is already known but determining the contribution of forest degradation remains a challenge. Discrimination of logging from fires, both of which produce different levels of forest damage, is important for the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) program. This work presents a semi-automated procedure for monitoring deforestation and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon using fraction images derived from Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM). Part of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene (path/row 226/068) covering part of Mato Grosso State in the Brazilian Amazon, was selected to develop the proposed method. First, the approach consisted of mapping deforested areas and mapping forest degraded by fires using image segmentation. Next, degraded areas due to selective logging activities were mapped using a pixel-based classifier. The results showed that the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images allowed deforested areas to be mapped and monitored and to separate degraded forest areas caused by selective logging and by fires. The comparison of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and RapidEye results for the year 2013 showed an overall accuracy of 94%. We concluded that spatial resolution plays an important role for mapping selective logging features due to their characteristics. Therefore, when compared to Landsat data, the current availability of higher spatial and temporal resolution data, such as provided by Sentinel-2, is expected to improve the assessment of deforestation and forest degradation, especially caused by selective logging. This will facilitate the implementation of actions for forest protection. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Amazonia; Brazil; Deforestation; Environmental regulations; Fires; Global warming; Image segmentation; Land use; Automated procedures; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Linear spectral mixing models; Operational land imager; Reducing emissions; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial resolution; United nations framework convention on climate changes; carbon emission; deforestation; environmental degradation; environmental monitoring; forest canopy; Landsat; mapping; RapidEye; Sentinel; Mapping","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064930641"

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring.Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost.

Different methodologies based on remote sensing have emerged for the leaf area index (LAI) and the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) estimation, essential biophysical parameters for crop evapotranspiration monitoring. Using Sentinel-2 (S2) spectral information, this studyperformeda comparative analysis of empirical (vegetation indices), semi-empirical (CLAIR model with fixed and calibrated extinction coefficient) and artificial neural network S2 products derived from the Sentinel Application Platform Software (SNAP) biophysical processor (ANN S2 products) approaches for the estimation of LAI and CCC. Four independent in situ collected datasets of LAI and CCC, obtained with standard instruments (LAI-2000, SPAD) and a smartphone application (PocketLAI), were used. The ANN S2 products present good statistics for LAI (R2 > 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.86) andCCC(R2 > 0.75, RMSE < 0.68 g/m2) retrievals. The normalized Sentinel-2 LAI index (SeLI) is the index that presents good statistics in each dataset (R2 > 0.71, RMSE < 0.78) and for the CCC, the ratio red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge) (R2 > 0.67, RMSE < 0.62 g/m2). Both indices use bands located in the red-edge zone, highlighting the importance of this region. The LAI CLAIR model with a fixed extinction coefficient value produces a R2 > 0.63 and a RMSE < 1.47 and calibrating this coefficient for each study area only improves the statistics in two areas (RMSE ≈ 0.70). Finally, this study analyzed the influence of the LAI parameter estimated with the different methodologies in the calculation of crop potential evapotranspiration (ETc) with the adapted Penman-Monteith (FAO-56 PM), using a multi-temporal dataset. The results were compared with ETc estimated as the product of the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and on the crop coefficient (Kc) derived fromFAO table values. In the absence of independent reference ET data, the estimated ETc with the LAI in situ values were considered as the proxy of the ground-truth. ETc estimated with the ANN S2 LAI product is the closest to the ETc values calculated with the LAI in situ (R2 > 0.90, RMSE < 0.41 mm/d). Our findings indicate the good validation of ANN S2 LAI and CCC products and their further suitability for the implementation in evapotranspiration retrieval of agricultural areas. © 2019 by the authors.","","Artificial neural network; Canopy chlorophyll content; Evapotranspiration in standard condition; Leaf area index; Sentinel-2; Vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074516279"

However, collecting this information over large areas is inherently costly. This paper investigates the possibility of applying multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite images to detect heavy metal-induced stress (i.e., Cd stress) in rice crops in four study areas in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. For this purpose, we compared seven Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 with in situ measured hyper-spectral data, chlorophyll content, rice leaf area index, and heavy metal concentrations in soil collected from 2014 to 2017. Vegetation indices (VIs) related to red edge bands were referred to as the sensitive indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice. The coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from the VIs allowed us to discriminate crops exposed to pollution from heavy metals as well as environmental stressors. The results indicate that (i) the red edge chlorophyll index, the red edge position index, and the normalized difference red edge 2 index derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images were good indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice; (ii) Rice under Cd stress remained stable with lower CSTV values of VIs overall growth stages in the experimental region, whereas rice under other stressors (i.e., pests and disease) showed abrupt changes at some growth stages and presented “hot spots” with greater CSTV values; and (iii) the proposed spatio-temporal anomaly detection method was successful at detecting rice under Cd stress; and CSTVs of rice VIs stabilized regardless of whether they were applied to consecutive growth stages or to two different crop years. This study suggests that regional heavy metal stress may be accurately detected using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images, using VIs sensitive to the spatio-temporal characteristics of crops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Oryza; Satellite Imagery; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Stress, Physiological; China; Hunan; Zhuzhou [Hunan]; Chlorophyll; Crops; Diagnosis; Food supply; Forestry; Heavy metals; Plants (botany); Pollution; cadmium; chlorophyll; heavy metal; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Environmental stressors; Heavy metal concentration; Heavy metal pollution; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; agricultural ecosystem; concentration (composition); crop production; food security; heavy metal; pollution effect; rice; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; China; chlorophyll content; controlled study; leaf area; nonhuman; plant growth; plant stress; priority journal; rice; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; telecommunication; crop; drug effect; environmental monitoring; human; Oryza; physiological stress; physiology; procedures; satellite imagery; soil; soil pollutant; toxicity; Chemical contamination","Abrupt stress; Heavy metal pollution; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal anomaly detection; Stable stress","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046810051"

The increased observational capacity of remotely sensed data, such as Sentinel-2 imagery, constitutes a major advantage over in situ methods, particularly for agricultural applications that require frequent updates. However, the development of fully automated cultivated field delineation methods remains a challenge. In this study an existing object-based image analysis (OBIA) methodology, called Canny edge-detection in conjunction with watershed segmentation (CEWS), was modified to automatically identify and delineate agricultural fields from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery in five diverse agricultural landscapes. The robustness of the technique was evaluated by comparing its outputs to those of standard per-pixel, supervised classifications. Reference field boundaries were manually digitised and used for quantitative accuracy assessments. Area and edge metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of the extracted boundaries. Results show that, on average, CEWS produced significantly higher field boundary accuracies than the supervised per-pixel approach in terms of both mean absolute error (MAE) (~31 m lower) and overall accuracy (~13.8% higher). The closed field boundaries produced by CEWS, as well as its capability to operate without any a priori knowledge, was found to be its main strengths for integration into operational workflows. However, in complex landscapes (e.g. Swartland and Mooketsi) it was found that some fields had weak boundaries due to the homogeneity between adjacent fields, making edge detection problematic. The incorporation of higher resolution imagery into the edge detection process is proposed, particularly in agricultural areas with very small and irregularly shaped fields. Despite these challenges, it was concluded that the multi-temporal CEWS approach will perform well in most agricultural areas and is suitable for operational implementation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","South Africa; Swartland; Western Cape; Agriculture; Edge detection; Electronic trading; Food supply; Image segmentation; Pixels; Agricultural fields; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural monitoring; Object based image analysis; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Sentinel-2 imagery; Supervised classification; Watershed segmentation; accuracy assessment; agricultural development; agricultural land; field margin; food security; homogeneity; image analysis; pixel; segmentation; Sentinel; watershed; Image analysis","Agricultural field boundary delineation; Edge detection; Object-based image analysis; Sentinel-2 imagery; Watershed segmentation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075390851"

Accurately mapping the grasslands at a large scale is essential for productivity monitoring, policymaking, and environmental assessment. The advancements in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have enabled the generation of high accuracy national level crop layers. Although the national crop layer for the US includes grasslands, it does not differentiate them well at the species level. To fill the gap of mapping grassland at the national scale with high accuracy, we used a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Convolutional-LSTM) neural network model for grass identification using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images. Miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) is used as a case study for this short paper. The classification of Miscanthus using the Convolutional-LSTM model yielded a 98.8% accuracy, which is significantly higher than the 92% accuracy produced by a benchmark model 3-layer fully connected neural network.

Satellite remote sensing data provide important information to detect changes in forest landscapes over long time periods in contrast to conventional approaches. Satellite remote sensing provides a useful tool to capture the temporal dynamics of forest vegetation change in response to climate shifts, at spatial resolutions fine enough to capture the spatial heterogeneity. In this paper, we present an integrated, standardized approach that aims at combining remote sensing data provided by different sensors, available for a long-term period (2000-2018). This multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach detects Cernica-Branesti periurban forest vegetation dynamics based on derived biophysical parameters within the highly dynamic city of Bucharest, as a test case. Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, MODIS Terra/Aqua, and Sentinel 2 data are combined in an integrated procedure to locate forest disturbances in relation with potential climate and anthropogenic drivers. To apply the approach for detecting forest land cover changes, the MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index/Enhanced Vegetation Index (NDVI/EVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data are used to provide forest vegetation change detection information in relation with land surface temperature (LST) and climate stressors and to monitor forest vegetation phenological variations. Correlations between NDVI/EVI time series and climatic variables were computed. Forest vegetation dynamics at seasonal and longer timescales reflect large-scale interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and the climate system. © 2019 SPIE.","Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Hydrology; Land surface temperature; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Vegetation; Biogeophysical parameters; CernicaBranesti; Climate; Field data; Forest-land cover change; Romania; Climate change","Biogeophysical parameters; CernicaBranesti; Climate; Forest land cover changes; Romania; Time-series satellite and field data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078085391"

With the development of remote sensing, abundant data sources strongly guarantee that researchers can identify crop types and map their spatial distributions. However, to date, only a few studies have been conducted to identify vineyards using satellite image data. In this study, a vineyard is identified using satellite images, and a new approach is proposed that integrates the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the original time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) are reconstructed by applying an iterated Savitzky-Golay (S-G) method to form a daily time series for a full year; then, the CWT is applied to three reconstructed time series to generate corresponding scalograms; and finally, CNN technology is used to identify vineyards based on the stacked scalograms. In addition to our approach, a traditional and common approach that uses a random forest (RF) to identify crop types based on multi-temporal images is selected as the control group. The experimental results demonstrated the following: (i) the proposed approach was comprehensively superior to the RF approach; it improved the overall accuracy by 9.87% (up to 89.66%); (ii) the CWT had a stable and effective influence on the reconstructed time series, and the scalograms fully represented the unique time-related frequency pattern of each of the planting conditions; and (iii) the convolution and max pooling processing of the CNN captured the unique and subtle distribution patterns of the scalograms to distinguish vineyards from other crops. Additionally, the proposed approach is considered as able to be applied to other practical scenarios, such as using time series data to identify crop types, map landcover/land use, and is recommended to be tested in future practical applications. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Crops; Decision trees; Identification (control systems); Neural networks; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Vegetation; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Continuous wavelet transforms; Convolutional neural network; Distribution patterns; Enhanced vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Sentinel-2; Vineyard; Wavelet transforms","CNN; CWT; Identification; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Vineyard","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075368323"

The traditional survey method is time consuming and labor intensive, and the remote sensing method with high-resolution, multi-spectral commercial satellite images has high cost and low availability. In this study, we explore and evaluate the potential of freely-available multi-source imagery to identify forest types with an object-based random forest algorithm. These datasets included Sentinel-2A (S2), Sentinel-1A (S1) in dual polarization, one-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation (DEM) and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (L8). We tested seven different sets of explanatory variables for classifying eight forest types in Wuhan, China. The results indicate that single-sensor (S2) or single-day data (L8) cannot obtain satisfactory results; the overall accuracy was 54.31% and 50.00%, respectively. Compared with the classification using only Sentinel-2 data, the overall accuracy increased by approximately 15.23% and 22.51%, respectively, by adding DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery. The highest accuracy (82.78%) was achieved with fused imagery, the terrain and multi-temporal data contributing the most to forest type identification. These encouraging results demonstrate that freely-accessible multi-source remotely-sensed data have tremendous potential in forest type identification, which can effectively support monitoring and management of forest ecological resources at regional or global scales. © 2018 by the authors.","Decision trees; Ecology; Forestry; Remote sensing; Surveying; Forest type; LANDSAT; Multi-Sources; Random forests; Sentinel imagery; Information management","DEM; Forest types; Landsat-8; Multi-source; Random forest; Sentinel imagery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048950271"

Remote sensing based rice monitoring has been a challenge for years because the size of rice fields is small, and crop mapping requires information of crop phenology, relating to spatiotemporal resolution of satellite data. This study aims to develop an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in Taiwan. The data were processed for 2018, following four main steps: (1) construct time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), (2) noise filtering of the time-series data using wavelet transform, (3) rice crop classification using information of crop phenology, and (4) parcel-based accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The parcel-to-parcel comparisons between mapping results and ground reference data indicated satisfactory results. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between satellite-derived rice area and government's statistics. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues and cloud-cover effects, lowered the mapping accuracies of townships along the coastline, this study has demonstrated the efficacy of using multitemporal Sentinel-2 data to create a reliable database of rice-growing areas over a large and heterogeneous region.

Several threshold, multi-temporal and machine learning approaches have been developed for the separation of clouds in land and ocean applications, but this task still remains a challenge. Concerning deep water marine applications, the main difficulties are imposed in regions with high noise levels and sunglint. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different configurations are evaluated for the detection of clouds in Sentinel-2 images depicting deep water regions with several noise levels. The ANNs are trained on a manual public dataset and on a manual dataset created for the needs of this study, which authors intend to make publicly available. Results are compared with the cloud masks produced by three state-of-the-art algorithms: Fmask, MAJA, and Sen2Cor. It was shown that the ANNs trained on the second dataset perform very favourably, in contrast to the ANNs trained on the first dataset that fails to adequately represent the spectra of the noisy Sentinel-2 images. This study further reinforces the value of the ‘cirrus’ band and indicates the bands that mitigate the influence of noisy spectra, by defining and examining an index that characterizes the importance of the bands according to the weights produced by the ANNs. Finally, the possibility of improving results by making predictions using the feature scaling parameters of the test set instead of those of the training set is also investigated in cases where the test set cannot be adequately represented by the training set. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image processing; Neural networks; Optical data processing; Deepwater regions; Feature scaling; High noise levels; Image processing technique; Machine learning approaches; Optical satellite images; Public dataset; State-of-the-art algorithms; artificial neural network; data set; image processing; machine learning; parameterization; prediction; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Marine applications","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079105064"

Lacklustre yields and erratic pest infestations have driven some farmers and growers to abandon mango orchards. To help revive low-yielding mango orchards, there is a need to distinguish actively bearing mango trees from those that remain dormant throughout the year. Using remote sensing techniques, mango trees from separate orchards in Brgy. Cantipay, Carmen, Cebu were mapped and studied using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data (from January 2018 through May 2019). Prior to that, a field visit was conducted to survey the area using UAVs and field observation, and in the process, was able to identify an abandoned mango orchard. Pixel-based Normal Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were extracted from each of the 822 geotagged mango trees with an average of 16 trees among 53 divisions. Time series were derived from the average of the NDVI values from each division and plotted per month of extraction from oldest to latest. Clustering was applied to the time series data using Hierarchical Clustering with Ward's Minimum Variance as an algorithm to determine the divisions with the closest time series. Using the resulting dendrogram as basis, two major clusters were selected based on the value of their distances with each other: Cluster 1 containing 29 Divisions, and Cluster 2 containing 24 Divisions. Cluster 1 contains most of the Divisions in and around the biggest active mango orchard. In contrast, Cluster 2 contains most of the Divisions that are in and around the previously identified abandoned mango orchard. An alternative dendrogram was also created by using Complete Linkage algorithm in Hierarchical Clustering, after which 3 relevant clusters were selected. The second dendrogram highlights the stark difference between Division 1, contained in Cluster 3, from the rest of the other clustered divisions at 2.17 units from the next closest one. Notably, Division 1 is located smack in the middle of the abandoned orchard The remaining clusters, Cluster 2 with 21 divisions containing most of the divisions in the abandoned orchard, is 2.46 distance units away from Cluster 1, which has 31 and hosting most of the divisions in the active mango orchards. Two major clusters emerged from using the two algorithms. Divisions with higher and more variant NDVI values seemed to come from the mango trees which were more active during the fruiting cycle. Divisions from the abandoned mango orchards were observed to have lower and less varied NDVI values because of minimal activity in the trees. Other Divisions clustered under the abandoned orchard could have been juveniles based on their size. © 2020 Authors.","Fruits; Hierarchical clustering; Orchards; Remote sensing; Time series; Cebu; Mango; Multi-temporal; NDVI; Time series clustering; Trees; Clustering algorithms","Cebu; Mango; Multi-temporal; NDVI; Time Series Clustering; Trees","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081562554"

In this work, we exploit the potentials of both radar and optical images for satellite-based quick detection and extent mapping of inundations/water raising events over Shkodër area, which occurred in the two last years (2017-2018). For instance, in March 2018 the Shkodër district (North Albania) was affected twice by the overflow of the Drin and Buna (Bojana) Rivers and by the Shkodër lake plain inundation. Sentinel-1 radar data allowed a rapid mapping of seasonal fluctuations and provided flood extent maps by discriminating water surfaces (permanent water and flood areas) from land/non-flood areas over all the informal zones of Shkodër city. By means of Sentinel-2 data, two color composites maps were produced and the Normalized Difference Water Index was estimated, in order to further distinguish water/moisturized soil surfaces from built-up and vegetated areas. The obtained remote sensing-based maps were combined and discussed with the urban planning framework in order to support a sustainable urban and environmental management. The provided multi-temporal analysis could be easily exploited by the local authorities for flood prevention and management purposes in the inherited territorial context. The proposed approach outputs were validated by comparing them with official Copernicus EMS (Emergency Management Service) maps available for one of the chosen events. The comparison shows good accordance results. As for a further enhancement in the future perspective, it is worth to highlight that a more accurate result could be obtained by performing a post-processing edit to further refine the flooded areas, such as water mask application and supervised classification to filter out isolated flood elements, to remove possible water-lookalikes and weed out false positives. © 2019 by the authors.","Albania; Shkodra; radar altimetry; satellite altimetry; satellite data; Sentinel; supervised classification; sustainable development; urban planning","Inundation mapping; Radar applications; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Spatial planning; Western Balkans","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071095569"

The exposure of mineral soils underlying these peatlands can further increase potential environmental problems when it contains acid sulfate soil (ASSoils-FeS2), harmful mineral when exposed to oxygen. Remote sensing applications on peatland mapping are commonly utilized to identify its extent, but never examined its ASSoils potential area. This study aims: 1) to map the coastal ASSoil occurrence probability based on a hybrid remote sensing and hydrogeomorphical approaches and 2) to examine the ability of remote sensing in assisting the development of digital ASSoils mapping in tropical peatland. This study utilized the legacy peatland data of Kubu Raya and Ketapang areas provided by the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture. The hybrid remote sensing image analysis approach consists of a combination of visual interpretation and digital image analysis. Multi-temporal satellite imageries (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) representing rainy and dry seasons were processed to derive wetness, vegetation density indices and landcover maps. Soil characteristics data included the thickness of peat, underlying materials, and ASSoils distributions. Processed hydrological and topographical data produces maps of tidal, salinity, and sea water intrusion and micro-elevation accordingly. Visual remote sensing image interpretation was conducted to identify existing coastal landforms. Both intermediary maps are associated to the field survey data and are used to determine the peatland ASSoil hydrogeomorphology units. The development of this digital ASSoils mapping is important to underpin the strategic regional and national planning in the peatland environment. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Chemical resistance; Image analysis; Mapping; Pyrites; Seawater; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Wetlands; Digital image analysis; Environmental problems; Occurrence probability; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing approaches; Remote sensing image interpretations; Remote sensing images; Visual interpretation; Remote sensing","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083365819"

The methodology makes use of edge detection that is applied to multiple images acquired during a growing season and image segmentation to delimit agricultural fields, orchards and vineyards. Two edge detection operators (Canny and Scharr) and three image segmentation algorithms (watershed, multi-threshold and multi-resolution) were combined and evaluated, resulting in six experiments (scenarios). A rule-based (knowledge-based) classification was applied to the extracted image objects to discard uncultivated areas. Reference field boundaries, manually digitised from very high (10 cm) resolution aerial imagery, were used for quantitative accuracy assessments and qualitative comparisons. The quantitative accuracy assessment consisted of both area- and edge-based metrics. The results showed that the watershed segmentation, combined with Canny edge detection, produced the most accurate field boundaries with an OA of 92.9% and combined MAE of 24.5 m. The Scharr algorithm produced thicker edges, causing positional errors along the boundaries. The multi-resolution and multi-threshold segmentation algorithms produced boundary inaccuracies ranging from 1 to 3 pixels, largely due to the creation of thick boundary objects, which caused offsets of the extracted borders on both sides of the reference boundaries. The combination of Canny edge detection (performed on multiple Sentinel-2 images acquired during the growing season) and watershed segmentation is thus recommended for operational field boundary delineation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Crops; Edge detection; Image acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Observatories; Crop fields; Earth observations; Edge-detection operators; Image segmentation algorithm; Knowledge-based classification; Multi-threshold segmentation; Object based image analysis; Sentinel-2; accuracy assessment; algorithm; comparative study; EOS; growing season; image analysis; image classification; satellite imagery; segmentation; Sentinel; Image segmentation","Crop field boundary delineation; Earth observation; Edge detection; Knowledge-based classification; Segmentation; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061694539"

This is the logical result of certain technological developments that occurred over the last two decades, allowing UAVs to be equipped with different types of sensors that can provide high-resolution data at relatively low prices. However, despite the success and extraordinary results achieved by the use of UAVs, traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellites continue to develop as well. Nowadays, satellites use sophisticated sensors providing data with increasingly improving spatial, temporal and radiometric resolutions. This is the case for the Sentinel-2 observation mission from the Copernicus Programme, which systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolutions, with a revisiting period of five days. It therefore makes sense to think that, in some applications, satellite data may be used instead of UAV data, with all the associated benefits (extended coverage without the need to visit the area). In this study, Sentinel-2 time series data performances were evaluated in comparison with high-resolution UAV-based data, in an area affected by a fire, in 2017. Given the 10-m resolution of Sentinel-2 images, different spatial resolutions of the UAV-based data (0.25, 5 and 10 m) were used and compared to determine their similarities. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite data for post-fire monitoring, even at a local scale, as more cost-effective than UAV data. The Sentinel-2 results present a similar behavior to the UAV-based data for assessing burned areas. © 2020 by the authors.","","Fire severity mapping; Forest regeneration; Multispectral imagery; Parrot SEQUOIA; Post-fire management; Sentinel-2A; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083343128"

In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan - 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multi-temporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2. Data has been simulated to 10 and 20m spatial resolution bands available in 350-1050nm range. This simulated 8 band feature set has been fed to the same set of classifiers to evaluate their performance. Results suggests that LR provides maximum classification accuracy of 89.12% using simulated Sentinel-2 bands. Further to validate the algorithm using actual ground observations from the field, we have implemented simulated Sentinel-2 based algorithm on two Sentinel-2 images available during the study period and results are compared with actual ground observations about mites infestation. Results suggest mites detection accuracy of 83.33% which shows the good agreement and potential of Sentinel-2 for mites infestation detection. © 2018 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Digital storage; Geology; Neural networks; Reflection; Regression analysis; Classification accuracy; Hyperspectral data analysis; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators; Multi-temporal; Pest infestation; Sentinel-2; Remote sensing","Classification; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Multi-temporal sensing; Pest infestation; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064221936"

This is attributed to, among other factors, higher sensor temporal resolutions of the recently launched satellites. The increased data, combined with the computation and possible derivation of a large number of indices, may lead to high multi-collinearity and redundant features that compromise the performance of classifiers. Using dimension reduction algorithms, a subset of these features can be selected, hence increasing their predictive potential. In this regard, an investigation into the application of feature selection techniques on multi-temporal multispectral datasets such as Sentinel-2 is valuable in vegetation mapping. In this study, ten feature selection methods belonging to five groups (Similarity-based, statistical-based, Sparse learning based, Information theoretical based, and wrappers methods) were compared based on f-score and data size for mapping a landscape infested by the Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus). Overall, results showed that ReliefF (a Similarity-based approach) was the best performing feature selection method as demonstrated by the high f-score values of Parthenium weed and a small size of optimal features selected. Although svm-b (a wrapper method) yielded the highest accuracies, the size of optimal subset of selected features was quite large. Results also showed that data size affects the performance of feature selection algorithms, except for statistically-based methods such as Gini-index and F-score and svm-b. Findings in this study provide a guidance on the application of feature selection methods for accurate mapping of invasive plant species in general and Parthenium weed, in particular, using new multispectral imagery with high temporal resolution. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Information theory; Mapping; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Dimension reduction algorithm; Feature selection algorithm; Feature selection methods; High temporal resolution; Multispectral datasets; Parthenium weeds; Performance of classifier; Sentinel-2; Feature extraction","Feature selection; Parthenium weed; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071594826"

With the availability of the image data over the complete rice growing season over two consecutive years, spectral time series analysis of rice crops is conducted in this study for the Riverina region of Coleambally, New South Wales, Australia. Vegetation and water indices are adopated to compare the growing patterns of rice over the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 growing seasons. Rice crops of different varieties are identified and examined. Different seed sowing methods are also compared in terms of their effect on the latter season. The results show that the growth pattern of rice follows a particular trend that can be distinguished from other types of vegetation. This is facilitated by a property unique to rice where water sensitive indices produce a higher reading than vegetation indices during the initial flooding period of the season, after which, the crop growth reverses this and the biomass sensitive index becomes larger. Spectral analysis of rice crops planted via various methods reveals that the drill sowing method did not produce this unique characteristic as the late flooding time results in a very short submersion period for the rice seedlings, which is a valuable finding. © 2018 IEEE","","Multi-temporal; Rice crops; Sentinel-2A imagery; Vegetation index","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062213621"

Temporal aggregation-the use of metrics (i.e., mean or median) derived from satellite data over a period of time-is an approach that benefits from recent increases in the frequency of free satellite data acquisition and cloud-computing power. This enables the efficient use of multi-temporal data and the exploitation of cloud-gap filling techniques for land cover mapping. Here, we provide the first formal comparison of the accuracy between land cover maps created with temporal aggregation of Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat-8 (L8) data from one-year and test whether this method matches the accuracy of traditional approaches. hirty-two datasets were created for Wales by applying automated cloud-masking and temporally aggregating data over different time intervals, using Google Earth Engine. Manually processed S2 data was used for comparison using a traditional two-date composite approach. Supervised classifications were created, and their accuracy was assessed using field-based data. Temporal aggregation only matched the accuracy of the traditional two-date composite approach (77.9%) when an optimal combination of optical and radar data was used (76.5%). Combined datasets (S1, S2 or S1, S2, and L8) outperformed single-sensor datasets, while datasets based on spectral indices obtained the lowest levels of accuracy. The analysis of cloud cover showed that to ensure at least one cloud-free pixel per time interval, a maximum of two intervals per year for temporal aggregation were possible with L8, while three or four intervals could be used for S2. This study demonstrates that temporal aggregation is a promising tool for integrating large amounts of data in an efficient way and that it can compensate for the lower quality of automatic image selection and cloud masking. It also shows that combining data from different sensors can improve classification accuracy. However, this study highlights the need for identifying optimal combinations of satellite data and aggregation parameters in order to match the accuracy of manually selected and processed image composites. © 2019 by the authors.","Cloud computing; Data acquisition; Data fusion; Engines; Mapping; Radar; Satellites; Supervised learning; Classification accuracy; Cloud masking; Gap filling; Large amounts of data; Optimal combination; Supervised classification; Temporal aggregation; Traditional approaches; Space-based radar","Cloud computing; Cloud masking; Data fusion; Gap filling; Radar; Supervised classifications","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061402857"

Satellite images can capture the ground surface conditions and give a huge amount of information in a single image. In recent days, with the availability of multi-temporal satellite data, monitoring of flood events have become pretty easy. It gives accurate and real time flood information. Flood is one of the most disastrous natural disasters in Assam, India. It is necessary to predict or monitor flood events to minimise the overall damage caused due to floods. There are many scientific approaches which have been made operational in flood monitoring related activities. However Deep Learning based approaches are not yet fully exploited so far to monitor and predict flood events. We propose flood detection in real-time with the help of multispectral images and SAR data using Deep Learning technique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The satellite images are from Sentinel-2 and the SAR data are from Sentinel-1. The CNN was trained with 100 images for 100 iterations. CNN has shown excellent performance in image-oriented tasks like classification, segmentation and feature extraction. Recently Deep learning techniques are used extensively on remote sensing data due to their high resolution and the former’s extensive computing capability. The study area comprises of 2 districts namely Barpeta and Kamrup of Assam, India. We have obtained an accuracy of 80% in detecting flood. Based on our result, deep learning may be vigorously explored in various other disaster detection or monitoring activities. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Disasters; Floods; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Network security; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Amount of information; Computing capability; Disaster monitoring; Ground surface condition; Learning-based approach; Monitoring activities; Multispectral images; Remote sensing imagery; Radar imaging","Deep learning; Flood detection; Multispectral image; SAR image; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088206765"

It is exposed to a complex interaction of natural phenomena, oil and gas activities, fishing and navigational activities and these are potential sources of oil slicks and seeps. This work is primarily aimed at characterizing oil on water events and their association to oil and gas activities utilizing space synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The primary dataset being multi temporal Sentinel – 1A data acquired between 2015 and 2018. The analysis involved derivation of backscatter coefficients of the SAR images used, in order to identify dark regions. A novel approach applying gamma augmentation to the SAR datasets for the purpose of optimized characterization of the detected dark regions. Enhanced discrimination of dark regions using gamma, aided inference on the nature of weathering, thickness and behaviour of the detected oil anomaly. Geometric, textural and radiometric parameters of areas of detected anomalies were extracted and computed for the purpose of anomaly characterization. An anomaly confidence estimation algorithm was utilized, incorporating four key parameters in confidence estimation. These parameters are Homogeneity - uniformity in dark pixels of anomaly, Association - relationship of anomaly with a possible source, Signature - geometry of anomaly and contrast with respect to the ocean and Detectability - Ocean and satellite parameters such as wind speed and satellite incident angle. The quantitative extraction of these confidence estimating parameters was instrumental in the numerical computation of confidence levels using the HADS (Homogeneity Association Detectability Signature algorithm) computational method. Detected high confidence oil anomaly were strongly related to Otuo offshore oil and gas infrastructure, and these validated using optical satellite images: Landsat - 8 and Sentinel - 2. The results derived from this study establishes that SAR is a practical and effective tool in detecting oil on water within offshore oil mining leases, in addition to confirmation that oil spills occur as a result of oil and gas activities within this mining lease. © 2021 International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering.

River meander dynamics and mobility are important indicators of environmental change related to climate changes and anthropogenic activities at local and river basin scales. This paper presents a study of spatial and temporal changes meandering Alazani (Georgia) in its middle stream and downstream. Alazani is the border of the country and the bank erosion here has the environmental and political importance as well. The aim of the present study was to identify spatial-temporal variations of channel length, meandering, and central line migration of the Alazani River. The analysis was carried out on a series of multitemporal and multispectral remotely sensed data acquired by different satellite missions during the time period between 1986 and 2019. Data from the Sentinel-2 missions and large-scale topographic maps (1:25 000) were considered. Supervised image classification with the combination of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) was used for Landsat image (1986, 1995, 2006, 2013, 2019) analysis, Sentinel data and topographic maps served to establish reference information about river morphological features in order to compare the results of the temporal analysis. The results demonstrated that the morphological changes are mostly related to the sediment supply and its regime. The direction of the migration rates varied towards the west and the east, with the dominant direction towards the west. Several meanders and ox-bow lakes remain as a result of migration. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

In this research, Sentinel-2A images were selected for the analyses. Sentinel-2 is a very new program of the European Space Agency (ESA) designed for fine spatial resolution global monitoring. Land Cover-Land Use (LCLU) classification tasks can take advantage of the fusion of radar and optical remote sensing data, generally leading to increased mapping accuracy. Here we propose a methodological approach to fuse information from the new European Space Agency Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate land cover mapping of a portion of the South Solok region, West Sumatra. Data pre-processing used the European Space Agency's Sentinel Application Platform and the SEN2COR toolboxes. The two main objectives of this study are to evaluate the potential use and synergetic effects of ESA Sentinel-1A C-band SAR and Sentinel-2A Optical data for classification and mapping of LCLU. First, the pre-processing chain supported by sensor-specific toolboxes developed by ESA represents a reliable and fast approach for the preparation of ready-to-process imagery. Second, an investigation to derive a methodological framework to integrate Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery for land cover mapping by integrating radar and optical imagery has been set up and tested. The results of object-based classification produced higher accuracy than pixel-based classifications if the same type of classifier is used.

The paper presents an automatic procedure that integrates SAR and optical data, which can be effectively used to generate land consumption maps or update existing maps. The main input of the procedure is a series of SAR amplitude images acquired over a given geographical area and observation period. The main assumption of the procedure is that land consumption is associated with an increase of the SAR amplitude values. Such an increase is detected in the SAR amplitude time series using an automatic Bayesian algorithm. The results based on the SAR amplitude are then filtered using an NDVI map derived from optical imagery.

The accurate mapping of plastic-mulched land (PML) is valuable for monitoring the environmental problems caused by the use of plastic film. The drawback of PML mapping is that the detectable period of PML changes among the fields, which causes uncertainty when supervised classification methods are used to identify PML. In this study, a new workflow which merging PML of multiple temporal phases (MTPML) is proposed. For each temporal phase, the ""possible PML"" is firstly generated, these ""temporal possible PML"" layers are then combined to generate the ""possible PML"" layer. Finally, the maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the growing season is used to remove the non-cropland pixels from the ""possible PML layer,"" and then generate PML images. When generating ""temporal possible PML layers,"" three new PML indices (PMLI with near-infrared bands known as PMLI_NIR, PMLI with shortwave infrared bands known as PMLI_SWIR, and Normalized Difference PMLI known as PMLI_ND) are proposed to separate PML from bare land at plastic film cover stage; and the ""temporal possible PML layer"" are identified by the threshold based method. To estimate the performance of the three PML indices, two other approaches, PMLI threshold and Random Forest (RF) are used to generate ""temporal possible PML layer."" Finally, PML images generated from the five MTPML approaches are compared with the image time series supervised classification (SUPML) result. Two study regions, Hengshui (HS) and Guyuan (GY), are used in this study. PML identification models are generated using training samples in HS and the models are used for PML mapping in both study regions. The results showed that MTPML workflow outperformed SUPML with 3%-5% higher classification accuracy. The three proposed PML indices had higher separability and importance score for bare land and PML discrimination. Among the five approaches used to generate the ""temporal possible PML layer,"" PMLI_SWIR is the recommended approach because the PMLI_SWIR threshold approach is easy to implement and the accuracy is only slightly lower than the RF approach. It is notable that no training sample was used in GY and the accuracy of the MTPML approach was higher than 85%, which indicated that the rules proposed in this study are suitable for other study regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Decision trees; Infrared devices; Plastic films; Sampling; Soil pollution; Supervised learning; Water pollution; Multi-temporal data; PML indices; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Threshold rule; Mapping","Multi-temporal data; Plastic-mulched land (PML); PML indices; Random Forest; Sentinel-2; Threshold rule","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067379140"

However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoacán, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images.

In addition, we analyzed the contribution of airborne LiDAR metrics to improve classification accuracy compared to six vegetation indices (VIs) and 10 reflectance bands from the MSI instrument. Using a detailed soil survey, the spatial distribution of the vegetation physiognomies mapped by RF was associated with the variability of 20 physico-chemical attributes of 75 soil profiles submitted to principal components analysis (PCA) and ordinary kriging. The results showed gains in overall classification accuracy with use of the multi-temporal data over the mono-temporal observations. Gains in classification of arboreous Caatinga were also observed after the insertion of LiDAR metrics in the analysis, especially the percentage of vegetation cover with height greater than 5 m, the terrain elevation and the standard deviation of vegetation height. Overall, the most important metrics for classification were the VIs, especially the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII-1), Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The most important MSI/Sentinel-2 bands were positioned in the red-edge spectral interval. From PCA, soil attributes responsible for most of the data variance were related to soil fertility, soil depth and rock fragments in the surface horizon. The amounts of gravels and pebbles were factors of physiognomic variability with shrub and sub-shrub Caatinga occurring preferentially over shallow and stony soils. By contrast, arboreous Caatinga occurred over soils with total profile depth greater than 1 m. Finally, areas of sub-shrub Caatinga had greater values of cation exchange capacity (CEC) and water retention at field capacity than areas of arboreous Caatinga. The differences were statistically significant at 95% confidence level, as indicated by Mann-Whitney U tests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; desert; kriging; lidar; principal component analysis; remote sensing; semiarid region; Sentinel; vegetation mapping","Caatinga; Classification; Kriging; Principal components analysis; Random forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065012674"

Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantifies the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 × 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation >0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in different orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution. © 2018 The Authors","South Africa; Characterization; Data visualization; Statistics; European Space Agency; LANDSAT; Least squares adjustments; Registration; Registration precision; Sentinel-2; Sub-pixel registrations; Universal Transverse Mercator; algorithm; data acquisition; data processing; Landsat; least squares method; pixel; precision; satellite data; Sentinel; wavelength; Pixels","Characterization; Landsat; Least-squares adjustment; Registration; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046143432"

The methodology is based on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images acquired after the sowing and before the harvest of the crop throughout four successive agricultural seasons, the reflectance constituting the input variables of a statistical algorithm (random forest). The best performances are obtained when the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is combined with the yield maps collected during the crop rotation, the agricultural season 2014 showing the lower level of performances with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.44 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.13 quintals by hectare (q.h−1) (corresponding to a relative error of 12.9%), the three other years being associated with values of R2 close or upper to 0.60 and RMSE lower than 7 q.h−1 (corresponding to a relative error inferior to 11.3%). Moreover, the proposed approach allows estimating the crop yield throughout the agricultural season, by using the successive images acquired from the sowing to the harvest. In such cases, early and accurate yield estimates are obtained three months before the end of the crop cycle. At this phenological stage, only a slight decrease in performance is observed compared to the statistic obtained just before the harvest. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Due to increasing anthropogenic influences and the impact of climate change, wetlands are increasingly threatened and degraded. An effective monitoring of wetlands is therefore necessary to preserve and restore these endangered ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) data offer a great potential to support cost-effective and large-scale monitoring of wetlands. Current state-of-the-art methods for wetland mapping, however, require large training data and manual effort and can therefore only be locally applied. The focus of this study is to evaluate a methodology for large-scale and highly automated wetland mapping based on current EO data streams. For this purpose, an algorithm for water and wetness detection based on multi-temporal optical imagery and topographic data is presented. Suitable spectral indices sensitive to water and wetness were identified using feature selection methods based on mutual information between optical indices and occurrence of water and wetness. In combination with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), these were used to derive monthly water and wetness masks using a dynamic thresholding approach. Aggregating all observations corrected for seasonal bias yielded flooding and wetness frequencies and the Water Wetness Presence (or Probability) Index (WWPI) as an indicator for wetland occurrence or a pre-inventory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the algorithm is demonstrated at three study sites with different wetland types in Kenya/Uganda, Algeria, and Austria using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery. For all sites, the overall accuracy was above 92%. User's and producer's accuracies were higher for water (>96%) than for wetness (>75%). Due to the high degree of automation and low processing time, the proposed method is applicable on a large scale and has already been applied during the production of the Copernicus High Resolution Water-Wetness Layer and within the European Space Agency (ESA) project GlobWetland Africa. © 2019","Algeria; Austria; Kenya; Uganda; Automation; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Ecosystems; Flood control; Floods; Food supply; Mapping; Space applications; Image compositing; Image thresholding; Sentinel-2; Waterbodies; Wetness frequency; WWPI; accuracy assessment; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; automation; detection method; flood control; image analysis; restoration ecology; satellite data; Sentinel; wetland; Wetlands","Image compositing; Sentinel-2; Split-based image thresholding; Water body mapping; Water frequency; Wetland detection; Wetness frequency; WWPI","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061713338"

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained considerable achievements in the remote sensing community. However, it has not been widely used in mapping a rice paddy, and most studies lack the comparison of classification effectiveness and efficiency between CNNs and other classic machine learning models and their transferability. This study aims to develop various machine learning classification models with remote sensing data for comparing the local accuracy of classifiers and evaluating the transferability of pretrained classifiers. Therefore, two types of experiments were designed: local classification experiments and model transferability experiments. These experiments were conducted using cloud-free Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data in Banan District and Zhongxian County, typical hilly areas of Southwestern China. A pure pixel extraction algorithm was designed based on land-use vector data and a Google Earth Online image. Four convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (one-dimensional (Conv-1D), two-dimensional (Conv-2D) and three-dimensional (Conv-3D_1 and Conv-3D_2) convolutional neural networks) were developed and compared with four widely used classifiers (random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Recall, precision, overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score were applied to evaluate classification accuracy. The results showed that Conv-2D performed best in local classification experiments with OA of 93.14% and F1 score of 0.8552 in Banan District, OA of 92.53% and F1 score of 0.8399 in Zhongxian County. CNN-based models except Conv-1D provided more desirable performance than non-CNN classifiers. Besides, among the non-CNN classifiers, XGBoost received the best result with OA of 89.73% and F1 score of 0.7742 in Banan District, SVM received the best result with OA of 88.57% and F1 score of 0.7538 in Zhongxian County. In model transferability experiments, almost all CNN classifiers had low transferability. RF and XGBoost models have achieved acceptable F1 scores for transfer (RF = 0.6673 and 0.6469, XGBoost = 0.7171 and 0.6709, respectively). © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural robots; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Decision trees; Land use; Mapping; Multilayer neural networks; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Machine learning classification; Machine learning models; Model transferabilities; Multi layer perceptron; Multi-temporal data; Remote sensing data; Learning systems","Convolutional neural network; F1 score; Rice; Sentinel-2; Transfer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085583302"

Although multi-temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi-sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved δNDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data. © 2019 The Authors","Deep learning; Hazards; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Independent component analysis; Landslides; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Magnetorheological fluids; Mapping; Markov processes; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Change detection; Landslide inventories; Markov Random Fields; Multi sensor; NDVI; data set; detection method; earthquake trigger; hazard assessment; image resolution; landslide; machine learning; mapping method; principal component analysis; remote sensing; risk assessment; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Principal component analysis","Change detection; Independent component analysis; Landslide inventory mapping; Markov random field (MRF); Multi-sensor; NDVI; Principal component analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067615144"

The combination of remotely sensed optical and radar datasets presents an opportunity for acquiring crop information at relative spatial resolution and temporal resolution adequately to capture the growth profiles of various crop species. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1A (S-1) and Sentinel-2A (S-2) data acquired between the end of June and early September 2016, on a semi-arid area in northern Nigeria. A different set of (VV and VH) SAR and optical (SI and SB) images, illustrating crop phenological development stage, were employed as inputs to the two machines learning Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to automatically map maize fields. Significant increases in overall classification were shown when the multi-temporal spectral indices (SI) and spectral band (SB) datasets were added with the different integration of SAR datasets (i.e., VV and VH). The best overall accuracy (OA) for maize (96.93%) was derived by using RF classification algorithms with SI-SB-SAR datasets, although the SI datasets for RF and SB datasets for SVM also produced high overall maize classification accuracies, of 97.04% and 97.44%. The outcomes indicate the robustness of the RF or SVM methods to produce high-resolution maps of maize for subsequent application from agronomists, policy planners, and the government, because such information is lacking in our study area. © 2020 by the authors.","Nigeria; Zea mays; agricultural land; data acquisition; food security; machine learning; maize; phenology; satellite data; satellite imagery; semiarid region; Sentinel; smallholder; spatial resolution; support vector machine; temporal analysis; tropical region; vegetation mapping","Food security; Maize fields; Random forest; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Smallholder; Support vector machine; Tropical","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082957328"

However, it is not always either freely available or easily compatible for the final users due to the different resolutions offered by sensors onboard the satellite platforms. Crop classification is an important task to control and make decisions related to the agricultural practice and its regulation. However, it is not trivial, especially for extensive areas. Thus, this paper proposes a new approach for crop classification in large areas by a combined use of multi-temporal open-source remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) satellite platforms. Having to deal with different spatial and temporal resolutions, special spatial regions (called Tuplekeys) were created within a local nested grid to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. Temporal variation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was the chosen input to classify crops. Moreover, due to the massive quantity of data collected, filters considering some agronomic and edaphic criteria were applied with the dual goal of decreasing redundancies and increasing the process efficiency. Out of three different machine learning classifiers analyzed, a plot-based approach was considered for the algorithms calibration while a pixel-based approach was used for the final classification process. The methodology was both tested and validated in the Duero river basin (Spain), 78,859 km                             2                             , for the 2017 spring and summer seasons. Finally, classification outputs were analyzed throughout their overall accuracy (OA), not only for the whole basin but also for each of the Tuplekeys so that the OA spatial distribution was evaluated as well. The Ensemble Bagged Trees (EBT) algorithm showed the maximum OA, 87% and 92%, when classifying crops individually (15 classes) and grouped (7 classes), respectively, proving both the accuracy and efficiency of the developed approach.                          © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Duero Basin; Spain; agricultural practice; algorithm; calibration; Landsat; machine learning; NDVI; pixel; precision agriculture; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; vegetation classification","Crop classification; Interoperability; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060333901"

The dense time series and a wide swath of Sentinel-2 data are a good basis for forest mapping and tree species identification over a large area. This study presents the results of the classification of the forest/non-forest cover, forest type (broadleaf and coniferous) and the identification of eight tree species (beech, oak, alder, birch, spruce, pine, fir, and larch) using the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in combination with topographic information. The study was conducted over the large mountain area located in southern Poland. The Random Forest classifier was used to first derive a forest/non-forest map. Second, the forest was classified into broadleaf and coniferous. Finally, the tree species classification was carried out following two approaches: (i) Non-stratified, where all species were classified together within the forest mask and (ii) stratified, where the broadleaf and coniferous tree species were classified separately within the forest type masks. The overall accuracy for the forest/non-forest cover reached 98.3% and declined slightly to 94.8% for the classification of the forest type. The use of the topographic information did not increase the accuracy of either result. The role of the topographic variables increased significantly in the process of tree species delineation. By combining the topographic information (in particular, digital elevation model) with the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data, the classification of eight tree species improved from 75.6% to 81.7% (approach 1). A further increase in accuracy to 89.5% for broadleaf and 82% for coniferous species was observed following the stratified approach number 2. The highest overall accuracy (above 85%) was obtained for beech, oak, birch, alder, and larch. The study confirmed the potential of the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for accurate delineation of the forest cover, forest type, and tree species at the regional scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Mapping; Surveying; Digital elevation model; Forest cover; Forest type; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Tree species; Forestry","Digital elevation model (DEM); Forest cover; Forest type; Random forest; Sentinel-2; Tree species","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065017586"

From an environmental viewpoint, the presence and type of vegetation cover in winter influences the transport of pollutants to water resources. From a methodological viewpoint, characterizing spatio-temporal dynamics of land cover and land use at the field scale is challenging due to the diversity of farming strategies and practices in winter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the respective advantages of Sentinel optical and SAR time-series to identify land use in winter. To this end, Sentinel-1 and -2 time-series were classified using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms in a 130 km                             2                              agricultural area.

Remote sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and its changes, which is reflected by a large number of scientific papers published on this topic. The aim of this study was to investigate the multi-decadal changes of mangrove forests selected communes in Hai Phong city, North Vietnam, based on using Landsat and Sentinel 2 data from 2000 to 2018. The study used these continuous steps: 1) data pre-processing; 2) image classification using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; 3) accuracy assessments; and 4) multi-temporal change detection and spatial analysis of mangrove forests.

The multi-temporal co-registration accuracy of images provided by both missions is, however, currently not fully satisfactory for change detection, time-series analysis and in particular Earth surface motion measurements. The objective of this work is the development, implementation and test of an automatic processing chain for correcting co-registration artefacts targeting accurate alignment of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery for time series analysis. The method relies on dense sub-pixel offset measurements and robust statistics to correct for systematic offsets and striping artefacts. Experimental evaluation at sites with diverse environmental settings is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the processing chain in comparison with previously proposed routines. The experimental evaluation suggests lower residual offsets than existing methods ranging between RMSExy = 2.30 and 2.91 m remaining stable for longer time series. A first case study demonstrates the utility of the processor for the monitoring of continuously active landslides. A second case study demonstrates the use of the processor for measuring co-seismic surface displacements indicating an accuracy of 1/5 th of a pixel after corrections and 1/10th of a pixel after calibration with ground measurements.

Likewise, the Earth Observation (EO) data contribute to the disaster management process through the provision of updated information for areas under investigation. In addition, long term studies may be performed for the in-depth analysis of the disaster-prone areas using archive satellite imagery and other cartographic materials. Hence, satellite remote sensing represents an essential tool for the study of hazards in cultural heritage sites and landscapes. Depending on the size of the archaeological sites and considering the fact that some parts of the site might be covered, the main concern regards the suitability of satellite data in terms of spatial and spectral resolution. Using a multi-temporal Sentinel-2 dataset between 2016 and 2019, the present study focuses on the hazard risk identification for the Micia and Germisara archaeological sites in Romania as they are endangered by industrialisation and major infrastructure works and soil erosion, respectively. Furthermore, the study includes a performance assessment of remote sensing vegetation indices for the detection of buried structures. The results clearly indicate that Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be fundamental in meeting the objectives of the study, particularly due to the extensive archaeological knowledge that was available for the cultural heritage sites. The main conclusion to be drawn is that satellite-derived products may be enhanced by integrating valuable archaeological context, especially when the resolution of satellite data is not ideally fitting the peculiarities (e.g., in terms of size, underground structures, type of coverage) of the investigated cultural heritage sites. © 2020 by the authors.","Architecture; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Hazards; Satellite imagery; Underground structures; Archaeological site; Cultural heritages; Disaster management; Earth observation data; Industrialisation; Performance assessment; Satellite remote sensing; Updated informations; Remote sensing","Archaeological heritage; Copernicus programme; Cultural heritage; Disaster management; Earth observation; Remote sensing; Roman forts; Sentinel-2; Vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086984669"

The multi-band temporal texture features obtained are combined with bi-Temporal multispectral images to detect urban built-up area change using direct multi-Temporal image classification. One-class random forest (OCRF), a recently proposed one-class classifier, is used in multi-Temporal image classification by sampling one specific class of interest, i.e., built-up area expansion. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of multi-band temporal textures outperformed that using spectral features alone, with increases of 10.55% and 1.74% in overall accuracy, for SPOT-5 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. Similarly, its overall accuracy is 11.08% and 0.24% higher than incorporating single-band temporal textures.

LCZs outline a classification scheme, which is designed to categorize urban and rural surfaces according to their climate-relevant properties, irrespective of local building materials or cultural background. We present a novel workflow for a high-resolution derivation of LCZs using multi-temporal Sentinel 2 (S2) composites and supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We assume that CNNs, due to their potential invariance to size and illumination of objects, are best suited to predict the highly context-based LCZs on a large scale. As a first step, the proposed workflow includes a fully automated generation of cloud-free S2 composites. These composites serve as training data basis for the LCZ classifications carried out over eight German cities. Results show that by using a CNN, overall accuracies can be increased by an average of 16.5 and 4.8 percentage points when compared to a pixel-based and a texture-based Random Forest approach, respectively. If sufficient training data is available, CNN models proved to be robust in classifying unknown cities and achieved overall accuracies of up to 86.5%.

This method is based on Sentinel-1 data, as well as auxiliary land cover information, and combines a pixel-based and an object-oriented approach. Multi-temporal characteristics and patterns are applied to generate novel times series features, which represent a basis for the developed approach. The method is tested on a study area in Namibia characterized by a large flood event in April 2017. Sentinel-1 times series were used for the period between September 2016 and July 2017. It is shown that the supplement of TFV areas to the temporary open water areas prevents the underestimation of the flood area, allowing the derivation of the entire flood extent.

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically.

The study described in this paper presents methods for combining results of land cover/land use classifications performed on single-date Sentinel-2 images acquired at different time periods. For that purpose different aggregation methods were proposed and tested on study sites spread on different continents. The initial classifications were performed with Random Forest classifier on individual Sentinel-2 images from a time series. In the following step the resulting land cover maps were aggregated pixel by pixel using three different combinations of information on the number of occurrences of a certain land cover class within a time series and the posterior probability of particular classes resulting from the Random Forest classification. From the proposed methods two are shown superior and in most cases were able to reach or outperform the accuracy of the best individual classifications of single-date images. Moreover, the aggregations results are very stable when used on data with varying cloudiness. They also enable to reduce considerably the number of cloudy pixels in the resulting land cover map what is significant advantage for mapping areas with frequent cloud coverage. © 2017 SPIE.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Image processing; Learning systems; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Signal processing; Time series; Decision fusion; Land cover; Multi-temporal analysis; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Time series analysis","Decision fusion; Land cover; Machine learning; Multitemporal analysis; Random forest; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041021782"

Four non-parametric classifier algorithms, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were applied to map crop types in various irrigated landscapes in Central Asia. A novel decision fusion strategy to combine the outputs of the classifiers was proposed. This approach is based on randomly selecting subsets of the input dataset and aggregating the probabilistic outputs of the base classifiers with another meta-classifier. During the decision fusion, the reliability of each base classifier algorithm was considered to exclude less reliable inputs at the class-basis. The spatial and temporal transferability of the classifiers was evaluated using data sets from four different agricultural landscapes with different spatial extents and from different years. A detailed accuracy assessment showed that none of the stand-alone classifiers was the single best performing. Despite the very good performance of the base classifiers, there was still up to 50% disagreement in the maps produced by the two single best classifiers, RF and SVM. The proposed fusion strategy, however, increased overall accuracies up to 6%. In addition, it was less sensitive to reduced training set sizes and produced more realistic land use maps with less speckle. The proposed fusion approach was better transferable to data sets from other years, i.e. resulted in higher accuracies for the investigated classes. The fusion approach is computationally efficient and appears well suited for mapping diverse crop categories based on sensors with a similar high repetition rate and spatial resolution like RapidEye, for instance the upcoming Sentinel-2 mission. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Many approaches are based on classification techniques considering observation at certain points in time. However, some land cover classes, such as crops, change their spectral characteristics due to environmental influences and can thus not be monitored effectively with classical mono-temporal approaches. Nevertheless, these temporal observations should be utilized to benefit the classification process. After extensive research has been conducted on modeling temporal dynamics by spectro-temporal profiles using vegetation indices, we propose a deep learning approach to utilize these temporal characteristics for classification tasks. In this work, we show how long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks can be employed for crop identification purposes with SENTINEL 2A observations from large study areas and label information provided by local authorities. We compare these temporal neural network models, i.e., LSTM and recurrent neural network (RNN), with a classical non-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN) model and an additional support vector machine (SVM) baseline. With our rather straightforward LSTM variant, we exceeded state-of-the-art classification performance, thus opening promising potential for further research.","Brain; Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Education; Neural networks; Recurrent neural networks; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Classification technique; Convolutional neural network; Crop identification; Land cover classification; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel 2; Spectral characteristics; Long short-term memory","Crop identification; Deep learning; Land cover classification; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Sentinel 2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021131739"

Based on this information, well-targeted land management decisions can be made. Remote sensing is in a unique position to contribute to this task as it is globally available and provides a plethora of information about current crop status. M4Land is a comprehensive system in which a crop growth model (PROMET) and a reflectance model (SLC) are coupled in order to provide these information products by analyzing multi-temporal satellite images. SLC uses modelled surface state parameters from PROMET, such as leaf area index or phenology of different crops to simulate spatially distributed surface reflectance spectra. This is the basis for generating artificial satellite images considering sensor specific configurations (spectral bands, solar and observation geometries). Ensembles of model runs are used to represent different crop types, fertilization status, soil colour and soil moisture. By multi-temporal comparisons of simulated and real satellite images, the land cover/crop type can be classified in a dynamically, model-supervised way and without in-situ training data. The method is demonstrated in an agricultural test-site in Bavaria. Its transferability is studied by analysing PROMET model results for the rest of Germany. Especially the simulated phenological development can be verified on this scale in order to understand whether PROMET is able to adequately simulate spatial, as well as temporal (intra-and inter-season) crop growth conditions, a prerequisite for the model-supervised approach. This sophisticated new technology allows monitoring of management decisions on the field-level using high resolution optical data (presently RapidEye and Landsat). The M4Land analysis system is designed to integrate multi-mission data and is well suited for the use of Sentinel-2's continuous and manifold data stream.","Agricultural robots; Data streams; Decision making; Food supply; Land use; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Canopy reflectance model; Classification system; Crop growth model; M4Land; Sentinel; Crops","Canopy reflectance model SLC; Crop growth model PROMET; Land management classification system; M4Land; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930390504"

Compatibility in multitemporal, multiple sensor image data would facilitate the monitoring. The decommissioning of SPOT 5 (Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre 5) left a void in multispectral imagery at the 10 m spatial resolution of its high-resolution geometric (HRG) sensor. The subsequent launch of Sentinel 2 presented an opportunity for data continuity to monitor the savannah woody cover, using equivalent 10 m resolution multispectral instrument (MSI) bands. This study examined the integration potential of Sentinel 2 MSI with the longer archive HRG and Landsat 8 (Land Satellite 8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery, in assessing savannah woody cover. Images of three semi-arid savannah sites acquired on same season dates that excluded herbaceous vegetation from the spectral signature were used: November 2014 (HRG) and December 2015 (MSI, OLI). Using equivalent green (G), red (R), and near infrared (NIR) bands at 10 m (MSI, HRG) and 30 m (OLI) resolution, the woody cover was mapped through subpixel classification. The mapped woody cover was compared for statistical differences using χ2 analysis at 10 m resolution (MSI, HRG) and at a degradation of the MSI and HRG images to the 30 m OLI pixel size. Conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance values facilitated inter-sensor correlation of G, R, and NIR reflectance for field sampling sites where woody cover was quantified. Inter-sensor regression functions in G, R, and NIR band MSI and HRG images were developed. The 10 m resolution classifications of woody cover were not statistically different. Due to spatial resolution similarity, SPOT 5 HRG multispectral imagery was established as suitable for integration with equivalent band MSI imagery in mapping the woody cover in a multitemporal analysis. For dense woody cover, Landsat 8 OLI imagery was more suitable for integration with MSI than HRG images due to higher radiometric sensitivity, which can permit monitoring physiology-related woody reflectance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image resolution; Infrared devices; Integration; Monitoring; Pixels; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Herbaceous vegetation; Multi-spectral imagery; Multi-temporal analysis; Multispectral instruments; Operational land imager; Radiometric sensitivity; Statistical differences; Sub-pixel classification; imagery; land cover; Landsat; monitoring; savanna; semiarid region; Sentinel; SPOT; Image analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046280200"

In this study, high spatial and temporal resolution RapidEye bio-temporal data were utilized within a novel 2-step hierarchical random forest (RF) classification approach to map areas of mono- and mixed maize cropping systems. A small-scale maize farming site in Machakos County, Kenya was used as a study site. Within the study site, field data was collected during the satellite acquisition period on general land use/land cover (LULC) and the two cropping systems. Firstly, non-cropland areas were masked out from other land use/land cover using the LULC mapping result. Subsequently an optimized RF model was applied to the cropland layer to map the two cropping systems (2nd classification step). An overall accuracy of 93% was attained for the LULC classification, while the class accuracies (PA: producer’s accuracy and UA: user’s accuracy) for the two cropping systems were consistently above 85%. We concluded that explicit mapping of different cropping systems is feasible in complex and highly fragmented agro-ecological landscapes if high resolution and multi-temporal satellite data such as 5 m RapidEye data is employed. Further research is needed on the feasibility of using freely available 10–20 m Sentinel-2 data for wide-area assessment of cropping systems as an important variable in numerous crop productivity models. © 2017 by the authors.

The Sentinel-2 mission offers a global coverage over terrestrial surfaces. The satellites acquire systematically terrestrial surfaces under the same viewing conditions in order to have temporal images stacks. The first satellite was launched in June 2015 and the second in March 2017. In cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA), the French space agency (CNES) is in charge of the image quality of the project, and so ensured the CAL/VAL commissioning phase during the months following the launch. This cooperation is also extended to routine phase as CNES supports European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) and the Sentinel-2 Mission performance Centre (MPC) for validation in geometric and radiometric image quality aspects, and in Sentinel-2 Global Reference Image (GRI) geolocation performance assessment. This paper points on geometric image quality on Sentinel-2B commissioning phase. It relates to the methods and the performances obtained, as well as the comparison between S2A and S2B. This deals with geolocation and multispectral registration. A small focus is also done on the Sentinel-2 GRI which is a set of S2A images at 10m resolution covering the whole world with a good and consistent geolocation. This ground reference leads to ensure an accurate multi-temporal registration-on refined Sentinel-2 products over GRI-which is also presented in this paper. © Copyright 2017 SPIE.","Geometry; Image quality; Orbits; Space flight; Space research; Geolocations; Geometric calibrations; Geometric performances; In-orbit; Reference image; Registration; Sentinel-2; Satellites","Geolocation; Geometric calibration; Geometric performances; Global Reference Image; Image Quality; In-Orbit commissioning; Registration; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038360913"

This paper presents a remote sensing based method to observe calcite precipitation over large areas, which are an important prerequisite for a systematic monitoring and evaluation of restoration measurements. We use globally archived satellite remote sensing data for a retrospective systematic assessment of past multi-temporal calcite precipitation events. The database of this study consists of 205 data sets that comprise freely available Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1998 and 2015 covering the Northeast German Plain. Calcite precipitation is automatically identified using the green spectra and the metric BGR area, the triangular area between the blue, green and red reflectance value. The validation is based on field measurements of CaCO3 concentrations at three selected lakes, Feldberger Haussee, Breiter Luzin and Schmaler Luzin. The classification accuracy (0.88) is highest for calcite concentrations ≥0.7 mg/L. False negative results are caused by the choice of a conservative classification threshold. False positive results can be explained by already increased calcite concentrations. We successfully transferred the developed method to 21 other hardwater lakes in Northeast Germany. The average duration of lakes with regular calcite precipitation is 37 days. The frequency of calcite precipitation reaches from single time detections up to detections nearly every year. False negative classification results and gaps in Landsat time series reduce the accuracy of frequency and duration monitoring, but in future the image density will increase by acquisitions of Sentinel-2a (and 2b). Our study tested successfully the transfer of the classification approach to Sentinel-2 images. Our study shows that 15 of the 24 lakes have at least one phase of calcite precipitation and all events occur between May and September. At the lakes Schmaler Luzin and Feldberger Haussee, we illustrated the influence of ecological restoration measures aiming at nutrient reduction in the lake water on calcite precipitation. Our study emphasizes the high variance of calcite precipitation in hardwater lakes: each lake has to be monitored individually, which is feasible using Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series. © 2017 by the authors.","Germany; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Ecology; Lakes; Reflection; Remote sensing; Restoration; Time series analysis; Ecological restoration; Hardwater; Landsat time series; Northeast German Plain; Sentinel 2; accuracy assessment; calcite; concentration (composition); data set; database; environmental monitoring; image classification; lake water; Landsat; remote sensing; restoration ecology; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial distribution; time series analysis; Calcite","Calcium-rich hardwater lakes; Evaluation of ecological restoration measures; Landsat Time series analysis; Northeast German Plain; Sentinel 2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011309023"

The MACCS (Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening)-ATCOR (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction) Joint Algorithm, called MAJA, is a numerical tool designed to perform cloud detection and atmospheric correction. For the correction of aerosols effects, MAJA makes an estimate of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) based on multi-temporal and multi-spectral criteria, but there is insufficient information to infer the aerosol type. The current operational version of MAJA uses an aerosol type which is constant with time, and this assumption impacts the quality of the atmospheric correction. In this study, we assess the potential of using an aerosol type derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational analysis. The performances, with and without the CAMS information, are evaluated. Firstly, in terms of the aerosol optical thickness retrievals, a comparison against sunphotometer measurements over several sites indicates an improvement over arid sites, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 28% (from 0.095 to 0.068), although there is a slight degradation over vegetated sites (RMSE increased by 13%, from 0.054 to 0.061). Secondly, a direct validation of the retrieved surface reflectances at the La Crau station (France) indicates a reduction of the relative bias by 2.5% on average over the spectral bands. Thirdly, based on the assumption that surface reflectances vary slowly with time, a noise criterion was set up, exhibiting no improvement over the spectral bands and the validation sites when using CAMS data, partly explained by a slight increase in the surface reflectances themselves. Finally, the new method presented in this study provides a better way of using the MAJA processor in an operational environment because the aerosol type used for the correction is automatically inferred from CAMS data, and is no longer a parameter to be defined in advance. © 2017 by the author.","Atmospheric aerosols; Cams; Mean square error; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Time series; Atmospheric corrections; MACCS; MAJA; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Aerosols","Aerosols; Atmospheric correction; CAMS; MACCS; MAJA; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038210948"

Large scale crop mapping requires processing andmanagement of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a “Big Data” problem. Themain objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g., country level) and multiple sensors (e.g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platformare compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory (~28,100 km2 and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that GEE provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platformand providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE. © 2017 Shelestov, Lavreniuk, Kussul, Novikov and Skakun.

Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic. © 2015 by the authors.","Agricultural machinery; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision trees; Image resolution; Learning systems; Mapping; Remote sensing; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Crop type mappings; Land cover; LANDSAT; Random forests; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; SPOT4 (Take5); Satellite imagery","Crop type mapping; Land cover; Landsat 8; Random forests; Satellite image time series; Sentinel-2; SPOT4 (Take5); Support vector machines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942518161"

Spatial coverage of this urban development is a good basis for deriving prospective traffic-and urban development plans. Satellite imagery exists since the early 70s which now document almost historic cityscape. Different methods for semi-automatic classification of urban growth and structure were tested and optimized by means of several satellite data based on Landsat MSS, Landsat TM5, Landsat ETM7 or RapidEye sensors in order to get a quick and acceptable overview of the urban dynamics. The frst applied method was a object-oriented classification with ecognition 8.0 divided into segmentation and classification. The object defnition rules of time series already of one sensor based on different weather conditions, seasons and bounding boxes were not transferrable caused by completely different segmentation. In contrast to this an approach with representatives has better results for time series because these 'segments' are pre-defned and have always the same borders. The same is true for data from other sensors, for example Sentinel 2. This free data could become in future a low-cost possibility to get quick hints for suburbanization, agglomeration or urban decay. The aim of a multi-temporal approach was not achieved due to an unsufficient number of satellite data caused by many clouds in the subtropical Siedlungsarea. The use of radar satellite data, irrespective of clouds, could specially in this area be an alternative and a focus for further research works. Sentinel 1 is a radar satellite with a revisit time of six days. The analysis of the change has roughly confirmed the political plans for suburban growth or also known as New Urban Area (NUA). Moreover, areas with fast or slow growth were detected while urban structures were differentiated in more detail. © 2016 E.

An accurate atmospheric correction requires good knowledge of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and of the aerosol type. As a first step, this study compares the performances of two kinds of AOT estimation methods applied to FormoSat-2 and LandSat time series of images: a multi-spectral method that assumes a constant relationship between surface reflectance measurements and a multi-temporal method that assumes that the surface reflectances are stable with time. In a second step, these methods are combined to obtain more accurate and robust estimates. The estimated AOTs are compared to in situ measurements on several sites of the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network). The methods, based on either spectral or temporal criteria, provide accuracies better than 0.07 in most cases, but show degraded accuracies in some special cases, such as the absence of vegetation for the spectral method or a very quick variation of landscape for the temporal method. The combination of both methods in a new spectro-temporal method increases the robustness of the results in all cases. © 2015 by the authors.","Atmospheric aerosols; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Time series; Aerosol optical thickness; Aerosol robotic networks; Atmospheric corrections; Formosat-2; High resolution image; LANDSAT; Optical remote sensing; Surface reflectance; Aerosols","Aerosols; Atmospheric correction; FormoSat-2; LandSat; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2,VENμS; Surface reflectance; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926382691"

Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced the LiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45 m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65 m for > 20 m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for < 5 m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 5–10 m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11–17 m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover ≥ 18 m.

The recursive and multi-temporal algorithm is implemented in a core that is the same for all the sensors and that combines several processing steps: estimation of cloud cover, cloud shadow, water, snow and shadows masks, of water vapor content, aerosol optical thickness, atmospheric correction. This core is accessed via a number of plug-ins where the specificity of the sensor and of the user project are taken into account: products format, algorithmic processing chaining and parameters. After a presentation of MACCS architecture and functionalities, the paper will give an overview of the production facilities integrating MACCS and the associated specificities: the interest for this tool has grown worldwide and MACCS will be used for extensive production within the THEIA land data center and Agri-S2 project. Finally the paper will zoom on the use of MACCS during Sentinel-2 In Orbit Test phase showing the first Level-2A products. © 2015 SPIE.","Data handling; Image acquisition; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Aerosol optical thickness; Atmospheric corrections; Commissioning; Level 2; Production facility; Sentinel 2; Technical expertise; Water vapor contents; Image processing","Commissioning; level 2A production; Sentinel 2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961653820"

Recently, miniaturized hyperspectral 2D frame cameras have showed great potential to precise agriculture estimations and they are feasible to combine with lightweight platforms, such as drones. Drone platform is a flexible tool for remote sensing applications with environment and agriculture. The assessment and comparison of different platforms such as satellite, aircraft and drones with different sensors, such as hyperspectral and RGB cameras is an important task in order to understand the potential of the data provided by these equipment and to select the most appropriate according to the user applications and requirements. In this context, open and permanent test fields are very significant and helpful experimental environment, since they provide a comparative data for different platforms, sensors and users, allowing multi-temporal analyses as well. Objective of this work was to investigate the feasibility of an open permanent test field in context of precision agriculture. Satellite (Sentinel-2), aircraft and drones with hyperspectral and RGB cameras were assessed in this study to estimate biomass, using linear regression models and in-situ samples. Spectral data and 3D information were used and compared in different combinations to investigate the quality of the models. The biomass estimation accuracies using linear regression models were better than 90% for the drone based datasets. The results showed that the use of spectral and 3D features together improved the estimation model. However, estimation of nitrogen content was less accurate with the evaluated remote sensing sensors. The open and permanent test field showed to be suitable to provide an accurate and reliable reference data for the commercial users and farmers. © Authors 2017.","Agriculture; Biomass; Calibration; Cameras; Drones; Fighter aircraft; Hyperspectral imaging; Nitrogen; Photogrammetry; Regression analysis; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Biomass estimation; Canopy Height Models; Experimental environment; HyperSpectral; Linear regression models; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing technology; Validation; Remote sensing","Biomass estimation; Calibration; Canopy Height model; Drone; Hyperspectral; Photogrammetry; UAV; Validation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033726056"

Often it is also not optimal to use only one scene due to regionally varying mapping conditions.

The results were validated with a SVM classification of UAV-based hyperspectral mosaics acquired in March 2016. The results show that it is possible to map the coverage of the Pinus radiata class up to an accuracy of R2 ∼ 0.6 and RMSE of ∼ 10 %. Generally, a higher number of Sentinel-2 images increased the performance of the model, while there was no significant dependency on a specific acquisition date.

Considering this, the objective of this paper was to investigate the performance of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data for discriminating different successional forest stages of a patch located in a subtropical portion of the Atlantic Rain Forest in Southern Brazil with the aid of two machine learning algorithms and relying on the use of spectral reflectance data selected over two seasons and attributes thereof derived. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were used as classifiers with different subsets of predictor variables (multitemporal spectral reflectance, textural metrics and vegetation indices). All the experiments reached satisfactory results, with Kappa indices varying between 0.9, with Landsat-8 spectral reflectance alone and the SVM algorithm, and 0.98, with Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance alone also associated with the SVM algorithm. The Landsat-8 data had a significant increase in accuracy with the inclusion of other predictor variables in the classification process besides the pure spectral reflectance bands. The classification methods SVM and RF had similar performances in general. As to the RF method, the texture mean of the red-edge and SWIR bands were considered the most important ranked attributes for the classification of Sentinel-2 data, while attributes resulting from multitemporal bands, textural metrics of SWIR bands and vegetation indices were the most important ones in the Landsat-8 data classification. © 2017 by the authors.","Decision trees; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reflection; Support vector machines; Tropics; Vegetation; Classification methods; Classification process; Environmental conservation; Multi-temporal; Random forests; Textural feature; Tropical environments; Vegetation index; Classification (of information)","Multitemporal information; Random forest; Support vector machine; Textural features; Vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027469296"

While hyperspectral exploratory sensors are demonstrating their potential, satellite remote sensing has simultaneously entered a new era. Multispectral sensors with short revisiting period are now acquiring free, open, global and systematic high resolution visible and infrared imagery. More specifically, Sentinel-2 sensors broke down the barrier between hyper- and multispectral imaging. This sensor optimizes its number of potential applications thanks to numerous narrow bands spanning on a significant range of the spectrum at a high spatial resolution. The recent release of this high performance multispectral instrument calls thus the relevance of hyperspectral spaceborne imaging of medium spatial resolution into question and suggests potential synergies between those two kinds of data. In order to clarify this concern, we tried to identify through a comprehensive review the current and future applications for hyperspectral sensors in the Sentinel-2 context. This study therefore reviews 20 years of researches and applications in satellite hyperspectral remote sensing through the analysis of Earth observation (EO) hyperspectral sensors' publications that cover the Sentinel-2 spectrum range: Hyperion, TianGong-1, PRISMA, HYSI, EnMAP, HISUI, Shalom and HyspIRI. More specifically, this study (i) identifies the most useful wavelengths that are not available on Sentinel-2 and (ii) assesses the assets and the limitations of hyperspectral spaceborne sensors for operational EO. Applications using Sentinel-2 are still uncovered, including some demonstrations made with hyperspectral systems. However, the medium spatial resolution and the long revisit time of hyperspectral sensors, and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the short-wave infrared of Hyperion were highlighted as major limitations for hyperspectral applications compared to the Sentinel-2 system. Forthcoming hyperspectral sensors will probably overcome these constraints. This study is putting forward the compatibility of hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 systems for resolution enhancement techniques, and thus for increasing even more the panel of hyperspectral uses, but also the promising future of hyperspectral remote sensing. © 2017 IEEE.","Earth (planet); Image analysis; Image resolution; Infrared radiation; Observatories; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Earth observations; EnMAP; HISUI; Hyperion; HyperSpectral; HyspIRI; Multi-temporal data; PRISMA; Sentinel-2; Shalom; TianGong-1; Hyperspectral imaging","Earth observation; EnMAP; HISUI; Hyperion; Hyperspectral applications; Hyperspectral imaging; HyspIRI; Multi-temporal data; PRISMA; Sentinel-2; Shalom; TianGong-1","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032390367"

In cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA), the French space agency (CNES) is in charge of the image quality of the project, and so ensures the CAL/VAL commissioning phase during the months following the launch. This cooperation is also extended to routine phase as CNES supports European Space Research Institute (ESRIN) and the Sentinel-2 Mission performance Centre (MPC) for validation in geometric and radiometric image quality aspects, and in Sentinel-2 GRI geolocation performance assessment whose results will be presented in this paper. The GRI is a set of S2A images at 10m resolution covering the whole world with a good and consistent geolocation. This ground reference enables accurate multi-temporal registration of refined Sentinel-2 products. While not primarily intended for the generation of DSM, Sentinel-2 swaths overlap between orbits would also allow for the generation of a complete DSM of land and ices over 60° of northern latitudes (expected accuracy: few S2 pixels in altimetry). This DSM would benefit from the very frequent revisit times of Sentinel-2, to monitor ice or snow level in area of frequent changes, or to increase measurement accuracy in areas of little changes.","Image quality; Satellites; Space flight; Space research; Digital surface models; European Space Agency; European space research institutes; Multi-temporal; Performance assessment; Radiometric image quality; Reference image; Sentinel-2 (S2); Orbits","Digital surface model (DSM); Global reference image (GRI); Multi-temporal registration; Sentinel-2 (S2)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021181046"

The aim was to help users set up and test their applications and methods, before Sentinel-2 mission data become available. In 2016, when both Sentinel-2 satellites are operational, and for at least fifteen years, users will have access to high resolution time series of images systematically acquired every five days, over the whole Earth land surfaces. Thanks to Sentinel-2's high revisit frequency, a given surface should be observed without clouds at least once a month, except in the most cloudy periods and regions. In 2013, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) lowered the orbit altitude of SPOT-4, to place it on a five-day repeat cycle orbit for a duration of five months. This experiment started on 31 January 2013 and lasted until 19 June 2013. SPOT-4 images were acquired every fifth day, over 45 sites scattered in nearly all continents and covering very diverse biomes for various applications. Two ortho-rectified products were delivered for each acquired image that was not fully cloudy, expressed either as top of atmosphere reflectance (Level 1C) or as surface reflectance (Level 2A). An extensive validation campaign was held to check the performances of these products with regard to the multi-temporal registration, the quality of cloud masks, the accuracy of aerosol optical thickness estimates and the quality of surface reflectances. Despite high a priori geo-location errors, it was possible to register the images with an accuracy better than 0.5 pixels in the large majority of cases. Despite the lack of a blue band on the SPOT-4 satellite, the cloud and shadow detection yielded good results, while the aerosol optical thickness was measured with a root mean square error better than 0.06. The surface reflectances after atmospheric correction were compared with in situ data and other satellite data showing little bias and the standard deviation of surface reflectance errors in the range (0.01-0.02). The Take 5 experiment is being repeated in 2015 with the SPOT-5 satellite with an enhanced resolution. © 2015 by the authors.","Aerosols; Errors; Geometrical optics; Image registration; Image segmentation; Mean square error; Optical properties; Orbits; Reflection; Satellites; Time series; Atmospheric corrections; Cloud detection; Repetitivity; Sentinel-2; SPOT-4 (Take 5); Surface reflectance; Validation; Image acquisition","Atmospheric correction; Cloud detection; Image registration; Repetitivity; Sentinel-2; SPOT-4 (Take 5); Surface reflectance; Time series; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942540471"

The random forests based machine learning and cross-validation approach was applied for evaluating the performance of different datasets. Cross-validation with the rich-feature datasets-with a sample size of 390-showed that the MODIS datasets provided highest classification accuracy (Overall accuracy = 0.80, Kappa coefficient = 0.77) compared with Landsat 8 (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) and Sentinel-2 (Overall accuracy = 0.66, Kappa coefficient = 0.61) datasets. As a result, temporally rich datasets were found to be crucial for the vegetation physiognomic classification. However, in the case of Landsat 8 or Sentinel-2 datasets, sample size could be increased excessively as around 9800 ground truth points could be prepared within 390 MODIS pixel-sized polygons. The increase in the sample size significantly enhanced the classification using Landsat-8 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.86, Kappa coefficient = 0.84). However, Sentinel-2 datasets (Overall accuracy = 0.77, Kappa coefficient = 0.74) could not perform as much as the Landsat-8 datasets, possibly because of temporally limited datasets covered by the Sentinel-2 satellites so far. A combination of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets slightly improved the classification (Overall accuracy = 0.89, Kappa coefficient = 0.87) than using the Landsat 8 datasets separately. Regardless of the fact that Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets have lower temporal resolutions than MODIS datasets, they could enhance the classification of otherwise challenging vegetation physiognomic types due to possibility of training a wider variation of physiognomic types at 30 m resolution. Based on these findings, an up-to-date 30 m resolution vegetation map was generated by using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 datasets, which showed better accuracy than the existing map in Japan. © 2017 by the authors.","","Cross-validation; Japan; Landsat 8; Machine learning; MODIS; Physiognomy; Sentinel-2; Vegetation mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028611407"

In addition to the SPOT4 (Take5) dataset, we used several Landsat5, 7, 8 images to document the variations in suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in the turbid Gironde and Loire estuaries (France). Satellite-derived SPM concentration was validated using automated in situ turbidity measurements from two monitoring networks. The combination of a multi-temporal atmospheric correction method with a near-infrared to visible reflectance band ratio made it possible to quantify SPM surface concentration in moderately to extremely turbid waters (38-4320 g·m-3), at an accuracy sufficient to detect the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) in both estuaries. Such a multi-sensor approach can be applied to high spatial resolution satellite archives and to the new ESA Sentinel-2 mission.

In particular, Sentinel-2 (S-2) data with improved high spatial resolution and higher revisit frequency (five days with the pair of satellites in operation) will play a fundamental role in recording land cover types and monitoring land cover changes at regular intervals. Nevertheless, cloud coverage usually hinders the time series availability and consequently the continuous land surface monitoring. In an attempt to alleviate this limitation, the synergistic use of instruments with different features is investigated, aiming at the future synergy of the S-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (S-3) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). To that end, an unmixing model is proposed with the intention of integrating the benefits of the two Sentinel missions, when both in orbit, in one composite image. The main goal is to fill the data gaps in the S-2 record, based on the more frequent information of the S-3 time series. The proposed fusion model has been applied on MODIS (MOD09GA L2G) and SPOT4 (Take 5) data and the experimental results have demonstrated that the approach has high potential. However, the different acquisition characteristics of the sensors, i.e. illumination and viewing geometry, should be taken into consideration and bidirectional effects correction has to be performed in order to reduce noise in the reflectance time series. © 2015 by the authors.","Data fusion; Satellite imagery; Time series; Bidirectional effects; High spatial resolution; Multi sensor; Multi-temporal; Multispectral instruments; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spectral unmixing; Temporal weights; Sensor data fusion","Data fusion; Multi-sensor; Multi-temporal; Spatial-spectral unmixing; Temporal weights","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945906996"
