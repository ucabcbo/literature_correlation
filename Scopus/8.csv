Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice-water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence. The sea ice-related loss function is designed to provide more detailed sea ice information of the network to improve super-resolution performance and further benefit finer Arctic SIC results. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDRnet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art MISR methods and can generate super-resolved SIC products with finer texture features and much sharper sea ice edges.

Accurately tracking sea ice motions is essential to validate or even improve sea ice models for ice hazard forecasts at a fine scale. Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a significant benefit. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved fine-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image super-resolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the tracking performance in both accuracy and robustness for a benchmark algorithm and a recently proposed state-of-the-art tracking algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Benchmarking; Ice; Image resolution; Motion analysis; Optical resolving power; Orbits; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; AMSR2; Example-based learning; Maximum cross correlations; Motion tracking; Passive microwaves; Polar-orbiting; Super resolution; accuracy assessment; algorithm; AMSR-E; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatial resolution; Radar tracking","AMSR2; example-based learning; maximum cross correlation (MCC); motion tracking; passive microwave; patch redundancy; sea ice; Suomi national polar-orbiting partnership (NPP); super-resolution (SR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028838260"

In this study, we propose an optical flow and super-resolution approach to accurately estimate motion from remote sensing images at a higher spatial resolution than the original data. First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical flow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector field with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical flow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientific and operational applications. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation. The SIC network with an encoder-decoder structure and atrous convolution, is employed to accurately perform the SIC retrieval by considering the characteristics of passive microwave images in the Arctic sea ice region. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Aided SIC estimation approach can generate accurate SIC with more detailed sea ice textures and much sharper sea ice edges. With respect to MODIS SIC products distributed in Arctic scale, the proposed model achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.94% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.04%, whereas the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) SIC results have three and two times greater values of RMSE and MAE.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Decoding; Frequency estimation; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Integrated circuits; Mean square error; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Timing circuits; Arctic sea ice; Arctic sea ice concentration; Convolutional neural network; Microwave FET; Microwave FET integrated circuit; Microwave images; Microwave imaging; Microwave theory and techniques; Passive microwave image; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; Sea ice","Arctic sea ice concentration; convolutional neural networks; passive microwave image; super resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146252936"
