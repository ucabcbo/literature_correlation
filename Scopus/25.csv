In this study, we first assess the ability of IS2 to estimate thermodynamic ice growth and dynamic thickening during the ice-growing season in the central Arctic Ocean. As an indicator of the thermodynamic ice growth, we use 10 thermistor string-based sea ice mass balance array (SIMBA) buoys deployed at a scale of ~50 km from the Icebreaker Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. We collect IS2 data within 20 km buffer distance from the individual buoys, and calculate the mode, median, and mean of the IS2-derived ice thickness. The IS2 modal thickness shows the least bias (−0.169 m) with the buoy ice thickness, representing level ice thickness. In addition, the increasing rate of the IS2 modal thickness is close to the thermodynamic ice growth with a small bias of −0.054 cm/day. However, the increasing rates of the IS2 median and mean thickness are greater than the thermodynamic ice growth by about 0.114 cm/day and 0.198 cm/day, respectively, because they also include ice growth caused by thickness redistribution during dynamic deformation. The dynamic contributions may account for 26.1 ± 10.3% and 34.4 ± 10.1% of the total increase of the IS2 median and mean thickness, respectively. Within a ~ 50 km radius area from the MOSAiC Central Observatory, IS2 measurements exhibit that the ridge fraction increased from <2% in November to ~4% in March (~0.029%/day of average increasing rate) and ridge height increased about 0.047 cm/day during the same period. However, lead formation does not show significant contributions to the dynamic ice thickening because leads are temporary features lasting only 2–3 days. Although there are considerable uncertainties in IS2 ice thickness estimation and IS2-buoy thickness comparison, this study emphasizes the importance of combining measurements by IS2 and SIMBA buoys to explain the regional sea ice mass balance with separating the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Central Department; Indicator indicator; Aneroid altimeters; Buoys; Deformation; Meteorological instruments; Observatories; Remote sensing; Thermodynamics; Thickness measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Ice growth; Ice mass; Ice thickness; Lead; Mass balance; Remote-sensing; Ridge; Satellite altimeter; Sea ice deformations; Sea ice mass balance; data buoy; deformation; growth; habitat mosaic; ice lead; ice ridge; ICESat; remote sensing; sea ice; thermodynamics; Sea ice","Lead; Remote sensing; Ridge; Satellite altimeter; Sea ice deformation; Sea ice mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116189953"

However, the current monitoring techniques could not detect the basic sea ice physical parameters in an automatic and accurate way, which is far away from the needs of marine production and navigation. At present, the most used sea ice monitoring methods based on naked eyes and equipment are time-consuming and labor-expensive. While the methods utilizing satellite remote sensing and radar observation station are highly limited by the accuracy and cost. In this paper, a method integrating image processing and machine learning technologies is proposed to automatically obtain the multi-parameters of sea ice, which include sea ice thickness, density, size distribution, and types. Our experiment results show that the average measurement error of thickness was less than 4 cm, the intensity was 2.8%, the size distribution was 5.8%, and the accuracy rate of type classification was 95%. This method has the advantage of easy operation, high precision, and low cost, which can greatly reduce the risk of manual operation and observation errors.

While these sensors were only placed in operation within the last few years, information from other sensors may assist us with estimating the distribution of sea ice thickness in the Arctic beginning in the 1980s. A previous study found that the age of sea ice is correlated to sea ice thickness from 2003 to 2006, but an extension of the temporal analysis is needed to better quantify this relationship and its variability from year to year. Estimates of the ice age/thickness relationship may allow the thickness record to be extended back to 1985, the beginning of our ice age dataset. Comparisons of ice age and thickness estimates derived from both ICESat (2004-2008) and IceBridge (2009-2015) reveal that the relationship between age and thickness differs between these two campaigns, due in part to the difference in area of coverage. Nonetheless, sea ice thickness and age exhibit a direct relationship when compared on pan-Arctic or regional spatial scales.","Glacial geology; NASA; Remote sensing; Arctic ocean; Arctic sea ice; Area of coverages; Cryosphere; Satellite observations; Sea-ice thickness; Spatial scale; Temporal analysis; Sea ice","Cryosphere; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974844270"

One of approaches to monitor sea ice in large area is microwave remote sensing data analysis. However, ground truth must be necessary to discuss the effectivity of this kind of approach. The conventional method to acquire ground truth of ice thickness is drilling ice layer and directly measuring the thickness by a ruler. However, this method is destructive, time-consuming and limited spatial resolution. Although there are several methods to acquire ice thickness in non-destructive way, ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be effective solution because it can discriminate snow-ice and ice-sea water interface. In this paper, we carried out GPR measurement in Lake Saroma for relatively large area (200m by 300m, approximately) aiming to obtain grand truth for remote sensing data. GPR survey was conducted at 5 locations in the area. The direct measurement was also conducted simultaneously in order to calibrate GPR data for thickness estimation and to validate the result. Although GPR Bscan image obtained from 600MHz contains the reflection which may come from a structure under snow, the origin of the reflection is not obvious. Therefore, further analysis and interpretation of the GPR image, such as numerical simulation, additional signal processing and use of 200MHz antenna, are required to move on thickness estimation. © Authors 2018.

Accurate knowledge of sea ice conditions is therefore becoming increasingly important for reducing the risk and operational cost of human activities in the Arctic. Satellite-based sea ice charting is routinely used for tactical ice management, but the marine sector does not yet make optimal use of sea ice thickness (SIT) or sea ice concentration (SIC) forecasts on weekly timescales. This is because forecasts have not achieved sufficient accuracy, verification and resolution to be used in situations where maritime safety is paramount, and assessing the suitability of forecasts can be difficult because they are often not available in the appropriate format. In this paper, existing SIT forecasts currently available on the Copernicus Marine Service (CMS) or elsewhere in the public domain are evaluated for the first time. These include the seven-day forecasts from the UK Met Office, MET Norway, the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Their forecast skills were assessed against unique in situ data from five moorings deployed between 2016 and 2019 by the Barents Sea Metocean and Ice Network (BASMIN) and Barents Sea Exploration Collaboration (BaSEC) Joint Industry Projects. Assessing these models highlights the importance of data assimilation in short-term forecasting of SIT and suggests that improved assimilation of sea ice data could increase the utility of forecasts for navigational purposes. This study also demonstrates that forecasts can achieve similar or improved correlation with observations when compared to a persistence model at a lead time of seven days, providing evidence that, when used in conjunction with sea ice charts, SIT forecasts could provide valuable information on future sea ice conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

The main goal of this article is to provide a realistic and comprehensive characterization of the sea ice and its snow cover that explains the microwave observations during a whole year using a radiative transfer model. For this purpose, we construct a unique dataset of passive microwave observations, to mimic the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR), along with the active microwave scatterometer data (ASCAT). CIMR database is used to classify sea ice microwave signatures in their spectral dimension with a machine learning technique while ASCAT data are used to help interpret the results of the classification. Classification results are then interpreted with a state-of-art sea ice and Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT) for all highlighted signatures and all seasons. Results make it possible to identify the specific behaviors from the observation co-variabilities for SIC, SIT, and snow structure. Our analysis underlined the role of the depth hoar over multi-year ice, for the interpretation of scattering signals in winter. Scattering signals that appear in late summer are explained by the presence of superimposed ice. This characterization will benefit from future advances in SMRT development, as well as the improved observations of future satellite missions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Learning systems; Meteorological instruments; Microwave devices; Microwaves; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Active microwave; ASCAT; Copernicu imaging microwave radiometer; Microwave observations; Microwave radiative transfer model; Passive microwaves; Radiative transfer modelling; Scatterometers; Sea ice concentration; Snow microwave radiative transfer model; image classification; machine learning; observational method; radiative transfer; scattering; scatterometer; sea ice; snow cover; Snow","ASCAT; CIMR; Classification; Radiometer; Scatterometer; Sea ice; SMRT; Snow","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130189685"

The assimilation is performed by a Local Error Subspace Transform Kalman filter coded in the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework. The new estimates can be generally thought of as combined model and satellite thickness (CMST). It combines the skill of satellite thickness assimilation in the freezing season with the model skill in the melting season, when neither CryoSat-2 nor Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sea ice thickness is available. Comparisons with in situ observations from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project, Ice Mass Balance Buoys, and the NASA Operation IceBridge demonstrate that CMST reproduces most of the observed temporal and spatial variations. Results also show that CMST compares favorably to the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System product and even appears to correct known thickness biases in the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Due to imperfect parameterizations in the sea ice model and satellite thickness retrievals, CMST does not reproduce the heavily deformed and ridged sea ice along the northern coast of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Greenland.

It studies some of the major parameters that cause resistance to the ship movement through sea ice. It aims to optimize a safe ship route in the Antarctic sea ice between Bharati and Maitri (Indian Research Stations in Antarctica) coasts. The study region is divided into grids that results into unique nodes, which are studied for sea ice parameters and wind velocity. Resistances caused due to ice and wind are considered to calculate expected ship velocity between nodes. The calculated ship velocities are then used to estimate durations to cover distances from a node to all the neighboring nodes. It forms a mathematical route from source to destination through various nodes with time as weight that is then optimized through Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain optimal route. Satellite remote sensing data derived sea ice parameters (Scatsat-1 derived sea ice extent and NSIDC sea ice concentration) and modeled wind velocity (from ECMWF) have been used as inputs in this model. Ship parameters of Kapitan Khlebnikov (Russian icebreaker) are used to test and compare the proposed model. Results of model are validated with the actual ship route navigated by the 33rd Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (33ISEA) ship.

L-band radiometry has been shown to provide information on the thickness of thin sea ice. Here, we apply a new emission model that has previously been used to investigate the impact of snow on thick Arctic sea ice. The model has not yet been used to retrieve ice thickness. In contrast to previous SMOS ice thickness retrievals, the new model allows us to include a snow layer in the brightness temperature simulations. Using ice thickness estimations from satellite thermal imagery, we simulate brightness temperatures during the ice growth season 2011 in the northern Baltic Sea. In both the simulations and the SMOS observations, brightness temperatures increase by more than 20 K, most likely due to an increase of ice thickness. Only if we include the snow in the model, the absolute values of the simulations and the observations agree well (mean deviations below 3.5 K). In a second comparison, we use high-resolution measurements of total ice thickness (sum of ice and snow thickness) from an electromagnetic (EM) sounding system to simulate brightness temperatures for 12 circular areas. While the SMOS observations and the simulations that use the EM modal ice thickness are highly correlated (r2=0.95), the simulated brightness temperatures are on average 12 K higher than observed by SMOS. This would correspond to an 8-cm overestimation of the modal ice thickness by the SMOS retrieval. In contrast, if the simulations take into account the shape of the EM ice thickness distributions (r2=0.87), the mean deviation between simulated and observed brightness temperatures is below 0.1 K. © 2015 N.

Long-term year-round, sustained monitoring of this sea-ice cover is, on the one hand, crucial for shipping, off-shore activities, near-coastal transport, and marine safety. On the other hand, it is crucial to better understand recent and predict future sea-ice cover changes-changes which already have an impact on coastal erosion and regional as well as large-scale weather conditions. This chapter deals with observations of the sea-ice cover in the Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean and its changes obtained from data of satellite passive microwave sensors. In addition, ways are presented to monitor polynyas and fast ice by means of microwave, optical, and infrared satellite remote sensing. Polynyas form frequently along the fast-ice cover of the Asian Arctic coast during winter. Their role for the Arctic Ocean sea-ice volume and ocean water mass modification is discussed. Furthermore, methods to estimate sea-ice thickness by means of satellite observations are described and illustrated for thin ice. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Marine safety; Microwave sensors; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Satellites; Ice volumes; Microwave radiometry; Polynya; Sea ice concentration; Sea-ice thickness; Thermal infrared; Sea ice","Microwave radiometry; Polynya; Sea ice; Sea-ice concentration; Sea-ice thickness; Sea-ice volume Fast ice; Thermal infrared; Thin ice","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063457970"

Model fields of air temperature, sea surface temperature and surface wind as well as the surface current fields retrieved from satellite data were used to analyze the main factors influencing the changes in the sea ice area and types. To derive the sea ice characteristics satellite images and measurements of high (Sentinel-1), moderate (MODIS) and low (AMSR2, SMOS) spatial resolution were used. The Arctic portal ensured the instrumental possibility for data visualization to analyze satellite images and geophysical parameter fields of different spatial and temporal resolutions. The verification of the sea ice type structure analysis was done on the bases of the detailed sea ice maps of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, whereas the verification of the sea ice thickness was done using the SMOS estimates. We conclude that intensive North Atlantic cyclones, accompanied by the development of storm winds over the Pechora Sea and by positive air temperature anomalies, are the main reasons for the atypically young sea ice type structure by the end of the winter and for the destruction of the sea ice cover a month earlier than traditionally in mild winters. Presumably, an increase in the number of the North Atlantic cyclones and in their intensity as a result of the Arctic climate changes will lead to sharper changes in the characteristics of the sea ice cover of the Pechora Sea (stronger decrease in the sea ice area and thickness) than for the other regions of the Arctic. © 2021 Russian Academy of Sciences,Department of the Earth Sciences.

An empirical function has been derived from the data, which gives a possibility to access sea ice thickness information stored in the historic dataset of in situ imagery. A similar function has been applied to aerial imagery. The presented approach can be used (1) as fast, non-intrusive method to estimate sea ice thickness in situ; (2) for general circulation model input, validation, ice mass balance estimate; (3) for assessing summer sea ice thickness dynamics from historic data to be used in the context of Arctic change. © 2016 IEEE.","","Arctic; cryospheric change; Melt ponds; remote sensing; sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007439394"

In situ observations needed for validation of remote sensing data and sea-ice models are limited; most have been restricted to a few point measurements on selected ice floes, or to visual shipboard estimates. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) floe-scale maps of sea-ice draft for ten floes, compiled from two springtime expeditions by an autonomous underwater vehicle to the near-coastal regions of the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Wilkes Land sectors of Antarctica. Mean drafts range from 1.4 to 5.5 m, with maxima up to 16 m. We also find that, on average, 76% of the ice volume is deformed ice. Our surveys indicate that the floes are much thicker and more deformed than reported by most drilling and ship-based measurements of Antarctic sea ice. We suggest that thick ice in the near-coastal and interior pack may be under-represented in existing in situ assessments of Antarctic sea ice and hence, on average, Antarctic sea ice may be thicker than previously thought. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A new SIT redistribution algorithm overcomes difficulties related to grids with partial ice and water, and high SIT values.

The difference of monthly SIT from different snow and ice density schemes is smaller than that caused by snow depth.

Undeformed sea ice thickness (SIT) as well as area fractions of open water, melt pond, and sea ice (Aw, Ap, and Ai) were monitored using downward-oriented and oblique-oriented cameras. The results show that SIT varied between 20 and 220 cm throughout the whole cruise, with the average and standard deviation equaling 104.9 and 29.1 cm, respectively. Mean Aw and Ai were 0.52 and 0.44 in the marginal ice zone, respectively, while mean Aw decreased to 0.23 and mean Ai increased to 0.73 in the pack ice zone. Limited variation between 0 and 0.32 in Ap was seen throughout the whole cruise. Shipborne sea ice concentration was then rectified and mapped across a large transect to validate estimates derived from the satellite sensors Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) (25 km) and AMSR2 (25 km). Overestimations were 9.5% and 9.9% for SSMIS and AMSR2 compared with measurements, respectively.

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500-1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500-1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500-1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts. We also describe the remaining questions and challenges to be addressed in advancing to future spaceborne operation of this technology along with recommendations for future research activities. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Aquarius; Satellites; Geophysics; Observatories; Radio interference; Radiometry; Sea ice; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Surface waters; Temperature measurement; Brightness temperature measurement; Emerging technologies; Geophysical properties; Opportunistic sensing; Passive microwave measurements; Radio frequency interference; Spaceborne observations; Surface soil moisture; brightness temperature; microwave imagery; radiometer; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; sea surface salinity; soil moisture; Microwaves","Earth observations; microwave radiometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104256989"

Satellite remote sensing is an effective way to monitor sea-ice drift globally and daily, especially using the wide swaths of passive microwave missions. Since the late 1990s, many algorithms and products have been developed for this task. Here, we investigate how processing sea-ice drift vectors from the intersection of individual swaths of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) mission compares to today's status quo (processing from daily averaged maps of brightness temperature). We document that the ""swath-to-swath""(S2S) approach results in many more (2 orders of magnitude) sea-ice drift vectors than the ""daily map""(DM) approach. These S2S vectors also validate better when compared to trajectories of on-ice drifters. For example, the RMSE of the 24g h winter Arctic sea-ice drift is 0.9g km for S2S vectors and 1.3g km for DM vectors from the 36.5g GHz imagery of AMSR2. Through a series of experiments with actual AMSR2 data and simulated Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) data, we study the impact that geolocation uncertainty and imaging resolution have on the accuracy of the sea-ice drift vectors. We conclude by recommending that a swath-to-swath approach is adopted for the future operational Level-2 sea-ice drift product of the CIMR mission. We outline some potential next steps towards further improving the algorithms and making the user community ready to fully take advantage of such a product. © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic; Varanidae; algorithm; AMSR-E; ice drift; ice thickness; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112177933"

CryoSat-2 along-track SITs, which are converted from freeboard measurements using the model snow depth, and a daily, gridded SMOS SIT product are used in the assimilation to constrain the Arctic sea ice thickness. When using only CryoSat-2 assimilation, SIT forecast fields within the ice pack are greatly improved with respect to independent airborne measurements. However, the positive impacts of CryoSat-2 assimilation in thick ice regions are counteracted by an SIT overestimation in areas of thin ice, due to biased freeboard measurements there. Adding the SMOS assimilation results in much thinner SITs in those regions, which performs better than the control when compared to SIT objective analyses and mooring measurements in the Beaufort and Barents Seas. Furthermore, SMOS assimilation enhances the short-term predictive skill of the marginal sea-ice concentration relative to the control. This is translated into a consistent retreat of the sea-ice covered areas in the 5-day forecasts during March 2017, which is in better agreement with independent ice edge products. This work successfully demonstrates improvements in FOAM sea ice when SIT observations from both CryoSat-2 and SMOS are assimilated, representing an important step towards the operational implementation of SIT assimilation within Met Office forecasting systems. © 2022 Crown Copyright, Met Office.

The method corrects the 2 m air temperature based on the difference between the modeled and the observed IST. Thus the correction includes biases in the surface forcing and the ability of the model to convert incoming parameters at the surface to a net heat flux. A multisensor, daily, gap-free surface temperature analysis has been constructed over the Arctic region. This study revealed challenges estimating the ground truth based on buoys measuring IST, as the quality of the measurement varied from buoy to buoy. With these precautions we find a cold temperature bias in the remotely sensed data, and a warm bias in the modeled data relative to ice mounted buoy temperatures, prior to assimilation. As a consequence, this study weighted the modeled IST and the observed IST equally in the correction. The impact of IST was determined for experiments with and without the assimilation of IST and sea-ice concentration. We find that assimilation of remotely sensed data results in a cooling of IST, which improves the timing of the snow melt onset. The improved snow cover in spring is only based on observations from one buoy, thus additional good quality observations could strengthen the conclusions. The ice cover and the sea-ice thickness are increased, primarily in the experiment without sea-ice concentration assimilation. © 2018.

Sea ice extent and thickness in the NEP decreased annually, which resulted in the navigability of the NEP showing a potential tendency toward improvement in navigability. The navigation period was mainly concentrated in early August to early October. The middle part of the NEP was primarily affected by sea ice. This influence decreased over time, while the navigation period increased, especially in the Vilkitsky Strait, which is a key shipping area. This analysis of sea ice conditions and navigability in the past 20 years could provide a reference for future scientific investigations and aid in merchant ship navigation in the Arctic summer. © 2022 Wuhan University.

To overcome such a limitation, a method of retrieving Arctic basin-scale ice thickness is developed. The physical background of this method is that the scattering optical thickness at microwave frequencies within the freeboard layer is linearly proportional to the physical thickness of the ice freeboard. In this study, we relate the optical thickness estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with ice freeboard estimated from the CryoSat-2 (CS2) by employing a piecewise linear fit. The results show a strong linear relationship between the AMSR2-estimated and CS2-measured ice freeboards with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and bias and RMSE of 0.0001 and 0.04 m, respectively; this evidence suggests that the method can provide Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard with a comparable accuracy level of CS2. The method is also applied to estimate ice freeboard for the periods of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) (1978-1987) and AMSR-E (2002-2011). It is shown that the area-averaged ice freeboard has decreased significantly with the linear trends of 1.5 cm/decade. In addition, there seems to be a change of ice freeboard distributions over the Arctic. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the ice thickness retrieval by using the hydrostatic balance equation, showing that operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval will be possible from satellite passive microwave measurements if a realistic snow depth on sea ice is employed. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Chromium compounds; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Optical properties; Piecewise linear techniques; Radiometers; Sea ice; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Correlation coefficient; Hydrostatic balance; Linear relationships; Linearly proportional; Passive microwave measurements; Satellite passive microwave; Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer; algorithm; AMSR-E; correlation; CryoSat; glacioisostasy; ice thickness; microwave radiation; satellite data; scattering; sea ice; Microwaves","Ice freeboard; Passive microwave remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea ice thickness; Surface emissivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110708417"

An early warning system is desired to discriminate between thin ice of no risk and thick ice with significant challenge. The severity and variability of ice conditions will affect the feasibility of operating in such a region, with significant impact on the design and selection of resources to be used and the ice management requirements to support exploration and development. By measuring the ice thickness, operators can determine the operational risk for ice management operations. In addition, it can help map the areas of thin ice to aid shipping route selection. Despite its fundamental importance, sea ice thickness is one of the most difficult measurements to obtain via remote sensing. Passive remote sensing methods at the near infrared, thermal infrared and visible electromagnetic wavelengths, are restricted due to fog, precipitation, clouds, and Polar darkness. Thus active sensing techniques are deemed to be the only feasible method of measuring ice thickness, especially if they can be mounted in aircraft or satellites. Technical solutions are available to measure the thickness of sea ice, but they do not provide a physical measurement over a wide swath of ice. Thus, the authors are developing a wide swath ice thickness measurement system to fill this gap. The most practical solution for ice thickness measurement is an airborne radar. The authors have completed the preliminary design of a system that will combine an ice penetrating radar with a microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The penetrating radar will be used to glean physical measurements of ice thickness, to be fused with the wide swath SAR to produce an ice thickness map.

Estimating the sea ice thickness is currently the most important issue in the study of sea ice remote sensing. With the Bohai Sea as the study area, a semiempirical model of the sea ice thickness (SEMSIT) that can be used to estimate the thickness of first-year ice based on existing water depth estimation models and hyperspectral remote sensing data according to an optical radiative transfer process in sea ice is proposed. In the model, the absorption and scattering properties of sea ice in different bands (spectral dimension information) are utilized. An integrated attenuation coefficient at the pixel level is estimated using the height of the reflectance peak at 1 088 nm. In addition, the surface reflectance of sea ice at the pixel level is estimated using the 1 550–1 750 nm band reflectance. The model is used to estimate the sea ice thickness with Hyperion images. The first validation results suggest that the proposed model and parameterization scheme can effectively reduce the estimation error associated with the sea ice thickness that is caused by temporal and spatial heterogeneities in the integrated attenuation coefficient and sea ice surface. A practical semi-empirical model and parameterization scheme that may be feasible for the sea ice thickness estimation using hyperspectral remote sensing data are potentially provided. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Bohai Sea; hyperspectral remote sensing; sea ice thickness; semi-empirical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008877641"

Total ice thickness including snow depth (htot) averaged over 2004-2008 is 95 cm. The interannual variability of htot is large; from 77.5 cm (2008) to 110.4 cm (2005). The mode of htot varies from 50-60 cm (2007 and 2008) to 70-80 cm (2005). Ice thickness derived from ICESat data is validated from a comparison with that observed by Electromagnetic Induction Instrument (EM) aboard the icebreaker Soya near Hokkaido, Japan. Annual maps of htot reveal that the spatial distribution of htot is similar every year. Ice volume of 6.3 × 1011 m3 is estimated from the ICESat derived htot and AMSR-E derived ice concentration. A comparison with ice area demonstrates that the ice volume cannot always be represented by the area solely, despite the fact that the area has been used as a proxy of the volume in the Sea of Okhotsk. The ice volume roughly corresponds to that of annual ice production in the major coastal polynyas estimated based on heat budget calculations.

SIT data are based on radar altimetry measurements of sea ice freeboard from the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) and CryoSat-2 (CS2). The CCI-2 SIT has previously been validated with in situ observations from drilling, airborne remote sensing, electromagnetic (EM) measurements and upward-looking sonars (ULSs) from multiple ice-covered regions of the Arctic. Here we present the Laptev Sea CCI-2 SIT record from 2002 to 2017 and use newly acquired ULS and upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sea ice draft (VAL) data for validation of the gridded CCI-2 and additional satellite SIT products. The ULS and ADCP time series provide the first long-term satellite SIT validation data set from this important source region of sea ice in the Transpolar Drift. The comparison of VAL sea ice draft data with gridded monthly mean and orbit trajectory CCI-2 data, as well as merged CryoSat-2-SMOS (CS2SMOS) sea ice draft, shows that the agreement between the satellite and VAL draft data strongly depends on the thickness of the sampled ice. Rather than providing mean sea ice draft, the considered satellite products provide modal sea ice draft in the Laptev Sea. Ice drafts thinner than 0.7m are overestimated, while drafts thicker than approximately 1.3m are increasingly underestimated by all satellite products investigated for this study. The tendency of the satellite SIT products to better agree with modal sea ice draft and underestimate thicker ice needs to be considered for all past and future investigations into SIT changes in this important region. The performance of the CCI-2 SIT CDR is considered stable over time; however, observed trends in gridded CCI-2 SIT are strongly influenced by the uncertainties of ENVISAT and CS2 and the comparably short investigation period. © Author(s) 2020.","Arctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean; Laptev Sea; comparative study; Envisat; ice cover; ice thickness; mooring system; observational method; radar altimetry; sea ice","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089724530"

The associated perennial sea ice loss has economic and global security implications associated with Arctic Ocean navigability, since sea ice cover dictates whether an Arctic route is open to shipping. Thus, understanding changes in sea ice thickness, concentration and drift is essential for operation planning and routing. However, changes in sea ice cover on scales up to a few days and kilometers are challenging to detect and forecast; current sea ice models may not capture quickly-changing conditions on short timescales needed for navigation. Assimilating these predictive models requires frequent, high-resolution morphological information about the pack, which is operationally difficult. We suggest an approach to mitigate this challenge by using machine learning (ML) to interpret satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this study, we derive ML models for the analysis of SAR data to improve short-term local sea ice monitoring at high spatial resolutions, enabling more accurate analysis of Arctic navigability. We develop an algorithm/classifier that can analyze Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the potential to inform operational sea ice forecasting models. We focus on detecting two sea ice features of interest to Arctic navigability: ridges and leads (fractures in the ice shelf). These can be considered local extremes in terms of ice thickness, a crucial parameter for navigation. We build models to detect these ice features using machine learning techniques. Both our ridge and lead detection models perform as well as, if not better than, state-of-the- art methods. These models demonstrate Sentinel-1's ability to capture sea ice conditions, suggesting the potential for Sentinel-1 global coverage imagery to inform sea ice forecasting models.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The resolution of the SIT chart is 1 km and that of the OWSI chart is 250 m. The charts are targeted to be used in development and validation of sea ice products from microwave sensor data. We improve the original MODIS cloud masks for the IST and R data, with a focus on identifying larger cloud-free areas in the data. The SIT estimation from the MODIS IST swath data follows previous studies. The daily SIT chart is composed from available swath charts by assigning daily median SIT to a pixel. The OWSI classification is simply conducted by a fixed threshold for the MODIS band 1 R. This was based on manually selected R data for various ice types in late winter, early melt, and advanced melt conditions. The composition procedures for the daily SIT and OWSI charts somewhat compensates for errors due to the undetected clouds. The SIT and OWSI charts were compared against manual ice charts by Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Russia and by Norwegian Meteorological Institute, respectively, and on average, a good relationship between the charts was found. Pixel-wise comparison of the SIT and OWSI charts showed very good agreement in open water vs. sea ice classification, which gives further confidence on the reliability of our algorithms. We also demonstrate usage of the MODIS OWSI and SIT charts for validation of sea ice concentration charts based on the SENTINEL-1 SAR and AMSR2 radiometer data and two different algorithms. © 2017 by the author.","Graphic methods; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Fixed threshold; Microwave radiometers; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Research institutes; Sea ice classification; Sea ice concentration; Sea-ice thickness; Ice","Microwave radiometer; MODIS; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038208149"

Satellite radar and laser altimetry are currently the most promising tools for sea-ice thickness retrieval. We present qualitative inter-comparisons of winter and spring circum-Antarctic sea-ice thickness computed with different approaches from Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard estimates. We find that approach A, which assumes total freeboard equals snow depth, and approach B, which uses empirical linear relationships between freeboard and thickness, provide the lowest sea-ice thickness and the smallest winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness: A: 0.0 m and 0.04 m, B: 0.17 and 0.16 m, respectively. Approach C uses contemporary snow depth from satellite microwave radiometry, and we derive comparably large sea-ice thickness. Here we observe an unrealistically large winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0.68 m and 0.65 m, respectively, which we attribute to biases in the snow depth. We present a conceptually new approach D. It assumes that the two-layer system (sea ice, snow) can be represented by one layer. This layer has a modified density, which takes into account the influence of the snow on sea-ice buoyancy. With approach D we obtain thickness values and a winter-to-spring increase in average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0.17 m and 0.23 m, respectively, which lay between those of approaches B and C. We discuss retrieval uncertainty, systematic uncertainty sources, and the impact of grid resolution. We find that sea-ice thickness obtained with approaches C and D agrees best with independent sea-ice thickness information-if we take into account the potential bias of in situ and ship-based observations. © 2016 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Microwaves; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Antarctic; Intercomparisons; Laser altimetry; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Ice","Antarctic; Inter-comparison; Laser altimetry; Microwave radiometry; Sea ice; Snow satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992482343"

Here we present a first assessment of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) over individual Arctic sea ice melt ponds with different reflective properties. We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions. Characterizing the complex photon backscatter signals of melt ponds on sea ice is a first step toward automating retrievals of pond parameters such as width, melt pond fraction and depth, and improving higher-level ICESat-2 sea ice height and freeboard products. © 2020.

Measurements at microwave frequencies from radiometers, scatterometers, and synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have the advantage to be independent of clouds and the polar night. Observations in the visual spectrum can have higher spatial resolution and be used during months with daylight to derive additional quantities like the coverage with melt ponds.

The exploitation of the ANR could shorten the navigational distances from North Asia to Northwestern Europe by 40% (about 2500 nautical miles) and reduce one-third (about 10 days) of the time required for maritime transport by the Royal Road, which can help to save lots of transport costs and bring large environmental benefits. It is very important and urgent to accurately understand the changes in the navigability of the ANR for the development of the route. However, due to the lack of high-quality observed dataset, there are very few observation-based studies. Some model-based studies cannot effectively reflect the real changes in the navigability of the ANR, due to the varying degrees of the data quality issues. In this study, we applied the daily sea ice concentration product provided by the NSIDC and the reconstructed daily SMOS sea ice thickness product into the Arctic Transportation Accessibility Model (ATAM) from the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System (AIRSS) to assess and map the daily navigation risks for open water vessels in the ANR from 2010-2017 and further analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of the Autumn navigability of the route during the eight years. Assuming the navigability of a specific ice regime is affected by the sea ice conditions and the ice-breaking ability of the vessels, the ATAM model can quantify the navigability of a specific ice regime for seven different vessel types. Since the SMOS ice thickness product is more reliable in thin ice area (lower than 0.5 m), we only focus on the navigability changes of the ANR for open water vessels. We found that, although the end of shipping season for open water vessels across the ANR has extended to the day of 297±4 (October 24th) since 2010 (excluding 2013), there is no significant trend in the navigability of the ANR for open water vessels in the last 8 years. Further analysis of the spatial distribution map of the navigation risk for open water vessels at the end of shipping season in different years shows that the navigability of the ANR mainly affected by the ice regime around the Eastern Siberian Sea, the Novosibirsk Islands and the Severnaya Zemlya Islands. In most years, it is the earlier frozen ice over the three regions leading to the end of the entire ANR, in the case that most other areas are still safely navigable. We also performed detailed analysis and found that there are significant differences in the navigability changes in the three key straits for open water vessels over the ANR. The Long strait shows great inter-annual variations in the navigability, but has limit impact on the navigability of the entire route because of its late ending of the shipping season. The Sannikov Strait shows the fastest decline, but small inter-annual variations in the navigability. It is also the earliest one that ending the shipping season, and therefore has a great impact on the long-term trend of the navigability of the ANR. The intra- and inter-annual changes in the navigability of the Vlikitsky Strait are very complex. It always fluctuates dramatically, and thus has great impact on the short-term navigability of the entire ANR. In view of the complexity of the change in the ANR navigability, observed high-quality, near real-time sea ice datasets are very important for the quantification of navigation risk in the ASR. © 2019, Science Press.

Sea ice thickness is one of the most important sea ice parameters. Accurately obtaining the sea ice thickness and its changes has great significance to Arctic and global change research. Satellite altimeters can be used to derive long-term and large-scale changes in sea ice thickness. The leads detection is vital in sea ice thickness estimation by using satellite altimetry. Different leads detection methods are compared with remote sensing images, and results show that the detection method that uses waveform parameters can obtain improved results. The model for the conversion of freeboard to thickness is optimized by considering the incomplete penetration of snow for radar altimeters. We derive the estimates of the Arctic sea ice thickness for November 2010 to December 2019 by using the CryoSat-2 altimetry data. The sea ice thickness from the IceBridge and draft data from the upward-looking sonar are used to validate our thickness results. Validations show that the accuracy of our thickness estimates is within 0.2 m. Variations in the Arctic sea ice thickness are analyzed using the PIOMAS model and air and sea surface temperatures.

Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given end user objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modelling, prediction and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess 8 years of sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors on board the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments and Operation IceBridge (OIB), respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice thickness, particularly between ∼40.5 and 4m. Among data compared, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. There is disagreement among the products in terms of the magnitude of the mean thickness trends, especially in spring 2017. Regional comparisons reveal noticeable differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the marginal seas in areas of considerable ship traffic. © 2019 Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; assessment method; AVHRR; climate change; CryoSat; ice thickness; instrumentation; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; sea ice; SMOS; sonar","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064395987"

This is especially true in the polar regions where uncertainties about the interactions between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere are driving ongoing monitoring efforts. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is an European Space Agency (ESA) candidate mission which promises to offer high resolution, low uncertainty observation capabilities at the 1.4, 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz frequencies. To assess the potential impact of CIMR for sea ice parameter retrieval, a comparison is made between retrievals based on present AMSR2 observations and a retrieval using future CIMR equivalent observations over a data set of validated sea ice concentration (SIC) values. An optimal estimation retrieval method (OEM) is used which can use input from different channel combinations to retrieve seven geophysical parameters (sea ice concentration, multi-year ice fraction, ice surface temperature, columnar water vapor, liquid water path, over ocean wind speed, and sea surface temperature). An advantage of CIMR over existing radiometers is that it would provide higher spatial resolution observations at the lower frequency channels (6.9, 10.65, and 18.7 GHz) which are less sensitive to atmospheric influence. This enables the passive microwave based retrieval of SIC and other surface parameters with higher resolution and lower uncertainty than is currently possible. An information content analysis expands the comparison between AMSR2 and CIMR to all retrievable surface and atmospheric parameters. This analysis quantifies the contributions to the observed signal and highlights the differences between different input channel combinations. The higher resolution of the low frequency CIMR channels allow for unprecedented detail to be achieved in Arctic passive microwave sea ice retrievals. The presence of 1.4 GHz channels on board CIMR opens up the possibility for thin sea ice thickness (SIT) retrieval. A combination of collocated AMSR2 and SMOS observations is used to simulate a full CIMR suite of measurements, and the OEM is modified to include SIT as a retrieval parameter. The output from different retrieval configurations is compared with an operational SIT product. The CIMR instrument can provide increased accuracy for SIC retrieval at very high resolutions with a combination of the 18.7 and 36.5 GHz channels while also maintaining sensitivity for atmospheric water vapor retrieval. In combination with the 1.4 GHz channels, SIT can be added as an eighth retrieval parameter with performance on par with existing operational products. © 2020.

Here, we develop an approach to assess the small-scale deformation of landfast ice critical to on-ice operations using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). InSAR has previously proven successful in determining long-term qualitative climatology of ice deformation around on-ice operations, but is now used to explore its potential for providing quantitative guidance for ice road planning, construction, and maintenance. A validation effort using X-band SAR and high-precision GPS data over Elson Lagoon, Alaska, confirms the ability of InSAR to accurately estimate 3-dimensional sea ice strain values accumulated between SAR image acquisitions, using an inverse model. The inverse model was further applied to L-band InSAR data over the Northstar Island ice road near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Assuming an elasto-brittle rheology, the derived strain values yielded a spatial distribution of internal stress consistent with preexisting ice defects and morphology. In several localized regions of the study area, stress values exceeded expected yield stress. Resulting relative fracture intensity potential was shown to conform with local knowledge based on road inspections by engineers, and may be used to guide ice road planning, construction and maintenance efforts. The results presented here demonstrate that InSAR is an accurate tool for estimating landfast ice deformation and stability in support of ice use. The findings may also provide substantial new insights into the mechanics of landfast ice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alaska; Arctic; Elson Lagoon; United States; Deformation; Fracture; Global positioning system; Highway planning; Interferometry; Knowledge based systems; Radar; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Yield stress; ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Ice roads; Land-fast; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; TerraSAR-X; Trafficability; ALOS; fracture; ice thickness; PALSAR; radar interferometry; remote sensing; sea ice; stress; TerraSAR-X; Ice","ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Ice roads; Ice stability; Ice strain; Ice trafficability; Landfast ice; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; TerraSAR-X","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042333714"

Sea-ice density was estimated with three techniques during the second Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem experiment (S1PEX-I1, September-November 2012, East Antarctica). The sea ice was first-year highly deformed, mean thickness 1.2 m with layers, consistent with rafting, and 6-7/10 columnar ice and 3/10 granular ice. Ice density was found to be lower than values (900-920 kg m-3 used previously to derive ice thickness, with columnar ice mean density of 870kg m-3. At two different ice stations the mean density of the ice was 870 and 800 kg m-3, the lower density reflecting a high percentage of porous granular ice at the second station. Error estimates for mass/volume and liquid/solid water methods are presented. With 0.1 m long, 0.1 m core samples, the error on individual density estimates is 28kgm-3 Errors are larger for smaller machined blocks. Errors increase to 46kgm-3 if the liquid/solid volume method is used. The mass/volume method has a low bias due to brine drainage of at least 5%.

The satellite products are based on three different retrieval methods: an energy budget approach, measurements of ice freeboard, and the relationship between passive microwave brightness temperatures and thin ice thickness. Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are -0.48 m and -0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of -0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m. The mean difference between SMOS and CryoSat-2 for 0~1 m thick ice is 0.13 m in March and -0.24 m in October. All satellite-retrieved ice thickness products and PIOMAS overestimate the thickness of thin ice (1 m or less) compared to IceBridge for which SMOS has the smallest bias (0.26 m).

It acts to regulate regional heat and freshwater budgets and subsequent atmospheric and oceanic circulation across the Arctic and at lower latitudes. Satellites have observed a decline in Arctic sea ice extent for all months since 1979. However, to fully understand how changes in the Arctic sea ice cover impact on our global weather and climate, long-term and accurate observations of its thickness distribution are also required. Such observations were made possible with the launch of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) CryoSat-2 satellite in April 2010, which provides unparalleled coverage of the Arctic Ocean up to 88°N. Here we provide an end-to-end, comprehensive description of the data processing steps employed to estimate Northern Hemisphere sea ice thickness and subsequent volume using CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data and complementary observations. This is a sea ice processor that has been under constant development at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) since the early 1990s. We show that there is no significant bias in our satellite sea ice thickness retrievals when compared with independent measurements. We also provide a detailed analysis of the uncertainties associated with our sea ice thickness and volume estimates by considering the independent sources of error in the retrieval. Each month, the main contributors to the uncertainty are snow depth and snow density, which suggests that a crucial next step in Arctic sea ice research is to develop improved estimates of snow loading. In this paper we apply our theory and methods solely to CryoSat-2 data in the Northern Hemisphere. However, they may act as a guide to developing a sea ice processing system for satellite radar altimeter data over the Southern Hemisphere, and from other Polar orbiting missions. © 2017 COSPAR","Aneroid altimeters; Budget control; Data handling; Earth (planet); Meteorological instruments; Orbits; Radar equipment; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Satellites; Snow; Space-based radar; Uncertainty analysis; Arctic; Cryosphere; European Space Agency; Independent measurement; Northern Hemispheres; Oceanic circulations; Sea ice thickness and volumes; Thickness distributions; Sea ice","Arctic; Cryosphere; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034100293"

The scientific objectives of the SMOS mission directly respond to the need for global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, two key variables used in predictive hydrological, oceanographic and atmospheric models. SMOS observations also provide information on vegetation, in particular plant available water and water content in a canopy, drought index and flood risks, surface ocean winds in storms, freeze/thaw state and sea ice and its effect on ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and dynamics affecting large-scale processes of the Earth's climate system.Significant progress has been made over the course of the now 6-year life time of the SMOS mission in improving the ESA provided level 1 brightness temperature and level 2 soil moisture and sea surface salinity data products. The main emphasis of this paper is to review the status of the mission and provide an overview and performance assessment of SMOS data products, in particular with a view towards operational applications, and using SMOS products in data assimilation.SMOS is in excellent technical condition with no limiting factors for operations beyond 2017. The instrument performance fulfils the requirements.

It is a key parameter for the derivation of sea-ice thickness from satellite altimetry. One way to retrieve the basin-scale snow depth on sea ice is by satellite microwave radiometry. There is evidence from measurements and inter-comparison studies that current retrievals likely under-estimate the snow depth over deformed, rough sea ice. We follow up on an earlier study, where satellite passive microwave data were combined with information on the sea-ice topography from the satellite laser altimeter on board the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) in a hybrid approach. Such topography information is spatiotemporally limited because of ICESat's operation mode. In this paper, we aim to derive a proxy for this topography information from satellite microwave radiometry. For this purpose, we co-locate parameters describing the sea-ice deformation taken from visual ship-based observations and the surface elevation standard deviation derived from ICESat laser altimetry with the microwave brightness temperatures (TB) measured via the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer aboard Earth Observation Satellite (AMSR-E) and aboard Global Change Observation Mission-Water 1 (GCOM-W1) (AMSR2). We find that the TB polarization ratio at 6.9 GHz and the TB gradient ratio between 10.7 GHz (horizontal polarization) and 6.9 GHz (vertical polarization), might be suited as such a proxy. Using this proxy, we modify the above-mentioned hybrid approach and compute the snow depths on sea ice from the AMSR-E and AMSR2 data. We compare our snow depths with those of the commonly used approach, the hybrid approach, with the ship-based observations for the years 2002 through 2015 and with the measurements made by drifting buoys for the period of 2014 through 2018. We find a convincing overall agreement with the hybrid approach and some improvement over the common approach. However, our approach is sensitive to the presence of thin ice-here, the retrieved snow depths are too large; and our approach performs sub-optimally over old ice-here, the retrieved snow depths are too small. More investigations and, in particular, more evaluations are required to optimize our approach so that the snow depths retrieved for the combined AMSR-E/AMSR2 period could serve as a data set for sea-ice thickness retrieval based on satellite altimetry. © 2019 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Polarization; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Ships; Snow; Snow melting systems; Topography; AMSR2; Buoy observations; Cryosphere; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Snow depths; Microwaves","AMSR-E; AMSR2; Buoy observations; Marine cryosphere; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; Ship-based observations; Snow depth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073443398"

Forecasts of July sea-ice conditions from initial conditions in May showed substantial improvement in some Arctic regions after adding sea-ice thickness (SIT) data to the model initialization. The SIT initialization also improved seasonal forecasts for years with extremely low summer sea-ice extent.

However, ground truth must be necessary to discuss this kind of approach. Although there are several methods to acquire ice thickness, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can be good solution because it can discriminate snow-ice and ice-sea water interface thanks to comparative higher spatial resolution than the other methods. In this paper, we carried out GPR measurement in brackish lake and an electromagnetic field analysis in order to interpret the GPR data. The simulation model was assumed considering the actual snow and ice thickness acquired in field measurement. From the simulation results, although it seems difficult to identify the reflection at snow and ice interface due to a thin layer thickness and a low dielectric constant, snow and ice thickness may be estimated by using multiple reflection components. © Authors 2019.

It is not easy to extract sea ice thickness information from satellite data. In 2012, the authors have developed a method to detect thin ice area using the brightness temperature data derived from the passive microwave sensor AMSR-E onboard Aqua satellite. The basic algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR-E 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 37GHz V polarization. In May 2012, AMSR2, the successor of AMSR-E, were successfully launched by JAXA on board GCOM-W1 satellite. Recently, the authors have developed a new method to detect thin ice area using brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR2 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 19GHz V polarization. It worked quite well in the Sea of Okhotsk with both AMSR2 and AMSR-E data. The authors have calculated the thin ice distribution in the Sea of Okhotsk from 2003 to 2015 using the new method. The result suggested the reduction trend of total sea ice extent from 2003 to 2015 and the increasing trend of thin ice extent from 2009 to 2015.","Luminance; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Microwave sensors; Polarization; Radiometers; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Temperature; Aqua; Brightness temperatures; GCOM-W1; MODIS; Passive microwave sensors; Passive microwaves; Polarization difference; Sea ice distribution; Ice","Aqua; GCOM-W1; MODIS; Passive microwave radiometer; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964047977"

Two empirical models were developed, one to describe the relationship between the reflectance of visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) imagery and level ice thickness and one to describe the relationship between the backscattering coefficient of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and rough ice thickness. The results showed that the VIS/NIR images were more suitable for distinguishing sea ice from sea water, and the active microwave remote sensing images were suitable for determining the difference between level and rough sea ice. The thickness of the level sea ice was logarithmically related to the VIS/NIR reflectance, and the R2 value of the fitted curve was 0.99 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0 cm. In contrast, the thickness of the rough sea ice was exponentially related to the SAR backscattering coefficient, and the R2 value of the fitted curve was 0.90 with an RMSE of 2.3 cm. The thicknesses of level and rough sea ice were then calculated using the empirical models, and the results reflected the thickness distribution of sea ice in the Bohai Sea.

The primary objectives of ICESat-2 will be to measure ice-sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and global biomass. However, the 6-beam, green-wavelength photon-counting lidar, combined with the 91-day repeat period and near-polar orbit, may provide unique opportunities to measure coastal bathymetry in remote, poorly-mapped areas of the globe. The study focuses on high-probability bottom returns in Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior, acquired during the ""Transit to KPMD"" MABEL mission in August, 2012 at an AGL altitude of 20,000 m. Water-surface and bottom returns were identified and manually classified using MABEL Viewer, an in-house prototype data-explorer web application. Water-surface returns were observed in 12 green channels, and bottom returns were observed in 10 channels. Comparing each channel's mean water-surface elevation to a regional NOAA Nowcast water-level estimate revealed channel-specific elevation biases that were corrected for in our bathymetry estimation procedure. Additionally, a first-order refraction correction was applied to each bottom return. Agreement between the refraction-corrected depth profile and NOAA data acquired two years earlier by Fugro LADS with the LADS Mk II airborne system indicates that MABEL reliably detected bathymetry in depths up to 8 m, with an RMS difference of 0.7 m. In addition to feeding coastal bathymetry models, MABEL (and potentially ICESat-2 ATLAS) has the potential to seed algorithms for bathymetry retrieval from passive, multispectral satellite imagery by providing reference depths. © 2016 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Ice; Lakes; NASA; Optical radar; Orbits; Photons; Refraction; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Search engines; Water levels; ATLAS; Bathymetric lidars; ICESat-2; Keweenah Bay; MABEL; Photon counting; Bathymetry","ATLAS; Bathymetric lidar; ICESat-2; Keweenah Bay; Lake Superio; MABEL; Photon counting lidar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011265349"

Most models default to five thickness categories. However, little has been done to explore the effects of the resolution of this distribution (number of categories) on sea-ice feedbacks in a coupled model framework and resulting representation of the sea ice mean state. Here, we explore this using sensitivity experiments in CESM2 with the standard 5 ice thickness categories and 15 ice thickness categories. Increasing the resolution of the ITD in a run with preindustrial climate forcing results in substantially thicker Arctic sea ice year-round. Analyses show that this is a result of the ITD influence on ice strength. With 15 ITD categories, weaker ice occurs for the same average thickness, resulting in a higher fraction of ridged sea ice. In contrast, the higher resolution of thin ice categories results in enhanced heat conduction and bottom growth and leads to only somewhat increased winter Antarctic sea ice volume. The spatial resolution of the ICESat-2 satellite mission provides a new opportunity to compare model outputs with observations of seasonal evolution of the ITD in the Arctic (ICESat-2; 2018–2021). Comparisons highlight significant differences from the ITD modeled with both runs over this period, likely pointing to underlying issues contributing to the representation of average thickness. © 2022.

The estimation of these parameters mainly relies on satellite based remote sensing, and current retrieval algorithms usually focus on the retrieval of a single parameter under simple assumptions over the other. In this article, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth through the data synergy two types of concurrent observations of the sea ice cover: the active altimetry and the L-band passive remote sensing. The data synergy is based on two physical constrains: (1) L-band (1.4 GHz) radiation model for the sea ice cover, and (2) the hydrostatic equilibrium as used in satellite altimetry. Two schemes of data synergy are proposed: (1) the synergy between L-band brightness temperature (TB) from passive microwave remote sensing and sea ice freeboard (FBice) as measured by radar altimetry, and (2) the synergy between L-band TB and snow freeboard (FBsnow) as measured by laser altimetry. Based on retrievability studies, we show that both parameters can be retrieved using the two sets of data. Specifically, we show that there is potential problem of ill-posedness for the synergy between L-band TB and FBsnow, with two possible retrieval solutions for a small portion of the solution space. On the other hand, the synergy between L-band TB and FBice is always well-posed. In terms of sensitivity, lower uncertainty is witnessed for thin ice for the retrieval with FBice, while the retrieval with FBsnow shows advantage for thick ice. Besides the input parameters of TB, FBice and FBsnow, the uncertainty associated with certain model parameters such as snow and ice densities is not negligible for the uncertainty estimation of the retrieved parameters. Verification is carried out with observational data from Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns and SMOS satellite, showing that both sea ice thickness and snow depth can be attained by the proposed retrieval algorithms. These algorithms serve as the basis for large-scale retrieval with satellite remote sensing data, including concurrent observation of the Arctic Ocean by independent satellite campaigns such as SMOS, CryoSat-2 and ICESat. © 2017 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Climate change; Luminance; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Space optics; Temperature; Altimetry; Brightness temperatures; Hydrostatic equilibrium; L-band passive microwave remote sensing; Passive microwave remote sensing; Passive remote sensing; Retrieval; Satellite remote sensing data; Ice","Altimetry; Brightness temperature; Passive microwave remote sensing; Retrieval; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032878733"

Monitoring the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice can provide crucial information for ice disaster prevention for marine transportation, oil field operation, and regional climate change studies. Although these satellite data cover the study area with fairly high spatial resolution, their typically limited cloudless images pose serious restrictions for continuous observation of short-term dynamics, such as sub-seasonal changes. In this study, high spatiotemporal resolution (500 m and eight images per day) geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data with a high proportion of cloud-free images were used to monitor the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice, including area and thickness. An object-based feature extraction method and an albedo-based thickness inversion model were used for estimating sea ice area and thickness, respectively. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new dataset, a total of 68 GOCI images were selected to analyze the evolution of sea ice area and thickness during the winter of 2012-2013 with severe sea ice conditions. The extracted sea ice area was validated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with higher spatial resolution, and the estimated sea ice thickness was found to be consistent with in situ observation results. The entire sea ice freezing-melting processes, including the key events such as the day with the maximum ice area and the first and last days of the frozen season, were better resolved by the high temporal-resolution GOCI data compared with MODIS or AVHRR data. Both characteristics were found to be closely correlated with cumulative freezing/melting degree days. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the GOCI data as an improved dataset for studying the Bohai Sea ice, particularly for purposes that require high temporal resolution data, such as sea ice disaster monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; AVHRR; extraction method; GOCI; ice thickness; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; monitoring; Northern Hemisphere; regional climate; remote sensing; resolution; satellite data; sea ice; spatial resolution","Bohai Sea; Geostationary ocean color imager; Ocean remote sensing; Sea ice monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060969602"

Accurate snow depth is a precondition for representing thermodynamic processes in sea-ice systems and is helpful for estimating sea-ice thickness. To better apply Arctic snow-depth products released by different organizations, we compared four kinds of snow-depth products based on three kinds of passive microwave (PM) sensors and evaluated them against the snow depth measured by ice mass-balance buoys (IMB snow depth) and Operation Ice Bridge airborne snow radar (OIB snow depth). The results show that the snow depths from the product released by the University of Bremen (UB) are larger than those by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), with an average difference of 10 cm. Comparing the PM remote-sensing snow depths released by UB, NSIDC and NASA against IMB and OIB snow depths, it is found that NSIDC AMSR-E snow-depth product has the highest accuracy. Although these PM remote-sensing snow-depth products released by different organizations differ in accuracy, they all reflect the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of snow depth on Arctic sea ice. These comparisons and analysis of snow-depth products from different sensors released by different organizations provide a basis for further investigation of Arctic sea-ice thickness estimation and benefit the studies of Arctic sea ice and climate change. © 2019 C.

The investigation on the accelerated decline in the Arctic sea-ice was performed using different datasets of passive microwave satellite imagery and model reanalysis. Arctic sea-ice declined rapidly in the boreal summer (-10.2 ± 0.8 %decade−1) during 1979–2018, while, the highest decline in sea-ice extent (SIE) (i.e., 82,300 km2 yr−1/-12.8 ± 1.1 %decade−1) is reported in the month of September. Since late 1979, the SIE recorded the sixth-lowest decline during September 2018 (4.71 million km2). Incidentally, the records of twelve lowest extents in the satellite era occurred in the last twelve years. The loss of SIE and sea-ice concentration (SIC) are attributed to the impacts of land-ocean warming and the northward heat advection into the Arctic Ocean. This has resulted in considerable thinning of sea-ice thickness (SIT) and reduction in the multiyear ice (MYI) for summer 2018. Global and Arctic land-ocean temperatures have increased by ~0.78 °C and ~3.1 °C, respectively, over the past 40 years (1979–2018) while substantial warming rates have been identified in the Arctic Ocean (~3.5 °C in the last 40-year) relative to the Arctic land (~2.8 °C in the last 40-year). The prevailing ocean-atmospheric warming in the Arctic, the SIE, SIC and SIT have reduced, resulting in the decline of the sea-ice volume (SIV) at the rate of -3.0 ± 0.2 (1000 km3 decade−1). Further, it observed that the SIV in September 2018 was three times lower than September 1979. The present study demonstrates the linkages of sea-ice dynamics to ice drifting and accelerated melting due to persistent low pressure, high air-ocean temperatures, supplemented by the coupled ocean-atmospheric forcing. © 2020","","Arctic sea-ice; Atmospheric science; Climate change; Earth sciences; Environmental science; Global temperature; Multiyear ice; Natural hazards; Oceanography; Sea-ice thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089352859"

The primary instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the distance from the spacecraft to the earth's surface via the roundtrip travel time of individual laser pulses. GLAS utilized pulsed lasers and a direct detection receiver consisting of a silicon avalanche photodiode and a waveform digitizer. Early in the mission, the peak power of the received signal from snow and ice surfaces was found to span a wider dynamic range than anticipated, often exceeding the linear dynamic range of the GLAS 1064-nm detector assembly. The resulting saturation of the receiver distorted the recorded signal and resulted in range biases as large as ∼50 cm for ice- and snow-covered surfaces. We developed a correction for this ""saturation range bias"" based on laboratory tests using a spare flight detector, and refined the correction by comparing GLAS elevation estimates with those derived from Global Positioning System surveys over the calibration site at the salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Applying the saturation correction largely eliminated the range bias due to receiver saturation for affected ICESat measurements over Uyuni and significantly reduced the discrepancies at orbit crossovers located on flat regions of the Antarctic ice sheet. © 2017 IEEE.","Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Bolivia; Aneroid altimeters; Detectors; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Laser beams; NASA; Optical radar; Orbits; Pulsed lasers; Radio altimeters; Receivers (containers); Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Signal receivers; Snow; Surface emitting lasers; Surface waves; Travel time; Ice sheet; Laser altimetry; Laser ranging; Measurement by laser beam; Optical surface waves; correction; GLAS; GPS; ice sheet; ICESat; lidar; measurement method; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite laser ranging; spacecraft; travel time; Ice","Ice sheets; laser ranging; lidar; remote sensing; satellite laser altimetry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028823003"

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences. ©2019 IEEE","3D modeling; Lakes; Radar theory; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Solar radiation; Space-based radar; Thickness measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Amplitude information; Antarctic sea ice; Changing climate; Fraction measurements; Multiple frequency; Reflected signal; Satellite mission; Sea-ice thickness; Radar measurement","Antarctic; Arctic; Bistatic radar; Numerical solution; Reflectometry; Satellite missions; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101994742"

It is also the most important content in remote sensing monitoring of sea ice. In this study, a practical model of sea ice thickness (PMSIT) was proposed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In the proposed model, the MODIS data of the first band were used to estimate sea ice thickness and the difference between the second-band reflectance and the fifth-band reflectance in the MODIS data was calculated to obtain the difference attenuation index (DAI) of each pixel. The obtained DAI was used to estimate the integrated attenuation coefficient of the first band of the MODIS at the pixel level. Then the model was used to estimate sea ice thickness in the Bohai Sea with the MODIS data and then validated with the actual sea ice survey data. The validation results showed that the proposed model and corresponding parameterization scheme could largely avoid the estimation error of sea ice thickness caused by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sea ice extinction and allowed the error of 18.7% compared with the measured sea ice thickness. © 2018, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; heterogeneity; ice thickness; MODIS; parameterization; pixel; reflectance; remote sensing; sea ice","Bohai Sea; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); practical model; sea ice thickness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049801668"

Traditional direct thickness measurements with meter sticks can provide accurate but only spot information, referred to as “needles” due to their pinpoint focus and information, while airborne and satellite remote sensing snow products, referred to as “the haystack,” have large uncertainties due to their scale. We demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and applicability of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) snow thickness measurements by comparing them with in situ meter stick data from two field campaigns to Antarctica in late winter/early spring. The efficiency and millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy of GPR enables practitioners to acquire extensive, semiregional data with the potential to upscale needles to the haystack and to potentially calibrate satellite remote sensing products that we confirm to derive roughly 30% of the in situ thickness. We find the radar wave propagation velocity in snow to be rather constant (± 6%), encouraging regional snow thickness surveys.

A radiative transfer model is used to create lookup tables of the circularly polarized thermal emissions of first-year (FY) and multiyear (MY) sea ice, and the performance of two distinct retrieval methods is examined. The first method retrieves only sea-ice thicknesses, while the second retrieves both ice thickness and ice salinity. Retrieval errors are simulated for both FY and MY sea ice as a function of ice thickness, salinity, and temperature to investigate the impact of radiometric uncertainty, the frequency channels used, and any errors in ancillary information. To gain further insight into Arctic scale retrieval performance, a simulated brightness temperature dataset is produced for Arctic sea ice for the period October 2020-March 2021 using sea-ice thicknesses from the SMOS-CryoSat-2 algorithm. Compared to existing sea-ice thickness retrievals obtained from 1.4-GHz microwave radiometers, the results demonstrate that 0.5-2-GHz radiometry can achieve higher sensitivity to a sea-ice thickness within the range 0.5-1.5 m for FY sea ice and enable the retrieval of multiple sea-ice parameters (thickness and salinity) simultaneously.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Information retrieval; Microwave devices; Radiative transfer; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Table lookup; Timing circuits; Arctic sea ice; Frequency channels; Microwave radiometry; Ocean temperature; Performance; Remote-sensing; Salinity (geophysical); Sea ice salinity; Sea-ice thickness; ice thickness; nadir; radiative transfer; radiometer; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; Microwaves","Microwave radiometry; radiative transfer; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128694932"

In this study we present a Lagrangian approach to quantify summer sea ice melt in which multiyear ice (MYI) floes that were surveyed by airborne electromagnetic thickness sounding within Nares Strait during summer were backtracked, using satellite imagery, to a region in close proximity (3–20 km) to spring ice thickness surveys carried out in the Lincoln Sea. Typical modal total MYI thicknesses, including ~0.4-m snow, ranged between 3.9 and 4.7 m in the Lincoln Sea during April. Ice-only modal thicknesses were between 2.2 and 3.0 m in Nares Strait during August. Total thinning including snow and ice was 1.3 ± 0.1 m including 0.4 ± 0.09 m of snow melt and 0.9 ± 0.2 m of ice melt.

Furthermore, our approach provides an improvement on traditional ice mass balance buoy estimates because it integrates melt over larger spatial scales, where melt can be highly variable due to differential melt experienced between melt ponds, bare ice, hummocks, and ridges.                          ©2018.

Using the DMS and reflectivity of ATM L1B, leads are detected to define local sea level height. The total freeboard is then obtained and converted to ice thickness. The estimated mean sea-ice thickness values are found to be in the 0.48-0.99 m range. Along the N-S track, sea ice was thinner southward rather than northward of the fluxgate, resulting in two peaks of modal thickness: 0.35 m (south) and 0.7 m (north). This supports that new ice produced in coastal polynyas is transported northward by katabatic winds off the ice-shelf. The lowest (2%) elevation method used for freeboard retrieval for ICESat is also tested for ATM data. It is found that the lowest elevation method tends to overestimate freeboard, but mean values are less affected than mode values. Using mean thickness values of ICESat and ATM along the 'fluxgate', separating the shelf from the deep ocean, the exported ice volume at this 'fluxgate' is found to be higher during the ICESat years (2003-2008) than during the IceBridge year (2013).

Their persistence is threatened by the rapid loss of sea ice from the Arctic Ocean due to climate change, but this threat will be at least partially offset by the replacement of multiyear ice (MYI) with first-year ice (FYI). FYI is thinner and usually features a thinner snow cover than MYI, thus transmitting more light to support ice algal growth. We combined remote sensing, reanalysis data, and modeling products with a radiative transfer model to assess how the changing physical conditions in the Arctic altered the extent and duration of the bottom ice algal habitat over a 34-year period. Habitat was defined as areas where enough light penetrates to the bottom ice to support net positive photosynthesis. The Arctic shifted from 37% FYI in 1985 to 63% in 2018, as the 2.0 × 106 km2 increase in FYI extent outpaced the 0.6 × 106 km2 decrease in overall sea ice extent above the Arctic Circle. The proliferation of younger ice corresponded with a 0.08 m decade-1 decrease in average sea ice thickness and a 0.003 m decade-1 decrease in average snow depth. The end of the ice algal season, marked by the onset of warm summer air temperatures, moved slightly earlier, by 1.4 days decade-1. Our analysis indicates that ice algal habitat extent increased by 0.4 × 106 km2 decade-1, or from 48% to 66% of total sea ice extent. The average ice algal growing season also lengthened by 2.4 days and shifted earlier in the year. Together, these trends suggest that net primary production in Arctic sea ice increased during 1985-2018. The most dramatic changes were localized in the Central Basin and the Chukchi Sea and were driven primarily by the declining snow cover and the shift from MYI to FYI. Although the Arctic recently became more favorable to ice algae, we expect that this trend will not continue indefinitely, as a limited amount of MYI remains. © 2022 The Author(s)","Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; climate change; growing season; ice thickness; microalga; net primary production; radiative transfer; sea ice; snow cover; time series analysis","Arctic Ocean; Climate change; Microalgae; Primary producers; Sea ice; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145448581"

The space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer from Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. is China's first commercial GNSS-R instrument. On July 3, 2021, this payload was equipped on the Jilin-1 wide-range 01B satellite (J1-01B) developed by Changguang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. and entered the polar orbit with the height about 500km from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.The attitude of J1-01B is stable to the ground within 0.1 degrees, which can guarantee the high accuracy of GNSS-R antenna gain model on the detection of sea surface wind speed and direction, soil moisture and etc. Meanwhile, its orbital characteristics ensure that its trajectory can cover the north and south poles of the earth, providing opportunities for researches on sea-ice detection and sea-ice thickness retrieval. The payload supports the mutual switching between dual system (GPS L1 or BDS B1) signal mode and dual working mode (generate the doppler delay maps (DDM) in manual-adjustable resolution on the satellite, or collect intermediate frequency (IF) data with 58Mb/s rate), which guarantees the verification and continuous development of multi-system compatibility, data quality analysis and application scenario expansion.After two weeks of satellite's launch, the satellite has entered normal working mode. In two periods from 6:0 to 6:15 and from 7:32 to 7:42 on July 16, 2021, GNSS-R data were collected in DDMs as well as IFs formats, when J1-01B was over the Pacific Ocean. And L1a DDMs with the horseshoe shape were generated with correction from raw DDMs, as well as from IFs.The GNSS-R instrument on the Jilin-1 wide 01B satellite is an important component of the Yunyao constellation plan, which would provide rich and stable data, and be an important role in global and regional exploration in aerospace, meteorology, ocean, earthquake and other fields.  © 2021 IEEE.","Antennas; Communication satellites; Global positioning system; Orbits; Reflection; Reflectometers; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Sea level; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Wind; Aerospace technologies; Global navigation satellite system; Global navigation satellite system reflectometry; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Reflectometry; Remote sensing missions; Remote-sensing; Satellite launches; Wind speed and directions; Remote sensing","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS); GNSS Reflectometry; Hydrology; Remote Sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123616171"

ERA-20C performance over Arctic sea ice is assessed by comparisons with measurements and data from other reanalyses. ERA-20C performs similarly with respect to the annual cycle of downwelling radiation, air temperature, and wind speed compared to reanalyses with more extensive data assimilation such as ERA-Interim and MERRA. PIOMAS-20C sea ice thickness and volume are then compared with in situ and aircraft remote sensing observations for the period of ~1950-2010. Error statistics are similar to those for PIOMAS. We compare the magnitude and patterns of sea ice variability between the first half of the twentieth century (1901-40) and the more recent period (1980-2010), both marked by sea ice decline in the Arctic. The first period contains the so-called early-twentieth-century warming (ETCW; ~1920-40) during which the Atlantic sector saw a significant decline in sea ice volume, but the Pacific sector did not. The sea ice decline over the 1979-2010 period is pan-Arctic and 6 times larger than the net decline during the 1901-40 period. Sea ice volume trends reconstructed solely from surface temperature anomalies are smaller than PIOMAS-20C, suggesting that mechanisms other than warming, such as changes in ice motion and deformation, played a significant role in determining sea ice volume trends during both periods. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Arctic Ocean; Earth atmosphere; Error statistics; Remote sensing; Wind; Arctic; Comparisons with measurements; Model based reconstruction; Model evaluation/performance; Reanalysis; Sea ice thickness and volumes; Ship observations; Surface temperature anomalies; arctic environment; atmosphere-ice-ocean system; data assimilation; downwelling; ice cover; performance assessment; reconstruction; sea ice; spatial variation; temperature anomaly; temporal variation; Sea ice","Arctic; Atmosphere; Model evaluation/performance; Reanalysis data; Sea ice; Ship observations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063970894"

To make the best use of these observations, in this paper we develop a multi-sensor optimal data merging (MODM) method to merge any number of different sea ice observations. Since such merged data are independent on model forecast, they are valid for model initialization and model validation. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation theory, we prove that any model assimilated with the merged data is equivalent to assimilating the original multi-sensor data. This greatly facilitates sea ice data assimilation, particularly for operational forecast with limited computational resources. We apply the MODM method to merge sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice thickness (SIT), respectively, in the Arctic. For SIC merging, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data are merged together with the Norwegian Ice Service ice chart. This substantially reduces the uncertainties at the ice edge and in the coastal areas. For SIT merging, the daily Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data is merged with the weekly-mean merged CryoSat-2 and SMOS (CS2SMOS) data. This generates a new daily CS2SMOS SIT data with better spatial coverage for the whole Arctic. © 2020, Editorial Office of Advances in Polar Science.

In addition to providing sea ice forecasts for disaster prevention and risk mitigation, sea ice numerical models could help explain the sea ice variability within the context of climate change in marine ecosystems, such as spotted seals, which are the only ice-dependent animal that breeds in Chinese waters. Here, we developed NEMO-Bohai, an ocean-ice coupled model based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model version 4.0 and Sea Ice Modelling Integrated Initiative (SI3) (NEMO4.0-SI3) for the Bohai Sea. This study will present the scientific design and technical choices of the parameterizations for the NEMO-Bohai model. The model was calibrated and evaluated with in situ and satellite observations of the ocean and sea ice. The model simulations agree with the observations with respect to sea surface height (SSH), temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), currents, and temperature and salinity stratification. The seasonal variation of the sea ice area is well simulated by the model compared to the satellite remote sensing data for the period of 1996-2017. Overall agreement is found for the occurrence dates of the annual maximum sea ice area. The simulated sea ice thickness and volume are in general agreement with the observations with slight overestimations. NEMO-Bohai can simulate seasonal sea ice evolution and long-term interannual variations. Hence, NEMO-Bohai is a valuable tool for long-term ocean and ice simulations and climate change studies. © 2022 The Author(s).","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; climate change; ice thickness; ice-ocean interaction; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea surface height; spatial resolution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125172267"

Their precise detection is crucial for altimetric estimations of sea ice thickness and volume. This study evaluates the performance of the SARAL/AltiKa (Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa) altimeter to detect leads and to monitor their spatio-temporal dynamics. We show that a pulse peakiness parameter (PP) used to detect leads by Envisat RA-2 and ERS-1,-2 altimeters is not suitable because of saturation of AltiKa return echoes over the leads. The signal saturation results in loss of 6–10% of PP data over sea ice. We propose a different parameter—maximal power of waveform—and define the threshold to discriminate the leads. Our algorithm can be applied from December until May. It detects well the leads of small and medium size from 200 m to 3–4 km.

Such missions (e.g., ERS, Envisat, ICESat, CryoSat-2) are based on the conversion of freeboard into thickness by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Freeboard, the height of the ice above the water level, is therefore a crucial parameter. Freeboard is a relative quantity, computed by subtracting the instantaneous sea surface height from the sea-ice surface elevations. Hence, the impact of geophysical range corrections depends on the performance of the interpolation between subsequent leads to retrieve the sea surface height, and the magnitude of the correction. In this study, we investigate this impact by considering CryoSat-2 sea-ice freeboard retrievals in autumn and spring. Our findings show that major parts of the Arctic are not noticeably affected by the corrections. However, we find areas with very low lead density like the multiyear ice north of Canada, and landfast ice zones, where the impact can be substantial. In March 2015, 7.17% and 2.69% of all valid CryoSat-2 freeboard grid cells are affected by the ocean tides and the inverse barometric correction by more than 1 cm.

For northern communities, it is a central part of culture, community, and livelihood. Recent changes in Arctic climate have led to greater unpredictability in sea ice conditions, making travel and hunting more hazardous, particularly during the dynamic freeze-up and break-up periods. If the recent trend of warmer Arctic winters is an indication of future climatic conditions, sea ice will become increasingly more dangerous for travel, especially for inexperienced travellers, and traditional knowledge of safe routes based on past climatic conditions will become less reliable. For northern resource industries (e.g., mining) and maritime shipping, the presence of sea ice represents added operational risk, particularly where shipping routes overlap with community on-ice travel routes, making route planning in these coastal areas less predictable and increasing the potential for delay and additional costs. Furthermore, northern resource extractive industries are expected to grow significantly in the future, leading to increased year-round shipping and greater potential for conflicting sea-ice use. The key to decreasing conflicts and ensuring safe and efficient winter travel for both local communities and industry is the timely availability of information describing sea ice conditions, at the relevant spatial scales, presented in a format that is appropriate for each user group. SmartICE represents a community-government-university-industry collaboration that integrates adapted technology, remote sensing, and Inuit Knowledge to promote safe travel for all stakeholders in northern coastal environments. The main elements of the SmartICE information system are: (i) A network of automated in situ sensors that measure sea-ice thickness and other characteristics; (ii) Repeat satellite imagery from which sea-ice surface conditions (e.g., concentration, roughness, water content) are mapped following user-defined classification systems; and (iii) Information technology that integrates the in situ and remotely sensed sea-ice data to generate raw and processed digital products that match the needs of user groups, from ice navigation managers to Inuit ice experts to recreational ice users. While community participation in SmartICE is key to addressing local needs and conditions, the program is intended to augment and integrate Inuit sea-ice knowledge, not replace it. Development and validation of the SmartICE technology and information system involve a multi-stage approach with simultaneous development of the ice monitoring technology and the Inuit-based ice type classification and remote sensing. The Nunatsiavut Government is a principal partner in SmartICE and our first phase of community sea-ice workshops, sea-ice classification and field truthing, sensor deployment and system validation is taking place in the Nunatsiavut communities of Nain and Rigolet. Nain is located to the north of Vale NL's Voisey's Bay mine site where winter ore shipping cuts a regular track through the coastal sea ice. Rigolet and a third study community, North West River, are located at the mouth and head of Lake Melville, respectively, an 150-km-long estuary that drains major rivers, including the Churchill River, to the Labrador Sea. Lake Melville sea ice is regularly used for subsistence harvesting and travel during winter and spring months. During the 2013/14 sea-ice season, workshops with sea-ice specialists were held in Nain and North West River. Sea-ice types deemed locally important for making decisions about on-ice travel were identified. Categories common to both communities included: rough ice (either due to ice or hard pack snow), smooth ice (again, due to a surface of ice or snow), open water, and water on-ice. Pack ice and the shear zone with landfast ice were only identified in Nain. The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) and C-CORE (through Polarview) provided high-resolution imagery for sea-ice classification. In addition, CIS have given full access to coarse resolution operational images. The sea-ice specialists in Nain and North West River have collected on-ice observations concurrent with image acquisition. Development of the sea-ice classification process is ongoing. SmartICE is developing two in situ sea-ice monitoring device types. Type 1, based on thermistor technology, will be deployed in the ocean prior to freeze-up and left in place until after breakup. Device prototypes were environmentally tested during the 2013-14 sea-ice season. Non-destructive ultrasonic sensor technologies are currently being explored for Type 2 devices, which will be deployed onto the ice surface. © 2014 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Coastal zones; Information systems; Information use; Knowledge management; Lakes; Marine radar; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Ships; Snow; Stream flow; Ultrasonic testing; Canadian subarctic; Coastal sea ices; Ice remote sensing; Industry-government collaboration; Inuit Knowledge; Labrador; Nunatsiavut; Radar remote sensing; safe winter ice travel; Sea ice classification; Sea-ice thickness; Sea ice","Canadian subarctic; coastal sea ice; community sea ice; in situ sea ice thickness; Inuit Knowledge; Labrador; marine shipping; Nunatsiavut; radar remote sensing; safe winter ice travel; sea ice classification; sea ice information system; sea ice remote sensing; university community industry government collaboration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921725035"

Large-scale active and passive remote sensing is the basis for the estimation of these parameters. In traditional altimetry or the retrieval of snow depth with passive microwave remote sensing, although the sea ice thickness and the snow depth are closely related, the retrieval of one parameter is usually carried out under assumptions over the other. For example, climatological snow depth data or as derived from reanalyses contain large or unconstrained uncertainty, which result in large uncertainty in the derived sea ice thickness and volume. In this study, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth using the concurrent active altimetry and passive microwave remote sensing of the sea ice cover. Specifically, laser altimetry and L-band passive remote sensing data are combined using two forward models: the L-band radiation model and the isostatic relationship based on buoyancy model. Since the laser altimetry usually features much higher spatial resolution than L-band data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, there is potentially covariability between the observed snow freeboard by altimetry and the retrieval target of snow depth on the spatial scale of altimetry samples. Statistically significant correlation is discovered based on high-resolution observations from Operation IceBridge (OIB), and with a nonlinear fitting the covariability is incorporated in the retrieval algorithm. By using fitting parameters derived from large-scale surveys, the retrievability is greatly improved compared with the retrieval that assumes flat snow cover (i.e., no covariability). Verifications with OIB data show good match between the observed and the retrieved parameters, including both sea ice thickness and snow depth. With detailed analysis, we show that the error of the retrieval mainly arises from the difference between the modeled and the observed (SMOS) L-band brightness temperature (TB). The narrow swath and the limited coverage of the sea ice cover by altimetry is the potential source of error associated with the modeling of L-band TB and retrieval. The proposed retrieval methodology can be applied to the basin-scale retrieval of sea ice thickness and snow depth, using concurrent passive remote sensing and active laser altimetry based on satellites such as ICESat-2 and WCOM. © Author(s) 2018.","algorithm; altimetry; brightness temperature; data assimilation; ice thickness; ICESat; laser method; methodology; parameter estimation; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; SMOS; snow cover","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044287492"

Due to the interference between the signal components from the air-ice and ice-water interfaces, the reflection coefficient experiences an oscillating pattern versus elevation angle so that detecting sea ice using the power or amplitude of the reflected global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal has to choose a suitable satellite to reduce the influence of the oscillating pattern. A sea ice surface is more stable and presents higher correlation than a dynamic ocean surface, this article explores the potential of detecting and measuring sea ice using the coherency of reflected GNSS signal for coastal scenario. Experimental results show that phase coherency can significantly detect sea ice without strictly limiting elevation and azimuth angle. This article also is to is to explore the potential of retrieving sea ice thickness using the oscillating phase pattern versus elevation angle. The phase compensation and the dual-polarization observation are proposed to remove the delay phase between the direct and reflected signal from the estimated phase of the reflected GNSS signal. The results show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating phase pattern, respectively, have an inversely proportional and positively linear relationship with sea ice thickness. Simulation shows that, compared to the oscillating amplitude, the oscillating frequency is a better choice to measure sea ice thickness. The frequency of the dual-polarization oscillating pattern could provide the measurement performance with a root-mean-square error of 0.05 m.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Communication satellites; Phase interfaces; Polarization; Reflection; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Surface waters; Atmospheric modeling; Coastal global navigation satellite systemreflectometry; Correlation time; Dual-polarizations; Dualpolarization observation; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Global navigation satellites; Ice detection; Phase compensation; Random Walk; Random walk test; Sea ice detection; Sea measurements; Sea surfaces; Sea-ice thickness; Walk tests; azimuth; computer simulation; detection method; GNSS; ice thickness; numerical model; sea ice; Global positioning system","Coastal global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R); correlation time; dual-polarization observation; phase compensation; random walk test; sea ice detection; sea ice thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121361865"

Since current satellite and field observations for sea ice thickness are limited in time and space, the use of PIOMAS is expected to fill the gap by providing temporally continued ice thickness fields. Calculated monthly volume flux exhibits a prominent annual cycle with the peak record in March (roughly 145 km3/month) and the trough in August (10 km3/month). Annual ice volume flux (1 132 km3) is primarily attributable to winter (October through May) outflow (approximately 92%). Uncertainty in annual ice volume export is estimated to be 55 km3 (or 5.7%). Our results also verified the extremely large volume flux appearing between late 1980s and mid- 1990s. Nevertheless, no clear trend was found in our volume flux results. Ice motion is the primary factor in the determination of behavior of volume flux. Ice thickness presented a general decline trend may partly enhance or weaken the volume flux trend. Ice concentration exerted the least influences on modulating trends and variability in volume flux. Moreover, the linkage between winter ice volume flux and three established Arctic atmospheric schemes were examined. Compared to NAO, the DA and EOF3 mechanism explains a larger part of variations of ice volume flux across the strait. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Fram Strait; PIOMAS; remote sensing; sea ice volume flux","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008895453"

However, due to the differences in footprint sizes and noise levels of the measurement techniques, as well as sea ice's variability across scales, it is challenging to carry out inter-comparison or consistently study these observations. In this study we focus on the remote sensing of sea ice thickness parameters and carry out the following: (1) the analysis of variability and its statistical scaling for typical parameters and (2) the consistency study between airborne and satellite measurements. By using collocating data between Operation IceBridge and CryoSat-2 (CS-2) in the Arctic, we show that consistency exists between the variability in radar freeboard estimations, although CryoSat-2 has higher noise levels. Specifically, we notice that the noise levels vary among different CryoSat-2 products, and for the European Space Agency (ESA) CryoSat-2 freeboard product the noise levels are at about 14 and 20 cm for first-year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI), respectively. On the other hand, for Operation IceBridge and NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), it is shown that the variability in snow (or total) freeboard is quantitatively comparable despite more than a 5-year time difference between the two datasets. Furthermore, by using Operation IceBridge data, we also find widespread negative covariance between ice freeboard and snow depth, which only manifests on small spatial scales (40 m for first-year ice and about 80 to 120 m for multi-year ice). This statistical relationship highlights that the snow cover reduces the overall topography of the ice cover. Besides this, there is prevalent positive covariability between snow depth and snow freeboard across a wide range of spatial scales. The variability and consistency analysis calls for more process-oriented observations and modeling activities to elucidate key processes governing snow-ice interaction and sea ice variability on various spatial scales. The statistical results can also be utilized in improving both radar and laser altimetry as well as the validation of sea ice and snow prognostic models. © Author(s) 2020.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; CryoSat; ice thickness; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; sea ice; snow cover","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081250667"

Key open questions are whether assimilation of lower-level data products such as radar freeboard (RFB) can further improve model performance and what performance gains can be achieved through joint assimilation of these data products in combination with a snow depth product. The Arctic Mission Benefit Analysis system was developed to address this type of question. Using the quantitative network design (QND) approach, the system can evaluate, in a mathematically rigorous fashion, the observational constraints imposed by individual and groups of data products. We demonstrate the approach by presenting assessments of the observation impact (added value) of different Earth observation (EO) products in terms of the uncertainty reduction in a 4-week forecast of sea ice volume (SIV) and snow volume (SNV) for three regions along the Northern Sea Route in May 2015 using a coupled model of the sea ice-ocean system, specifically the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model. We assess seven satellite products: three real products and four hypothetical products. The real products are monthly SIT, sea ice freeboard (SIFB), and RFB, all derived from CryoSat-2 by the Alfred Wegener Institute. These are complemented by two hypothetical monthly laser freeboard (LFB) products with low and high accuracy, as well as two hypothetical monthly snow depth products with low and high accuracy. On the basis of the per-pixel uncertainty ranges provided with the CryoSat-2 SIT, SIFB, and RFB products, the SIT and RFB achieve a much better performance for SIV than the SIFB product. For SNV, the performance of SIT is only low, the performance of SIFB is higher and the performance of RFB is yet higher. A hypothetical LFB product with low accuracy (20&thinsp;cm uncertainty) falls between SIFB and RFB in performance for both SIV and SNV. A reduction in the uncertainty of the LFB product to 2 cm yields a significant increase in performance. Combining either of the SIT or freeboard products with a hypothetical snow depth product achieves a significant performance increase. The uncertainty in the snow product matters: a higher-accuracy product achieves an extra performance gain. Providing spatial and temporal uncertainty correlations with the EO products would be beneficial not only for QND assessments, but also for assimilation of the products. © 2018 Author(s).","Arctic; Simian immunodeficiency virus; continental freeboard; CryoSat; forecasting method; ice thickness; ice-ocean interaction; network design; performance assessment; satellite data; sea ice; snow; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051538931"

The sea and land segmentation is based on the normalized water body index. By analyzing the spectral characteristics of sea water and sea ice, the sea ice region is extracted by the maximum likelihood method, and the sea ice thickness is inverted by the exponential albedo model. The inversion results are compared with the ice thickness calculated by Zubov empirical model. The correlation coefficient is 0. 884, which proves the feasibility of medium high resolution optical remote sensing data in sea ice thickness inversion.

Landfast ice (LFI) on the Baltic Sea is a place for recreational activities such as skiing and ice fishing. Over thick LFI ice roads can be established between mainland and islands to speed up transportation compared to the use of ferries. LFI also allows transportation of material to or from islands without piers for large ships. For all these activities, information on LFI extent and sea ice thickness, snow thickness and degree of ice deformation on LFI is very important. We generated new operational products for these LFI parameters based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and existing products and prediction models on the Baltic Sea ice properties. The products are generated daily and have a 500 m pixel size. They are visualized in a web-portal titled “Baltic Sea landfast ice extent and thickness (BALFI)” which has free access. The BALFI service was started in Feb 2019. Before the BALFI service, information on the LFI properties in fine scale (<1 km) was not available from any single source or product. We studied the accuracy and quality of the BALFI products for the ice season 2019–2020 using ice charts and in-situ coastal ice station data. We suggest that the current products give usable information on the Baltic LFI properties for various end-users.

The European Space Agency's Envisat (2002–2010) and CryoSat-2 (2010–present) satellite radar altimeter missions provide a continuous 17-year dataset with the potential to estimate sea ice thickness. However, the satellite footprints are not equal in area and so different distributions of floes and leads are sampled by each mission. Here, we compare lead and floe sampling from Envisat and CryoSat-2 to investigate the impact of geometric sampling differences on Arctic sea ice thickness estimates. We find that Envisat preferentially samples wider, thicker sea ice floes, and that floes in less consolidated ice regions are effectively thickened by off-nadir ranging to leads. Consequently, Envisat sea ice thicknesses that are an average of 80 cm higher than CryoSat-2 over first-year ice and 23 cm higher over multiyear ice. By considering the along-track distances between lead and floe measurements, we are able to develop a sea ice thickness correction that is based on Envisat's inability to resolve discrete surfaces relative to CryoSat-2. This is a novel, physically based approach to addressing the bias between the satellites and reduces the average thickness difference to negligible values over first-year and multiyear ice. Finally, we evaluate our new bias-corrected Envisat sea ice thickness product using independent airborne, moored-buoy and submarine data. The European Space Agency's Envisat and CryoSat-2 satellites have the potential to produce a continuous record of Arctic sea ice thickness since 2002, but this is complicated by the fact that the satellites do not sample the sea ice surface in the same way. We find that Envisat is only able to sample larger, thicker sea ice relative to CryoSat-2, because of its poorer resolution. In this paper we account for these differences in sampling to combine Arctic sea ice thickness estimates from two the satellite missions.

Sea-ice thickness (SIT) is a controlling geophysical variable that needs to be understood with greater accuracy. For the first time, a SIT-retrieval method that exclusively uses only airborne SIT data for training the empirical algorithm to retrieve SIT from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperature (TB) at different polarization is presented. A large amount of airborne SIT data has been used from various field campaigns in the Arctic conducted by different countries during 2011-15. The algorithm attempts to circumvent the issue related to discrimination between TB signatures of thin SIT versus low sea-ice concentration. The computed SIT has a rms error of 0.10 m, which seems reasonably good (as compared to the existing algorithms) for analysis at the used 25 km grid.

Using a long-term time series of sea ice products from satellite observations—the extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x)—trends in sea ice concentration, ice extent, ice thickness, and ice volume in the Arctic from 1982 to 2020 are investigated. Results show that the Arctic has become less ice-covered in all seasons, especially in summer and autumn. Arctic sea ice thickness has been decreasing at a rate of −3.24 cm per year, resulting in an approximate 52% reduction in thickness from 2.35 m in 1982 to 1.13 m in 2020. Arctic sea ice volume has been decreasing at a rate of −467.7 km3 per year, resulting in an approximate 63% reduction in volume, from 27,590.4 km3 in 1982 to 10,305.5 km3 in 2020. These trends are further examined from a new perspective, where the Arctic Ocean is classified into open water, perennial, and seasonal sea ice-covered areas based on sea ice persistence. The loss of the perennial sea ice-covered area is a major factor in the total sea ice loss in all seasons. If the current rates of sea ice changes in extent, concentration, and thickness continue, the Arctic is expected to have ice-free summers by the early 2060s. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, the latest sea ice data sets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative were firstly combined to comprehensively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice thickness (SIT) from 2002 to 2017. The results show that during this period, the SIC of the Kara Sea and the Barents Sea decreases the most significantly, reaching −1.11%·year−1. The Arctic annual average sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) exhibit noticeable decreasing trends, reaching −0.0592 × 106 km·year−1 and −0.0628 × 106 km·year−1, respectively. Both of Arctic SIE and SIA vary seasonally, and they reach the minimum values of 4.97 × 106 km2 and 3.96 × 106 km2 in September and the maximum values of 14.58 × 106 km2 and 13.35 × 106 km2 in March, respectively. Moreover, the Arctic SIE and SIA anomaly series from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed based on the linear regression method. It is found the most noticeable decreasing trends of the Arctic SIE and SIA are from July to October. The maximum variation of the SIE is −1.06 × 106 km2(10a)−1, and the maximum variation of the SIA is −1.09 × 106 km2(10a)−1. The Arctic SIE and SIA present the smallest decreasing trends from April to May, which are −0.19 × 106 km2(10a)−1 and −0.2 × 106 km2(10a)−1, respectively. The Arctic SIT also displays a pronounced decreasing trend with −0.015 m·year−1 in autumn and −0.018 m·year−1 in winter. The annual average SIT reaches a minimum of 1.28 m in 2013 and a maximum of 1.66 m in 2005. Particularly, the SIT of the Hudson Bay decreases the most significantly, reaching −0.051 m·year−1. Finally, the Arctic average SIT was tested by the Mann-Kendall method. It is found that the SIT has a sudden change in 2007, from a slight increase in 2003–2007 to a significant decrease in 2007–2017. Overall, the decreasing trend of the Arctic sea ice (both SIC and SIT) is significant in the past decade. These findings can contribute to future research on polar regions and global climate change. © 2020.

The L-band radiometer Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity has been applied to retrieve sea ice parameters using a L-band radiation model. Here, we improve the L-band radiation model in two ways. First, instead of a single layer, we reformulate the model to consider multiple layers for sea ice and snow to better characterize the radiative effect of vertical temperature and salinity profile within the sea ice and the snow cover. Second, we incorporate small-scale sea ice variability, sea ice leads, which are not distinguishable with the L-band satellite data but have profound impacts on the simulated brightness temperature. Small-scale features of the sea ice cover such as leads can significantly lower the overall brightness temperature (TB ). The results show that the improved radiation model can correct sea ice type dependent biases of TB (R2 from 0.05 to 0.72) and compensate for the overestimation of TB when (refrozen) leads are ignored (R2 from 0.51 to 0.62).

In Geographical Information System (GIS), DEM provides a terrain model to facilitate drainage network analysis, watershed demarcation, soil erosion mapping, contour generation and for other area and volume calculations. In this study Open Source DEMs namely ASTER, SRTM and CartoDEM are analyzed with ICESat footprints. The selection of DEM is very much dependent on geographical features of earth affecting its quality in the area. The accuracy assessment was carried out for the Open source DEMs with the help of ICESat land altimetry data. ICESat carried a single instrument, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the travel time of laser returns from the earth surface along profiles, with a spatial resolution of approximately 70 m and an along-track sampling of 172 m (Herring, 1997). It is used to measure ice sheet elevations, change in elevation through time, height profiles of clouds and aerosols, land elevation and vegetation cover and can approximate the sea ice thickness. Total 400 footprints of ICESat data are considered for analysis of elevation derived from Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data. The elevation derived using ASTER, SRTM and CartoDEM are compared with these footprints. These footprints are passing through two districts i.e. Kanpur and Unnao of Uttar Pradesh. All 400 footprints of ICESat /GLAS are divided into six classes for statistical analysis. The result shows that the accuracy is highest in CartoDEM followed by SRTM. The elevation profile of CartoDEM has a better linear correlation as compare to other DEMs. The RMSE value of CartoDEM is varying for different classes from 2.40m (fallow land) to 3.71 m (Built-up area). © 2017 ACRS.

In this study, we used atmospheric reanalysis data and satellite remote sensing products to identify anomalies of meteorological and sea ice conditions during the ice season of 2018–2019 relative to climatological means using a Lagrangian methodology. We obtained the anomalies along the drifting trajectories of eight sea ice mass balance buoys between the marginal ice zone and the pack ice zone in the western Arctic Ocean (~160°W–170°W and 79°N–85°N) from September 2018 to August 2019. The temporary collapse of the Beaufort High and a strong positive Arctic Dipole in the winter of 2018–2019 drove the three buoys in the north to drift gradually northeastward and merge into the Transpolar Drift Stream. The most prominent positive temperature anomalies in 2018–2019 along the buoy trajectories relative to 1979–2019 climatology occurred in autumn, early winter, and April, and were concentrated in the southern part of the study area; these anomalies can be partly related to the seasonal and spatial patterns of heat release from the Arctic ice-ocean system to the atmosphere. In the southern part of the study area and in autumn, the sea ice concentration in 2018–2019 was higher than that averaged over the past 10 years. However, we found no ice concentration anomalies for other regions or seasons. The sea ice thickness in the freezing season and the snow depth by the end of the winter of 2018–2019 can also be considered as normal. Although the wind speed in 2018–2019 was slightly lower than that in 1979–2019, the speed of sea ice drift and its ratio to wind speed were significantly higher than the climatology. In 2019, the sea ice surface began to melt at the end of June, which was close to the 1988–2019 climatology. However, spatial variations in the onsets of surface melt in 2019 differed from the climatology, and can be explained by the prevalence of a high-pressure system in the south of the Beaufort Sea in June 2019. In addition to seasonal variations, the meteorological and sea ice anomalies were influenced by spatial variations. By the end of summer 2019, the buoys had drifted to the west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, where the ice conditions was heavier than those at the buoy locations in early September 2018. The meteorological and sea ice anomalies identified in this study lay the foundations for subsequent analyses and simulations of sea ice mass balance based on the buoy data. © 2022, Editorial Office of Advances in Polar Science.

Current methods of snow depth retrieval are based on satellite microwave radiometry, which perform best for dry, homogeneous snow packs on level sea ice. We introduce an alternative approach based on in-situ measurements of total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard and snow depth, which we use to compute snow depth on sea ice from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) total freeboard observations. We compare ICESat snow depth for early winter and spring of the years 2004 through 2006 with the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer aboard EOS (AMSR-E) snow depth product. We find ICESat snow depths agree more closely with ship-based visual and air-borne snow radar observations than AMSR-E snow depths. We obtain average modal and mean ICESat snow depths, which exceed AMSR-E snow depths by 5-10 cm in winter and 10-15 cm in spring.

These parameters, especially sea-ice density, are usually based on climatologies constructed from in situ observations made in the 1980s and earlier while contemporary and representative measurements are lacking. Our aim with this paper is to derive updated sea-ice bulk density estimates suitable for the present Arctic sea-ice cover and a range of ice types to reduce uncertainties in sea-ice thickness remote sensing. Our sea-ice density measurements are based on over 3000 km of high-resolution collocated airborne sea-ice and snow thickness and freeboard measurements in the western Arctic Ocean in 2017 and 2019. Sea-ice bulk density is derived assuming isostatic equilibrium for different ice types. Our results show higher average bulk densities for both first-year ice (FYI) and especially multi-year ice (MYI) compared to previous studies. In addition, we find a small difference between deformed and possibly unconsolidated FYI and younger MYI. We find a negative-exponential relationship between sea-ice bulk density and sea-ice freeboard and apply this parameterisation to one winter of monthly gridded CryoSat-2 sea-ice freeboard data. We discuss the suitability and the impact of the derived FYI and MYI bulk densities for sea-ice thickness retrievals and the uncertainty related to the indirect method of measuring sea-ice bulk density. The results suggest that retrieval algorithms be adapted to changes in sea-ice density and highlight the need of future studies to evaluate the impact of density parameterisation on the full sea-ice thickness data record.

While information about the mean of this distribution is increasingly available from modelling and remote sensing, the full distribution cannot yet be resolved. We analyse 33 539 snow depth measurements from 499 transects taken at Soviet drifting stations between 1955 and 1991 and derive a simple statistical distribution for snow depth over multi-year ice as a function of only the mean snow depth. We then evaluate this snow depth distribution against snow depth transects that span first-year ice to multiyear ice from the MOSAiC, SHEBA and AMSR-Ice field campaigns. Because the distribution can be generated using only the mean snow depth, it can be used in the downscaling of several existing snow depth products for use in flux modelling and altimetry studies.

Satellite microwave remote sensing based on microwave reflection signals reflected by the sea ice surface has been playing an essential role in monitoring and analyzing the Arctic SIT and sea ice concentration (SIC) during the past decades. Recently, passive microwave satellites incorporating an L-band radiometer, such as soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and soil moisture active passive (SMAP), have been used for analyzing sea ice characteristics, in addition to land and ocean research. In this study, we present a novel method to estimate thin SIT and sea ice roughness (SIR) using a conversion relationship between them, from the SMAP and SMOS data. Methodologically, the SMAP SIR is retrieved. The SMAP thin SIT and SMOS SIR are estimated using a conversion relationship between thin SIT data from SMOS data and SMAP-derived SIR, which is obtained from the spatial and temporal collocation of the SMOS thin SIT and the SIR retrieved from SMAP. Our results for the Arctic sea ice during December for four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018, show high accuracy (bias = -2.268 cm, root mean square error (RMSE) = 15.919 cm, and correlation coeffcient (CC) = 0.414) between the SMOS-provided thin SIT and SMAP-derived SIT, and good agreement (bias = 0.03 cm, RMSE = 0.228 cm, and CC = 0.496) between the SMOS-estimated SIR and SMAP-retrieved SIR. Consequently, our study could be effectively used for monitoring and analyzing the variation in the Arctic sea ice. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Earth (planet); Mean square error; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Microwave remote sensing; Positive and negative effect; Satellite remote sensing; SMAP; SMOS; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Thickness; Soil moisture","Roughness; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; SMAP; SMOS; Thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076526239"

We compare in situ total sea-ice thickness measurements from the Norwegian young sea ICE expedition in the area north of Svalbard with airborne-derived total sea-ice thickness from electromagnetic soundings. A segmented and classified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) quad-pol ALOS-2 Palsar-2 satellite scene was grouped into three simplified ice classes.

The area fractions of the simplified classes from ground- A nd helicopter-based measurements are comparable with those achieved from the SAR data. Thus, this study shows that there is potential for a stepwise upscaling from in situ, to airborne, to satellite data, which allow us to assess whether in situ data collected are representative of a wider region as observed by satellites. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; ALOS; climate change; electromagnetic method; ice thickness; measurement method; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar","airborne electromagnetic soundings; electromagnetic induction; remote sensing; sea-ice; sea-ice classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042227714"

Recently, the ice bridge has been in a state of decline, either breaking up earlier in the year or not forming at all and thereby increasing the sea ice export out of the Arctic Ocean. The decline in the ice bridge has been ascribed to thinner and therefore weaker ice from the Arctic Ocean entering Nares Strait; however, local forcing also affects the state of the ice bridge and thereby influences when it breaks up. Using a variety of remotely sensed data we examine the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness within the ice bridge, highlighting the presence of negative ice thickness anomalies on both the eastern and western sides of the strait and identifying a recurrent sensible heat polynya that forms within the ice bridge near Cape Jackson in northwestern Greenland. Using the sea ice-ocean model FESOM2, we then attribute these ice thickness anomalies to the heat from warmer subsurface waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that reduce thermodynamic ice growth throughout winter on the western and eastern sides, respectively. The consequently weaker and thinner areas within the ice bridge are then suggested to promote instability and earlier breakup. This work provides new insight into the structure of the Nares Strait ice bridge and highlights that warming of the modified Atlantic and/or Pacific waters that enter the strait may contribute to its further decline.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Nares Strait; heat flux; ice thickness; remote sensing; sea ice; spatial planning; thermodynamics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141952389"

The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables, lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is adjusted for best performance of the system at hand.

This paper describes an approach for automatic retrieval of daily thin sea ice thickness maps around Svalbard. The algorithm uses thermal satellite imagery from MODIS to estimate the surface temperature of the ice and further uses a thermal model of the ice surface to estimate the thickness of the sea ice. The approach is usable for thin sea ice, up to ca. 50 cm thick, during cold weather (freezing) conditions and without cloud cover present. The algorithm is compared with helicopter-borne electromagnetic ice thickness measurements. The comparison yields increasing root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for thicker ice. The lowest RMSD found is 8.7 cm for ice thickness in the range 10 cm < hi ≤ 20 cm. The highest RMSD found is 25.2 cm for ice thickness in the range 30 cm < hi ≤ 40 cm. The bias shows no such trend, and the overall bias is found to be −5.5 cm.

In this study, first we investigate the extent to which the sea-ice anisotropy can influence the representativeness of an airborne survey compared to the regional situation. Second, we propose a method to process sea-ice maps prior to flights to help preparing the most representative flight plan possible for the local area. The method is based on automated segmentation of radar satellite images and extensive simulation of flight transects over the image. The spatial analysis of these transects enables for the identification of the most representative survey trajectories for the area. The method was applied for seven different synthetic aperture radar satellite images over Arctic sea ice north of Svalbard. The results indicate that the proposed method improved the representativeness of the airborne survey by identifying the most suitable transect over the ice pack. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

Monitoring sea ice thickness and the mean sea level (MSL) of the frozen sea are performed using the interference frequency obtained by the GNSS interference pattern (IP) technique. The height variations between the GNSS antenna and the sea surface evaluated using the IP of the direct and reflected carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) are used to find the corresponding MSL. The GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R) derived MSL for open sea conditions agreed well with the mareograph data with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.72 cm with an R-squared value of 0.9644. For frozen sea, a notable difference was observed between the measured MSL and ground-truth MSL values. This difference was caused by the combined thickness of snow and ice above the frozen sea surface, also known as the total freeboard. Assuming the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied, total freeboard was converted to ice thickness. The ice thickness values agreed well with the published ice charts by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). The main uncertainty in the extracted ice thickness was due to the thick snow accumulation and unknown snow properties.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Antenna reflectors; Communication satellites; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Mean square error; Permittivity measurement; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Satellite antennas; Sea ice; Sea level; Snow; Surface waters; Antennas measurement; Freeboard; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Global navigational satellite system-reflectometry; Ice thickness; Interference pattern network; Interference patterns; Navigational satellites; Pattern networks; Propagation; Reflectometry; Reflector antennas; Remote-sensing; Satellite system; Sea measurements; Sea surfaces; GNSS; Reflection","Freeboard; global navigational satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R); ice thickness; propagation; reflection; remote sensing; sea ice; snow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136884890"

On average, it covers up to ~ 15% of the world’s oceans for at least some of the year, with strong and opposing seasonal variability in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Passive microwave observations from satellite-borne sensors have provided information on sea ice cover since the early 1970s and have produced a consistent and near-complete climate record of sea ice concentration and extent since October 1979. Passive microwave sensors are optimal for sea ice because the microwave emission they detect is sensitive to the phase state of water (liquid vs. frozen). Also, the emission is independent of sunlight, which allows continuous coverage through the long polar winter nights. Atmospheric emission (clouds, water vapor, aerosols) is also generally low over sea ice, enabling the surface emission to be clearly detected by the orbiting sensors. Finally, the sensor swath width and sun-synchronous polar orbits yield near-complete daily coverage of all sea ice covered regions. The long-term record from passive microwave data indicates a significant downward trend in Arctic sea ice cover, while the Antarctic time series is more complex and is dominated by strong interannual variability. Other geophysical parameters can also be derived, including temperature, motion, snow depth, and melt/freeze. New passive microwave sensors are also now providing thickness estimates of newly-formed sea ice. The record from passive microwave sensors show a dramatically changing Arctic with large decreases in extent and age, faster ice motion, earlier melt and later freeze-up. The Antarctic is more variable over the satellite record, with small positive trends in extent. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","","Antarctic; Arctic; Climate change; Passive microwave sensing; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice extent; Sea ice thickness","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079082824"

In contrast to conventional in situ measurements, FM-CW radar, when operated onboard an airborne platform, can be a useful tool for widearea surveys of snow deposition. Since the early 2000s, the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) at the University of Kansas (KU) has designed, developed, and deployed airborne ultrawide-band (UWB) FM-CW radars, called Snow Radars, on National Science Foundation (NSF)-, NASA-, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)-, and Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)-provided aircraft in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and generated a large amount of snow data products. In addition to the significant standalone value of the snow-thickness measurements, these data are being used in estimating Arctic sea ice thickness, which is a key variable in the study of atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions. This article provides a review of snow remote sensing techniques with airborne FM-CW radars to document the operating principle, design, and evolution of CReSIS' UWB FM-CW radars and discuss and promote understanding of the advantages and limitations associated with these systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Arctic and Antarctic; Continuous wave radar; NASA; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Research laboratories; Sea ice; Snow; Snowfall measurement; Thickness measurement; Airborne measurements; Frequency-modulated continuous waves; National Science Foundations; Naval Research Laboratory; Operating principles; Remote sensing techniques; Snow-thickness measurement; University of Kansas; airborne sensor; airborne survey; frequency analysis; ice sheet; radar altimetry; research institution; sea ice; snow avalanche; Frequency modulation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021157101"
