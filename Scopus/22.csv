This study presents a satellite-based approach at quantifying the distribution of sediment-laden ice that allows for more extensive observations in both time and space to monitor spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice. A structural-optical model coupled with a four-stream multilayer discrete ordinates method radiative transfer model was used to examine surface spectral albedo for four surface types: clean ice, sediment-laden ice with 15 different sediment loadings from 25 to 1000 g m−3, ponded ice, and ice-free open water. Based on the fact that the spectral characteristics of sediment-laden ice differ from those other surface types, fractions of sediment-laden ice were estimated from the remotely-sensed surface reflectance by a spectral unmixing algorithm using a least square method. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a combination of sediment loads of 50 and 500 g m−3 effectively represents the areal fraction of sediment-laden ice with a wide range of sediment loads. The estimated fractions of each surface type and corresponding remotely-sensed surface reflectances were used to train an artificial neural network to speed up processing relative to the least squares method. Comparing the fractions of sediment-laden ice derived from these two approaches yielded good agreements for areal fractions of sediment-laden ice, highlighting the superior performance of the neural network for processing large datasets. Although our approach contains potential uncertainties associated with methodological limitations, spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice exhibited reasonable agreement with spatial patterns and seasonal variations reported in the literature on in situ observations of sediment-laden ice. Systematic satellite-based monitoring of sediment-laden ice distribution can provide extensive, sustained, and cost-effective observations to foster our understanding of the role of sediment-laden ice in a wide variety of research fields including sediment transport and biogeochemical cycling. © 2021 The Authors","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Cost effectiveness; Large dataset; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; Multilayer neural networks; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellites; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Arctic; Arctic ocean; Least-squares- methods; Marginal seas; Network-based; Neural-networks; Remote-sensing; Sediment loads; Spatio-temporal variation; Surface reflectance; algorithm; artificial neural network; radiative transfer; sea ice; sediment transport; surface reflectance; Remote sensing","Arctic; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121867836"

In this study, we first assess the ability of IS2 to estimate thermodynamic ice growth and dynamic thickening during the ice-growing season in the central Arctic Ocean. As an indicator of the thermodynamic ice growth, we use 10 thermistor string-based sea ice mass balance array (SIMBA) buoys deployed at a scale of ~50 km from the Icebreaker Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. We collect IS2 data within 20 km buffer distance from the individual buoys, and calculate the mode, median, and mean of the IS2-derived ice thickness. The IS2 modal thickness shows the least bias (−0.169 m) with the buoy ice thickness, representing level ice thickness. In addition, the increasing rate of the IS2 modal thickness is close to the thermodynamic ice growth with a small bias of −0.054 cm/day. However, the increasing rates of the IS2 median and mean thickness are greater than the thermodynamic ice growth by about 0.114 cm/day and 0.198 cm/day, respectively, because they also include ice growth caused by thickness redistribution during dynamic deformation. The dynamic contributions may account for 26.1 ± 10.3% and 34.4 ± 10.1% of the total increase of the IS2 median and mean thickness, respectively. Within a ~ 50 km radius area from the MOSAiC Central Observatory, IS2 measurements exhibit that the ridge fraction increased from <2% in November to ~4% in March (~0.029%/day of average increasing rate) and ridge height increased about 0.047 cm/day during the same period. However, lead formation does not show significant contributions to the dynamic ice thickening because leads are temporary features lasting only 2–3 days. Although there are considerable uncertainties in IS2 ice thickness estimation and IS2-buoy thickness comparison, this study emphasizes the importance of combining measurements by IS2 and SIMBA buoys to explain the regional sea ice mass balance with separating the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Central Department; Indicator indicator; Aneroid altimeters; Buoys; Deformation; Meteorological instruments; Observatories; Remote sensing; Thermodynamics; Thickness measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Ice growth; Ice mass; Ice thickness; Lead; Mass balance; Remote-sensing; Ridge; Satellite altimeter; Sea ice deformations; Sea ice mass balance; data buoy; deformation; growth; habitat mosaic; ice lead; ice ridge; ICESat; remote sensing; sea ice; thermodynamics; Sea ice","Lead; Remote sensing; Ridge; Satellite altimeter; Sea ice deformation; Sea ice mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116189953"

However, to date, there is no multiple remote sensing method to detect sea ice type in the Arctic. This study develops a multiple sea ice type algorithm using the HaiYang-2B Scatterometer (HY-2B SCA). First, the parameters most applicable to classify sea ice type are selected through feature extraction, and a stacking model is established for the first time, which integrates decision tree and image segmentation algorithms. Finally, multiple sea ice types are classified in the Arctic, comprising Nilas, Young Ice, First Year Ice, Old Ice, and Fast Ice. Comparing the results with the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) Sea Ice Type dataset (SIT) indicates that the sea ice type classified by HY-2B SCA (Stacking-HY2B) is similar to OSI-SAF SIT with regard to the changing trends in extent of sea ice. We use the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) high-resolution sea ice type data and EM-Bird ice thickness data to validate the result, and accuracies of 87% and 88% are obtained, respectively.

Due to the autonomous learning characteristics of deep learning, it has been gradually applied to the classification of remote sensing sea ice images. At present, deep learning models are mostly used in sea ice classification of single source remote sensing data. Due to the limitations of single source data and the information loss of deep learning model in the process of feature extraction layer by layer, it is inevitable to encounter a bottleneck in sea ice detection requiring fine classification. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a sea ice image classification method based on ResNet16-feature pyramid networks-spatial pyramid pooling-gated fusion network (ResFPG) and heterogeneous data fusion. In the feature extraction part, the method uses the improved ResNet16 to extract the multi-level feature information of sea ice in synthetic aperture radar data and optical data, reducing information loss in the feature extraction process, then mines and fuses the low-level spatial information and high-level semantic information through the improved feature pyramid networks (FPN), and then collects and fuses the output features of different scales through the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network. In the feature fusion part, a gated feature-level fusion strategy is designed to further improve the overall classification accuracy by adaptively adjusting the feature contribution of two heterogeneous sources of data through the gated fusion network (GFN). In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, we use two sets of heterogeneous sea ice remote sensing data located in Hudson Bay area for experiments. The experimental results show that compared with other image classification methods, the proposed method fully excavates and integrates the multi-scale and multi-level features in heterogeneous data, effectively distinguishes the feature contribution, and achieves better classification results (97.14% and 95.85%). © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Classification (of information); Data fusion; Data mining; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Image classification; Learning systems; Optical remote sensing; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification methods; Feature pyramid; Features extraction; Heterogeneous data; Ice detection; Images classification; Information loss; Learning models; Remote sensing data; Single source; classification; experimental study; image classification; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; Sea ice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143793466"

We propose the first deep learning pipeline to extract fine-scale sea ice layers from high-resolution satellite imagery (Worldview-3). Extracting sea ice from imagery is often challenging due to the potentially complex texture from older ice floes (i.e., floating chunks of sea ice) and surrounding slush ice, making ice floes less distinctive from the surrounding water. We propose a pipeline using a U-Net variant with a Resnet encoder to retrieve ice floe pixel masks from very-high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Even with a modest-sized hand-labeled training set and the most basic hyperparameter choices, our CNN-based approach attains an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.698–a nearly 60% improvement when compared to a watershed segmentation baseline. We then supplement our training set with a much larger sample of images weak-labeled by a watershed segmentation algorithm. To ensure watershed derived pack-ice masks were a good representation of the underlying images, we created a synthetic version for each weak-labeled image, where areas outside the mask are replaced by open water scenery. Adding our synthetic image dataset, obtained at minimal effort when compared with hand-labeling, further improves the out-of-sample F1 score to 0.734. Finally, we use an ensemble of four test metrics and evaluated after mosaicing outputs for entire scenes to mimic production setting during model selection, reaching an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.753. Our fully-automated pipeline is capable of detecting, monitoring, and segmenting ice floes at a very fine level of detail, and provides a roadmap for other use-cases where partial results can be obtained with threshold-based methods but a context-robust segmentation pipeline is desired. © 2021 by the authors.

But it has lower accuracy due to the enhanced weather influences from water vapor, cloud liquid water (CLW), wind, and surface temperature. Here we improve a high-resolution SIC algorithm, called the ASI algorithm, based on the difference between vertical and horizontal polarization 89 GHz data, by correcting the observed data for these weather influences through a radiative transfer model and geophysical data retrieved by an optimal estimation method. The improved algorithm denoted ASI3, is developed for the Arctic based on the weather-corrected brightness temperatures and newly identified open water (80 K) and sea ice (14 K) tie-points. The most important component of this correction is the inclusion of CLW, the largest weather influence contributor. ASI3 results are evaluated over pure surface sites of 0% and 100% SICs under various weather conditions, showing a much lower average standard deviation (1.1%) than ASI (16.2%). ASI3 reduces weather patterns over pack ice resulting in more homogeneous retrievals but biased toward lower values. Comparison to Landsat imagery under clear-sky conditions shows that ASI3 results in better agreement with the Landsat SIC than ASI. The number of cases where real sea ice is falsely identified as open water is reduced by ASI3 due to its relaxed open-water mask and wider water/ice dynamic range. © 2022.

We applied the SIA data from remote sensing observations and SIT data from numerical model calculations. We found the large summer variability of SIA and SIT in AS and PS compared with those in winter. The opposite feature was seen in the BKSs. The annual declining rates of SIA and SIT were the largest in PS (−1.73 × 104 km2 yr−1) and AS (−3.36 × 10−2 m yr−1), respectively. The SIA variability was modest for winter PS and the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago of AS. The annual and winter SIA flux from PS to AS gradually increased in 1979–2020; the summer SIA flux accounted for 11% of the PS summer SIA decline. The annual and seasonal SIA outflow through the Fram Strait during 1979–2020 steadily increased while for annual and winter SIA export, the increase mainly occurred in 1979–2000; the summer SIA outflow was only 1.45% equivalent to the decrease in the entire Arctic summer SIA. We concluded that sea ice export was not a major impact factor on the seasonal and regional decline of SIA and SIT except for the individual years. The near surface air temperature (SAT) and sea surface temperature (SST) were responsible for the retreat and thinning of the sea ice. The dramatic increase in SAT in winter resulted in a strong decrease in winter sea ice in BKS. The outgoing longwave radiation had significant negative correlations with SIA and SIT and positive correlations with SAT and SST. The Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation, related to the North Atlantic Ocean’s SST anomalies, had significant negative correlations with SIA and SIT. The SIT had higher correlations with the atmospheric and oceanic factors compared with SIA, which indicates that SIT is important for predictions of Arctic sea ice and climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

We assess transceiver cross-calibration stability between the two DAR frequency channels using a combination of ground-based calibration measurements and airborne cloud observations that are validated by independent sensors. By comparing calibrated, unattenuated ocean surface backscatter measurements with existing models, we demonstrate the need for improvements in treating ocean surface scattering at G-band frequencies for future in-flight radar calibration applications.

Furthermore, we present water vapor profiling and IWV measurements in the presence of clouds and precipitation when flying through a frontal weather system in the vicinity of Bodega Bay. By comparing with coincident RS profiles, we find an RMSE for in-cloud humidity profile retrievals of 1.1 ${\rm gm}^{-3}$ and precision of 0.6 ${\rm gm}^{-3}$ while the IWV retrievals reveal a bias from differential hydrometeor extinction of 5 mm.

Accurate knowledge of sea ice conditions is therefore becoming increasingly important for reducing the risk and operational cost of human activities in the Arctic. Satellite-based sea ice charting is routinely used for tactical ice management, but the marine sector does not yet make optimal use of sea ice thickness (SIT) or sea ice concentration (SIC) forecasts on weekly timescales. This is because forecasts have not achieved sufficient accuracy, verification and resolution to be used in situations where maritime safety is paramount, and assessing the suitability of forecasts can be difficult because they are often not available in the appropriate format. In this paper, existing SIT forecasts currently available on the Copernicus Marine Service (CMS) or elsewhere in the public domain are evaluated for the first time. These include the seven-day forecasts from the UK Met Office, MET Norway, the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Their forecast skills were assessed against unique in situ data from five moorings deployed between 2016 and 2019 by the Barents Sea Metocean and Ice Network (BASMIN) and Barents Sea Exploration Collaboration (BaSEC) Joint Industry Projects. Assessing these models highlights the importance of data assimilation in short-term forecasting of SIT and suggests that improved assimilation of sea ice data could increase the utility of forecasts for navigational purposes.

The optimal neural network architecture for solving the problem was obtained by the empirical method. During the experiments, the optimal size of input textures was obtained, which was 21×21 pixels. In the same way, the input parameters were obtained, which were the solar zenith angle and infrared channels with central wavelengths of 0.6, 1.6, 10.7, and 12.0 µm. As reference data, ice cover masks were used, manually created by experienced decoders of FEC SRC Planeta.

Post millennium, autumn blooms have increased in frequency in Arctic shelf seas. Delayed sea-ice formation, stronger autumn winds and greater inflows of nutrient-rich temperate waters have all been suggested to support growing annual net primary production and an increasing incidence of autumn blooms. Here, we investigated data sets of remotely sensed September chlorophyll a, sea surface temperature, current and wind speeds. We explored mechanistic drivers of autumn blooms in the Barents Sea, one of the most productive Arctic shelf seas, to better understand the role of strong winds and the ingression of Atlantic waters in the dynamics of autumn blooms. We performed geographically resolved regressions between remotely sensed September chlorophyll a and environmental conditions in the Barents Sea, demonstrating a strong dependency of autumn bloom intensity on Atlantic inflow.

Due to the intense reflection and scattering of incident light, whitecaps can be effectively recognized and distinguished in in-situ photos or videos. Whitecap coverage (W), defined as the proportion of ocean surface covered by whitecaps, is an important parameter for the quantification of whitecaps. Of course, oceanic whitecaps can also be discriminated in high spatial resolution optical remote sensing images, such as Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data. This can provide a new research direction in marine environment observation, and may be further used for wind speed monitoring. However, how to estimate oceanic whitecap coverage from these optical remote sensing images is still a challenge. In this study, the formula of whitecap coverage is obtained by converting the form of radiative equation related with the constant and image reflectance of Sentinel-2 MSI data under some assumptions. The background signal of seawater and atmosphere was eliminated by data optimization, and the signal of whitecaps can be distinguished using regional filtering method. Then, whitecap coverage can be estimated. The identification and estimation results indicate that whitecap coverage derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images are consistent with previous studies using in situ observations in the order of magnitude, and can invert sea surface wind speed using a statistical model. Coarse spatial resolution wind speed images converted from MSI inversion were validated by ERA5 wind speed products from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In addition, whitecap coverage can imply the modulation of other marine environmental dynamic factors (e.g., water mass, ocean fronts, ocean eddies and internal waves). Moreover, it should be noted that sunglint reflection is a non-negligible issue for optical remote sensing of oceanic whitecaps whose signal should be effectively eliminated. Examining the MSI-derived results to HY1-C/D CZI, it indicates that whitecaps can be identified in CZI images when wind speed is greater than 9 m/s, and the reflectance difference between whitecaps and background seawater is 5.8%—8.3%. We hope the above results can be used to improve the accuracy of atmospheric correction, and provide new reference for using high spatial resolution optical remote sensing in sea surface wind speed estimation and marine environmental dynamic factors monitoring. This will hopefully expand the research and application fields of ocean color remote sensing. © 2023 Science Press.

The measurement of SIE is derived from remote sensing data and is both a lagged and leading indicator of climate change. To characterize at a local level the decline in SIE, we use remote-sensing data at 25 km resolution to fit a spatio-temporal logistic autoregressive model of the sea-ice evolution in the Arctic region. The model incorporates last year’s ice/water binary observations at nearby grid cells in an autoregressive manner with autoregressive coefficients that vary both in space and time. Using the model-based estimates of ice/water probabilities in the Arctic region, we propose several graphical summaries to visualize the spatio-temporal changes in Arctic sea ice beyond what can be visualized with the single time series of SIE. In ever-higher latitude bands, we observe a consistently declining temporal trend of sea ice in the early fall. We also observe a clear decline in and contraction of the sea ice’s distribution between (Formula presented.) – (Formula presented.), and of most concern is that this may reflect the future behavior of sea ice at ever-higher latitudes under climate change. © 2022 by the authors.","Climate models; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space optics; Time series; Arctic regions; Arctic sea ice; Boxplot time series; Dynamic spatio-temporal model; Reflected solar radiation; Remote sensing data; Sea ice extent; Spatio-temporal; Spatio-temporal models; Times series; Climate change","boxplot time series; climate change; dynamic spatio-temporal model; reflected solar radiation; sea ice extent","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143799333"

The methodological framework addressed the processing of remote sensing signals, interdependence between sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations, and combining zonal and meridional velocities as the eddy kinetic energy. Dynamic and static random effects models were estimated by maximum likelihood and stepwise methods, respectively, taking into account the unobserved heterogeneity across grids. The main findings were that quarterly sea surface temperatures increased steadily in the Northern hemisphere, whereas cyclical patterns were apparent in Southern hemisphere; sea ice concentrations declined in both hemispheres. Second, sea surface temperatures were estimated with large negative coefficients in the models for sea ice concentrations for the hemispheres; previous sea ice concentrations were negatively associated with sea surface temperatures, indicating feedback loops. Third, sea surface temperatures were positively and significantly associated with eddy kinetic energy in Northern hemisphere. Overall, the results indicated the importance of reducing sea surface temperatures via reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the dumping of pollutants into oceans for maintaining sea ice concentrations and enhancing global sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.","","climate change; maximum likelihood estimation; mitigation policies; ocean surface current velocities; remote sensing data; sea ice concentrations; sea surface temperatures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144897776"

Sea ice area and extent are useful climatic indicators of large-scale variability, but they do not allow the quantification of regions of distinct variability in sea ice concentration (SIC). This is particularly relevant in the marginal ice zone (MIZ), which is a transitional region between the open ocean and pack ice, where the exchanges between ocean, sea ice and atmosphere are more intense. The MIZ is circumpolar and broader in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. Its extent is inferred from satellite-derived SIC using the 15 %-80 % range, assumed to be indicative of open drift or partly closed sea ice conditions typical of the ice edge. This proxy has been proven effective in the Arctic, but it is deemed less reliable in the Southern Ocean, where sea ice type is unrelated to the concentration value, since wave penetration and free-drift conditions have been reported with 100 % cover. The aim of this paper is to propose an alternative indicator for detecting MIZ conditions in Antarctic sea ice, which can be used to quantify variability at the climatological scale on the ice-covered Southern Ocean over the seasons, as well as to derive maps of probability of encountering a certain degree of variability in the expected monthly SIC value. The proposed indicator is based on statistical properties of the SIC; it has been tested on the available climate data records to derive maps of the MIZ distribution over the year and compared with the threshold-based MIZ definition. The results present a revised view of the circumpolar MIZ variability and seasonal cycle, with a rapid increase in the extent and saturation in winter, as opposed to the steady increase from summer to spring reported in the literature. It also reconciles the discordant MIZ extent estimates using the SIC threshold from different algorithms. This indicator complements the use of the MIZ extent and fraction, allowing the derivation of the climatological probability of exceeding a certain threshold of SIC variability, which can be used for planning observational networks and navigation routes, as well as for detecting changes in the variability when using climatological baselines for different periods.

Seasonal predictions of landfast ice conditions are generally lacking in current seasonal forecasting products but are needed especially for planning of on-ice activities such as the construction of ice roads. This study focuses on the planned offshore development of Liberty Island where there is a need to generate seasonal forecasts for the construction of ice roads in Foggy Island Bay along the Beaufort Sea coast in northern Alaska. Due to the lack of prior in-situ observations of ice thickness in the region, a combination of newly obtained field measurements, remote sensing data analysis and modeling were employed to produce prototype seasonal forecasts of ice thickness in the landfast ice around Liberty Island. Seasonal forecasts initialized in September and March were built using Climate Forecast System seasonal forecast model data coupled with a single column ice model to forecast ice thickness that capture the start and end of the operational season, respectively. The results showed that the model forecasts had modest skill in capturing the timing of key ice thickness thresholds needed to support vehicle traffic during the start of the season in November–December but very limited skill with end of season and ice breakup forecasts.

CryoSat-2 along-track SITs, which are converted from freeboard measurements using the model snow depth, and a daily, gridded SMOS SIT product are used in the assimilation to constrain the Arctic sea ice thickness. When using only CryoSat-2 assimilation, SIT forecast fields within the ice pack are greatly improved with respect to independent airborne measurements. However, the positive impacts of CryoSat-2 assimilation in thick ice regions are counteracted by an SIT overestimation in areas of thin ice, due to biased freeboard measurements there. Adding the SMOS assimilation results in much thinner SITs in those regions, which performs better than the control when compared to SIT objective analyses and mooring measurements in the Beaufort and Barents Seas. Furthermore, SMOS assimilation enhances the short-term predictive skill of the marginal sea-ice concentration relative to the control. This is translated into a consistent retreat of the sea-ice covered areas in the 5-day forecasts during March 2017, which is in better agreement with independent ice edge products. This work successfully demonstrates improvements in FOAM sea ice when SIT observations from both CryoSat-2 and SMOS are assimilated, representing an important step towards the operational implementation of SIT assimilation within Met Office forecasting systems. © 2022 Crown Copyright, Met Office.

Sea ice concentration, which is the main parameter of passive microwave remote sensing of sea ice, can characterize the sea ice conditions, which can be used to guide the polar navigation and study the sea ice change in different scales. The sea ice area and sea ice extent can also be calculated by using the sea ice concentration, which is of great significance for the forecast of polar sea ice conditions and the study of climate change. This work discusses how to use the high resolution channels of FY-3B/MWRI (FY-3B/Microwave Radiometer Imager) to retrieve the sea ice concentrations in the Arctic. Based on the ASI (ARTIST [Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study] Sea Ice) algorithm, the Arctic sea ice concentration is calculated in this study by improving the tie points of the algorithm. According to the cross calibration of brightness temperatures between the FY-3B/MWRI and the Aqua/AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS), the differences between the two brightness temperature data are between ±4 K, which will result in a maximum bright temperature difference of 8 K. Accordingly, this study first sets the variation range of the tie points for FY-3B/MWRI centered on the original values of the ASI algorithm to 11.7±8 K for sea ice and 47.0±8 K for open water, separately, with a step length of 1 K. After the combination, 289 series of point value combinations are obtained. Then, the sea ice concentrations corresponding to each set of tie points are compared with those of the AMSR-E L3 product. Meanwhile, the tie points corresponding to the smallest deviation of the two data sets are selected. According to the tie points determined above, this study calculated the Arctic sea ice concentrations based on the FY-3B/MWRI brightness temperatures, hereinafter referred to as the Retrieved Sea Ice Concentration (RSIC). The RSICs in this study are compared with the MWRI Level 2 sea ice concentration product (hereinafter referred to as MWRI). First, the sea ice concentrations obtained from the Aqua/MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) reflectivity data from July to September 2011 are used to verify the two data sets. The results show that the bias of RSIC is comparable to that of the MWRI product. However, the standard deviation and root mean square error are significantly reduced. Meanwhile, the accuracy of RSIC is much higher than that of the MWRI product in the areas with a sea ice concentration lower than 95%. Then, the two sea ice concentration data sets are compared with the sea ice concentration product from the University of Bremen (SIC_UB). The bias and the standard deviation between RSIC and SIC_UB are 3.3% and 10.6%, which are lower than the values between the MWRI and the SIC_UB products: 5.9% and 16.4%, respectively. Finally, the time series of the daily averaged sea ice concentration, sea ice area, and sea ice extent from the RSIC, MWRI, SIC_UB, and NSIDC/AMSR-E (National Snow and Ice Data Center/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E) sea ice concentration products are compared. The results show that the values of RSIC are significantly lower than those of the MWRI product in three statistical methods and much closer to the AMSR-E and SIC_UB products. In this study, the sea ice concentrations in the Arctic region are retrieved based on the brightness temperatures from the FY-3B/MWRI high frequency channels. The sea ice concentrations in this study have a higher spatial resolution and a better accuracy compared with the FY-3B/MWRI L2 sea ice concentration product, which is conducive to the long-time series study of climate change in the Arctic. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

We examined ocean-entry timing and marine habitat-use, and their association with environmental conditions (e.g., sea-ice and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs)) of anadromous Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma malma) from the Canadian Arctic using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSAT) and data storage tags. Using this information, we evaluated the extent tagged fish occupied offshore (>5 km) habitats, and their proximity to a marine protected area (MPA) and areas of potential threats in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Ocean-entry by tagged fish using the western Mackenzie Delta for freshwater migration occurred approximately mid-June (range = 8–26 June) and closely followed landfast sea-ice break-up based on satellite imagery. While at sea, fish predominately occupied surface waters (<2 m) at SSTs of 5–10 °C. PSAT end-locations were 37–152 km offshore, typically near the sea-ice edge, greatly extending previously reported distances from shore in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. The spatial extent of offshore dispersal by Dolly Varden is likely influenced by SSTs and sea-ice conditions, and the physical properties of the Mackenzie River plume (e.g., turbidity), which extends preferred temperatures farther from shore. In relatively cooler years characterized by later sea-ice breakup and a summer sea-ice margin situated closer to shore, fish spent more time in nearshore than offshore habitats (51.7% vs. 48.3%) compared to warmer years (12.6% vs. 87.5%). Furthermore, fish typically occupied shallower offshore mean depths (2.2 m vs. 3.4 m) of the water column and experienced colder mean water temperatures (5.1 °C vs. 7.4 °C) in cooler versus warmer years. Dolly Varden were found within or adjacent to hydrocarbon lease areas and shipping lanes, and may be vulnerable to threats associated with these activities. Although PSATs reported outside of the MPA boundaries, which are situated adjacent to the Mackenzie Delta, occupancy in spring was inferred during ocean-entry and while transitioning to offshore areas. This first study to describe how environmental conditions influence marine distribution of Canadian Dolly Varden together with their proximity to anthropogenic threats is relevant for assessing impacts of climate change and future development. © 2021","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mackenzie Delta; Mackenzie River [Northwest Territories]; Northwest Territories; Salmonidae; Salvelinus malma; Salvelinus malma malma; abundance; anthropogenic effect; climate change; dispersal; environmental conditions; freshwater environment; habitat use; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon generation; protected area; sea ice; water column","Anadromous migration; Biotelemetry; Marine ecology; Offshore; Remote sensing; Salvelinus malma","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120700744"

Satellite-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl) is an important parameter to monitor phytoplankton blooms on synoptical scales, particularly in remote seas. However, the present NASA standard Chl algorithm tends to strongly underestimate the Chl in the Ross Sea. Based on a locally-tuned Chl algorithm in the Ross Sea and using the data record from MODIS between 2002 and 2020, here we investigated the spatial expansion of phytoplankton blooms in the Ross Sea. Our results show the geometric areas of the phytoplankton blooms could reach (7.20 ± 2.8) × 104 km2 on average, which was ~3.1 times that of those identified using the NASA default Chl algorithm. Spatially, blooms were frequently identified on the shelf of the Ross Sea polynya with a typical chance of ≥80%. In the context of climate change and global warming, the general decrease and interannual dynamics of sea ice cover tends to affect solar light penetration and surface seawater temperature, which were found to regulate the spatial expansion of the phytoplankton blooms over the years. Statistical analyses showed that the spatial coverages of the phytoplankton blooms were significantly correlated with sea surface temperature (Spearman correlation coefficient R = 0.55, at p < 0.05), sea surface wind speed (R = 0.42, at p < 0.05), and sea ice concentration (R = −0.84, at p < 0.05), yet without significant long-term (>10 years) trends over the study period. The stronger phytoplankton blooms than those previously observed may indicate larger carbon sequestration, which needs to be investigated in the future. More valid satellite observations under cloud covers will further constrain the estimates. © 2022 by the authors.

Many studies on satellite-based cloud-detection have been performed using the spectral characteristics of clouds in terms of reflectance and temperature. This study proposes a cloud-detection method using reflectance in four bands: 0.56 µm, 0.86 µm, 1.38 µm, and 1.61 µm. Methodologically, we present a conversion relationship between the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the green band in the visible spectrum for thick cloud detection using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. NDWI consists of reflectance at the 0.56 and 0.86 µm bands. For thin cloud detection, the 1.38 and 1.61 µm bands were applied with empirically determined threshold values. Case study analyses for the four seasons from 2000 to 2019 were performed for the sea surface area of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. In the case studies, the comparison of the proposed cloud-detection method with the MODIS cloud mask (CM) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation data indicated a probability of detection of 0.933, a false-alarm ratio of 0.086, and a Heidke Skill Score of 0.753. Our method demonstrated an additional important benefit in distinguishing clouds from sea ice or yellow dust, compared to the MODIS CM products, which usually misidentify the latter as clouds. Consequently, our cloud-detection method could be applied to a variety of low-orbit and geostationary satellites with 0.56, 0.86, 1.38, and 1.61 µm bands. © 2022 by the authors.

Arctic-wide maps that represent spatial patterns of sea ice roughness can be used to better characterize spatial patterns of ice convergence and divergence processes. Sea ice surface roughness can also control and quantify turbulent exchange between sea ice surface and atmosphere and therefore influence surface energy balance at the basin scale. We have developed a data processing system that produces georeferenced sea ice roughness rasters that can be mosaicked to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness. This approach starts with Top-of-Atmosphere radiance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We used red-band angular data from three MISR cameras (Ca, Cf, An). We created a training data set in which MISR pixels were matched with co-located and concurrent lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We used a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with the training data to calibrate the multi-angle data to values of surface roughness and then applied the algorithm to Arctic-wide MISR data for two 16-day periods in April (spring) and July (summer). After georeferencing the roughness rasters, we then mosaicked each 16-day roughness dataset to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness for spring and summer. Assessment of the results shows good agreement with independent ATM roughness data, not used in model development. A preliminary exploration of spatial and seasonal changes in sea ice roughness for two locations shows the ability to characterize the roughness of different ice types and the results align with previous studies. This processing system and its data products can help the sea ice research community to gain insights into the seasonal and interannual changes in sea ice roughness over the Arctic. © 2022 by the authors.","Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Surface roughness; Data-processing system; Ice age; Ice convergences; Ice surface roughness; Ice surfaces; Ice thickness; Influence surfaces; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Remote-sensing; Spatial patterns; Remote sensing","MISR; remote sensing; sea ice; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140027596"

Despite the harsh climatic condition, UAV is widely used in many Antarctic fields of basic and applied science, which still lacks a comprehensive and systematic literature review. Methods: We firstly discuss the special impact of Antarctic environmental conditions (meteorology, electromagnetic field, light, etc.) on the UAV operation. A comprehensive literature retrieval is subsequently presented on the current application of UAV in Antarctic research and expedition. We sort out 104 papers according to the time of publication, main journals, study areas, nations, and institutions. Representative literature is reviewed in seven application ar‍eas, including aeromechanics, atmosphere, sea ice and iceberg, glacier, geomorphology and geomagnetism, ecology-vegetation as well as ecology-animals. We retrospect the development and achievement of UAV's applications in the Chinese national Antarctic research and summarize the limitations of the research on the application of UAV in Antarctica. Results: A number of environmental factors need to be considered before the UAV missions, such as the meteorological conditions, electromagnetic field, solar radiations, and flight regulations. According to the review, half of the literature belongs to the journal paper, mostly in Polar Biology, Polar Science, and Remote Sensing. The earliest UAV research in Antarctica was published in 2004, followed by a productive period of International Polar Year in 2008. The first-tier countries including the USA, Australia, and Germany, led the progress in the research on UAVs in Antarctica. Meanwhile, the dominant role of top universities stood out via various collaborations. The UAV can also be classified into multiple categories according to the payload, such as the industrial- or consumer-grade optical cameras, radiosonde, synthetic aperture radar, and light detecting and ranging(LiDAR), among which consumer-grade camera is widely used in Antarctic investigations. China's Antarctic expedition team initiated the Antarctic UAV program in 2007 and had carried out at least 18 flight missions by 2020. The flights cov‍ered Zhongshan Station, The Great Wall Station, Inexpression Island, and the inland ice sheet, from which the collected data were employed to support the glaciological, geomorphic, and biological stud‍ies. Conclusions: The UAV remote sensing, as the essential technology in the""Air-Space-Ground"" polar observation system, has been increasingly upgraded in the recent decade. The flight experiments cov‍ered the primary research topics and research fields in Antarctic science. In general, the application and development of Antarctic UAV in China lie in the second tier, falling behind the USA and Australia. In the end, accord‍ing to the current development of Antarctic UAV in China, this paper provides guidance for China's Antarctic expedition team in the future: (1) Develop new UAV models; (2) Make breakthroughs in the battery technology; (3) Couple multiple sensors; (4) Encourage trans-disciplinary collaboration; (5) Promote for‍eign communication and sharing; (6) Participate in the international management. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

Five different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including the Cloude-Pottier decomposition (Cloude), the Freeman three-component decomposition (Freeman3), the Freeman three-component decomposition using the extended Bragg model (Freeman3X), the Yamaguchi three-component decomposition (Yamaguchi3), and the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED) were analyzed using 35 scenes of GF-3 PolSAR data collected over the Fram Strait, Arctic from June 14-18, 2017. Polarimetric features extracted from these five methods were evaluated and utilized to train random forest classifiers to classify open water (calm water and rough water) and sea ice types (melted ice, unmelted ice, and deformed ice). The results show that NNED could ensure physically valid decomposed powers while the other three model-based decompositions had negative values. In terms of sea ice classification, NNED had the highest feature importance scores and achieved an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of about 86.18% and 0.82, respectively. Inclusion of radar incidence angle as a feature in the classifier could slightly improve the classification accuracy by about 3%. The influence of incidence angle on sea ice classification accuracy was also investigated and it was found that high incidence angles (39°-46°) were superior to low incidence angles (21°-27°) due to the overall higher accuracies.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Fram Strait; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Ferroelectric RAM; Polarimeters; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic; Arctic sea ice; Gaofen-3; Ocean temperature; Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Random access memory; Random forests; Sea surfaces; Solid modelling; accuracy assessment; arctic environment; classification; decomposition analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; summer; synthetic aperture radar; Sea ice","Arctic sea ice; Gaofen-3; polarimetric decomposition; polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; random forest","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129421561"

The ultimate objective of this analysis is to better understand sea-ice topography to improve the estimation of the sea-ice freeboard for nadir-looking altimeters. We first introduce the use of an exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) distribution to fit the surface elevation probability density function (PDF). The characteristic function of the EMG distribution can be integrated in the modeling of radar altimeter waveforms. Our results indicate that the Arctic sea-ice elevation PDF is dominantly positively skewed and the EMG distribution is better suited to fit the PDFs than the classical Gaussian or lognormal PDFs. We characterize the elevation correlation characteristics by computing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and correlation length (CL) of the ATM measurements. To support the radar altimeter waveform retracking over sea ice, we perform this study typically on 1.5 km ATM along-track segments that reflect the footprint diameter size of radar altimeters.

Remote sensing and data classification were some of the fields that have widely depended on this continuously developing technology. In this context, remote sensing data related to places with harsh conditions have been missing, especially the ones related to SAR imagery. Such conditions include deserts, glaciers, and icebergs, where lots of people have lost their lives in, due to the lack of efficient methods of searching and finding these people in such critical timing. Training AI models on similar scenarios to fasten the process can be beneficial, but the lack of data is an obstacle in the way of development such models. In this paper, we propose using image generating AI systems to generate remote sensing datasets that are difficult to collect using normal imagery, thus creating more efficient image classification systems that can be used in scenarios such as locating missing people. Several AI models are discussed in this paper: Dall-E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, where they are found to vary a lot in terms of the generated images, that could be because of the architecture of the model, and the data they trained on. The overall performance of the AI models is promising. Dall-E 2 performed the best in our tests, followed by Stable Diffusion, and finally Midjourney. This research could open the door to using such models in generating lots of datasets, which might solve crucial problems.  © 2022 IEEE.","Arid regions; Classification (of information); Diffusion; Generative adversarial networks; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Condition; Data classification; Dataset; Diffusion model; Long lasting; Neural-networks; Remote data; Remote sensing classification; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; Remote sensing","Datasets; Diffusion Models; Generative Adversarial Networks; Remote Sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146372111"

However, the other side of the coin is that this opens a window to utilize the Arctic sea routes in the summer seasons, bringing remarkable economic benefits for ocean transportation between Asia and Europe. However, commercial vessels with low ice classes must tackle substantial environmental challenges in the Arctic sea routes, particularly those caused by variable sea ice, even in the melting seasons. Therefore, the science-based support for shipping safety in the Arctic sea routes is being given more prominence. Emerging satellite remote sensing technology plays a critical role in environmental monitoring in the Arctic. This paper reviews state-of-the-art satellite observations on monitoring sea ice and potential applications on supporting shipping activities in the Arctic Ocean. Moreover, we introduced a recently developed system based on satellite observations to support the safe transportation of Chinese cargo vessels in the Arctic northern sea route, demonstrating the efforts by both the science and business communities to promote the development of the polar silk road. © 2022 The Author(s).

The comparative studies were made on the difference in coastal erosion at different latitudes and the difference and influencing factors in coastal erosion at similar latitudes. The coastline retreatment is used to indicate coastal erosion. It is found that the most extensive erosion occurred along Alaska’s coast, followed by that of the Eastern Siberian coasts. Based on the analysis of the historical time series of snow and ice as well as climate data, it is found that at similar latitudes, the erosion of the Arctic coasts is closely related to the trend and fluctuations of the sea surface temperature (SST). Specifically, it is found that in Alaska, coastal erosion is closely related to the fluctuation of the SST, while in Eastern Siberia, it is related to the increasing or decreasing trend of the SST. A decreasing trend is associated with low coastal erosion, whereas an increasing trend is associated with accelerated coastal erosion. In the Arctic, the strong fluctuations of the SST, the continuous decline of the sea ice cover, and the consequent increase of the significant wave height are the critical factors that cause changes in coastal permafrost and coastal erosion. © 2022 by the authors.

While the sea ice area in the Arctic has been decreasing at a rate of about 4 % per decade, the multi-year ice (MYI), also called perennial ice, is decreasing at a faster rate of 10 %-15 % per decade. On the other hand, the sea ice area in the Antarctic region was slowly increasing at a rate of about 1.5 % per decade until 2014, and since then it has fluctuated without a clear trend. However, no data about ice type areas are available from that region, particularly for MYI. Due to differences in the physical and crystalline structural properties of sea ice and snow between the two polar regions, it has become difficult to identify ice types in the Antarctic. Until recently,no satellite retrieval scheme was ready to monitor the distribution and temporal development of Antarctic ice types, particularly MYI, throughout the freezing season and on timescales of several years. In this study, we have adapted a method for retrieving Arctic sea ice types and partial concentrations using microwave satellite observations to fit the Antarctic sea ice conditions. The core of the retrieval method is a mathematical scheme that needs empirical distributions of the microwave brightness temperature and backscatter input parameters for the different ice types. The first circumpolar, long-term time series of Antarctic sea ice types (MYI, first-year ice, and young ice) is being established, and so far covers the years 2013-2021. Qualitative comparison with (a) synthetic aperture radar data, (b) charts of the development stage of the sea ice, and (c) the Antarctic polynya distribution data show that the retrieved ice types, in particular the MYI, are reasonable. Although there are still some shortcomings, the new retrieval allows insight into the interannual evolution and dynamics of Antarctic sea ice types for the first time. The current time series can in principle be extended backwards to start in the year 2002 and can be continued with current and future sensors. © 2023 Christian Melsheimer et al.","Arctic; climate classification; global warming; microwave radiation; polar region; remote sensing; sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147286085"

In February 2021 the Arctica-M spacecraft No. 1 with a multispectral scanning device MSU-GS for hydrometeorological support was launched into a highly elliptical orbit. The MSU-GS receives radiation of the Earth surface and clouds in the 3 visible and 7 infrared (IR) spectral bands [1]. The MSU is an operational source of data on dynamic processes in the environment with a temporal resolution of 15-30 minutes. When studying surface characteristics, however, a significant limitation is cloud cover, the probability of which in some areas of the Arctic reaches 80% and more [2]. For many applications, quantitative values of Arctic environment parameters are needed regardless of cloud cover and time of day (illumination). These include, for example, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), ice drift speed and direction, ice concentration, area of land ice melting zones, type and intensity of solid and liquid precipitation, cloud liquid water content, total atmospheric water vapor content, and other geophysical parameters. The source of information on these parameters are the data obtained by microwave scanning radiometers, scatterometers, and radars of various types from polar orbiting satellites of various countries.

Data from these instruments is critical to enhancing understanding and modeling of ice-sheet dynamics and ice-sheet contributions to global sea level. Traditionally, ice-penetrating radar sounders have a single center frequency creating inherent ambiguity in their pulse-by-pulse received power due to the confounding effects of basal material and roughness. Interpreting ice-penetrating radar data in light of these ambiguities requires assumptions about the physical state of the ice sheet, large-scale empirical analyses, or ancillary data. Here, we demonstrate that a high radiometric fidelity, narrowband, multi-frequency radar sounder can overcome these issues by separating the frequency-dependent basal roughness signature from the frequency-independent basal material signature. We present a radar system architecture with three narrow frequency bands spaced orders of magnitude apart (center frequencies of 1, 10, and 100 MHz, each with 20% fractional bandwidth) and high radiometric resolution (±0.5 dB). This architecture will allow us to precisely constrain ice-sheet basal conditions on a pulse-by-pulse basis by disambiguating the effects of basal material and basal roughness in ice-penetrating radar data. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Acoustic devices; Architecture; Bandwidth; Glaciers; Radar; Radiometry; Sea level; Fractional bandwidths; Frequency independent; Narrow frequency band; Orders of magnitude; Radiometric fidelity; Radiometric resolution; Subglacial conditions; System architectures; data set; detection method; ground penetrating radar; image resolution; land-sea interaction; modeling; precision; radar; roughness; sea ice; Ice","Ice-penetrating radar; radar remote sensing; radar sounding; radiometric resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112653201"

In the Arctic, these typically represent newly formed sea ice, oil spills, and localized weather phenomena such as low wind or rain cells. The operational monitoring of low backscatter targets can benefit from a stronger integration of freely available SAR imagery from Sentinel-1. We, therefore, propose a detection method applicable to Sentinel-1 extra wide-swath (EW) SAR scenes. Using intensity values coupled with incidence angle and noise-equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) information, the image segmentation method is able to detect the low backscatter targets as one segment across subswaths.

The citation has now been inserted in “3.5. The Role of Drone Data Derived Vegetation Indices and Machine Algorithms in Remote Sensing Water Quality and Quantity” as reference [60] and should read: “Numerous vegetation indices were derived from drone remotely sensed data for characterising surface water quality and quantity. The most widely used sections of the electromagnetic spectrum in detecting water quality parameters were the visible section (blue and green) and the NIR wavebands. In this regard, vegetation indices such as the red and near-infrared (NIR), Surface Algal Bloom Index (SABI) [60], two-band algorithm (2BDA) [26], NDVI, and Green NDV [33], as well as band combinations and differencing such as (R+NIR/G) were used mostly in characterising chlorophyll content as well as TSS. As was suggested in many studies, the combination of sensitive spectral variables with robust and efficient algorithms produce accurate models. This study noted that algorithms such as linear regression (LR), image differencing, matching pixel-by-pixel (mpp), artificial neural networks (ANN), and the Manning–Strickler and adaptive cosine estimator were utilised in characterising mostly water quality parameters (Figure 9). The mpp-based algorithms were also detected during the bibliometric analysis illustrated in Figure 3 (red cluster). Despite being a parametric estimator, LR was the most widely used algorithm because it is simple to implement [61] across various statistical platforms ranging from Microsoft Excel to R statistics. Since LR is a parametric statistic, it requires the data to suit specific assumptions such as normality that are often a challenge to attain. In this regard, there is a need for more efforts in assessing the utility of robust machine learning algorithms such as stochastic gradient boosting, random forest, and the ANN in mapping water quality based on drone remotely sensed data (Figure 10).” For the references after 60, should be revised like below: Original 60 change to 61; Original 61 change to 62; Original 62 change to 63; Original 63 change to 64; Original 64 change to 65; Original 65 change to 66; Original 66 change to 67; Original 67 change to 68; Original 68 change to 69; Original 69 change to 70; Original 70 change to 71; Original 71 change to 72; Original 72 change to 73; Original 73 change to 74; Original 74 change to 75; Original 75 change to 76; Original 76 change to 77; Original 77 change to 78; Original 78 change to 79. Which the corresponding citations in the main text should be changed like below: “4.1. Evolution of Drone Technology Applications in Remote Sensing Water Quality and Quantity, the second paragraph.” Meanwhile, results showed that more efforts from the community of practice were widely exerted towards mapping water quality in relation to water quantity. Specifically, only fourteen studies assessed the level of water, whereas thirty-seven studies assessed water quality parameters based on drone remotely sensed data [44,47–49,62–72]. A few examples of studies that mapped water levels included Ridolfi and Manciola [63], who used a method that was based on the Ground Control Points (GCPs) to detect water levels, where water level values were measured using drone-derived data. Meanwhile, Adongo et al. [64] assessed the utility of undertaking bathymetric surveys combined with geographic information systems (GIS) functionalities in remotely determining the reservoir volume of nine irrigation dams in three northern regions of Ghana. On the other hand, the majority of water quality-related studies that were conducted based on drone remotely sensed data, principally mapped and monitored the chlorophyll content [30,32,33,37,38] and turbidity in lakes, ponds, and dams (Figure 5b) [34–36]. This trend was also revealed through the bibliometric analysis illustrated in Figure 3. Other water quality parameters that were of interest include the chemical oxygen demand (COD) [26,35,73], Secchi disk depth (ZSD) [26,34,74], total nitrogen [35], total phosphorous [35,72], conductivity [24–26,73], water quality index [73], pH [27,75], total suspended solids (TSS) [28,29,76], dissolved Oxygen (DO) [75,77], and turbidity [35,48], in order of importance illustrated by their frequency in the literature. “4.2. Challenges in the Application of Drone Technologies with Special Reference to the Global South, the first paragraph.” The major challenge associated with many regions is the statutory regulations that govern the operation of UAVs [77–79]. In many countries, there are still stringent restrictions regarding where and how UAVs are supposed to be operated [16]. In some countries of the global south, the take-off mass, the maximum altitude of flight, and the operational areas of drones tend to be regulated [16]. For instance, the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) stipulates that remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft should not be operated at 50 m or closer to any person or group of persons. It states that remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft must not be operated at an altitude higher than 45.72 m (150 ft) from the ground unless approved by the Director of Civil Aviation of the SACAA. Remotely piloted aircraft or toy aircraft weighing more than 7 kg should be operated only if approved by the SACAA (http://www.caa.co.za/pages/rpas/remotely%20piloted%20aircraft%20 systems.aspx, accessed on 19 July 2021). The size of the UAV which is often associated with its batteries, engine efficiency, load, and type of UAV (fixed-wing or multi-rotor) tends to determine the length of time it can spend on a single flight plan and the size of the area it can cover [46,79]. In this regard, the regulation on the mass of UAV at taking off tends to indirectly restrict the areal extent that can be covered as well as the size of the camera to be mounted for research purposes, amongst other uses [16,68]. © 2022, MDPI.

Mass loss caused by iceberg calving represents up to half of the total loss of mass from the Antarctic ice shelves. As they melt and drift with the ocean currents, icebergs provide a significant source of freshwater input to the surface layer of the ocean, enough to affect the stability of stratification in the upper ocean. Any increased freshwater in iceberg discharge, or ice shelf melt, likely has a major impact on the ocean circulation by delivering sufficient freshwater, which will play a critical role in many geophysical and biological processes. The iceberg freeboard is an important geometric parameter for measuring the thickness of an iceberg and estimating its volume. Because of the paucity of high-precision measurements on iceberg thickness, large uncertainties exist on the iceberg’s ice volume estimation of the Southern Ocean. The freeboard of large icebergs has been successfully extracted using the altimetry method. These large uncertainties exist, however, because of the insufficient altimeter coverage of various icebergs. On the basis of the fact that an iceberg can cast an elongated shadow on the surface of sea ice in winter, this study proposes a method to measure the iceberg freeboard by using shadow length and the predefined or estimated solar elevation angle. Three Landsat 8 panchromatic images with center solar elevation angles of 5.43°, 7.49°, and 11.01° on August 29, September 7, and September 16 in 2016, respectively, are selected to test our method. The shadow lengths of five isolated tabular icebergs are automatically extracted to calculate the freeboard height. For an accuracy assessment, we perform cross-validation on the matching points at different times. Results show that the measurement error of shadow length is less than one pixel. When the sun elevation angle is lower than 11.01°, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the iceberg freeboard from the 15 m panchromatic image is less than 2.0 m, and the mean absolute error (MAE) is less than 1.5 m. The experiment shows that under the angle of low solar elevation in winter, the Landsat 8 15 m panchromatic images can be used for high-precision measurement of the iceberg freeboard and has the potential to measure the Antarctic iceberg freeboard at a large scale. © 2022 Science Press.

However, scarce field observations pose a challenge in understanding the long-term trend of CO2 uptake capacity on this continental shelf. We adopted a machine-learning-based approach to construct a 17-years (2003–2019) long-term time series of summer sea surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) from remote sensing products. We show that the long-term increase in CO2 uptake capacity can be attributed to strong and enhanced biological uptake. In addition, the intraseasonal variability of surface pCO2 in early summer confirms the crucial role of sea ice melt and the subsequently enhanced photosynthesis as soon as the surface ocean converts into an open system. Our results thus highlight the use of remote sensing data in interpolating/extrapolating the highly dynamic carbonate system in the continental shelf sea and shed light into future studies involving machine learning or algorithms. © 2021.

However, a scarcity of observations hampers the confidence of reanalyses in this Arctic hotspot region. Here, we study the warming over the past 20–40 years based on new available SAT observations and a quality controlled comprehensive SAT dataset from the northern archipelagos in the Barents Sea. We identify a statistically significant record-high annual warming of up to 2.7 °C per decade, with a maximum in autumn of up to 4.0 °C per decade. Our results are compared with the most recent global and Arctic regional reanalysis data sets, as well as remote sensing data records of sea ice concentration (SIC), sea surface temperature (SST) and high-resolution ice charts. The warming pattern is primarily consistent with reductions in sea ice cover and confirms the general spatial and temporal patterns represented by reanalyses. However, our findings suggest even a stronger rate of warming and SIC-SAT relation than was known in this region until now. © 2022, The Author(s).","air temperature; Arctic; article; autumn; Barents Sea; remote sensing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; warming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132199487"

Microwave remote sensors with medium incidence and normal incidence modes are the primary detection methods for sea ice types. The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) is a new type of sensor with a small incidence angle detection mode that is different from traditional remote sensors. The method of sea ice detection using SWIM data is also under development. The research reported here concerns ice classification using SWIM data in the Arctic from October 2019 to April 2020. Six waveform features are extracted from the SWIM echo data at small incidence angles, then the distinguishing capabilities of a single feature are analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. The classifiers of the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine are established and chosen based on single features. Moreover, sea ice classification based on multi-feature combinations is carried out using the chosen KNN classifier, and optimal combinations are developed. Compared with sea ice charts, the overall accuracy is up to 81% using the optimal classifier and a multi-feature combination at 2°. The results reveal that SWIM data can be used to classify sea water and sea ice types. Moreover, the optimal multi-feature combinations with the KNN method are applied to sea ice classification in the local regions. The classification results are analyzed using Sentinel-1 SAR images. In general, it is concluded that these multifeature combinations with the KNN method are effective in sea ice classification using SWIM data. Our work confirms the potential of sea ice classification based on the new SWIM sensor, and highlight the new sea ice monitoring technology and application of remote sensing at small incidence angles. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper presents the results of the analysis of the world's largest iceberg (A-76 iceberg), which was formed during a calving event in the Ronne Ice Shelf (RIS) on May 13, 2020, and subsequently broke into three fragments (A-76A, A-76B, and A-76C icebergs). The iceberg development cycle, up to this point, including its formation, separation and drift, was observed and analyzed. The detailed development process of rifts associated with the detachment of the A-76 iceberg in front of RIS before calving was analyzed using remote sensing data from multiple sources (ERS, RADARSAT-1, ALOS PALSAR, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8). In addition, based on a total of 66 Sentinel-1 A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired between May 13, 2021 and March 11, 2022, a multi-scale segmentation approach was applied to continuously track the drift path of A-76 icebergs, A-76A, A-76B, and A-76C. We calculated the average drift velocity of these icebergs and found that A-76C iceberg drifted the fastest, followed by A-76A, and A-76B, from May 30, 2021, to March 11, 2022. Future tracking of other iceberg parameters, such as area, thickness, freeboard, and volume, could help assess the melting rates of the icebergs.  © Authors 2022","Image segmentation; Remote sensing; Sea level; Synthetic aperture radar; Antarctic ice sheets; Antarctica; Dynamic changes; Ice shelves; Iceberg calfing; Mass balance; Rift; Ronne ice shelf; Satellite observations; Sea level rise; Sea ice","Iceberg Calving; Rift; Ronne Ice Shelf; Satellite Observation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131947664"

Most models default to five thickness categories. However, little has been done to explore the effects of the resolution of this distribution (number of categories) on sea-ice feedbacks in a coupled model framework and resulting representation of the sea ice mean state. Here, we explore this using sensitivity experiments in CESM2 with the standard 5 ice thickness categories and 15 ice thickness categories. Increasing the resolution of the ITD in a run with preindustrial climate forcing results in substantially thicker Arctic sea ice year-round. Analyses show that this is a result of the ITD influence on ice strength. With 15 ITD categories, weaker ice occurs for the same average thickness, resulting in a higher fraction of ridged sea ice. In contrast, the higher resolution of thin ice categories results in enhanced heat conduction and bottom growth and leads to only somewhat increased winter Antarctic sea ice volume. The spatial resolution of the ICESat-2 satellite mission provides a new opportunity to compare model outputs with observations of seasonal evolution of the ITD in the Arctic (ICESat-2; 2018–2021). Comparisons highlight significant differences from the ITD modeled with both runs over this period, likely pointing to underlying issues contributing to the representation of average thickness. © 2022.

These data assimilation systems are critical to the success of global numerical weather prediction systems including the Global Earth Observing System–Atmospheric Data Assimilation System (GEOS-ADAS). Extending more surface sensitive microwave channels over land, snow, and ice could provide a needed source of data for numerical weather prediction particularly in the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Unfortunately, the accuracy of emissivity models cur-rently available within the GEOS-ADAS along with other data assimilation systems are insufficient to simulate and assimilate radiances. Recently, Munchak et al. published a 5-yr climatological database for retrieved microwave emissivity from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) aboard the GPM mission. In this work the database is utilized by modifying the GEOS-ADAS to use this emissivity database in place of the default emissivity value available in the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), which is the fast radiative transfer model used by the GEOS-ADAS. As a first step, the GEOS-ADAS is run in a so-called stand-alone mode to simulate radiances from GMI using the default CRTM emissivity, and replacing the default CRTM emissivity models with values from Munchak et al. The simulated GMI observations using Munchak et al. agree more closely with observations from GMI. These results are presented along with a discus-sion of the implication for GMI observations within the GEOS-ADAS. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.","Boundary layers; Database systems; Microwaves; Radiative transfer; Sea ice; Snow; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric data; Community radiative transfer models; Data assimilation; Data assimilation systems; Emissivity models; Global earth observing systems; GPM Microwave Imager; Microwave observations; Numerical weather prediction; Remote-sensing; data assimilation; database; emissivity; EOS; land-sea interaction; microwave imagery; remote sensing; sea ice; snow; Remote sensing","Data assimilation; Microwave observations; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139165016"

The experiments were motivated by the fact that lower frequencies penetrate deeper into a frozen surface, thus offering the possibility to measure physical temperatures at great depths in ice sheets and, subsequently, other unique geophysical observables including sea ice salinity. These experiments were made feasible by recent engineering advances in electronics, antenna design, and noise removal algorithms when operating outside of protected bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. These technical advances permit a new type of radiometer that not only operates at low frequency, but also obtains continuous spectral information over the band from 0.5 to 2 GHz. Spectral measurements facilitate an understanding of the physical processes controlling emission and also support the interpretation of results from single frequency instruments. This paper reviews the development of low-frequency, wide band radiometry and its application to cryosphere science over the past 10 years. The paper summarizes the engineering design of an airborne instrument and the associated algorithms to mitigate radio frequency interference. Theoretical models of emission built around the morphologic and electrical properties of cryospheric components are also described that identify the dominant physical processes contributing to emission spectra. New inversion techniques for geophysical parameter retrieval are summarized for both Arctic and Antarctic scenarios. Examples that illustrate how the measurements are used to inform on glaciological problems are presented. The paper concludes with a description of new instrument concepts that are foreseen to extend the technology into operation from space.

Therefore, it is the key to accurately judge the type of sea ice around the ship. However, remote sensing technology will be restricted by external weather changes. Therefore, this paper presents a method based on statistical feature extraction and machine learning of ship main engine vibration signal, so as to realize the recognition of sea ice types. Firstly, according to the sea ice video information captured by the camera, the acceleration and vibration data collected by the vibration sensor are divided, and the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm is adopted to enhance the features. Then, based on the statistical characteristics of vibration signals, time domain and frequency domain features are extracted.

Measuring the associated phytoplankton responses to air–sea CO2 fluxes is challenging using traditional satellite passive ocean color measurements due to low solar elevation angles. We constructed a feedforward neural network light detection and ranging (LiDAR; FNN-LID) method to assess the Arctic diurnal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and formed a dataset of long-time-series variations in diurnal air–sea CO2 fluxes from 2001 to 2020; this study represents the first time spaceborne LiDAR data were employed in research on the Arctic air–sea carbon cycle, thus providing enlarged data coverage and diurnal pCO2 variations. Although some models replace Arctic winter Chl-a with the climatological average or interpolated Chl-a values, applying these statistical Chl-a values results in potential errors in the gap-filled wintertime pCO2 maps. The CALIPSO measurements obtained through active LiDAR sensing are not limited by solar radiation and can thus provide ‘fill-in’ data in the late autumn to early spring seasons, when ocean color sensors cannot record data; thus, we constructed the first complete record of polar pCO2. We obtained Arctic FFN-LID-fitted in situ measurements with an overall mean R2 of 0.75 and an average RMSE of 24.59 µatm and filled the wintertime observational gaps, thereby indicating that surface water pCO2 is higher in winter than in summer. The Arctic Ocean net CO2 sink has seasonal sources from some continental shelves. The growth rate of Arctic seawater pCO2 is becoming larger and more remarkable in sectors with significant sea ice retreat. The combination of sea surface partial pressure and wind speed impacts the diurnal carbon air–sea flux variability, which results in important differences between the Pacific and Atlantic Arctic Ocean. Our results show that the diurnal carbon sink is larger than the nocturnal carbon sink in the Atlantic Arctic Ocean, while the diurnal carbon sink is smaller than the nocturnal carbon sink in the Pacific Arctic Ocean. © 2022 by the authors.","Feedforward neural networks; Growth rate; Oceanography; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Wind; Air sea flux; Air–sea carbon flux; Arctic ocean; CALIPSO; Carbon fluxes; Carbon sink; Diurnal variation; LiDAR; Remote-sensing; Sink-in; Carbon dioxide","air–sea carbon flux; CALIPSO; diurnal variation; LiDAR; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144817888"

Most notably, field, remote sensing, and model-based studies have demonstrated that massive under-ice phytoplankton blooms (UIBs) contribute substantially to annual NPP and can even drive increases in sedimentary nitrogen recycling and loss through coupled partial nitrification-denitrification. In this study, we used a 1-D biogeochemical model (CAOS-GO) to compare the magnitude of NPP associated with UIBs in the northern and southern Chukchi Sea between 1988 and 2018. While UIBs were critical in driving interannual variation and secular increases in annual NPP and sedimentary nitrification and denitrification in the northern Chukchi Sea, UIBs were far less important at our southern site. As the length of the under-ice (UI) period diminished between 1988 and 2018 in the southern Chukchi Sea, there was a decrease in the amount of NPP produced during the UI period. Despite higher rates of both annual NPP and denitrification at the southern site, there were no secular trends in these rates over time. Our results indicate that, as sea ice continues to retreat earlier, the impact of UIBs on the biogeochemistry of the Chukchi Sea is likely to diminish. © 2022. American Geophysical Union.

The proposed system is based on an ensemble of deep learning models and conditional random field postprocessing. The following surface ice formations were considered: Icebergs, Deformed ice, Level ice, Broken ice, Ice floes, Floebergs, Floebits, Pancake ice, and Brash ice. Additionally, five non-surface ice categories were considered: Sky, Open water, Shore, Underwater ice, and Melt ponds. To find input parameters for the approach, the performance of 12 different neural network architectures was explored and evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. The best performance was achieved using an ensemble of models having pyramid pooling layers (PSPNet, PSPDenseNet, DeepLabV3+, and UPerNet) and convolutional conditional random field postprocessing with a mean intersection over union score of 0.799, and this outperformed the best single-model approach. The results of this study show that when per-class performance was considered, the Sky was the easiest class to predict, followed by Deformed ice and Open water. Melt pond was the most challenging class to predict. Furthermore, we have extensively explored the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and, in the process, discovered the types of scenes that pose a more significant challenge to the underlying neural networks.

Most notable for the CDR Version 4 is the addition of the early passive microwave record, 1979 to 1987. The focus of this study is on long-term trends in monthly extent and area. In addition to hemispheric trends, regional analysis is also carried out, including use of a new Northern Hemisphere regional mask. The results indicate overall good consistency between the products, with all three products showing strong statistically significant negative trends in the Arctic and small borderline significant positive trends in the Antarctic. Regionally, the patterns are similar, except for a notable outlier of the NT area having a steeper trend in the Central Arctic, likely related to increasing surface melt. Other differences are due to varied approaches to quality control, e.g., weather filtering and correction of mixed land-ocean grid cells. Another factor, particularly in regards to NT trends with BT or CDR, is the inter-sensor calibration approach, which yields small discontinuities between the products. These varied approaches yield small differences in trends. In the Arctic, such differences are not critical, but in the Antarctic, where overall trends are near zero and borderline statistically significant, the differences are potentially important in the interpretation of trends. © 2022 by the authors.

The Baseline-D height product of CryoSat-2 was recently upgraded and released in 2019. Based on the internal or locally external evaluation of CryoSat-2 Baseline-D ice heights, we extended the validation both heterogeneously and spatially to accomplish a comprehensive assessment. First, reliable ice surface global navigation satellite system point solutions along the 36th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition traverse functioned as a height reference for comparison with the CryoSat-2 SAR synthetic aperture radar interferometric mode (SIN) data. Secondly, the Land Ice Along-Track Height product over Lambert-Amery system (LAS) from ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite 2 (ICESat-2), was also applied to validate CryoSat-2 SIN and low-resolution mode (LRM) data. As the results indicate, the SIN height accuracy is evaluated to be -1.68 m ± 2.35 m (slope < 0.65°) along the traverse and -0.96 ± 1.95 m (slope < 0.95° and roughness < 3 m) over the margin of LAS. The LRM height accuracy is evaluated to be -0.13 ± 0.46 m (slope < 0.1° & roughness < 1 m) over the interior of LAS. The standard deviation of the height differences degrades linearly against the limited growth of the terrain slope/roughness at the confidence level of 99%. It is worth noting that the spatially heterogeneous pattern of height differences is correlated with surface topography variations.

Several hundreds of such radars are in operation, yet only a handful of experiments have been conducted to assess the prospect of utilizing this technology for the remote sensing of sea ice. Even then, the measurements carried out have addressed only the most basic questions: is there ice present, and can we measure its drift? Recently the theory that describes HF scattering from the dynamic sea surface was extended to handle situations where an ice cover is present. With this new tool, it becomes feasible to interpret the corresponding radar echoes in terms of the structural, mechanical, and electrical properties of the ice field. In this paper we look briefly at ice sensing from space-borne sensors before showing how the persistent and synoptic wide area surveillance capabilities of HF radar offer an alternative. The dispersion relations of different forms of sea ice are examined and used in a modified implementation of the electromagnetic scattering theory employed in HF radar oceanography to compute the corresponding radar signatures.

Nowadays， with the rapid development of satellite imaging techniques， remote sensing scene classification which uses High Spatial Resolution （HSR） remote sensing images has received， considerable attention recently， as can be used in natural hazards detection， traffic control， and object detection etc. Based on the feature representation used for remote sensing scene classification， the existing scene classification approaches can be categorized into three classes： handcrafted feature based methods， unsupervised feature learning-based methods， and deep feature learning-based methods. Convolutional Neural Networks （CNNs）， one of the deep feature learning-based methods， have achieved great success in the computer vision community. Especially， the powerful feature representations learned through CNNs have been widely used in remote sensing scene classification， but due to the different scale information of ground targets and the complex spatial distribution and texture information of the scene images， the classification effect of the scene classification algorithm based on CNN is insufficient good. For addressing the above problems， the paper proposes a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by a sparse second-order attention mechanism （MCNN-SSAM） while comprehensively considering the accuracy of scene classification and feature dimensions. The proposed MCNN-SSAM network includes the following parts： backbone network， pyramid convolution module， sparse second-order attention module and softmax classification layer. The network firstly inserts a multi-scale convolution layer after the backbone network to acquire the characteristic expressions of different scale information targets of the ground target， and embeds the group convolution into the multi-scale convolution layer to reduce the computational complexity； Secondly， after discuss the advantage of the attention mechanism of first and second-order statistics， a sparse second order attention mechanism is proposed to enhance the discriminability of channel information of different scale convolution features. The sparsity of the attention mechanism is able to effectively reduce the feature dimension of the second-order statistics while ensuring the performance of scene classification； Finally， the multi-scale convolutional layer and the sparse second-order attention mechanism are embedded into the proposed network for end-to-end training. We conduct extensive experiments on two challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets， i.e.， AID （Aerial Image Dataset） and NWPU45 （NWPU-RESISC45） datasets. The AID dataset contains 10 000 images in RGB space， which has 30 different scene classes and of size 600×600 in each class； There are 31 500 optical RS images for 45 scene classes， and each image measures 256×256 pixels on the NWPU45 dataset. In this paper， the VGG-16 network is selected as the backbone of MCNN-SSAM， and the Adam optimizer is used for end-to-end training. The training parameters of the proposed network are set as follows： initial learning rate 0.001， weight attenuation coefficient 0.001， batch size 32， momentum 0.9. All experiments are implemented in PyTorch， NVIDIA GeForce GTX 8G 1070 Ti GPU， and 32.00 GB RAM. we make the experimental result on AID dataset to analyze the influence of some important parameters on the MCNN-SSAM， then we can conclude that the number of the atoms in the dictionary and low-rank matrix parameters have a greater impact on the remote sensing scene classification performance of the proposed MCNN-SSAM. Afterwards， we compare MCNN-SSAM with some related networks， i.e.， AlexNet， VGG-16， SAFF， MSCP， and CapsNet. The experimental results show that： compared with the benchmark network （VGG-16）， the overall accuracy （OA） of MCNN-SSAM is improved by 5.27%~5.34% and 10.20%~10.82%； While compared with the SAFF， MSCP， and CapsNet networks， the remote sensing scene classification accuracy is improved by 0.23%~1.61% and 1.34%~2.75%. Additionally， based on the confusion matrix， we can observe that most of the remote sensing scene classes can be classified easily and correctly， some even achieving high classification accuracies， i.e.， mountains and viaducts in the AID dataset， jungles and sea ice in the NWPU45 dataset. Meanwhile， the effectiveness of the Sparse Second-order Attention Mechanism （SSAM） is verified by comparing with other related attention mechanisms and heat map results. Finally， we make the ablation generalization experiments to verify the effectiveness of MCNN-SSAM， such as SENet （Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks）， CovNet which is based on covariance statistics， and SSAM. We can conclude that， whether the CNN features or multi-scale MCNN features， compared with the attention mechanism based on first-order feature statistics （CNN+SENet and MCNN+SENet）， The scene classification accuracy obtained by CNN+CovNet， CNN+SSAM， MCNN+CovNet， and MCNN+SSAM which are based on the attention mechanism of second-order feature statistics has been further improved. In addition， MCNN module， SSAM module， and the fusion of these two modules can improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing image scene images. In this paper， we propose a multi-scale convolutional neural network driven by sparse second-order attention mechanism for remote sensing scene classification.

However, traditional ice velocity monitoring methods require buoys, which are costly and inefficient to distribute. It was found that UAV remote sensing images combined with machine vision technology yielded obvious practical advantages in ice velocity monitoring. Current research has mainly monitored sea ice velocity through GPS or satellite remote sensing technology, with few reports available on river ice velocity monitoring. Moreover, traditional river ice velocity monitoring methods are subjective. To solve the problems of existing time-consuming and inaccu-rate ice velocity monitoring methods, a new ice velocity extraction method based on UAV remote sensing technology is proposed in this article. In this study, the Mohe River section in Heilongjiang Province was chosen as the research area. High-resolution orthoimages were obtained with a UAV during the ice flood period, and feature points in drift ice images were then extracted with the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. Moreover, the extracted feature points were matched with the brute force (BF) algorithm. According to optimization results obtained with the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, the motion trajectories of these feature points were tracked, and an ice displacement rate field was finally established. The results indicated that the average ice velocities in the research area reached 2.00 and 0.74 m/s, and the maximum ice velocities on the right side of the river center were 2.65 and 1.04 m/s at 16:00 on 25 April 2021 and 8:00 on 26 April 2021, respectively. The ice velocity decreased from the river center toward the river banks. The proposed ice velocity monitoring technique and reported data in this study could provide an effective reference for the prediction of ice flood disasters. © 2022 by the authors.

First, the quality level (QL) 3 MODIS SSTs are classified into cloudy or clear-sky pixels based on MODIS cloud mask products. The cloudy SST pixels, flagged as confident cloudy or probably cloudy in the cloud masks, are further classified into three groups according to their associated daytime cloud-top and optical properties. Taking the SSTs measured by 11 buoys over one year as the reference data, those three groups of cloudy SSTs are significantly underestimated, with biases of -33.45 °C, -6.35 °C, and -4.72 °C. The QL 3 clear-sky SSTs are identified as probably and confident clear in the cloud masks and are not influenced by clouds, with a bias of nearly 0 °C. Then, three support vector regression (SVR) models are individually proposed for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. Taking the cloud-top and optical parameters as inputs of the proposed SVR models, we can obtain SSTs with a bias of 0 °C and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 1.6 °C for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. The method proposed in this study shows the potential for TIR SST estimation under some cloudy conditions using satellite remote sensing cloud products. Considering the RMSE of 0.4 °C in operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis, further study is needed before actual applying the method proposed in this study. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atmospheric temperature; Infrared radiation; Mean square error; Optical properties; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Support vector regression; Surface properties; Surface waters; Cloud mask products; Cloudy conditions; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Optical parameter; Root mean square errors; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surface temperature (SST); Support vector regression (SVR); cloud; MODIS; remote sensing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; support vector machine; Oceanography","Clouds; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); sea surface temperature (SST); thermal infrared (TIR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111595362"

To measure sea ice elevation, a theory of polarimetric interferometry for both monostatic and bistatic radars is developed based on analytic solutions of Maxwell's equations, accounting for realistic and complicated properties of snow, sea ice, and seawater. This analytic method inherently preserves phase information that is imperative for radar polarimetry and interferometry. Among a multitude of complex radar coefficients in the general polarimetric interferometric covariance matrix, the symmetry group theory is utilized to identify and select appropriate terms pertaining to the retrieval of sea ice elevation while avoiding radar parameters that may inadvertently introduce non-uniqueness and excessive uncertainty. Theoretical calculations compare well with field observations for rough and old sea ice encountered in the Operation-IceBridge and TanDEM-X Antarctic Science Campaign over the Western Weddell Sea. The results show that the magnitude of the coefficient of normalized correlation between co-polarized horizontal and co-polarized vertical radar returns is inversely related to sea ice elevation, while the associate phase term is nonlinear and noisy and should be excluded. From these analyses, a protocol is set up to measure Antarctic sea ice elevation to be presented in the next companion paper. © 2022 Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.

In addition to providing sea ice forecasts for disaster prevention and risk mitigation, sea ice numerical models could help explain the sea ice variability within the context of climate change in marine ecosystems, such as spotted seals, which are the only ice-dependent animal that breeds in Chinese waters. Here, we developed NEMO-Bohai, an ocean-ice coupled model based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model version 4.0 and Sea Ice Modelling Integrated Initiative (SI3) (NEMO4.0-SI3) for the Bohai Sea. This study will present the scientific design and technical choices of the parameterizations for the NEMO-Bohai model. The model was calibrated and evaluated with in situ and satellite observations of the ocean and sea ice. The model simulations agree with the observations with respect to sea surface height (SSH), temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), currents, and temperature and salinity stratification. The seasonal variation of the sea ice area is well simulated by the model compared to the satellite remote sensing data for the period of 1996-2017. Overall agreement is found for the occurrence dates of the annual maximum sea ice area. The simulated sea ice thickness and volume are in general agreement with the observations with slight overestimations. NEMO-Bohai can simulate seasonal sea ice evolution and long-term interannual variations. Hence, NEMO-Bohai is a valuable tool for long-term ocean and ice simulations and climate change studies. © 2022 The Author(s).","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; climate change; ice thickness; ice-ocean interaction; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea surface height; spatial resolution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125172267"

HY-1C and HY-1D was launched in September 7, 2018 and Jun 11, 2020, respectively. Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS), Coastal Zone Imager (CZI), Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI), Satellite-based Calibration Spectrometer (SCS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) are the key payloads onboard HY-1C and HY-1D. The HY-1C/D constellation has been detecting the global ocean color twice and sea surface temperature (SST) four times every day, and high- resolution (50m) China’s coastal zone and offshore environments twice every three days. In this article, the HY-1C/D satellites and the specifications of the payloads, flow-process, product levels and distribution of data products are introduced. The overpass times are 10:30 am±30 min and 1:30 pm±30 min of local time at the descending node for HY-1C and ascending node for HY-1D, respectively. The HY-1C/D satellites complete processing chains for generating raw data, radiances, ocean color and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the payloads by Geo-location, radiometric and atmospheric correction, geophysical parameters retrieval, data gridding and merging. There are different data products associated with the five levels of processing (Level 0 to Level 4). Data products of Level-1 (radiances), 2 (ocean color parameters and SST), 3 (gridded products) and 4 (merged gridded products) are available from the China Ocean Satellite Data Service Center to the general public for free. The HY-1C/D satellites product structure system is complete and data product processing and distribution are efficient. The typical products of Chlorophyll-a concentration and SST, the applications on floating green tides algae Ulva prolifera, sea ice, offshore aquaculture, inland water and tropical cyclones are also presented in this article. Maps of global daily gridded chlorophyll-a concentration and SST (L3A products) from COCTS onboard the HY-1C and HY-1D are presented to show their temporal and spatial coverage. The CZI remote sensing images have being used to extract the distribution location and area of offshore green tide, sea ice and offshore aquaculture facilities. The process of ice shelf falling off and drifting around Antarctic continent has been monitored by using a long time series CZI remote sensing images. In addition to offshore and coastal environmental monitoring applications, HY-1C/D remote sensing data products have also been applied in inland water algal bloom, typhoon cloud map and its moving path monitoring. The typical products and application shown in this article indicates that the sensors and the data products of HY-1C/D have high quality and great application potential in marine and coastal environmental monitoring. The planned future satellites including the next generation of Chinese ocean color satellites and geostationary coastal zone and ocean environment monitoring satellite and their key specifications are briefly introduced.

Especially with the temperatures rising globally the rate of calving of icebergs has increased and thus increasing their probability of them drifting into the major ship lanes posing various threats to people all across the world. Being an open hazard to the ocean, monitoring the iceberg behaviour is critical to ensure the safety of maritime activities. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images prove to be of major help in studying these icebergs since they strongly influence the SAR backscattering. However due to similarities in scattering behaviour of icebergs and background clutter because of their irregular shapes and sizes, it becomes challenging to accurately classify/identify them. Although the current state of the art techniques like decompositions, model-based scattering power decomposition and eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition are quite helpful but they come with their own set of limitations. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to explore the application of Deep learning on PolSAR data with Six-component scattering matric power decomposition for efficient identification and classification of the icebergs. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Deep learning; Iceberg; Maritime activities; Model based decompositions; Ocean monitoring; PolSAR; Radar data; Synthetic aperture radar images; Temperature rising; Workers'; Neural networks","Artificial Neural Network; Deep Learning; iceberg; Model-based Decomposition; PolSAR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140407103"

Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity of segmented ice floes. It is tolerant to perturbations and deficiencies of floe shapes, which enhances the density of retrieved sea ice motion vectors. The PHD algorithm can be applied to sequential images from different sensors, and was tested on two combined image mosaics consisting of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data acquired over the Fram Strait; the PHD algorithm successfully produced pairs of matched ice floes. The matching result has been verified using shape and surface texture similarity of the ice floes.

However, European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative algorithm from AMSR-E/AMSR2 (SICCI-AMSR), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility from SSM/I or SSMIS (OSI-SSMI), the ARTIST Sea Ice algorithm from SSM/I or SSMIS (ASI-SSMI), and the NASA Team algorithm from SSM/I or SSMIS (NT1-SSMI) are all lower than DPR-AMSR at sea ice edge. And NT1-SSMI had the largest negative difference, which was lower than -15% or even 20%.The difference of sea ice area was consistently within ±0.5 million km2 between DPR-AMSR and BT-AMSR, BT-SSMI, ASI-AMSR, and NT2-AMSR in all years. The smallest difference was with BT-SSMI (less than 0.1 million km2), whereas the largest difference was with NT1-SSMI (up to 1.5 million km2). In comparisons of sea ice extent, BT-AMSR, NT1-SSMI, and NT2-AMSR estimates were consistent with that of DPR-AMSR and were within ±0.5 million km2. However, differences exceeded 0.5 million km2 between DPR-AMSR and the other data sets. When ship-based visual observation (OBS) values ranged from 85% to 100%, the difference between DPR-AMSR and OBS was less than 1%. There were relatively large differences between DPR-AMSR and OBS when OBS values were less than 85% or were recorded during the summer, although those differences were also within 10%.

The algorithm, denoted as AMSR2 thin ice detection algorithm - version 2 (ATIDA2), is targeted for the Arctic Ocean. The detection of thin ice with a maximum thickness of 20 cm is based on the classification of the 36-GHz polarization ratio ( $PR36$ ) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio ( $GR8936H$ ) signatures with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and thick ice restoration with $GR3610H$. The thick ice restoration removes erroneous thin ice detections due to thin and thick ice $PR36$ and $GR8936H$ signature mixing. ATIDA2 is applied only when sea ice concentration (SIC) is ≥70% and the air temperature is ≤-5 °C to decrease misclassification of thick ice as thin ice. For the AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data, an atmospheric correction is applied following an EUMETSAT OSI SAF correction scheme in SIC retrieval algorithms. ATIDA2 is applied to L1R swath datasets, and then, the results are combined to a daily thin ice chart. ATIDA2 was developed and validated using MODIS ice thickness charts over the Barents and Kara Seas. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice in the daily chart is 8.7%, and 37.0% for vice versa. The comparison of the ATIDA2 chart and the SMOS ice thickness chart over the Arctic showed rough correspondence in the thin versus thick ice classification. The ATIDA2 chart is targeted to be used together with SAR imagery for various sea ice classifications. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Polarization; Radar imaging; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Restoration; Signal detection; Arctic; Detection algorithm; Ice detection; Ice thickness; Microwave radiometry; Misclassifications; Passive microwave remote sensing; Sea ice concentration; Thin sea ice; air temperature; algorithm; atmospheric correction; brightness temperature; discriminant analysis; ice thickness; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; SMOS; Silicon carbide","Arctic; passive microwave remote sensing; polynya; thin sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123279572"

Compared with the Mackenzie Bay Polynya, the only polynya in the west, the polynyas in eastern Prydz Bay have a larger area and higher ice production, but have never been studied individually. In this study, four recurrent polynyas were identified in eastern Prydz Bay from sea ice concentration data during 2002–2011. Their areas generally exhibit synchronous temporal variations and have good correlation with wind speed, which indicates that they are primarily wind-driven polynyas that need at least one stationary ice barrier to block the inflow of drifting sea ice. The components of the ice barriers of these four polynyas were identified through comparison of satellite remote sensing visible images and synthetic aperture radar images. All types of fast ice, including landfast ice, offshore fast ice and ice fingers serving as ice barriers for these polynyas are anchored by an assemblage of small icebergs and have an approximately year-round period of variations that also regulates the variability of polynyas. The movement and grounding of giant icebergs near the polynyas significantly affects the development of the polynyas. The results of this study illustrate the important impact of icebergs on Antarctic wind-driven polynyas and the formation of dense shelf water. © 2021 by the authors.

At present, the global navigation satellite system reflector (GNSS-R) technology has been applied to the study of sea ice remote sensing and achieved good results. In this paper, a convolution neural network (CNN) based method for sea ice recognition (SIR) and estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC) using GNSS-R data is proposed. Specifically, a CNN model is designed to solve the classification problem of SIR and the regression problem of SIC estimation. In the stage of data set construction, first, the global GNSS-R data (TDS-l), in a certain period of time, is spatiotemporally matched with the relatively reliable sea ice data (NSIDC), and then the matched GNSS-R data is extracted to balance the amount of seawater data and sea ice data. In the stage of CNN model construction, the feature learning ability of the model is enhanced by adding convolution layer, pooling layer and full connection layer. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN-based scheme has a higher prediction accuracy of SIR and lower estimation error of SIC than other existing methods.  © 2022 IEEE.","Climate change; Communication satellites; Convolution; Global positioning system; Remote sensing; Component; Convolution neural network; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Ice remote sensing; Network-based; Neural network model; Reflector technology; Remote-sensing; Sea ice concentration; Techdemosat-l; Sea ice","component; Convolution neural network; Global Navigation Satellite System; Remote Sensing; TechDemoSat-l","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137087254"

The South Sandwich Islands have a complex marine environment that is influenced by both the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Weddell Gyre, and seasonal sea ice. Here we investigate the local and regional dynamics and variability of the ocean and sea ice to inform management of the region. Remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST), sea ice concentration and chlorophyll a data from 2009 to 2021 are used to define the mean seasonal cycle in the environment and the associated temporal and spatial variability. While sea surface temperature and sea ice have a clearly defined seasonality, local chlorophyll blooms are irregular in timing, location and magnitude. Interannual variability in summer SST is strongly positively correlated along the island arc. The islands experience very different winter sea ice conditions from year to year, with marked variability in sea ice distribution and duration. Surface chlorophyll blooms develop in most years close to the island arc, but there is little spatial consistency and there are years where blooms are not observed. The timing and pattern of sea ice retreat appears to be a key driver in the formation of chlorophyll blooms, with their propagation affected by local circulation, but additional local processes are also important. Trajectories of near-surface satellite tracked surface buoys and Argo floats, together with an analysis of sea surface height output from a global reanalysis product, demonstrate the connectivity of the South Sandwich Islands to the wider regional marine system. Enhanced current flows around and between the South Sandwich Islands are likely to affect the transport and exchange of material along the island arc. The South Sandwich Islands are connected with the Scotia and Weddell seas, with contribution from the different regions varying according to latitude along the island arc. There are also connections with islands downstream including Bouvet, Crozet and Kerguelen Islands and seamounts, with possible return flow via the Weddell Gyre. Our analyses indicate that accounting for the complexity and variability in the South Sandwich Islands marine environment will be crucial in the development of conservation and fisheries management procedures. © 2022 The Authors","Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; French Southern Territories; Kerguelen Islands; Scotia Sea; South Sandwich Islands; Southern Ocean; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; Atmospheric temperature; Conservation; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Ocean currents; Phytoplankton; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Antarctic Circumpolar Currents; Antarctica; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem management; Island arc; Marine ecology; Marine environment; Scotia Sea; Southern ocean; Weddell gyre; Argo; chlorophyll a; connectivity; ecosystem function; ecosystem management; ice retreat; marine environment; phytoplankton; remote sensing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; Chlorophyll","Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Antarctica; Ecosystem function; Ecosystem management; Marine ecology; Phytoplankton; Scotia sea; Sea ice; Weddell Gyre","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127360589"

Due to the interference between the signal components from the air-ice and ice-water interfaces, the reflection coefficient experiences an oscillating pattern versus elevation angle so that detecting sea ice using the power or amplitude of the reflected global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal has to choose a suitable satellite to reduce the influence of the oscillating pattern. A sea ice surface is more stable and presents higher correlation than a dynamic ocean surface, this article explores the potential of detecting and measuring sea ice using the coherency of reflected GNSS signal for coastal scenario. Experimental results show that phase coherency can significantly detect sea ice without strictly limiting elevation and azimuth angle. This article also is to is to explore the potential of retrieving sea ice thickness using the oscillating phase pattern versus elevation angle. The phase compensation and the dual-polarization observation are proposed to remove the delay phase between the direct and reflected signal from the estimated phase of the reflected GNSS signal. The results show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating phase pattern, respectively, have an inversely proportional and positively linear relationship with sea ice thickness. Simulation shows that, compared to the oscillating amplitude, the oscillating frequency is a better choice to measure sea ice thickness. The frequency of the dual-polarization oscillating pattern could provide the measurement performance with a root-mean-square error of 0.05 m.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Communication satellites; Phase interfaces; Polarization; Reflection; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Surface waters; Atmospheric modeling; Coastal global navigation satellite systemreflectometry; Correlation time; Dual-polarizations; Dualpolarization observation; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Global navigation satellites; Ice detection; Phase compensation; Random Walk; Random walk test; Sea ice detection; Sea measurements; Sea surfaces; Sea-ice thickness; Walk tests; azimuth; computer simulation; detection method; GNSS; ice thickness; numerical model; sea ice; Global positioning system","Coastal global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R); correlation time; dual-polarization observation; phase compensation; random walk test; sea ice detection; sea ice thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121361865"

Despite the limitations of remotely sensed observations in an often cloudy environment, remote sensing data provide strong indications that surface chlorophyll biomass has increased (since 2000) as sea ice has declined in the Pacific Arctic region. We present here shipboard measurements of chlorophyll-a that have been made annually in July since 2000 from the Distributed Biological Observatory (DBO) stations in the Bering Strait region. This time series as well as shipboard observations made in other months since the late 1980s implicate complexities that intrude on a simple expectation that, as open water periods increase, the production and biomass of phytoplankton will increase predictably. These shipboard observations indicate that there have not been sharp increases in chlorophyll-a, for either maxima observed in the water column or integrated over the whole water column, at the DBO stations over a time-series extending for as long as 20 years coinciding with seasonal sea ice declines. On the other hand, biomass may be increasing in other months: we provide a shipboard confirmation of a fall bloom in October as wind mixing introduced nutrients back into the upper water column. The productive DBO stations may be at a high enough production already that additional enhancements in chlorophyll-a biomass should not be expected, but our time-series record does not exclude the possibility that additional enhanced production may be present in other areas outside the DBO station grid. These findings may also reflect limitations imposed by nutrient cycling and water column structure. The increasing freshwater component of waters flowing through the Bering Strait is likely associated with increased stratification that limits the potential change in biological production associated with decreases in seasonal sea ice persistence. © 2022 by the authors.","","Bering Sea; chlorophyll; Chukchi Sea; climate change; Distributed Biological Observatory; seasonal sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137426974"

Satellite remote sensing plays the main role for about the last five decades, as it is the only way to provide multitemporal views at continental scale. But the emergence of small consumer-grade unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the past two decades has paved the way for data in unprecedented detail. This has been also verified by an increasing noticeable interest in Antarctica by the incorporation of UAVs in the field activities in diversified research topics. This paper presents a comprehensive review about the use of UAVs in scientific activities in Antarctica. It is based on the analysis of 190 scientific publications published in peer-reviewed journals and proceedings of conferences which are organised into six main application topics: Terrestrial, Ice and Snow, Fauna, Technology, Atmosphere and Others. The analysis encompasses a detailed overview of the activities, identifying advantages and difficulties, also evaluating future possibilities and challenges for expanding the use of UAV in the field activities. The relevance of using UAVs to support numerous and diverse scientific activities in Antarctica becomes very clear after analysing this set of scientific publications, as it is revolutionising the remote acquisition of new data with much higher detail, from inaccessible or difficult to access regions, in faster and cheaper ways. Many of the advances can be seen in the terrestrial areas (detailed 3D mapping; vegetation mapping, discrimination and health assessment; periglacial forms characterisation), ice and snow (more detailed topography, depth and features of ice-sheets, glaciers and sea-ice), fauna (counting penguins, seals and flying birds and detailed morphometrics) and in atmosphere studies (more detailed meteorological measurements and air-surface couplings). This review has also shown that despite the low environmental impact of UAV-based surveys, the increasing number of applications and use, may lead to impacts in the most sensitive Antarctic ecosystems. Hence, we call for an internationally coordinated effort to for planning and sharing UAV data in Antarctica, which would reduce environmental impacts, while extending research outcomes. © 2022 by the authors.

This loss of sea ice has environmental implications as well as economic and global security implications, especially in regards to Arctic navigation. Rapid changes in sea ice influence when an Arctic route can become navigable, and thus understanding such changes is crucial for operation planning and routing. The Arctic’s spatial extent and severe environment are well suited for observation via satellite remote sensing, and the problem space lends itself well to a supervised machine learning approach. However, such an approach is limited by the lack of labeled sea ice data sets with both the spatial and temporal density and resolution to pair with image data. In this study, we develop methods to derive sea ice labels directly from satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We use single-look complex data from the Sentinel-1 constellation collected in the Extra-Wide swath mode, which has optimal imaging parameters for sea ice observation. We expand on existing methods of deriving labels from SAR data using H-α plane polarimetric classification techniques by examining additional polarimetric parameters. We then develop new classification rules by training a decision tree classifier using a labeled data set made available by the National Snow & Ice Data Center.

There are match-up pairs for all products covering the whole range of in-situ SST (19°C–30°C) and every month, consisting of an appropriate method to validate our satellite datasets in the study area. Although there is a good statistical agreement between MODIS retrievals and in-situ SST, cloud coverage over the study area results in a large number of gaps along with the time series. Thus, dominant features of the SST variability patterns were characterized based on 35 years (1985–2018) of OSTIA SST. There is a strong influence of the Brazil Coastal Current during late winter months contrasting with warmer waters from the Brazil Current during summer. Local high-frequency forcing dominates SST variability, mostly high-energy meteorological events, which act like pulses that intensify mixing processes, resulting in a stair-like variability pattern. At adequate temporal and spatial scales, the relatively cost-effective, spatially explicit, frequent, and continuous remote sensing data can provide the necessary information to support the reliance of our civilization on the ocean. As the SST regime in coastal waters differs from the open waters, the results presented here are unique.

However, the extent decreased to record low levels from 2016 to 2020, with the drop being greatest in the Weddell and Lazarev Seas of the Southern Ocean. An important question for the scientific fraternity and policymakers is to understand what ocean-atmospheric processes triggered such a rapid decline in sea ice. We employ in-situ, satellite, and atmospheric reanalysis data to examine the causative mechanism of anomalous sea ice variability in the Lazarev Sea at a time of ice growth in the annual cycle (March–April 2019), when a cargo ship was stuck in extensive ice cover and freed following the unusual decline in sea ice. High-resolution Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar captured a distinct view of the ship location and track within extensive ice cover of fast sea ice, dense pack ice, and icebergs in the Lazarev Sea on 27 March 2019. Subsequently, the sea ice cover declined and reached the fourth lowest extent in the entire satellite record during April 2019 which was 25.6% lower than the long-term mean value of 2.65 × 106 km2. We show that the anomalous sea ice variability was due to the occurrence of eastward-moving polar cyclones, including a quasi-stationary explosive development that impacted sea ice through extreme changes in ocean-atmospheric conditions. The cyclone-induced dynamic (poleward propagation of ocean waves and ice motion) and thermodynamic (heat and moisture plumes from midlatitudes, ocean mixed layer warming) processes coupled with high tides provided a conducive environment for an exceptional decline in sea ice over the region of ship movement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Antarctic Regions; Ice Cover; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Ships; Lazarev Sea; Southern Ocean; Oceanography; Satellites; Sea ice; Ships; Storms; Synthetic aperture radar; Water waves; sea water; Antarctica; Cryosphere; Ice cover; Ocean-atmosphere; Ocean-atmosphere–cryosphere; Polar cyclone; Remote-sensing; Satellite data; Sea-ice cover; Southern ocean; annual variation; ice cover; in situ measurement; remote sensing; sea ice; ship motion; Antarctica; article; atmosphere; circannual rhythm; flood tide; heat; hurricane; ice cover; iceberg; moisture; motion; pack ice; plume; remote sensing; sea ice; Southern Ocean; telecommunication; warming; Antarctica; sea; ship; Remote sensing","Ice cover; Ocean-atmosphere–cryosphere; Polar cyclones; Remote sensing; Southern Ocean","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123644421"

Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more accurate information on melt ponds on Arctic sea ice by remote sensing. The present large-scale melt pond products, especially the melt pond fraction (MPF), still require verification, and using very high resolution optical satellite remote sensing data is a good way to verify the large-scale retrieval of MPF products. Unlike most MPF algorithms using very high resolution data, the LinearPolar algorithm using Sentinel-2 data considers the albedo of melt ponds unfixed. In this paper, by selecting the best band combination, we applied this algorithm to Landsat 8 (L8) data. Moreover, Sentinel-2 data, as well as support vector machine (SVM) and iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithms, are used as the comparison and verification data. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the LinearPolar algorithm for melt ponds is higher than that of previous algorithms. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient results achieved by using the LinearPolar algorithm with L8 and Sentinel-2A (S2), the SVM algo-rithm, and the ISODATA algorithm are 95.38% and 0.88, 94.73% and 0.86, and 92.40%and 0.80, respectively, which are much higher than those of principal component analysis (PCA) and Markus algorithms. The mean MPF (10.0%) obtained from 80 cases from L8 data based on the LinearPolar algorithm is much closer to Sentinel-2 (10.9%) than the Markus (5.0%) and PCA algorithms (4.2%), with a mean MPF difference of only 0.9%, and the correlation coefficients of the two MPFs are as high as 0.95. The overall relative error of the LinearPolar algorithm is 53.5% and 46.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 30.9% and 27.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively. In the cases with-out obvious melt ponds, the relative error is reduced more than that of those with obvious melt ponds because the LinearPolar algorithm can identify 100% of dark melt ponds and relatively small melt ponds, and the latter contributes more to the reduction in the relative error of MPF retrieval. With a wider range and longer time series, the MPF from Landsat data are more efficient than those from Sentinel-2 for verifying large-scale MPF products or obtaining long-term monitoring of a fixed area. © 2021 by the authors.

The existing methods can obtain accurate SICs for most situations, but they usually perform poorly in low SIC regions because of the spatial differences in the neighboring pixels induced by the discontinuity of the sea ice cover. In this letter, to cope with the difficulty of this problem, an improved SIC estimation method is proposed to retrieve SIC, focusing on low SIC regions. The proposed method introduces the spatial relationships into SIC estimation by employing a total variation (TV) regularizer. Moreover, nonnegative constrained least squares (NCLS) is used to derive the optimal solutions from the SIC estimation equation. Verification was conducted in low SIC regions (0%-50%) of the Antarctic utilizing ship-based in situ data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the results were compared with those of some of the mature methods. The results indicated that the proposed method can obtain a superior accuracy with a smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) (6.0%-14.61%) than the other algorithms in low SIC regions. Furthermore, the proposed method can accurately estimate the SIC of both first-year ice and multiyear ice.

The ASI (ARTIST Sea Ice algorithm) can obtain the highest spatial resolution of 6.25 km2 in the current SIC products by using the dual-polarized brightness temperature of AMSR-E at 89 GHz. However, additional auxiliary low-frequency band data are still needed for weather filter. In this work, a new SIC retrieving algorithm based on single-frequency multi-incident angle brightness temperature data has been proposed and studied, which can be applied on an 89 GHz synthetic aperture radiometer. Fully utilizing the multi-incident angle brightness temperature with a synthetic aperture radiometer can separate the information of sea ice and seawater, improve the precision of SIC retrieving, and achieve high spatial resolution. The first step involves creating a simulation system for space-borne observation of sea – ice radiant brightness temperature and using the measured data of the 89 GHz channel from the FY-3C/MWHS to carry out the sensitivity analysis between brightness temperature and angle at 89 GHz. The second step consists of developing an SIC retrieving algorithm based on the angle brightness temperature difference at 89 GHz and completing the preliminary retrieving verification by combining the SIC product of ECMWF and the brightness temperature simulation system. The results show that the SIC retrieval can be realized by using the incident angle brightness temperature difference. Moreover, the minimum root mean square weighted average post-processing by using the combination of multi-incidence angle can minimize the retrieving error of SIC. When the input Gaussian white noise is 2 K, 5% SIC error can be obtained. The final results show that the SIC retrieval with the combination of multi-incidence angle can fully expand the distinction between sea water and sea ice. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

The significant low albedo of melt pond compared with snow and ice results in more absorption of radiation compared with sea ice without melt pond, which will then enhance sea ice melt to form more melt pond. This so-called positive feedback of melt pond is crucial for sea ice thermal and physical properties. The melt pond coverage varies significantly spatially and temporally and satellite remote sensing provides a possible solution in determining the spatial coverage of melt pond. This work aims to develop a new physically based algorithm for retrieving the cover fraction of melt ponds on sea ice using remote sensing data. In the newly developed algorithm, dynamic sea ice and melt pond reflectances are used in the pixel spectral unmixing for melt pond fraction (MPF) estimation. Radiative transfer models for sea ice and melt pond reflectance modeling are developed for MPF retrieval algorithm. The validation of retrieved MPF and its comparison with static pixel spectral unmixing results show that the dynamic algorithm proposed in this study has the potential of application in wide range of situations by considering dynamic spectral reflectances of melt pond and sea ice. The Arctic MPF and sea ice cover fraction (SIF) in 2000–2021 are generated by applying the proposed algorithm. The spatial and temporal characteristics of MPF and SIF are analyzed. Time series trend analysis of MPF in 2000–2021 reveals the significant increasing trend of relative MPF in the Arctic. The melt pond expansion in 2000–2021 is more obvious in the marginal areas, especially the marginal areas close to Russia coast. Trend analysis for typical regions such as Beaufort Sea, Greenland Sea, the Baffin Bay, Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Kara seas and center Arctic also reveals that the relative MPF and SIF show contrasting trend. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Using a long-term time series of sea ice products from satellite observations—the extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x)—trends in sea ice concentration, ice extent, ice thickness, and ice volume in the Arctic from 1982 to 2020 are investigated. Results show that the Arctic has become less ice-covered in all seasons, especially in summer and autumn. Arctic sea ice thickness has been decreasing at a rate of −3.24 cm per year, resulting in an approximate 52% reduction in thickness from 2.35 m in 1982 to 1.13 m in 2020. Arctic sea ice volume has been decreasing at a rate of −467.7 km3 per year, resulting in an approximate 63% reduction in volume, from 27,590.4 km3 in 1982 to 10,305.5 km3 in 2020. These trends are further examined from a new perspective, where the Arctic Ocean is classified into open water, perennial, and seasonal sea ice-covered areas based on sea ice persistence. The loss of the perennial sea ice-covered area is a major factor in the total sea ice loss in all seasons.

Its evolution is determined by the regional climate and bathymetry. This study investigated the seasonal cycle and interannual variations of LFSI along the northwest coast of Kotelny Island. Initial freezing, rapid ice formation, stable and decay stages were identified in the seasonal cycle based on application of the visual inspection approach (VIA) to MODIS/Envisat imagery and results from a thermodynamic snow/ice model. The modeled annual maximum ice thickness in 1995-2014 was 2.02 ± 0.12 m showing a trend of -0.13 m decade-1. Shortened ice season length (-22 d decade-1) from model results associated with substantial spring (2.3°C decade-1) and fall (1.9°C decade-1) warming. LFSI break-up resulted from combined fracturing and melting, and the local spatiotemporal patterns of break-up were associated with the irregular bathymetry. Melting dominated the LFSI break-up in the nearshore sheltered area, and the ice thickness decreased to an average of 0.50 m before the LFSI disappeared. For the LFSI adjacent to drift ice, fracturing was the dominant process and the average ice thickness was 1.56 m at the occurrence of the fracturing. The LFSI stages detected by VIA were supported by the model results.

Because ocean-ice numerical models are highly computationally intensive, relatively lightweight ML-based methods may be more efficient for sea ice forecasting. Many studies have exploited different deep learning models alongside classical approaches for predicting sea ice concentration in the Arctic. However, only a few focus on daily operational forecasts and consider the real-time availability of data needed for marine operations. In this article, we aim to close this gap and investigate the performance of the U-Net model trained in two regimes for predicting sea ice for up to the next 10 days. We show that this deep learning model can outperform simple baselines by a significant margin, and we can improve the model’s quality by using additional weather data and training on multiple regions to ensure its generalization abilities. As a practical outcome, we build a fast and flexible tool that produces operational sea ice forecasts in the Barents Sea, the Labrador Sea, and the Laptev Sea regions. © 2022 by the authors.","Computer vision; Deep learning; Forecasting; Global warming; Numerical methods; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Arctic sea ice; Data-driven model; Deep learning; Ice forecasting; Imagery analysis; Marine Operations; Remote-sensing; Satellite imagery analyse; Short-term sea ice forecasting; U-net; Remote sensing","Arctic sea ice; computer vision; data-driven models; deep learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery analysis; short-term sea ice forecasting; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142752053"

In this study, we used atmospheric reanalysis data and satellite remote sensing products to identify anomalies of meteorological and sea ice conditions during the ice season of 2018–2019 relative to climatological means using a Lagrangian methodology. We obtained the anomalies along the drifting trajectories of eight sea ice mass balance buoys between the marginal ice zone and the pack ice zone in the western Arctic Ocean (~160°W–170°W and 79°N–85°N) from September 2018 to August 2019. The temporary collapse of the Beaufort High and a strong positive Arctic Dipole in the winter of 2018–2019 drove the three buoys in the north to drift gradually northeastward and merge into the Transpolar Drift Stream. The most prominent positive temperature anomalies in 2018–2019 along the buoy trajectories relative to 1979–2019 climatology occurred in autumn, early winter, and April, and were concentrated in the southern part of the study area; these anomalies can be partly related to the seasonal and spatial patterns of heat release from the Arctic ice-ocean system to the atmosphere. In the southern part of the study area and in autumn, the sea ice concentration in 2018–2019 was higher than that averaged over the past 10 years. However, we found no ice concentration anomalies for other regions or seasons. The sea ice thickness in the freezing season and the snow depth by the end of the winter of 2018–2019 can also be considered as normal. Although the wind speed in 2018–2019 was slightly lower than that in 1979–2019, the speed of sea ice drift and its ratio to wind speed were significantly higher than the climatology. In 2019, the sea ice surface began to melt at the end of June, which was close to the 1988–2019 climatology. However, spatial variations in the onsets of surface melt in 2019 differed from the climatology, and can be explained by the prevalence of a high-pressure system in the south of the Beaufort Sea in June 2019. In addition to seasonal variations, the meteorological and sea ice anomalies were influenced by spatial variations. By the end of summer 2019, the buoys had drifted to the west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, where the ice conditions was heavier than those at the buoy locations in early September 2018. The meteorological and sea ice anomalies identified in this study lay the foundations for subsequent analyses and simulations of sea ice mass balance based on the buoy data. © 2022, Editorial Office of Advances in Polar Science.

However, understanding of the dynamics of phytoplankton taxonomic composition in this marginal ice zone remains unclear. In this study, seawater samples collected from 36 stations in the northeastern Antarctic Peninsula were analyzed for nutrients and phytoplankton pigments. Combining with CHEMTAX analysis, remote sensing data, and physicochemical measurements, we investigated the relationships between phytoplankton crops, taxonomic composition, and marine environmental drivers. Integrated chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations (200 m) varied from 8.9 mg/m2 to 64.2 mg/m2, with an average of (23.2±12.0) mg/m2 and higher phytoplankton biomass concentrated in the coastal region of South Orkney Island and South Shetland Island. Diatoms were the dominant functional group (63%±21%). Higher proportions of diatoms were associated with higher Chl a (r=0.40, p<0.01), stable water columns (r=0.20, p<0.01), higher Si/P ratios (r=0.34, p<0.01), higher photosynthetically active radiation intensity (r=0.64, p<0.01), and higher sea ice melt water contributions (MWC, r=0.20, p<0.01). Conversely, Phaeocystis antarctica contributed a smaller overall proportion (31%±18%) and was more concentrated in the offshore water masses (e.g., Philip Ridge and South Scotia Ridge) with lower light levels (r=−0.58, p<0.01), deeper mixed layer depths (r=0.17, p<0.05), higher nutrient concentrations (e.g., N, P, and Si, r>0.35, p<0.01), and lower MWC (r=−0.20, p<0.01). In comparison, the total contribution from green flagellates (4%±5%), cryptophyta (1%±3%), dinoflagellates (1%±4%), and cyanobacteria (1% ± 5%) was only 6%. In offshore regions with well-mixed water, less varied taxonomic composition and lower crops with a higher proportion of nanophytoplankton were observed. In contrast, significantly decreasing crops below the mixed layer depth was observed in water columns with strong stratification, where the dominant phytoplankter changed from diatoms to P. antarctica. These findings have important implications for better understanding the future dynamics of marine ecosystems in the sea area adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2022, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Antarctic Peninsula; light intensity; mixed layer depth; phytoplankton crops; phytoplankton taxonomic composition; pigment","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123425845"

These parameters, especially sea-ice density, are usually based on climatologies constructed from in situ observations made in the 1980s and earlier while contemporary and representative measurements are lacking. Our aim with this paper is to derive updated sea-ice bulk density estimates suitable for the present Arctic sea-ice cover and a range of ice types to reduce uncertainties in sea-ice thickness remote sensing. Our sea-ice density measurements are based on over 3000 km of high-resolution collocated airborne sea-ice and snow thickness and freeboard measurements in the western Arctic Ocean in 2017 and 2019. Sea-ice bulk density is derived assuming isostatic equilibrium for different ice types. Our results show higher average bulk densities for both first-year ice (FYI) and especially multi-year ice (MYI) compared to previous studies. In addition, we find a small difference between deformed and possibly unconsolidated FYI and younger MYI. We find a negative-exponential relationship between sea-ice bulk density and sea-ice freeboard and apply this parameterisation to one winter of monthly gridded CryoSat-2 sea-ice freeboard data. We discuss the suitability and the impact of the derived FYI and MYI bulk densities for sea-ice thickness retrievals and the uncertainty related to the indirect method of measuring sea-ice bulk density. The results suggest that retrieval algorithms be adapted to changes in sea-ice density and highlight the need of future studies to evaluate the impact of density parameterisation on the full sea-ice thickness data record.

To approach, sea ice was categorized into three ice types, typical of the sea ice in this region: nilas (thin level), pancake ice (thin rough), and deformed ice (thick rough), and then the measures to classify into these categories were developed using ALOS/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) as a function of backscatter coefficients at HH polarization (σ HH) and incidence angle (θ i), based on the field observations. Comparative analysis confirmed that PALSAR can detect deformed ice more efficiently than RADARSAT-2 (C-band SAR). The temporal evolution of the area, judged as deformed ice from these measures, shows significant variability with both time and space, and deformed ice regions appear in relatively linear alignments with a width of a few tens of kilometers in the inner ice pack region, consistent with ice drift convergence. To confirm the results, PALSAR-2 images at HH and HV polarizations were examined as a function of θ i, based on the four-year field observations in the same area. The results revealed that σ HH and σ HV are both subject to floe sizes as well as deformed ice, and σ HV is more sensitive. This indicates that care should be taken when applying these measures to the ice areas where significantly small floes are dominant like the marginal ice zone.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Image enhancement; Polarization; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Backscatter coefficients; Comparative analysis; Deformation process; Field observations; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Marginal Ice Zone; Seasonal ice zones; Temporal evolution; deformation; image analysis; sea ice; seasonal variation; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Cryosphere; deformed sea ice; dynamics; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098797896"

While information about the mean of this distribution is increasingly available from modelling and remote sensing, the full distribution cannot yet be resolved. We analyse 33 539 snow depth measurements from 499 transects taken at Soviet drifting stations between 1955 and 1991 and derive a simple statistical distribution for snow depth over multi-year ice as a function of only the mean snow depth. We then evaluate this snow depth distribution against snow depth transects that span first-year ice to multiyear ice from the MOSAiC, SHEBA and AMSR-Ice field campaigns. Because the distribution can be generated using only the mean snow depth, it can be used in the downscaling of several existing snow depth products for use in flux modelling and altimetry studies.

The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) relies on sea-ice floes in the St. Lawrence Island (SLI) and Wainwright regions of the Bering and Chukchi seas surrounding Alaska as a platform for rest, feeding and reproduction. Lower concentrations of thick ice floes are generally associated with earlier seasonal fragmentation and shorter annual persistence of sea-ice cover, potentially affecting the life history of the Pacific walrus. In this study, 24 Landsat satellite images were classified into thick ice, thin ice or open water to assess sea-ice fragmentation over the spring-summer breakup period. Geospatial fragmentation analyses traditionally used in terrestrial landscapes were newly implemented in this study to characterize the ices-cape environment. Fragmentation of sea ice was assessed based on the Percent of Landscape, Number of Patches, Mean Area, Shape Index, Euclidean Nearest Neighbor and Edge Density. Results show that lower sea-ice concentrations in both the SLI and Wainwright regions were associated with smaller sea-ice floes. In the Bering Sea, lower sea-ice concentrations were also associated with increases in the number of ice floes, floe isolation and edge density. By contrast, lower sea-ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea were associated with ice floes that were more circular in shape. The continuation of sea-ice decline with shift-ing icescape characteristics may result in walruses having to swim longer dis-tances in the northern Bering Sea and adapt to use less-preferred, rounder ice floes in the Chukchi Sea. © 2022 A.

FIPS V2.0 is comprised of a newly-developed snowdrift parameterization compared to the original FIPS V1.0. The simulation domain covers the entire fast ice region in Prydz Bay and is configured to 720 grid cells, with a spatial resolution of 0.125°. The ERA-Interim reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) were used as the atmospheric forcing. The in-situ observations were obtained near Zhongshan Station by the wintering team, and the measurement frequency of the snow and ice thicknesses was around one week. Both the FIPS V2.0 products and in-situ observations introduced in this paper cover the time periods from 2012 to 2016. The primary assessments based on the in-situ observations show that FIPS V2.0 has mean biases of 0.01 ± 0.07 m and 0.23 ± 0.09 m for snow and ice thickness simulations, respectively. The results indicate that the updated FIPS V2.0 produces a reasonable snow thickness due to the newly-developed snowdrift parameterization, but it overestimates the ice thickness due to the cold bias in the air temperature forcing. These 2-D snow and ice thickness distributions provide important references for sea ice thermodynamic studies, remote sensing validations, and icebreaker navigation assessments in this region.

An accurate estimate of the OHC in the Arctic sea ice regions is challenging due to the lack of in-situ data and satellite-based algorithms. In this study, an artificial neural network-based (ANN) novel approach is presented for estimating OHC changes at various standard depth extents (in line with the World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels) in the Arctic sea ice regions based on the relationships of the sea ice thermodynamic parameters from the satellite measurements and in-situ OHC estimates. Because of the potential uncertainty that arises from the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer in the in-situ OHC estimates, a preliminary ANN model was developed with a set of approximations to account for the in-situ OHC stored in the respective depths within the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer. The ANN model architecture was optimized for a depth extent of 700 m and adopted for the remaining depths of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 100 m,150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m, 400 m, 450 m, 500 m, 550 m, 600 m, and 650 m. The new model was robust in capturing the spatial, temporal, and depth variabilities of OHC in the sea ice-covered Arctic regions with greater accuracy (mean bias error 0.022 GJ m-2, mean bias percentage error 0.015%, mean absolute error 0.182 GJ m-2, mean absolute percentage error 0.148%, root mean square error 0.24 GJ m-2, R-2 0.94, slope 0.93, and intercept 25.05 GJ m-2). This model is capable of estimating OHC and its temporal trends from satellite data which will have implications for understanding the global climate change and its impacts in the Polar Oceans.  © 2013 IEEE.","Climate models; Errors; Mean square error; Neural networks; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Uncertainty analysis; Water content; Arctic; Arctic sea ice; Arctic sea ice region; Ocean heat content; Ocean remote sensing; Ocean temperature; Remote-sensing; Satellite navigation systems; Sea measurements; Sea-ice thermodynamic; Global warming","Arctic sea ice regions; climate change; Ocean heat content; ocean remote sensing; sea ice thermodynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139842698"

However, the influences of reflectance anisotropy and melt ponds were not well considered in previous studies. To improve the estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency, we developed a method for estimating the surface albedo of Arctic sea ice using an ensemble back-propagation neural network (EBPNN) model. A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo dataset of snow, white ice, and melt ponds was constructed using the asymptotic analytical radiative transfer (AART) model, and the nonlinear relationships between the surface reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface albedo were established using the EBPNN model (prediction correlation coefficient (R)= 0.996 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.023). Our results are consistent with the in situ measurements and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product ( R= 0.916 , RMSE = 0.085, and bias = 0.001), in which the reflectance anisotropy of the snow/ice and the influence of melt ponds were fully considered, and the calculation efficiency was significantly improved by using the EBPNN model. The results of this study provide new insights for estimating the Arctic sea ice albedo from satellite observations, and the proposed EBPNN method can be used to generate a long-term Arctic sea ice albedo dataset with superior estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Anisotropy; Backpropagation; Budget control; Distribution functions; Lakes; Mean square error; Neural network models; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Snow; Solar radiation; Spectrometers; Albedo; Arctic; Arctic sea ice; Land surface; Melt ponds; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Sea measurements; Sea surfaces; albedo; anisotropy; artificial neural network; meltwater; MODIS; sea ice; Reflection","Albedo; Arctic; artificial neural network; melt ponds; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137571054"

In recent years, Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has been declining at about the same rate (∼-13% per decade) as Arctic summer sea ice. More than one-sixth of the world's population relies on seasonal snowpack and glaciers for a water supply that is likely to decrease this century. Snow is also a critical component of Earth's cold regions' ecosystems, in which wildlife, vegetation, and snow are strongly interconnected. Snow water equivalent (SWE) describes the quantity of water stored as snow on the land surface and is of fundamental importance to water, energy, and geochemical cycles. Quality global SWE estimates are lacking. Given the vast seasonal extent combined with the spatially variable nature of snow distribution at regional and local scales, surface observations are not able to provide sufficient SWE information. Satellite observations presently cannot provide SWE information at the spatial and temporal resolutions required to address science and highsocio- economic-value applications such as water resource management and streamflow forecasting. In this paper, we review the potential contribution of X- and Ku-band syn-thetic aperture radar (SAR) for global monitoring of SWE. SAR can image the surface during both day and night regardless of cloud cover, allowing high-frequency revisit at high spatial resolution as demonstrated by missions such as Sentinel-1. The physical basis for estimating SWE from X- and Ku-band radar measurements at local scales is volume scattering by millimeter-scale snow grains. Inference of global snow properties from SAR requires an interdisciplinary approach based on field observations of snow microstructure, physical snow modeling, electromagnetic theory, and retrieval strategies over a range of scales. New field measurement capabilities have enabled significant advances in understanding snow microstructure such as grain size, density, and layering. We describe radar interactions with snowcovered landscapes, the small but rapidly growing number of field datasets used to evaluate retrieval algorithms, the characterization of snowpack properties using radar measurements, and the refinement of retrieval algorithms via synergy with other microwave remote sensing approaches. This review serves to inform the broader snow research, monitoring, and application communities on progress made in recent decades and sets the stage for a new era in SWE remote sensing from SAR measurements.  © Author(s) 2022.","cryosphere; monitoring; radar; remote sensing; snow; snow cover","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140389889"

Recently, the ice bridge has been in a state of decline, either breaking up earlier in the year or not forming at all and thereby increasing the sea ice export out of the Arctic Ocean. The decline in the ice bridge has been ascribed to thinner and therefore weaker ice from the Arctic Ocean entering Nares Strait; however, local forcing also affects the state of the ice bridge and thereby influences when it breaks up. Using a variety of remotely sensed data we examine the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness within the ice bridge, highlighting the presence of negative ice thickness anomalies on both the eastern and western sides of the strait and identifying a recurrent sensible heat polynya that forms within the ice bridge near Cape Jackson in northwestern Greenland. Using the sea ice-ocean model FESOM2, we then attribute these ice thickness anomalies to the heat from warmer subsurface waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that reduce thermodynamic ice growth throughout winter on the western and eastern sides, respectively. The consequently weaker and thinner areas within the ice bridge are then suggested to promote instability and earlier breakup. This work provides new insight into the structure of the Nares Strait ice bridge and highlights that warming of the modified Atlantic and/or Pacific waters that enter the strait may contribute to its further decline.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Nares Strait; heat flux; ice thickness; remote sensing; sea ice; spatial planning; thermodynamics","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141952389"

In the light of the constrained energy minimization scheme, this article provides a generalized complex-valued constrained energy minimization (GCVCEM) scheme for the Arctic sea ice extraction with strong robustness and accessible implementation. Given the fact that the image extraction process is easily disturbed by noise in real-life application scenarios, a modified Newton integration (MNI) neural algorithm with the noise-tolerance ability and high extraction accuracy is proposed to aid the GCVCEM scheme. Its key idea is to add an error integration feedback term on the basis of the Newton-Raphson iterative (NRI) algorithm to resist noise perturbation on the solution process of the GCVCEM scheme for high-precision and robust extraction of the Arctic sea ice. Besides, the corresponding convergence analyses and robustness proofs on the proposed MNI neural algorithm are furnished. To evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed MNI neural algorithm, multiple comparative experiments with different sea ice observation images and different noise workspaces are performed.

The algorithm is comprised of two steps: correction of the annotated thermal noise magnitude (previously proposed in Park et al., 2018) and a novel correction of the annotated thermal noise range dependence. The magnitude of the annotated thermal noise is corrected by applying scale and offset coefficients tuned on a few hundred of Sentinel-1 data acquired over surfaces with low backscatter in interferometric wide and extra-wide swath modes in HV and VH polarizations. The values of coefficients for all modes and polarizations for data processing with the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) version 3.1-3.3 are provided. The range dependence is corrected by minimizing a cost function between the annotated range profiles of thermal noise and antenna pattern gain (APG). An objective validation metric based on a comparison of averaged backscatter at interswath boundaries is proposed. Validation is performed on hundreds of Sentinel-1 scenes acquired over the open ocean, doldrums, deserts, and sea ice. It shows that the new algorithm outperforms the standard thermal noise removal algorithm proposed by European Space Agency in almost all cases. Analysis shows that the new algorithm worsens noise correction in cases when the range dependence of the annotated APG does not match with the observed signal, indicating either problems with signal processing on IPF or imprecise annotation of APG.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Antennas; Arid regions; Backscattering; Cost functions; Directional patterns (antenna); Interferometry; Polarization; Remote sensing; Signal processing; Space optics; Surface waters; Table lookup; Thermal noise; Instrument processing facilities; Interferometrics; Ocean temperature; Range dependence; Remote-sensing; Sea surfaces; Sentinel-1; Thermal; TOPSAR; Wide swath modes; interferometer; satellite data; Sentinel; Synthetic aperture radar","Remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR); thermal noise","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120563308"

The sheer volume of imagery required, however, hampers our ability to rely on manual annotation alone. Here, we present SealNet 2.0, a fully automated approach to seal detection that couples a sea ice segmentation model to find potential seal habitats with an ensemble of semantic segmentation convolutional neural network models for seal detection. Our best ensemble attains 0.806 precision and 0.640 recall on an out-of-sample test dataset, surpassing two trained human observers. Built upon the original SealNet, it outperforms its predecessor by using annotation datasets focused on sea ice only, a comprehensive hyperparameter study leveraging substantial high-performance computing resources, and post-processing through regression head outputs and segmentation head logits at predicted seal locations. Even with a simplified version of our ensemble model, using AI predictions as a guide dramatically boosted the precision and recall of two human experts, showing potential as a training device for novice seal annotators. Like human observers, the performance of our automated approach deteriorates with terrain ruggedness, highlighting the need for statistical treatment to draw global population estimates from AI output. © 2022 by the authors.","Automation; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Statistical tests; Antarctica; Deep learning; Fully automated; Instance segmentation; Pack ice; Pack-ice seal; Remote-sensing; U-net; Very high resolution satellite imagery; Worldview-3; Remote sensing","Antarctica; computer vision; deep learning; instance segmentation; pack-ice seal; remote sensing; U-Net; Worldview-3","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142743359"

Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979–2020 satellite dataset now shows recent losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007–2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic's lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53% lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice extents, the Arctic's lowest value (in 2020) is 18% lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic's lowest value (in 2017) is 16% lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12% lower than its highest value (in 1982). © 2021","Arctic and Antarctic; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Antarctic sea ice; Arctic sea ice; Global sea ice; High arctic; Multi channel; Satellite passive microwave; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice extent; Sea ice record high and low; Sea-ice cover; global perspective; historical record; ice cover; satellite altimetry; sea ice; Climate change","Antarctic sea ice; Arctic sea ice; Climate change; Global sea ice; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea ice record highs and lows","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118740396"

Monitoring sea ice thickness and the mean sea level (MSL) of the frozen sea are performed using the interference frequency obtained by the GNSS interference pattern (IP) technique. The height variations between the GNSS antenna and the sea surface evaluated using the IP of the direct and reflected carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) are used to find the corresponding MSL. The GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R) derived MSL for open sea conditions agreed well with the mareograph data with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.72 cm with an R-squared value of 0.9644. For frozen sea, a notable difference was observed between the measured MSL and ground-truth MSL values. This difference was caused by the combined thickness of snow and ice above the frozen sea surface, also known as the total freeboard. Assuming the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied, total freeboard was converted to ice thickness. The ice thickness values agreed well with the published ice charts by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). The main uncertainty in the extracted ice thickness was due to the thick snow accumulation and unknown snow properties.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Antenna reflectors; Communication satellites; Global positioning system; Internet protocols; Mean square error; Permittivity measurement; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Satellite antennas; Sea ice; Sea level; Snow; Surface waters; Antennas measurement; Freeboard; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Global navigational satellite system-reflectometry; Ice thickness; Interference pattern network; Interference patterns; Navigational satellites; Pattern networks; Propagation; Reflectometry; Reflector antennas; Remote-sensing; Satellite system; Sea measurements; Sea surfaces; GNSS; Reflection","Freeboard; global navigational satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R); ice thickness; propagation; reflection; remote sensing; sea ice; snow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136884890"

This extensive latitudinal gradient is associated with concomitant environmental gradients that impact the biogeochemical properties of its coastal waters. Although the Greenland fjords have been the subject of intense study, less is known of the productivity in the continental shelves, regions that support local fisheries and influence fjord oceanography. This study provides a large-scale overview of annual net primary production rates (NPP) and their spatial variability in 7 regional shelves around Greenland, over the last decade (2008–2017), with special emphasis on spring bloom initiation. NPP is estimated by two independent approaches already established as best for estimating Arctic productivity: a physically-biologically coupled, regional 3D ocean model (SINMOD) and a spectrally-resolved, light-photosynthesis model of primary production (UQUAR-Takuvik model) that is applied to satellite observations of phytoplankton chlorophyll a, which is derived from ocean color remote sensing (OCRS). Both OCRS and SINMOD provide similar estimates of the timing and rates of productivity in Greenlandic waters, when compared with scarce field estimates. Bloom initiation shows a strong south-north gradient, beginning in April in the southern regions and late June in the Arctic Ocean. OCRS-modeled NPP highlights the effect of sea ice presence on bloom initiation; this method depicts the start of the bloom consistently later, by up to 13 days on average, than SINMOD-modeled NPP estimates. In contrast, numerical modeling is able to detect early phytoplankton growth in Greenland shelves, particularly underneath seasonal sea ice. Rates of annual NPP show a strong south-north gradient, with higher NPP rates observed in the North Atlantic water-influenced southern regions, with up to a factor of 3 decrease in NPP towards the north, in the western Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Annual NPP varies from 78.3 ± 12.3 g C m−2 yr−1 and 80.3 ± 18.7 g C m−2 yr−1 in the southern regions to 24.7 ± 3.9 g C m−2 yr−1 in the Arctic Ocean. In each region, sea ice distribution and timing of formation and retreat affect location and timing of seasonal productivity with earlier and higher NPP offshore, moving inshore towards the summer. An average 55% to 75% of the annual production is estimated to be exported to depth, higher in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, suggesting Greenland shelf waters have a potential for high carbon export to depth and relatively less carbon associated with the microbial food web. © 2021","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Eurasian Basin; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; 3D modeling; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Offshore oil well production; Phytoplankton; Productivity; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Springs (components); Biogeochemical property; Environmental gradient; Latitudinal gradients; Net primary production; North Atlantic waters; Ocean color remote sensing; Phytoplankton chlorophyll; Satellite observations; latitudinal gradient; net primary production; ocean color; remote sensing; sea ice; seawater; spatial variation; Oceanography","Arctic Ocean; Bloom initiation; Continental shelf; Greenland; Numerical models; Primary productivity; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114763065"

For example, photographic aerial surveys have several advantages over surveys employing airborne observers or other more intrusive monitoring techniques, but produce onerous amounts of imagery for manual analysis when conducted across vast areas, such as the Arctic. Deep learning algorithms, chiefly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise for automatically detecting wildlife in large and/or complex image sets. But for sparsely distributed species, such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus), there may not be sufficient known instances of the animals in an image set to train a CNN. We investigated the feasibility of instead providing ‘synthesized’ training data to a CNN to detect polar bears throughout large volumes of aerial imagery from a survey of the Baffin Bay subpopulation. We harvested 534 miscellaneous images of polar bears from the Web that we edited to more closely resemble 21 known images of bears from the aerial survey that were solely used for validation. We combined the Web images of polar bears with 6292 random background images from the aerial survey to train a CNN (ResNet-50), which subsequently correctly classified 20/21 (95%) bear images from the survey and 1172/1179 (99.4%) random background validation images. Given that even a small background misclassification rate could produce multitudinous false positives over many thousands of photos, we describe a potential workflow to efficiently screen out erroneous detections. We also discuss potential avenues to improve CNN accuracy, and the broader applicability of our approach to other image-based wildlife monitoring scenarios. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using miscellaneously sourced images of animals to train deep neural networks for specific wildlife detection tasks. © 2022","Arctic; Baffin Bay; Bay; Somalia; aerial survey; artificial neural network; bear; image analysis; monitoring; sea ice; training","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer vision; Conservation; Machine learning; Marine mammals","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122506196"

A southward flow of warm, salty water had maximum current velocities along the eastern channel slope, while northward outflows of freshened ice shelf meltwater spread at intermediate depth above the western slope. The inflow correlated with the local ocean surface stress curl. At the western slope, meltwater outflows followed the warm influx along the eastern slope with a ~2–3 month delay.

They form in many locations throughout the Arctic and are typically noted for the polynyas that form on their lee side. However, ice bridges also provide a temporary platform that may be used by both humans and wildlife to cross otherwise impassable channels. For generations, Inuit in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, have used an ice bridge to cross Roes Welcome Sound and expand their hunting territory, though they report that the bridge only forms approximately every four years. Of interest both to Inuit and the scientific community is why the bridge forms so intermittently, by what mechanisms, and whether the frequency will change with ongoing warming and sea ice loss. Using satellite imagery, we determined that the bridge formed during 14 of the past 50 years (1971 – 2020). Generally, the bridge forms between January and March during a cold period that coincides with neap tide and after surface winds have rotated from the prevailing northerly (along-channel) winds to west-northwesterly (across-channel) winds. This rotation compresses the existing ice pack against Southampton Island, where it remains stationary because of the calm along-channel winds and low tidal range and coalesces under cold air temperatures. Breakup occurs between mid-June and early July after the onset of melt. Overall, the bridge forms when a specific set of conditions occur simultaneously; however, a warming climate, specifically a reduction in very cold days and a shorter ice season may affect the frequency of bridge formation, thereby limiting Inuit travel. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Canada; Hudson Bay; Nunavut; Southampton Island; air temperature; cold air; immobilization; polynya; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; warming","Hudson Bay; ice bridge; Inuit knowledge; Kivalliq; Nunavut; remote sensing; Roes Welcome Sound; sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130517620"

The main goal of this article is to provide a realistic and comprehensive characterization of the sea ice and its snow cover that explains the microwave observations during a whole year using a radiative transfer model. For this purpose, we construct a unique dataset of passive microwave observations, to mimic the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR), along with the active microwave scatterometer data (ASCAT). CIMR database is used to classify sea ice microwave signatures in their spectral dimension with a machine learning technique while ASCAT data are used to help interpret the results of the classification. Classification results are then interpreted with a state-of-art sea ice and Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT) for all highlighted signatures and all seasons. Results make it possible to identify the specific behaviors from the observation co-variabilities for SIC, SIT, and snow structure. Our analysis underlined the role of the depth hoar over multi-year ice, for the interpretation of scattering signals in winter. Scattering signals that appear in late summer are explained by the presence of superimposed ice.

We used caribou movements between Banks, Melville and Victoria islands and mainland Canada, documented from Indigenous Knowledge, to assess whether spatiotemporal trends in sea-ice anomalies (1983–2019) can be used as an indicator of caribou movement. We used the SNOWPACK model to evaluate how foraging conditions (as indexed by simulated snow properties) contribute to the prediction of caribou presence. Our results suggest that changes in sea-ice anomalies over time have impacted caribou crossings between islands: caribou no longer use areas with less sea ice whilst they continue to use areas with more sea ice. Our model evaluation shows that, when the simulated snow conditions are paired with other environmental variables, the ability of models to predict Peary caribou occurrence on land was enhanced across Banks and Melville islands. Overall, the land models suggest that caribou are more likely to occupy areas with lower density of snow accumulation and a majority of forb tundra with dwarf shrubs for Banks Island and cryptogam tundra, rush and grass for the Melville Island Complex. Our results suggest that future work monitoring changes in sea-ice and snow conditions will be important for understanding the impact of climate change on the distribution of Peary caribou in the western Arctic. © 2022 Coralie Gautier et al.","Arctic; climate change; extreme event; indigenous knowledge; mammal; remote sensing; sea ice; snow","Arctic amplification; Climate change; seasonal movement; snow densification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138164316"

It studies some of the major parameters that cause resistance to the ship movement through sea ice. It aims to optimize a safe ship route in the Antarctic sea ice between Bharati and Maitri (Indian Research Stations in Antarctica) coasts. The study region is divided into grids that results into unique nodes, which are studied for sea ice parameters and wind velocity. Resistances caused due to ice and wind are considered to calculate expected ship velocity between nodes. The calculated ship velocities are then used to estimate durations to cover distances from a node to all the neighboring nodes. It forms a mathematical route from source to destination through various nodes with time as weight that is then optimized through Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain optimal route. Satellite remote sensing data derived sea ice parameters (Scatsat-1 derived sea ice extent and NSIDC sea ice concentration) and modeled wind velocity (from ECMWF) have been used as inputs in this model. Ship parameters of Kapitan Khlebnikov (Russian icebreaker) are used to test and compare the proposed model. Results of model are validated with the actual ship route navigated by the 33rd Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica (33ISEA) ship. The proposed algorithm, which provides an optimal route when ship parameters are known in advance, can be useful to support future ship navigation in the Antarctic sea ice including Indian Scientific Expeditions to Antarctica. © 2021 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR","Antarctica; East Antarctica; Maitri; algorithm; ice thickness; navigation; optimization; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; wind velocity","Ice concentration; Route optimization; Sea ice; Sea ice thickness and Dijkstra's algorithm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110244708"

Numerical modelling suggests these processes will play an important role in Antarctica's future sea-level contribution, but our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to ice tongue/shelf collapse is incomplete and largely based on observations from the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica. Here, we use remote sensing of structural glaciology and ice velocity from 2001 to 2020 and analyse potential ocean-climate forcings to identify mechanisms that triggered the rapid disintegration of ~2445 km2 of ice mélange and part of the Voyeykov Ice Shelf in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica between 27 March and 28 May 2007. Results show disaggregation was pre-conditioned by weakening of the ice tongue's structural integrity and was triggered by mélange removal driven by a regional atmospheric circulation anomaly and a less extensive latent-heat polynya. Disaggregation did not induce inland ice flow acceleration, but our observations highlight an important mechanism through which floating termini can be removed, whereby the break-out of mélange and multiyear landfast sea ice triggers disaggregation of a structurally-weak ice shelf. These observations highlight the need for numerical ice-sheet models to account for interactions between sea-ice, mélange and ice shelves.

In this study, the relative performance of four mainstream IST records, i.e. airborne IST, infrared radiometer measured IST (IR IST), longwave radiation derived IST (LWR IST), and snow and ice mass balance array buoy derived IST (Buoy IST), were evaluated against the MODIS IST product. Bias, standard deviation (STD), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the data quality. Results revealed that airborne IST had the best accuracy, which was 0.21 K colder than MODIS IST, with STD of 1.46 K and RMSE of 1.47 K. Ground-based ISTs were biased with each other but all warmer than the MODIS IST. The IR IST had the best overall accuracy (bias = 0.55 K; STD = 1.52 K; RMSE = 1.61 K), while the LWR IST was the noisiest measurement with the largest outlier data percent. Besides, co-located IR and LWR ISTs were more consistent than any type of evaluated IST against MODIS IST (correlation coefficient = 0.99).

The Brunt Ice Shelf (BIS), one of the ice shelves closest to the continental shelf break in the region, just released an iceberg with an area of ∼1,270 km2 in late February 2021 and another large calving event is imminent. However, recent changes in the BIS, since 2017, have not been studied to date. In this study, we used multi-source remote sensing data (including satellite images, ice flow velocity products, digital elevation models, and altimetry data) to conclude that the instability of the ice shelf has been increasing. The increased instability is manifested by rapidly increasing ice flow velocity and the propagation rate of full-thickness rifts. The velocity at the front of the BIS accelerated by more than doubled from 2013–2021, and the width of Chasm 1 increased by almost three-fold from 2012–2021. Based on the expansion of Chasm 1 and the strain rate changes, an iceberg with an area of ∼1,675 km2 is predicted to be released from the BIS during October 2022. We used meteorological data, ocean synthesis, and field observations to attribute the increased instability of the BIS to warm inflow onto the continental shelf, which emphasizes the importance of further observation and analysis. Additionally, owing to its special location, the BIS could be an indicator of the evolution of other ice shelves in the Southern Weddell Sea. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Antarctica; Brunt Ice Shelf; East Antarctica; Indicator indicator; Flow velocity; Sea ice; Stability; Strain rate; Antarctica; Brunt ice shelves; Climate warming; Continental shelfs; Glacier dynamics; Ice flow; Ice shelves; Iceberg calfing; Remote-sensing; Rift; climate change; glacier dynamics; global warming; ice shelf; iceberg calving; remote sensing; rift zone; Remote sensing","Antarctica; Brunt Ice Shelf; glacier dynamics; iceberg calving; remote sensing; rifts","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112389872"

Based on the multi-source remote-sensing data with inter-sensor calibration processing and the ship-based observational data from R/V Xuelong and M/V Yongsheng, the sea ice conditions of the Arctic Northeast Passage (NEP) during the 2002–2021 summer seasons were analyzed, and the navigability of the NEP between July and October from 2002 to 2021 was discussed. Inter-sensor calibration could effectively reduce the deviation from different passive microwave data. Sea ice extent and thickness in the NEP decreased annually, which resulted in the navigability of the NEP showing a potential tendency toward improvement in navigability. The navigation period was mainly concentrated in early August to early October. The middle part of the NEP was primarily affected by sea ice. This influence decreased over time, while the navigation period increased, especially in the Vilkitsky Strait, which is a key shipping area.

The amplification of global warming is the response to increases in precipitation originally caused by climate change. Arctic predominant increases in specific humidity and precipitation have been documented by observations. In comparison, evapotranspiration in the Arctic is poorly known, in part, because the spatial and temporal sparsity of accurate in situ and remote sensing observations. Although more than 20 observations sites in the Arctic are available, where AERONET sun photometer integrated water vapor (IWV) measurements have been conducted, that information have been barely used. Here, we present a comparison of IWV observations from radiosondes and AERONET sun photometers at ten sites located across the Arctic with the goal to document the feasibility of that set of observations to contribute to the ongoing and future research on polar regions. Sun photometer IWV observations are averaged for three-time windows; 30 min, 6 and 24 h. The predominant dry bias of AERONET IWV observations with respect to radiosondes, identified at tropical and midlatitudes, is also present in the Arctic. The statistics of the comparison show robust results at eight of the ten sites, with precision and accuracy magnitudes below 8 and 2% respectively. The possible causes of the less robust results at the other two sites are discussed. In addition, the impact of selecting other temporal coincidence windows in the average sun photometer IWV used in the comparison were tested. Auto-correlation in diurnal sun photometer IWV could produce appreciable bias in the statistics used for the comparison. We suggest using only one pair of values per day, consisting in the daily mean IWV sun photometer and the IWV radiosonde observation value. This feature should be valid also for comparison of IWV from sun photometer and other instruments. Maximum 10% error level of IWV from sun photometer observations, when compared with radiosondes, have been found for the Arctic. It is in the same order of magnitude than at tropical and middle latitudes locations. It has been demonstrated the feasibility of AERONET IWV observations in the Arctic for research on this variable. AERONET standard instruments and its centralized-standard processing algorithm allow its IWV observations to be considered a relative standard dataset for the re-calibration of other instrumental IWV observations assuming radiosondes as the absolute standard dataset. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic; Atmospheric corrosion; Atmospheric humidity; Global warming; Photometers; Photometry; Radiosondes; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Tropics; Water vapor; AERONET; Arctic; Atmospheric moisture; Ice and snow cover; Integrated water vapors; Policy makers; Remote-sensing; Sea-ice cover; Specific humidity; Sun photometers; accuracy assessment; AERONET; arctic environment; climate change; comparative study; humidity; photometer; precipitation assessment; precision; radiosonde; spatiotemporal analysis; water vapor; Snow","AERONET; Arctic; Integrated water vapor; Radiosonde; Sun photometer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123330004"

Advancing our understanding of the Arctic climate system requires improved TOA radiative fluxes. We compare Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) TOA radiative fluxes with Arctic Radiation-IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE) airborne measurements using two approaches: grid box averages and instantaneously matched footprints. Both approaches indicate excellent agreement in the longwave and good agreement in the shortwave (SW), within 2σ uncertainty considering all error sources (CERES and airborne radiometer calibration, inversion, and sampling). While the SW differences are within 2σ uncertainty, both approaches show a ∼−10 W m−2 average CERES-aircraft flux difference. Investigating the source of this negative difference, we find a substantial sensitivity of the flux differences to the sea ice concentration data set. Switching from imager-based to passive microwave-based sea ice data in the CERES inversion process reduces the differences in the grid box average fluxes and in the sea ice partly cloudy scene anisotropy in the matched footprints. In the long-term, more accurate sea ice concentration data are needed to reduce CERES TOA SW flux uncertainties. Switching from imager to passive microwave sea ice data, in the short-term, could improve CERES TOA SW fluxes in polar regions, additional testing is required. Our analysis indicates that calibration and sampling uncertainty limit the ability to place strong constraints (<±7%) on CERES TOA fluxes with aircraft measurements. © 2022 The Authors.

Its salinity variability reflects many fundamental processes, including sea ice formation/melting and river runoff, but its spatial and temporal characteristics require better documentation. This study utilizes remote sensing products and in situ observations collected by saildrone missions to investigate Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) variability. All Satellite products resolve the large-scale pattern set up by the relatively salty deep basin and the fresh coastal region, but they can be inaccurate near the ice edge and near land. The SSS annual cycle exhibits seasonal maxima in winter to spring, and minima in summer to fall. The amplitude and timing of the seasonal cycle are variable, especially on the eastern Bering Sea shelf. SSS variability recorded by both saildrone, and satellite instruments provide unprecedented insights into short-term oceanic processes including sea ice melting, wind-driven currents during weather events, and river plumes etc. In particular, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite demonstrates encouraging skills in capturing the freshening signals induced by spring sea ice melting. The Yukon River plume is another source of intense SSS variability. Surface wind forcing plays an essential role in controlling the horizontal movement of plume water and thereby shaping the SSS seasonal cycle in local regions. © 2022 by the authors.

The influence of thin ice, lead and polynya has been well investigated, however, the effect of perennial ice (also called multiyear ice, MYI) has not. This study is motivated by it and investigated a hypothesis that changes in MYI concentration in winter triggers changes in short-term local 2-m air temperature. The hypothesis was tested using time series analysis of the two parameters and correlation between them. Data from the winters of 2004–2009 were used for the examination at three spatial scales. The hypothesis is found to be potentially accepted when MYI exists in a consolidated ice regime with negligible thin ice or open water in the surroundings, and the air temperature is low enough. Conditions for the acceptance of the hypothesis were quantitatively identified. The qualifications entail that the ice cell must experience daily change of MYI concentration meanwhile satisfy the criteria of total ice concentration (TIC), young ice concentration (YIC) and air temperature (Tair) in the surrounding area, which are TIC >88.3%, YIC <9.5% and Tair<–19.0 °C. Inverse relationships between changes in MYI concentration and the corresponding changes in air temperature were developed retroactively using data that satisfied the acceptance conditions. The relationships varied with years, depending on ice conditions such as ice type distributions and snow cover. This study offers a first attempt to assess the effect of MYI on the same-day local surface air temperature using satellite observations, and provides evidence of this effect under quantitatively quanlifying conditions. © 2022 The Authors","","Arctic response to climate change; Arctic sea ice; Microwave remote sensing; Multiyear ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133657764"

The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) instrument, as an innovative remote sensor that operates at multiple small incidence angles, is different from existing sensors with moderate and normal incidence modes for sea ice monitoring. Sea ice recognition at small incidence angles has rarely been studied. Moreover, SWIM uses a discrimination flag of sea ice and sea water to remove sea ice from sea wave products. Therefore, this research focuses on sea ice recognition in the Arctic based on SWIM data from October 2020 to April 2021. Eleven features are first extracted, and applied for the analysis of the waveform characteristics using the cumulative probability distribution (CPD) and mutual information measurement (MIM). Then, random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are built, and their abilities of sea ice recognition are assessed. The optimal classifier is the KNN method with Euclidean distance and k equal to 11. Feature combinations are also used to separate sea ice and sea water based on the KNN method to select the optimal combination. Thus, the optimal classifier-feature assembly at each small incidence angle is established, and the highest overall accuracy reaches 97.1%. Moreover, the application of the optimal classifier–feature assemblies is studied, and its performance is fairly good. These assemblies yield high accuracies in the short- and long-term periods of sea ice recognition, and the overall accuracies are greater than 93.1%. So, the proposed method satisfies the SWIM requirement of removing the sea ice effect. Moreover, sea ice extents and edges can be extracted from SWIM sea ice recognition results at a high level of precision greater than 94.8%. As a result, the optimal classifier–feature assemblies based on SWIM data express the effectiveness of the SWIM approach in sea ice recognition. Our work not only highlights the new sea ice monitoring technology of remote sensing at small incidence angles, but also studies the application of SWIM data in sea ice services.

For now, many satellite derived Arctic sea ice motion products have been released but few studies have conducted comparisons of these products. In this study, eleven satellite sea ice motion products from the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF), the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), and the French Research Institute for the Exploitation of the Seas (Ifremer) were systematically evaluated and compared based on buoys from the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP) and the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) over 2018–2020. The results show that the mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ice speed for these products are 1.15–2.26 km/d and the MAEs of ice motion angle are 14.93–23.19°. Among all products, Ifremer_AMSR2 achieves the best accuracy in terms of speed error, NSIDC_Pathfinder shows the lowest angle error and OSI-405-c_Merged performs best in sea-ice drift trajectory recon-struction. Moreover, season, region, data source, ice drift tracking algorithm, and time interval all influence the accuracy of these products: (1) The sea ice motion bias in the freezing season (1.04– 1.96 km/d and 11.93–22.41°) is smaller than that in the melting season (1.13–3.90 km/d and 14.41– 27.41°) for most of the products. (2) Most products perform worst in East Greenland, where ice movements are fast and complex. (3) The accuracies of the products derived from AMSR-2 remotely sensed data are better than those from other data sources. (4) The continuous maximum cross-cor-relation (CMCC) algorithm outperforms the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) algorithm in sea ice drift retrieval. (5) The MAEs of sea ice motion with longer time interval are relatively smaller. Over-all, the results indicate that the eleven remote sensing Arctic sea ice drift products are of practical use for data assimilation and model validation if uncertainties are appropriately considered. Fur-thermore, this study provides some improvement directions for sea ice drift retrieval from satellite data. © 2022 by the authors.

The analysis was performed according to the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) using NASA algorithms Team (Sea Ice Index) and Near-Real-Time Passive Microwave/Visible Data Sharing DMSP SSMIS Daily Polar gridded Sea Ice Concentrations and Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Passive Microwave Data (MASIE-NH). The absolute and relative difference of the ice cover values were calculated using the algorithms Sea Ice Index and MASIE-NH with daily discreteness for 14 ice seasons from 2006 to 2020. Despite the fact that the spatial resolutions of the data of the algorithms under consideration and the quantitative criteria for the condition for classifying a pixel as pure water or ice extent differed (the side of the pixel was 25 and 4 km, identification was 15 and 40 %, respectively), the curves of the average seasonal variation of the ice cover were in phase and that was confirmed by the high value of the correlation coefficient (0.92). It was determined that the difference in ice cover values were not critical and were within the calculation limits, which allowed using data from both sources without calculating correction factors. Sea Data Ice Index data should be appropriate for long-term analysis of inter-seasonal variability, since data series of observations with daily discreteness have been available since 1978. It was concluded that the use of both sources would be quite acceptable in the analysis of intra-seasonal fluctuations. A characteristic feature of Sea Ice Index was noted – the presence of ice throughout the warm season. Although according to literary sources, such a phenomenon in the Bering Sea was typical only for severe types of winters. That was probably due to the technical difficulties in identifying the ice extent using passive microwave sounding methods. © 2022 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions. © 2022 American Geophysical Union.

We present a critical review of historical polar eddy covariance studies and can identify only five that present comparable flux datasets. Assessment of ancillary datasets, including sea-ice coverage and type and air-sea concentration gradient of carbon dioxide, used to interpret flux datasets (with a specific focus on their role in estimating and interpreting sea ice zone gas transfer velocities) identifies that standardised methodologies to characterise the flux footprint would be beneficial. In heterogeneous ice environments both ancillary data uncertainties and controls on gas exchange are notably complex. To address the poor understanding, we highlight how future efforts should focus on the collection of robust gas flux datasets within heterogeneous sea ice regions during key seasonal processes alongside consistent ancillary data with a full characterisation of their associated uncertainties. © 2022","Air; Carbon dioxide; Gases; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Air-sea carbon-dioxide flux; Air-sea gas exchange; Carbon dioxide flux; Critical review; Eddy covariance; Gas exchange; Gas transfer; Gas transfer velocity; Remote-sensing; Transfer velocity; air-sea interaction; carbon flux; eddy covariance; gas exchange; literature review; sea ice; Sea ice","Air-sea carbon-dioxide fluxes; Air-sea gas exchange; Eddy covariance; Gas transfer velocity; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123793403"

The algorithm introduces the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module and Atrous Depthwise Separable Convolution on the basis of U -Net to develop a new independent sea ice segmentation network U-ASPP-Net. Meanwhile, FDWloss is used as the loss function at the back end of the network. Finally, the overlap elimination strategy is used to generate the final independent sea ice segmentation map.

It has a strong ability to extract details and edges, and has a high degree of reduction to tiny sea ice. In addition, this algorithm can solve the problem of thin cloud interference that cannot be solved when extracting independent sea ice based on medium-resolution remote sensing images to a certain extent.

A common simplification is the assumption of totally random orientation (TRO); however, studies have revealed that TRO occurs relatively infrequently in reality. A more appropriate assumption is that of azimuthally random orientation (ARO), but so far it has been a com-putationally expensive task. Recently a fast approximate approach was introduced that incorporates hydrometeor orientation into the assimilation of data from microwave conically scanning instruments. The approach scales the extinction in vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarised channels to approximate ARO. In this study, the application of the approach was extended to a more basic radiative transfer perspective using the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator and the high-frequency channels of the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI). The comparison of forward simulations and GMI observations showed that with a random selection of scaling factors from a uniform distribution between 1 and 1.4–1.5, it is possible to mimic the full distribution of observed polarisation differences at 166 GHz over land and water. The applicability of this model at 660 GHz was also successfully demonstrated by means of existing airborne data. As a complement, a statistical model for polarised snow emissivity between 160 and 190 GHz was also developed. Combining the two models made it possible to reproduce the polarisation signals that were observed over all surface types, including snow and sea ice. Further, we also investigated the impact of orientation on the ice water path (IWP) retrievals. It has been shown that ignoring hydrometeor orientation has a significant negative impact (∼20% in the tropics) on retrieval accuracy. The retrieval with GMI observations produced highly realistic IWP distributions. A significant highlight was the retrieval over snow covered regions, which have been neglected in previous retrieval studies. These results provide increased confidence in the performance of passive microwave observation simulations and mark an essential step towards developing the retrievals of ice hydrometeor properties based on data from GMI, the Ice Cloud Imager (ICI) and other conically scanning instruments. © 2022 by the authors.

Recently, the sea ice community has entered a new era of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites operating at C-band with the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014 and Sentinel-1B (S1) in 2016 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) in 2019. These missions represent five spaceborne SAR sensors that together routinely cover the pan-Arctic sea ice domain. Here, we describe, apply, and validate the Environment and Climate Change Canada automated sea ice tracking system (ECCC-ASITS) that routinely generates large-scale sea ice motion (SIM) over the pan-Arctic domain using SAR images from S1 and RCM. We applied the ECCC-ASITS to the incoming image streams of S1 and RCM from March 2020 to October 2021 using a total of 135471 SAR images and generated new SIM datasets (7d 25km and 3d 6.25km) by combining the image stream outputs of S1 and RCM (S1+RCM). Results indicate that S1+RCM SIM provides more coverage in the Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea, and directly over the North Pole compared to SIM from S1 alone. Based on the resolvable S1+RCM SIM grid cells, the 7d 25km spatiotemporal scale is able to provide the most complete picture of SIM across the pan-Arctic from SAR imagery alone, but considerable spatiotemporal coverage is also available from 3d 6.25 SIM products. S1+RCM SIM is resolved within the narrow channels and inlets of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, filling a major gap from coarser-resolution sensors. Validating the ECCC-ASITS using S1 and RCM imagery against buoys indicates a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.78km for dry ice conditions and 3.43km for melt season conditions. Higher speeds are more apparent with S1+RCM SIM as comparison with the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) SIM product and the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) SIM product indicated an RMSE of u 4.6kmd-1 and v 4.7kmd-1 for the NSIDC and u 3.9kmd-1 and v 3.9kmd-1 for OSI SAF. Overall, our results demonstrate the robustness of the ECCC-ASITS for routinely generating large-scale SIM entirely from SAR imagery across the pan-Arctic domain. Copyright:  © 2022 Stephen E. L.

Sea ice flux estimates through the Fram Strait based on satellite remote sensing exist. However, they show discrepancies, which mainly result from the sparse valid satellite observations and the increased uncertainty of sea ice motion in the Fram Strait. In order to improve the sea ice flux estimates, we develop an improved sea-ice velocity retrieval algorithm from 89 GHz brightness temperature fields of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS and AMSR2. The improved retrieval algorithm employs an adjusted size of the template window and performs bilinear interpolation on candidate windows before the matching procedure. Instead of depending on external data sources, we construct the SIV uncertainty fields depending only on the maximum correlation coefficients of the image itself. Compared with two similar Passive Microwave (PM) sea ice velocity datasets, the new sea-ice velocity has lower bias and root-mean-square error with respect to buoy observations. In addition, the data density of the new SIV is 14% and 36% higher than the two reference datasets, respectively. Monthly sea ice area flux estimates through the Fram Strait are acquired with the new daily sea-ice velocity data and the existed sea-ice concentration. And it indicates that the improved sea ice area flux estimated by PM sea ice velocity agrees well with the Synthetic-aperture radar-derived sea ice area flux. © 2022 The Authors.

In this regard, remote sensing (RS) systems offer exceptional advantages for mapping and monitoring various oceanographic parameters with acceptable temporal and spatial resolutions over the oceans and coastal areas. So far, different methods have been developed to study oceans using various RS systems. This urges the necessity of having review studies that comprehensively discuss various RS systems, including passive and active sensors, and their advantages and limitations for ocean applications. In this article, the goal is to review most RS systems and approaches that have been worked on marine applications. This review paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to the passive RS systems for ocean studies. As such, four primary passive systems, including optical, thermal infrared radiometers, microwave radiometers, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems, are comprehensively discussed. Additionally, this article summarizes the main passive RS sensors and satellites, which have been utilized for different oceanographic applications. Finally, various oceanographic parameters, which can be retrieved from the data acquired by passive RS systems, along with the corresponding methods, are discussed.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Ecosystems; Global positioning system; Information management; Infrared radiation; Marine applications; Marine pollution; Microwave sensors; Oceanography; Oil spills; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Aquatic vegetation; Coral reef; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Ocean chlorophyll; Ocean color; Ocean salinity; Ocean satellite observation; Optical reflection; Optical remote sensing; Optical scattering; Remote-sensing; Satellite observations; Sea measurements; Ship detection; Thermal-infrared; Tidal; aquatic plant; bathymetry; chlorophyll; coral reef; GNSS; ocean color; oceanic current; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; Sea ice","Aquatic vegetation; bathymetry; coral reef; Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS); ocean chlorophyll; ocean color (OC); ocean current; ocean salinity; ocean satellite observations; oil spill; optical remote sensing (ORS); radiometers; sea ice (SI); ship detection; thermal infrared (TIR); tidal","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121817762"

Limitations of satellite remote sensing such as the inability to detect bloom activity throughout the water column, under ice, and in cloudy conditions dictate the need for shipboard based measurements to provide more information on bloom dynamics. In this study, we adapted remote sensing land cover classification techniques to provide a new means to determine bloom stage from shipboard samples. Specifically, we used multiyear satellite time series of chlorophyll a to determine whether in-situ blooms were actively growing or mature (i.e., past-peak) at the time of field sampling. Field observations of chlorophyll a and pheophytin (degraded and oxidized chlorophyll products) were used to calculate pheophytin proportions, i.e., (Pheophytin/(Chlorophyll a + Pheophytin)) and empirically determine whether the bloom was growing or mature based on remotely sensed bloom stages. Data collected at 13 north Bering Sea stations each July from 2013–2019 supported a pheophytin proportion of 28% as the best empirical threshold to distinguish a growing vs. mature bloom stage. One outcome was that low vs. high sea ice years resulted in significantly different pheophytin proportions in July; in years with low winter-to-spring ice, more blooms with growing status were observed, compared to later stage, more mature blooms following springs with abundant seasonal sea ice. The detection of growing blooms in July following low ice years suggests that changes in the timing of the spring bloom triggers cascading effects on mid-summer production.

Currently, significant changes in the extent and thickness of the sea ice sheet are occurring. Not only the volume but also the structure of the sea ice is changing. Based on field measurements and remote sensing data, the paper shows the importance of taking into account the morphometric (structural) inhomogeneities of sea ice when modeling its interaction with the atmosphere. Identification of snowfields, hummocks and leads with the help of remote sensing methods is considered. Particular attention is paid to the marginal zones. The applicability of different spectral ranges for determining the relative area of structural inhomogeneities on the ice surface is investigated. The dependence of the drag coefficient and the aerodynamic roughness parameter on the surface structure is considered. The drag coefficient depends nonlinearly on the concentration of the ice cover, the relative area of snow patches on the surface, on the width and configuration of the leads, on the spatial arrangement and height of the hummocks, and also on the stratification of the atmosphere. The parameterizations proposed in this paper can be used to calculate heat and momentum fluxes in weather and climate models, as well as to interpret remote sensing data. © 2022 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The Malinka18 algorithm stood out as the most accurate algorithm for the retrieval of Hp. For the retrieval of Hi, Malinka18 and Zhang21 algorithms could also provide reasonable results and both can be applied under clear and overcast sky conditions, while retrievals under clear sky conditions are more accurate. The retrieval results of Hi for Lu18 agreed better with field measurements for thin ice (Hi < 1 m) than that for thick ice, but those results of Hp were not satisfactory. The König20 algorithm was only suitable for clear sky conditions, and underestimated Hp, while show-ing a good agreement with Hp < 0.15 m. For Arctic applications, Malinka18 and Zhang21 algorithms provided a basis and reference for the satellite optical data such as WoeldView2 to retrieve Hp and Hi.

Satellite imagery, in particular Sentinel-2 (S2), may enable large-scale monitoring of coastal areas in Greenland but its use is impacted by the optically complex environments and the scarcity of supporting data in the region. Additionally, the canopies of the dominant macrophyte species in Greenland do not extend to the sea surface, limiting the use of indices that exploit the reflection of near-infrared radiation by vegetation due to its absorption by seawater. Three hypotheses are tested: I) 10-m S2 imagery and commonly used detection methods can identify intertidal macrophytes that are exposed at low tide in an optically complex fjord system in Greenland impacted by marine and land terminating glaciers; II) detached and floating macrophytes accumulate in patches that are sufficiently large to be detected by 10-m S2 images; III) iceberg scour and/or turbid meltwater runoff shape the spatial distribution of intertidal macroalgae in fjord systems with marine-terminating glaciers. The NDVI produced the best results in optically complex fjord systems in Greenland. 12 km2 of exposed intertidal macrophytes were identified in the study area at low tide. Floating mats of macrophytes ranged in area from 400 m2 to 326,800 m2 and were most common at the mouth of the fjord. Icebergs and turbidity appear to play a role in structuring the distribution of intertidal macrophytes and the retreat of marine terminating glaciers could allow macrophytes cover to expand. The challenges and solutions presented here apply to most fjords in Greenland and, therefore, the methodology may be extended to produce a Greenland-wide estimate of intertidal macrophytes. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic Regions; Estuaries; Greenland; Satellite Imagery; Seawater; Arctic; Greenland; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Infrared reflection; Optical remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Surface waters; Vegetation mapping; sea water; Blue carbon; Coastal area; Complex environments; Green land; Large-scale monitoring; Macro-algae; Macrophytes; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; macroalga; macrophyte; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vegetation index; Arctic; estuary; Greenland; satellite imagery; Carbon","Blue carbon; Greenland; Macroalgae; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145666007"

A study of the rheological properties of GPI is carried out by comparing the predictions of two viscous wave propagation models: the Keller model and the close-packing (CP) model, with the observed wave attenuation obtained by SAR image techniques. In order to fit observations, it is shown that describing GPI as a viscous medium requires the adoption of an ice viscosity which increases with the ice thickness. The consequences regarding the possibility of ice thickness retrieval from remote sensing data of wave attenuation are discussed. We provide examples of GPI thickness retrievals from a Sentinel-1 C band SAR image taken in the Beaufort Sea on 1 November 2015, and three CosmoSkyMed X band SAR images taken in the Weddell Sea on March 2019.

The region facing the most significant impact is the marginal ice zone, where the ice covers are more dynamic and the wave-ice interactions are stronger than in the central Arctic. The need for reliable forecasts of the wave and ice conditions in this partially ice-covered region has motivated a rapid increase of wave-in-ice studies. Mathematical models for wave-in-ice have been developed for over a century. Earlier models were based on simple physical concepts. The complexity of these models increased over time. Field data have been difficult to obtain because of the scale of the phenomenon and the harsh environment. Laboratory experiments have shown promise for obtaining meaningful data to check the theories. However, scaling up to field conditions is a challenge. With the improvements of instrumentation coupled with remote sensing capabilities, large amount of field data have become available. Laboratory studies have also increased in recent years. This paper provides a brief overview of the theories, laboratory and field experiments.

This work was embedded into the interdisciplinary design of the 5 MOSAiC teams, studying the atmosphere, the sea ice, the ocean, the ecosystem, and biogeochemical processes. The overall aim of the snow and sea ice observations during MOSAiC was to characterize the physical properties of the snow and ice cover comprehensively in the central Arctic over an entire annual cycle. This objective was achieved by detailed observations of physical properties and of energy and mass balance of snow and ice. By studying snow and sea ice dynamics over nested spatial scales from centimeters to tens of kilometers, the variability across scales can be considered. On-ice observations of in situ and remote sensing properties of the different surface types over all seasons will help to improve numerical process and climate models and to establish and validate novel satellite remote sensing methods; the linkages to accompanying airborne measurements, satellite observations, and results of numerical models are discussed. We found large spatial variabilities of snow metamorphism and thermal regimes impacting sea ice growth. We conclude that the highly variable snow cover needs to be considered in more detail (in observations, remote sensing, and models) to better understand snow-related feedback processes. The ice pack revealed rapid transformations and motions along the drift in all seasons. The number of coupled ice–ocean interface processes observed in detail are expected to guide upcoming research with respect to the changing Arctic sea ice. © 2022 The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; mass balance; metamorphism; remote sensing; research vessel; satellite data; sea ice; snow cover","Arctic drift study; Atmosphere–ice–ocean interaction; Coupled climate system; Interdisciplinary research; Snow and sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124645931"

It is difficult to quantitatively address the specific problems encountered by ships sailing in the Arctic in real time through traditional manual approaches. Additionally, existing sea ice information service systems focus on data sharing and lack online calculation and analysis capabilities, making it difficult for decision-makers to derive valuable information from massive amounts of data. To improve navigation analysis through intelligent information service, we built an advanced Ship Navigation Information Service System (SNISS) using a 3D geographic information system (GIS) based on big Earth data. The SNISS includes two main features: (1) heuristic algorithms were developed to identify the optimal navigation route of the Arctic Northeast Passage (NEP) from a macroscale perspective for the past 10 years to the next 100 years, and (2) for key sea straits along the NEP, online local sea-ice images can be retrieved to provide a fully automatic sea ice data processing workflow, solving the problems of poor flexibility and low availability of real sea ice remote sensing data extraction.

These plumes are observed in the BrO vertical column densities (VCDs), retrieved from satellite sensors. Tropospheric BrO depletes tropospheric ozone and facilitates the deposition of mercury. Bromine molecules are mainly released from young sea ice, and meteorological parameters determine the formation and evolution of enhanced BrO VCD plumes. Due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes involved in the bromine explosion, the modeling of tropospheric BrO VCDs in chemical transport models is challenging and not yet adequate. The first of its type, this study demonstrates the potential of using an artificial neural network (ANN), which uses meteorological parameters and sea ice age as inputs to simulate and predict tropospheric BrO VCDs in the Arctic. The ANN is trained and validated using a 22-year satellite remote sensing dataset of Arctic tropospheric BrO VCDs. A generally satisfactory spatial agreement between observed and simulated tropospheric BrO VCDs is observed. However, the magnitude of the observed BrO VCD plumes is underestimated. Air temperature and mean sea level pressure are the most important parameters influencing the magnitude of tropospheric BrO VCD simulations. Although the changing spatial distribution of tropospheric BrO VCDs over time is well captured, the trend reported in the observations of tropospheric BrO VCDs is not reproduced by the ANN, suggesting that additional parameters not included in the ANN also influence the formation of tropospheric BrO VCD plumes. © 2022 The Authors","Air; Arctic; Niger [West Africa]; Atmospheric chemistry; Bromine compounds; Ozone; Ozone layer; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Troposphere; bromine; Arctic; Bromine explosion; Bromine monoxide; Meteorological parameters; Natural phenomenon; Ozone depletion; Polar spring; Satellite sensors; Tropospheric ozone; Vertical column densities; artificial neural network; deposition; simulation; troposphere; air temperature; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Article; artificial neural network; boundary layer; comparative study; computer simulation; low temperature; machine learning; meteorology; ozone depletion; physical chemistry; remote sensing; sea ice; sea level; wind speed; Neural networks","Arctic; Artificial neural network; Atmospheric chemistry; Bromine explosion; Ozone depletion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125913829"

These changes are most noticeable on small Arctic islands, once surrounded by thick ice fields but increasingly exposed to open water, thus making them of special interest. During the unique complex expedition ""Open Ocean: Archipelagoes of the Arctic. Severnaya Zemlya-2019"" on the Professor Molchanov research vessel in August-September 2019 full-scale field surveys of the islands and unmanned surveys from quadcopters were conducted. Subsequent surveys based on remote sensing data are intended to combine detailed field surveys with an overview coverage of these islands. Different nature of the islands requires applying different methods of studying their dynamics with remote sensing data. Changes in the islands' coastline are traced using a set of different time sources, i. e. the 1957 topographic map (1:200 000) and space images from Landsat 5, 7 satellites. The current situation is described according to cloud-free images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellites. Multiple interferometric images of Sentinel-IB (IW - Interferometric Wide Swath) radar system processing level SLC - Single Look Complex for 2019 supported a study of the seasonal dynamics of the Vize Island surface. The multiyear dynamics of ice edge retreat was revealed for the Ushakov Island. The retreat rate analysis proved the accelerated decrease of the ice cap area since the 2010-s. We accessed the influence of changing climatic conditions on the coastline dynamics of the Vize and Ushakov islands with due account of the wind speed and direction and the air temperature. Uneven coastal erosion is characteristic of the Vize Island, and the areas with the highest rate of coastline retreat were identified, as well as new accumulative forms, e. g. bars. Multitemporal composites with coherence obtained from the radar data made it possible to characterize the seasonal dynamics of the state of the Vize island surface and its dependence on variable weather conditions. The results of research show an obvious response of the small islands' coastlines to the climate changes of the 20th - 21st centuries. © 2022 Moskovskij Universitet.

Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radiometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncertainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter-band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration. © 2022 The Authors","Atlantic Ocean; Belgium; North Sea; Ostend; West Flanders; Biomass; Calibration; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Radiometry; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Water absorption; Autonomous measurement; Belgian coastal zone; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral radiometry; Hyperspectral satellite; Hyperspectral satellite sensor; Inter-band calibration; PANTHYR; Phaeocystis globosa; Satellite sensors; algal bloom; atmospheric correction; biomass; biomonitoring; calibration; coastal water; coastal zone; future prospect; in situ measurement; satellite sensor; signal-to-noise ratio; Signal to noise ratio","Autonomous measurements; Belgian coastal zone; Hyperspectral radiometry; Hyperspectral satellite sensors; Inter-band calibration; PANTHYR; Phaeocystis globosa; Signal to noise ratio","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138757228"

Their persistence is threatened by the rapid loss of sea ice from the Arctic Ocean due to climate change, but this threat will be at least partially offset by the replacement of multiyear ice (MYI) with first-year ice (FYI). FYI is thinner and usually features a thinner snow cover than MYI, thus transmitting more light to support ice algal growth. We combined remote sensing, reanalysis data, and modeling products with a radiative transfer model to assess how the changing physical conditions in the Arctic altered the extent and duration of the bottom ice algal habitat over a 34-year period. Habitat was defined as areas where enough light penetrates to the bottom ice to support net positive photosynthesis. The Arctic shifted from 37% FYI in 1985 to 63% in 2018, as the 2.0 × 106 km2 increase in FYI extent outpaced the 0.6 × 106 km2 decrease in overall sea ice extent above the Arctic Circle. The proliferation of younger ice corresponded with a 0.08 m decade-1 decrease in average sea ice thickness and a 0.003 m decade-1 decrease in average snow depth. The end of the ice algal season, marked by the onset of warm summer air temperatures, moved slightly earlier, by 1.4 days decade-1. Our analysis indicates that ice algal habitat extent increased by 0.4 × 106 km2 decade-1, or from 48% to 66% of total sea ice extent. The average ice algal growing season also lengthened by 2.4 days and shifted earlier in the year. Together, these trends suggest that net primary production in Arctic sea ice increased during 1985-2018. The most dramatic changes were localized in the Central Basin and the Chukchi Sea and were driven primarily by the declining snow cover and the shift from MYI to FYI. Although the Arctic recently became more favorable to ice algae, we expect that this trend will not continue indefinitely, as a limited amount of MYI remains. © 2022 The Author(s)","Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; climate change; growing season; ice thickness; microalga; net primary production; radiative transfer; sea ice; snow cover; time series analysis","Arctic Ocean; Climate change; Microalgae; Primary producers; Sea ice; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145448581"

We show here that use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) operational surface reflectance satellite product to derive albedo in the PAR spectral range is possible. To retrieve PAR albedo from the remote sensing surface reflectance, we trained a predictive model based on a principal component analysis with in situ and simulated data. The predictive model can be applied to first-year sea ice surfaces such as dry snow, melting snow, bare ice and melt ponds. Based on in situ measurements and the prescribed atmospheric correction uncertainty, the estimated PAR albedo had a mean absolute error of 0.057, a root mean square error of 0.074 and an R2 value of 0.91. As a demonstration, we retrieved PAR albedo on a 9-km2 area over late spring and early summer 2015 and 2016 at a coastal location in Baffin Bay, Canada. On-site measurements of PAR albedo, melt pond fraction and types of precipitation were used to examine the estimated PAR albedo time series. The results show a dynamic and realistic PAR albedo time series, although clouds remained the major obstacle to the method. This easy-to-implement model may be used for the partitioning of PAR in the Arctic Ocean and ultimately to better understand the dynamics of marine primary producers.  © 2022 The Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; albedo; photosynthetically active radiation; phytoplankton; satellite; sea ice; time series","Photosynthetically available radiation; Phytoplankton; Satellite; Sea ice; Surface reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130945642"

Marginal ice zone (MIZ) is defined as the transition zone between open ocean and pack ice where intensive air–ice–ocean–wave​ interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere occur. This definition of MIZ is rather vague, which affects its mapping. Previous data-driven methods extracted MIZ from single source data and conveniently used a single classification threshold. In this study, we propose to apply a concept-driven top down extraction method. We use a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to integrate multiple ice properties based upon the MIZ definition, and use membership functions to quantify the uncertainty of the threshold for several ice characteristics. This concept-driven method is applied to mapping the Antarctic MIZ between 2010 and 2021. Results show that a FIS successfully combines the ice concentration and ice thickness, while it allowed us to map the MIZ as objects with vague boundaries, thus well-presenting its indeterminate nature in space. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Antarctic; Fuzzy inference system; Marginal ice zone; Membership; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122958503"

For the initial competition, our team ranked 3rd place (deepjoker) in the accuracy leaderboard and the solution has been the most efficient algorithm to achieve a segmentation score above 97.79%. In this article, we briefly introduce our three strategies of the achievement including: 1) decoding the partial pretrained networks which can simultaneously capture the complex boundaries of sea ices and decrease the computational cost without the performance drop; 2) employing the classwise Dice loss for solving the gradient vanishing problem when most ground-truth maps are backgrounds; and 3) replacing the commonly exploited decoder with the one proposed by Silva et al. (2021). The main contributions are twofold: 1) an efficient and effective sea-ice segmentation method is proposed and 2) the gradient vanishing problem of binary Dice loss is investigated under some scenarios and solved by introducing its classwise version. Comparison and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to other commonly adopted deep segmentation models.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Decoding; Optical remote sensing; Sea ice; Semantic Segmentation; Decoding; Gaofen challenge; Gradient vanishing problem; Images segmentations; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Road; Sea ice segmentation; Semantic segmentation; Task analysis; accuracy assessment; comparative study; efficiency measurement; forecasting method; ground-based measurement; hazard assessment; navigation aid; performance assessment; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; segmentation; ship technology; Semantics","Gaofen (GF) challenge; gradient vanishing problem; sea-ice segmentation; semantic segmentation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132735731"

Melt ponds on the surface of melting Arctic sea ice are of particular interest as they are sensitive and valuable indicators and are proxy to the processes in the Arctic climate system. Manual analysis of this remote sensing data is extremely difficult and time-consuming due to the complex shapes and unpredictable boundaries of the melt ponds, and that leads to the necessity for automatizing the processes. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient automatic method for melt pond region segmentation and boundary extraction from high-resolution aerial photographs. The proposed algorithm is based on a swin transformer U-Net in which we introduce novel cross-channel attention mechanisms into the decoder design. The framework operates with optical data and allows for classifying imagery into four classes, i.e., sea ice/snow, open water, melt pond, and submerged ice. We use aerial photographs collected during the Healy-Oden Trans Arctic Expedition over Arctic sea ice in the summer season of 2005 as test data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for precise automatic extraction of melt pond geometry, and it can also be extended for other optical data sources that involve melt ponds.

High mobility of sea ice implies that there may be fragmented ice floes that are susceptible to quick displacement, thus allowing an icebreaker to navigate through the ice. © 2021, Current Science.

Remote sensing and forecasting of Southern Ocean sea ice at time scales suitable for navigation and research planning remain challenging. In this study, numerical sea ice drift forecasts are assessed from the perspective of informing shipping operations. A series of tests is performed to ascertain whether an operational global ocean and sea ice model and a simple free-drift model can provide accurate drift estimates over short lead times. Both approaches are evaluated against ice drift measurements from buoys deployed during two research cruises in the Southern Ocean marginal ice zone during winter and spring. The numerical forecast model was able to forecast sea ice trajectories over 24 h with an average position error of 16.6 km during winter and 9.2 km during spring. The simpler free-drift model, using empirically optimised wind scaling, returned an average position error of 15.9 and 9.3 km during winter and spring respectively. Model skill for both the dynamical and free-drift models is lower in winter than in spring. Free-drift model skill appears linked with sea ice consolidation, which may assist in determining when and where this approach is fit for purpose. Lingering uncertainties regarding the rheological representation of sea ice in the dynamical model and the quality of the wind and ocean forcing remain, potentially affecting model skill over tactical navigation time frames. © 2021 Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology.","Southern Ocean; marginal ice zone","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100805102"

Theoretical studies hypothesize that the eddy-driven overturning and the ice-ocean drag are crucial mechanisms of the gyre equilibration in response to atmospheric winds. However, due to severe weather conditions and limitations of remote sensing instruments, there are only sparse eddy observations in the ice-covered Arctic Ocean. Hence, the evolution of the under-ice eddy field, its impact on the gyre variability, and their mutual response to the ongoing Arctic warming remain uncertain. Here, we infer the characteristics of the under-ice eddy field by establishing its tight connection to the angular velocities of isolated spinning sea ice floes in marginal ice zones. Using over two decades of satellite observations of marginal ice zones in the western Arctic Ocean, we identified and tracked thousands of floes and used idealized eddy modeling to infer the interannual evolution of the eddy energetics underneath the ice. We find that the eddy field is strongly correlated to the strength of the Beaufort Gyre on interannual timescales, which provides the major observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of the gyre equilibration by eddies. The inferred trends over the past two decades signify that the gyre and its eddy field have been intensifying as the sea ice cover has been declining. Our results imply that with continuing sea ice decline, the eddy field and the Beaufort Gyre will keep intensifying and leading to enhanced transport of freshwater and biogeochemical tracers. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129127539"

Our analysis finds a strong correlation between 8-day averaged SMAP L-band brightness temperature (TB) bias and TB measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) in the C-through Ka-band frequency range for sea-ice contaminated ocean scenes. We show how this correlation can be employed to develop: (1) a discriminant analysis that is able to reliably flag the SMAP observations for sea-ice contamination and (2) subsequently remove the sea-ice contamination from the SMAP observations, which results in significantly more accurate SMAP SSS retrievals near the sea-ice edge. We provide a case study that evaluates the performance of the proposed sea-ice flagging and correction algorithm. Our method is also able to detect drifting icebergs, which go often undetected in many available standard sea-ice products and thus result in spurious SMAP SSS retrievals. © 2021 by the authors.

The reduction of sea ice in the Arctic region has altered the magnitude of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) entering the water column, impacting primary productivity. Increasing cloudiness in the atmosphere and rising turbidity in the coastal waters of the Arctic region are considered as the major factors that counteract the effect of reduced sea ice on underwater PAR. Additionally, extreme solar zenith angles and sea-ice cover in the AO increase the complexity of retrieving PAR. In this study, a PAR algorithm based on radiative transfer in the atmosphere and satellite observations is implemented to evaluate the effect of these factors on PAR in the coastal AO. To improve the performance of the algorithm, a flag is defined to identify pixels containing open-water, sea-ice or cloud. The use of flag enabled selective application of algorithms to compute the input parameters for the PAR algorithm. The PAR algorithm is validated using in situ measurements from various coastal sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas. The algorithm estimated daily integrated PAR above the sea surface with an uncertainty of 19% in summer. The uncertainty increased to 24% when the algorithm was applied year-round. The PAR values at the seafloor were estimated with an uncertainty of 76%, with 36% of the samples under sea ice and/or cloud cover. The robust performance of the PAR algorithm in the pan-Arctic region throughout the year will help to effectively study the temporal and spatial variability of PAR in the Arctic coastal waters. The calculated PAR data are used to quantify the changing trend in PAR at the seafloor in the coastal AO with depth < 100 m using MODIS-Aqua data from 2003 to 2020. The general trends calculated using the pixels with average PAR > 0.415 mol m (Formula presented.) day (Formula presented.) at the seafloor during summer indicate that the annual average of PAR entering the water column in the coastal AO between 2003 and 2020 increased by 23%. Concurrently, due to increased turbidity, the attenuation in the water column increased by 22%. The surge in incident PAR in the water column due to retreating sea ice first led to increased PAR observed at the seafloor (∼12% between 2003 and 2014). However, in the last decade, the rapid increase in light attenuation of the water column has restricted the increase in average annual PAR reaching the bottom in the coastal AO. © 2022 by the authors.","Climate change; Oceanography; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surface waters; Turbidity; Uncertainty analysis; Arctic ocean; Arctic regions; Coastal waters; Marginal seas; Ocean colour remote sensing; Photosynthetically available radiations; Primary production; Seafloors; Uncertainty; Water columns; Sea ice","Arctic Ocean; climate change; ocean colour remote sensing; photosynthetically available radiation; primary production; turbidity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140982159"

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used as an effective tool for sea ice remote sensing (e.g., ice type classification, concentration and thickness retrieval) for decades because it can collect data by day and night and in almost all weather conditions. The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a new Canadian SAR mission providing several new services and data, with higher spatial coverage and temporal resolution than previous Radarsat missions. As a very deep convolutional neural network, Normalizer-Free ResNet (NFNet) was proposed by DeepMind in early 2021 and achieved a new state-of-the-art accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. In this paper, the RCM data are utilized for sea ice detection and classification using NFNet for the first time. HH, HV and the cross-polarization ratio are extracted from the dual-polarized RCM data with a medium resolution (50 m) for an NFNet-F0 model. Experimental results from Eastern Arctic show that destriping in the HV channel is necessary to improve the quality of sea ice classification. A two-level random forest (RF) classification model is also applied as a conventional technique for comparisons with NFNet. The sea ice concentration estimated based on the classification result from each region was validated with the corresponding polygon of the Canadian weekly regional ice chart. The overall classification accuracy confirms the superior capacity of the NFNet model over the RF model for sea ice monitoring and the sea ice sensing capacity of RCM. © 2022 by the authors.

Using principal component analysis (PCA), we investigate the variability of the sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (SSC) and its bloom timing in the JES based on satellite remote sensing products spanning 1998–2019. The JES SSC exhibits strong seasonal variability and blooms twice annually. The spring bloom is induced under combined factors of increased photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), weakened wind speeds and sea ice melting, and terminated by the enhanced stratification. The fall bloom is induced by destratification and active dynamic processes (such as upwelling and front), and terminated by decreased PAR. The interannual variability of spring and fall bloom occur along the northwestern coast of the JES and in the deep Japan Basin, respectively. The positive SSC anomalies along the northwestern coast of the JES in spring is associated with more sea ice in the previous winter, weaker wind speed, and stronger stratification induced by the El Niño events. No significant relationship has been found between the fall bloom and the El Niño events. The bloom timing is controlled by the critical depth hypothesis. The initiation/termination timing of spring blooms has shifted earlier by 0.37/0.45 days, and the counterpart of fall blooms has shifted 0.49/1.28 days earlier per year. The duration and magnitude are independent with each other for spring bloom at interannual time scale.

Since 1981 the active remote sensing of satellite-based SST measurements has been around and proliferating to date in Indonesia. However, there has not been much research on the validation of several remote sensing datasets in Indonesia’s seas that has limited coverage of buoy observations. Moreover, no studies correspond to which data are the most precise in describing SST fluctuations in tropical storms. In this study, six remote sensing/satellite (Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA), Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA), Global Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (GAMSA), Microwave Infrared Optimally Interpolated (MWIROI), Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR), and K10) data are validated and compared to analyze SST fluctuations in TC as a case study. The validation method uses the Haversine distance formula to reach the highest quality iQuam data with satellite data. The comparison analysis is performed by plotting the SST and wind slop in a TC area. Based on the validation, The OSTIA, RAMSSA, GAMSSA, and MWIROI datasets ranked in the top 4 of the smallest RMSEs with values < 0.5. Moreover, in the SST and wind slop in a TC area, TC affects SST cooling as detected in the MUR and K10 datasets where there is a decrease of > 2 ºC. In the MWIROI, the decline is more noticeable significant > 3 ºC. © 2022, Asociatia Geographia Technica.

Upon refreezing, this can form icy crusts at the surface or within the snowpack. By altering radar backscatter and microwave emissivity, ROS over sea ice can influence the accuracy of sea ice variables retrieved from satellite radar altimetry, scatterometers, and passive microwave radiometers. During the Arctic Ocean MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate) expedition, there was an unprecedented opportunity to observe a ROS event using in situ active and passive microwave instruments similar to those deployed on satellite platforms. During liquid water accumulation in the snowpack from rain and increased melt, there was a 4-fold decrease in radar energy returned at Ku- and Ka-bands. After the snowpack refroze and ice layers formed, this decrease was followed by a 6-fold increase in returned energy. Besides altering the radar backscatter, analysis of the returned waveforms shows the waveform shape changed in response to rain and refreezing. Microwave emissivity at 19 and 89 GHz increased with increasing liquid water content and decreased as the snowpack refroze, yet subsequent ice layers altered the polarization difference. Corresponding analysis of the CryoSat-2 waveform shape and backscatter as well as AMSR2 brightness temperatures further shows that the rain and refreeze were significant enough to impact satellite returns. Our analysis provides the first detailed in situ analysis of the impacts of ROS and subsequent refreezing on both active and passive microwave observations, providing important baseline knowledge for detecting ROS over sea ice and assessing their impacts on satellite-derived sea ice variables.

This paper provides a discussion of the possibility of using the Doppler spectrum of the reflected microwave signal to solve this problem. For the first time, a semi-empirical model of the Doppler spectrum of a radar microwave signal reflected by an ice cover was developed for a radar with a wide antenna beam mounted on a moving carrier at small incidence angles of electromagnetic waves (0°– 19°). To describe the Doppler spectrum of the reflected microwave signal, the following parameters were used: shift and width of the Doppler spectrum, as well as skewness and kurtosis coefficients. Research was conducted on the influence of the main parameters of the measurement scheme (movement velocity, width of antenna beam, sounding direction, incidence angle) and the sea ice concentration (SIC) on the parameters of the Doppler spectrum. It was shown that, in order to determine the kind of scattering surface, it is necessary to use a wide or knife-like (by the incidence angle) antenna. Calculations confirmed the assumption that, when measured from a moving carrier, the Doppler spectrum is a reliable indicator of the transition from one kind of scattering surface to another. The advantage of using the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis in the analysis is that it is not necessary to keep the radar velocity unchanged during the measurement process. © 2022 by the authors.

Currently, ice charts are manually generated by analysts at the Canadian Ice Service based on dual-polarized RADARSAT-2/RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery on a daily basis. Inspired by the demand for a computer-based mapping system, we have developed an automatic sea-ice classification method that integrates spatial contexture (unsupervised segmentation) with textural features (supervised pixel-level labeling). First, the full-scene image is oversegmented, and the segments are merged into homogeneous regions across the entire scene. Second, pixel-based classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) are compared for their ability to label the generated homogeneous regions. Finally, the segmentation and labeling are combined using a proposed energy function. The proposed method was tested on 18 dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes acquired over the Beaufort Sea. This dataset contains water, young ice, first-year ice, and multiyear ice covering melt, summer, and freeze-up seasons. The proposed method obtains an average classification accuracy of 86.33% based on the leave-one-out validation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves promising classification results in both the quantity and quality measurements compared with benchmark methods. The robustness against incidence angle variance indicates that the proposed method is well qualified for operational sea-ice mapping.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Benchmarking; Climate change; Decision trees; Image classification; Image segmentation; Mapping; Pixels; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Support vector machines; Images segmentations; Labelings; Radar polarimetry; Radarsat-2; Random forest; Random forests; Sea ice mapping; Segmentation; Support vectors machine; Synthetic aperture radar; image classification; mapping method; pixel; RADARSAT; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatial analysis; synthetic aperture radar; texture; Synthetic aperture radar","Classification; RADARSAT-2; random forest (RF); sea ice; segmentation; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139446024"

Remote sensing-based studies focused on aerosol distribution and links to chlorophyll-a concentration and sea ice predominantly use passive sensor retrievals of aerosol optical properties. However, these data are subject to cloud presence, signal uncertainties, and lack of retrievals in high latitude wintertime. To address these concerns, we have developed a method of quantifying tropospheric marine aerosol with the NASA Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), which we term marine aerosol optical depth (MAOD). MAOD may be retrieved in nighttime conditions of high-latitude winter and is devoid of cloud contamination, thereby advancing upon prior aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements linked with biogenic aerosol. To examine trends in tropospheric marine aerosol, we undertook a multi-year remote sensing analysis in the Bellingshausen Sea from 2006 to 2018. A seasonal increase in MAOD was observed alongside a seasonal increase in chl-a and sea ice melt, suggesting a biogenic component to aerosol presence. To the best of our knowledge, this study is also the first to further distinguish a late winter to early spring temporal MAOD signal, likely tied to an aerosol source from either venting of biogenic aerosol from breaks in sea ice or to sea spray/salt aerosol resulting from pulses in wind speed. Our work extends upon previous findings of AOD in polar environments and now more fully characterizes interactions during polar winter. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

The substantial increase in satellite imagery provides a large amount of data support for deep learning methods in the sea ice classification field. However, there is a lack of public remote sensing datasets to facilitate sea ice classification with spatial and temporal information and to benchmark the deep learning methods. In this paper, we provide a labeled large sea ice dataset derived from time-series sentinel-1 SAR images, dubbed SI-STSAR-7, and a validated dataset construction method for sea ice classification research. The SI-STSAR-7 dataset includes seven different sea ice types corresponding to different sea ice development stages in Hudson Bay during winter, and its samples are time sequences of SAR image patches in order to embody the differences of backscattering intensity and textures between different sea ice types, as well as the change of sea ice with time. We construct the dataset by first performing noise reduction and mitigation of incidence angle dependence on SAR images, and then producing data samples and labeling them based on our proposed sample-producing principles and the weekly regional ice charts provided by Canadian Ice Service. Three baseline classification methods are developed on SI-STSAR-7 to establish benchmarks, which are evaluated with accuracy and kappa coefficient. The sample-producing principles are verified through experiments. Based on the experimental results, sea ice classification can be implemented well on SI-STSAR-7. © 2021 by the authors.

It is a conically scanning microwave radiometer with polarized channels centered at 1.414, 6.925, 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz and channel NEΔT between 0.2 and 0.7 K. A large rotating deployable mesh reflector will provide real-aperture resolutions ranging from (Formula presented.) 60 (1.4 GHz) to (Formula presented.) 5 km (36.5 GHz). To evaluate CIMR retrieval performance, a simplified end-to-end simulation of the mission has been carried out. The simulation includes important processes and input parameters, such as test geophysical datasets, forward models, an instrument simulator, and retrieval algorithms to derive the key mission geophysical products. The forward modeling is tested by producing Brightness Temperatures (TBs) from 4 global scenes. A comparison with current observations of the open ocean and sea ice at similar frequencies confirmed the realism of the simulations. The produced top-of-atmosphere TBs are converted to Antenna brightness Temperatures (TAs), taking into account the instrument design, and are then inverted to retrieve Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Evaluating the retrieval performance showed that the simulated CIMR instrument can provide SST, SSS, and SIC measurements with precisions and spatial resolutions conforming with the mission requirements. The evaluation also highlighted the challenges of observing the Arctic environment and put in perspective CIMR capabilities compared with current instruments. © 2021.

It is not clear what role the Antarctic cryosphere plays in this regard, but new remote-sensing-based techniques and datasets have recently opened the possibility to investigate its role. Here, we leverage these to show that the surface albedo reductions from sustained post-2000 losses in Arctic snow and ice cover equate to increasingly positive snow and ice albedo feedback relative to a 1982–1991 baseline period, with a decadal trend of +0.08 ± 0.04 W m–2 decade–1 between 1992 and 2015. During the same period, the expansion of the Antarctic sea-ice pack generated a negative feedback, with a decadal trend of −0.06 ± 0.02 W m–2 decade–1. However, substantial Antarctic sea-ice losses during 2016–2018 completely reversed the trend, increasing the three-year mean combined Arctic and Antarctic snow and ice albedo feedback to +0.26 ± 0.15 W m–2. This reversal highlights the importance of Antarctic sea-ice loss to the global snow and ice albedo feedback. The 1992–2018 mean feedback is equivalent to approximately 10% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the same period; the share may rise markedly should 2016–2018 snow and ice conditions become common, although increasing long-wave emissions will probably mediate the impact on the total radiative-energy budget. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Arctic and Antarctic; albedo; cryosphere; feedback mechanism; ice cover; remote sensing; sea ice; snow cover; solar radiation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118171955"

Boundary-layer clouds may play an important role in this change. At temperatures below 0°C, mixed-phase clouds exist and their phase and longevity is influenced by the abundance of ice crystals, which in turn is a function of aerosols serving as ice nucleating particles (INPs). Previous in situ studies suggested a local source of INPs due to biological activity over open ocean. Here we investigate ice crystal concentrations in clouds below 2 km at a large scale, by exploiting a newly developed data set—DARDAR-Nice—retrieved from active satellite remote sensing. The data set spans from 2006 to 2016. Contrary to previous expectation, we find that at a given latitude and temperature, there are more ice crystals over sea ice than over open ocean. This enhancement is particularly found in clouds south of 70°N, and also at temperatures between 0°C and −10°C. © 2022.

Data on the evolvement of the Arctic sea ice and decadal trends of phenology factors during melt season are necessary for climate prediction under global warming. Previous studies on Arctic sea ice phenology did not involve melt ponds that dramatically lower the ice surface albedo and tremendously affect the process of sea ice surface melt. Temporal means and trends of the Arctic sea ice phenology from 1982 to 2017 were examined based on satellite-derived sea ice concentration and albedo measurements. Moreover, the timing of ice ponding and two periods corresponding to it were newly proposed as key stages in the melt season. Therefore, four timings, i.e., date of snow and ice surface melt onset (MO), date of pond onset (PO), date of sea ice opening (DOO), and date of sea ice retreat (DOR); and three durations, i.e., melt pond formation period (MPFP, i.e., MO—PO), melt pond extension period (MPEP, i.e., PO—DOR), and seasonal loss of ice period (SLIP, i.e., DOO—DOR), were used. PO ranged from late April in the peripheral seas to late June in the central Arctic Ocean in Bootstrap results, whereas the pan-Arctic was observed nearly 4 days later in NASA Team results. Significant negative trends were presented in the MPEP in the Hudson Bay, the Baffin Bay, the Greenland Sea, the Kara and Barents seas in both results, indicating that the Arctic sea ice undergoes a quick transition from ice to open water, thereby extending the melt season year to year. The high correlation coefficient between MO and PO, MPFP illustrated that MO predominates the process of pond formation. © 2022, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Arctic sea ice; melt ponds; melt timings and durations; remote sensing; sea ice phenology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137568724"

Owing to the spatiotemporal limitations of existing datasets, budgetary constraints, logistical challenges, and adverse temperature and climatic conditions of Antarctica, researchers face great challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have helped to solve this issue because they can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal data and conduct operations in inaccessible locations at a low cost and with ease compared with in situ observation and conventional spaceborne and airborne remote sensing. The development and testing of UAVs for use in polar environments mainly focus on enhancing UAV performance in extreme Antarctic conditions by improving their endurance, wind resistance, and aerial photography stability. The equipped multisensors, flexible data collection and operation window, and high-spatiotemporal resolution all contribute to making UAVs the most powerful platform for cryospheric research. In recent years, a series of UAV-related studies on the cryosphere have been published. However, a thorough review that explicitly details the scientific progress and possibilities of using UAVs in Antarctic polar research is lacking. In this era of rapid global and regional climate change, it is becoming increasingly necessary to employ UAVs to investigate the finer changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and ice shelves. This work investigates the use of UAVs in the monitoring of the glacial microtopography (including rifts and crevasses, surface subsidence, and melting ponds), ice surface landforms, atmosphere, flora and fauna, sea ice, subglacial environment, and other aspects of Antarctic glaciology investigation, and it speculates on their future use in multidisciplinary research.

The detection of sea surface temperature (SST) distribution and variation is one of the main tasks of Chinese ocean color and temperature scanner (COCTS), which is the main load of Ocean-1 satellite. Considering the detection of sea ice, typhoon and other meteorological elements over the ocean, the dynamic range of the actual water temperature detection channel is required to cover the temperature range of 200K to 320K. The variation of temperature in some ocean areas will lead to severe weather disasters, so SST detection channels need to meet the requirements of detection sensitivity and quantification accuracy. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to design the information acquisition circuit of infrared channel for COCTS according to the technical requirements, including the pre-amplifier circuit to amplify the weak signal of the detector, the AC amplifier which eliminates the basic level to improve the dynamic range, and the channel amplifier circuit which can realize the DC recovery and dynamic range adjustment of the signal. Method: Based on the study of the working mechanism of the photoconductive infrared detector used, and combined with the system composition and the characteristics of COCTS, in order to ensure that the contradictory requirements of high dynamic range and high sensitivity are met at the same time, the form and parameters of each stage amplifier circuit were determined on the basis of theoretical analysis, calculation and simulation. In order to achieve the stable reference level detection and single pixel signal detection of the whole field of view, the corresponding high-pass and low-pass filter are designed. The system performance of COCTS will be measured in the vacuum environment simulation laboratory, to verify the reasonability of information acquisition circuit design. Result: The results of the infrared radiometric calibration in the laboratory show that the dynamic range of the two infrared channels covers 177K to 327K and 173K to 324K respectively, and both meet the technical requirements of 200K to 320K. The noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of the two infrared channels in the whole dynamic range is between 20mK and 110mK. At the appraisal position of 300K, NETD has reached 21mK to 34mK, which is much better than the technical requirements of 0.2mK. Space test environment is more complex than the laboratory, and there are also some differences in measuring accuracy. The results of in orbit test show that the dynamic range of the two infrared channels is 186K to 328K and 185K to 326K respectively, and the NETD in the whole dynamic range is between 50mK and 110mK according to the window size of the selected target area. The performance is better than the technical requirements. Conclusion: The infrared channel can track the change of the blackbody signal on the satellite with the time and the surrounding environment changing, so the calibration coefficient of the infrared channel can be corrected in real-time. The expected goal of real-time radiometric calibration in orbit can be achieved. This lays a foundation for the quantitative inversion of SST, and can obtain and make high-quality global SST products. © 2022 Science Press.

At present, remote sensing images of sea ice are mainly acquired with the help of payload platforms, such as aircraft or satellites. The above methods have a large measurement scale and a short period. Sea ice research also requires suitable equipment for fine-scale, visualized long-term tracking observations of target sea ice regions. This article investigates the feasibility of measuring interannual variability in sea ice morphology in the Arctic sea ice environment using a low-power gimbal camera automated by satellite communications. Year-round observational data from the arctic field were used. The sea ice images were defogged and edge-enhanced by a newly developed algorithm with the help of human visual enhancement principles. During the 11th Chinese National Arctic Science Expedition, the system was placed on perennial ice in the northern Beaufort Basin to monitor sea ice appearance changes and the external state of the ice mass balance buoy. The system fuses visually enhanced sea ice images with ice balance buoy data from the same ice floe in a multi-scale environmental sequence to obtain sea ice observations with image sequences. The data complement the need for long-duration, fixed-ice, and short-visual-range observations in sea-ice studies. The equipment design methods and image processing algorithms involved in the experimental process have accumulated engineering experience for this application area.

However, few in situ observations of sea ice kinematics have been reported owing to difficulties of deployment of buoys in the marginal ice zone (MIZ). To investigate the characteristics of sea ice kinematics from MIZ to packed ice zone (PIZ), eight drifting buoys designed by Taiyuan University of Technology were deployed in the open water at the ice edge of the Canadian Basin. Sea ice near the buoy constantly increased as the buoy drifted, and the kinematics of the buoy changed as the buoy was frozen into the ice. This process can be determined using sea ice concentration, sea skin temperature, and drift speed of buoy together. Sea ice concentration data showed that buoys entered the PIZ in mid-October as the ice grew and consolidated around the buoys, with high amplitude, high frequency buoy motions almost ceasing. Our results confirmed that good correlation coefficient in monthly scale between buoy drift and the wind only happened in the ice zone. The correlation coefficient between buoys and wind was below 0.3 while the buoys were in open water. As buoys entered the ice zone, the buoy speed was normally distributed at wind speeds above 6 m/s. The buoy drifted mainly to the right of the wind within 45° at wind speeds above 8 m/s. During further consolidation of the ice in MIZ, the direct forcing on the ice through winds will be lessened. The correlation coefficient value increased to 0.9 in November, and gradually decreased to 0.7 in April. © 2022, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","buoy observations; kinematics; marginal ice zone; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134396348"

Current methods for remote sensing of ocean salinity are based on the monotropic function between Raman spectra and ocean salinity, while the effect of the ocean temperature, which influences the measurement of salinity, is neglected. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for fine inversion of salinity combining Brillouin and Raman spectra of water. The Raman spectra of solutions containing a single solute and mixed solutions were detected, and the effect of solutions containing different solutes on the spectra was analyzed. The experimental results revealed the variation in the low- and high-frequency spectral intensities of the Raman spectra with salinity and temperature. The Raman spectra of seawater were modeled as a function of temperature and salinity using the low- and high-frequency area ratios. Brillouin scattering spectra are also related to ocean temperature and salinity, changes in temperature and salinity will affect the frequency shift and line-width of Brillouin scattering spectra. Based on the Brillouin scattering theory, the relationship between frequency shift and line-width with ocean temperature and salinity was analyzed. With high spectra resolution lidar as the detection technique, the Brillouin frequency shift, line-width and Raman spectra of ocean could be detected simultaneously by using multi-beam interferometry, photon correlation spectroscopy, and Raman spectra detection techniques.

Here we use satellite-derived Net Primary Production (NPP) rates calculated using the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of NPP over the 21-year satellite record (1998–2018) on the AB. In calculating VGPM NPP we used the OCCI Chlorophyll-a product, SST from Operational-Sea-Surface-Temperature-and-Sea-Ice-Analysis (OSTIA) and PAR from GlobColour level-3 mapped products as these represent the longest datasets that fit our extended study period. We examine spatial trends between the eastern and central AB, as well as three areas of the bank (around Port Alfred, the Tsitsikamma coast, and the ‘cold ridge’) that have been previously identified as contributing significantly to the overall productivity of the AB. The AB shows only a moderate degree of seasonality in NPP calculated from the VGPM, with NPP being highest in austral summer (1.7–1.8 g C m−2 d−1) and lowest in winter (0.9–1.0 g C m−2 d−1), and remains relatively high (>1 g C m−2 d−1) throughout the year, contrasting sharply with other shelf systems. Considered annually, NPP on the bank was 516 g C m−2 yr−1 (38 Mt C yr−1 when scaled to the total shelf area) which is higher than many other shelf systems though lower than the neighbouring Benguela system and is indicative of a moderately productive shelf system fuelled by perennial NPP. Comparing different sections of the AB from east to central bank, and including the three upwelling areas, highlighted that spatial differences in NPP were relatively limited; that these three upwelling areas made similar contributions to their relative proportion of the total shelf area, and that average rates of NPP are spatially similar across the bank, though notable high rates occur in some coastal upwelling areas. Interannual variability in NPP was relatively modest, varying between years by only ∼15% over the two decades assessed. Over the 21-year data set, there was a slight (∼0.26% yr−1) statistically-significant decline in calculated NPP over time for the AB as a whole, which, when examined on a pixel-by-pixel basis, indicated that most of the decline was on the central bank between 100 m and 200 m isobaths. In summer, an increase in NPP occurred on the EAB (26.5–28°E). In conclusion, the AB is a significant site of perennial moderate levels of NPP, varying little interannually and with only a slight decline in NPP over time. These factors lead to a stable environment in terms of ecosystem productivity so that the AB makes a significant contribution to the productivity of South African regional fisheries. © 2022 The Author(s)","Agulhas Bank; Angola; Benguela; Eastern Cape; Indian Ocean; Port Alfred; South Africa; Tsitsikamma; Fisheries; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Productivity; Sea ice; Surface waters; Central bank; Continental shelfs; Marine productivity; Net primary production; Production models; Remote-sensing; Spatial and temporal variability; Upwelling; Upwelling areas; Vertically generalized production model; continental shelf; ecological modeling; fishery; marine ecosystem; net primary production; remote sensing; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; upwelling; Remote sensing","Continental shelf; Net primary production; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Upwelling; Vertically generalized production model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129019928"

This paper describes an approach for automatic retrieval of daily thin sea ice thickness maps around Svalbard. The algorithm uses thermal satellite imagery from MODIS to estimate the surface temperature of the ice and further uses a thermal model of the ice surface to estimate the thickness of the sea ice. The approach is usable for thin sea ice, up to ca. 50 cm thick, during cold weather (freezing) conditions and without cloud cover present. The algorithm is compared with helicopter-borne electromagnetic ice thickness measurements. The comparison yields increasing root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for thicker ice. The lowest RMSD found is 8.7 cm for ice thickness in the range 10 cm < hi ≤ 20 cm. The highest RMSD found is 25.2 cm for ice thickness in the range 30 cm < hi ≤ 40 cm. The bias shows no such trend, and the overall bias is found to be −5.5 cm. The results show that this is a promising approach, allowing monitoring of thin sea ice thickness at relatively higher spatial resolution. © 2022 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; electromagnetic method; estimation method; ice thickness; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice","Arctic; ice thickness; MODIS; Remote sensing; sea ice; Svalbard","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131526040"

Here, a 40-yr integrated melt onset (MO) dataset over sea ice, ice sheets, and terrestrial snow is compiled from spaceborne microwave radiometers and ERA5, allowing an overall assessment of the cryosphere. Results suggest that MO in both hemispheres shows latitudinal and vertical zonalities. The global cryosphere presented a trend toward earlier MO (22 days decade21) with hotpots distributed at the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes where the warming rate is much higher than that at lower latitudes. Overall, variations in MO showed a similar pattern to that in near-surface temperature. The advance of MO has been slowing down since the 1990s and no significant trend was observed during the so-called warming hiatus period (1998–2012). Regionally, climatic linkage analyses suggest the local MO variations were associated with different climate indices. MO in the pan-Arctic region is related with the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation, while that in the pan-Antarctic region is associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the southern annular mode. Occasionally, abnormal MO occurs as a result of extreme weather conditions. In February 2018, abnormal early melt events that occurred in the Arctic Ocean are found to be linked with the warm southerly flow due to sudden stratospheric warming. These findings suggest the satellite-based MO allows examining the dynamics and extremes in the climate system, both regionally and globally.

While rule-based remote-sensing classification methods, such as the threshold method, have been widely used for surveying and mapping polar sea ice leads, they have difficulty in overcoming the problems of noise and poor generalization. In this article, we presented an automated, deep learning sea ice open lead detection network in low wind speed conditions, entropy-weighted network (EW-Net). In EW-Net, a dense block was introduced into a U-Net baseline network to strengthen feature propagation, and an entropy sampling structure was designed to improve the pertinence of the network to leads and alleviate the influence of noise. Furthermore, an entropy-weighted feature fusion block was designed to better restore features. EW-Net was trained on the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset in order to obtain lead maps of different polar regions from Sentinel-1 images. The results showed that the proposed EW-Net model was more effective and more generalizable for polar sea ice lead detection than the threshold method and the deep learning methods U-Net and DeepLab V3 Plus, with an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 0.97. In addition, EW-Net showed advantages in terms of outstanding generalization from cross-sensor image monitoring of leads. The method proposed in this article could be beneficial for providing accurate maps of polar sea ice leads in open water and contribute to further research on polar science.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Antarctica; Arctic Ocean; Chemical detection; Climate change; Deep learning; Entropy; Oceanography; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Wind; Antarctic Ocean; Arctic ocean; Deep learning; Generalisation; Lead detection; Polar sea ice; Sea ice lead; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar; Threshold methods; polar region; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Antarctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean; deep learning; entropy; sea ice lead; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128653029"

Lake ice cover and Lake Ice Thickness (LIT) are two key variables in lake ice studies. However, most lake ice studies focus on lake ice cover as opposed to LIT, due mostly to the lack of in situ LIT observations and effective satellite platforms. Consequently, LIT states in ungauged basins remain largely unknown, and critical knowledge gaps need to be filled with breakthroughs in remote sensing observations and retrieval methods. This study reviews the progress in the remote sensing of LIT for the past two decades, focusing on methods based on active and passive microwave information as well as methods based on thermal infrared information. Currently, the best retrieval accuracy of LIT is 0.1—0.2 m for satellite platforms, unable to meet the accuracy requirement (1—2 cm) from the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Passive microwave sensors such as AMSR-E and AMSR2 with high temporal-resolution and coarse spatial resolution (~30 km) are efficient for monitoring LIT in large lakes. SAR images can be used to discriminate bedfast lake ice and floating ice, applicable to shallow lakes and lakes with bathymetry information. Waveforms of satellite altimeters containing signals backscattered from the lake ice surface and the lake ice bottom can be used to estimate the traveling time of radar pulse within the ice, which is suitable for ungauged basins because the method is physically based and does not need calibration. Backscattering coefficients from satellite altimeters can also reflect LIT evolution but needs further investigation to improve its robustness. Thermal infrared information such as MODIS land surface temperatures can be used to drive lake ice models to estimate the LIT, but its accuracy is subject to the complicated process of lake surface snow. We summarize the challenges for current LIT studies and indicate future directions for LIT studies. There are four critical issues: (1) The physical process of lake ice and lake surface snow needs to be better resolved to improve the performance of remote sensing and modeling of LIT; (2) In situ measurements of LIT need to be aggregated and standardized in a larger scale to provide sufficient calibration and validation data; (3) Multisource remote sensing information of LIT can be better combined with lake ice modeling through data fusion and data assimilation to derive global LIT datasets with a longer period, higher spatiotemporal resolution and better accuracy; (4) With the development of new generations of satellite platforms, such as the latest altimetry missions (e.g., ICESat-2, Jason-CS, and SWOT) and SAR platforms, advanced methods can be developed to better achieve the LIT monitoring target set by GCOS. © 2022 Science Press.

In this paper, a method integrating image processing and machine learning technologies is proposed to automatically obtain the multi-parameters of sea ice, which include sea ice thickness, density, size distribution, and types. Our experiment results show that the average measurement error of thickness was less than 4 cm, the intensity was 2.8%, the size distribution was 5.8%, and the accuracy rate of type classification was 95%.

These remote data highlight complex structures especially in strongly eddying regions. A recent study showed that over 38% of the global ocean area, the chaotic variability may hinder the attribution to the atmospheric forcing of regional sea level trends from 1993 to 2015. This study aims to complement this work by focusing on the atmospherically forced and chaotic interannual variability of regional sea level and its components. At interannual time scales, variability can hamper the detection of regional sea level trends. A global 1/4° ocean/sea-ice 50-member ensemble simulation is analyzed to disentangle the imprints of the atmospheric forcing and of the chaotic ocean variability on the interannual variability of regional sea level and of its steric and manometric components over 1993–2015. The atmospherically forced and chaotic interannual variabilities of sea level mainly have a steric origin, except in coastal areas. The chaotic part of the interannual variability of sea level and its components is stronger in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans than in the Indian Ocean. The chaotic part of the interannual variance of sea level and of its steric component exceeds 20% over 48% of the global ocean area; this fractional area reduces to 26% for the manometric component. These results confirm the substantial imprint of the chaotic interannual variability on sea level components, questioning in several regions the attribution of their observed evolution to atmospheric causes. © 2021.

In this study we use data from an ecosystem cruise to Kong Håkon VII Hav, in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, in March 2019 and more than two decades of satellite-derived ocean color to study phytoplankton bloom phenology. During the cruise we observed phytoplankton blooms in different bloom phases. By correlating bloom phenology indices (i.e., bloom initiation and end) based on satellite remote sensing to the timing of changes in environmental conditions (i.e., sea ice, light, and mixed layer depth) we studied the environmental factors that seemingly drive phytoplankton blooms in the area. Our results show that blooms mainly take place in January and February, consistent with previous studies that include the area. Sea ice retreat controls the bloom initiation in particular along the coast and the western part of the study area, whereas bloom end is not primarily connected to sea ice advance. Light availability in general is not appearing to control the bloom termination, neither is nutrient availability based on the autumn cruise where we observed non-depleted macronutrient reservoirs in the surface. Instead, we surmise that zooplankton grazing plays a potentially large role to end the bloom, and thus controls its duration. The spatial correlation of the highest bloom magnitude with marked topographic features indicate that the interaction of ocean currents with sea floor topography enhances primary productivity in this area, probably by natural fertilization. Based on the bloom timing and magnitude patterns, we identified five different bloom regimes in the area.

But due to the complexity of radar echoes over sea ice, freeboard retrieval from altimetry still presents some errors and biases that further limit the potential of these observations for climate studies or for assimilation into models. Various methods have been explored, producing a large range of freeboard estimations. In this study, we analyze the main steps of the radar freeboard computation developed as part of the Cryo-SeaNice Project. The objective is to quantify the impacts of each processing method and to identify optimal strategies to improve freeboard estimations from SAR altimetry measurements. We consider two SAR processing options: the Hamming Window (HW) and with the Zero-Padding (ZP), and 2 retrackers: the Threshold First Maximum Retracker Algorithm (TFMRA) based on heuristic measurements and SAMOSA+ a retracker declined from model based analysis of the surface back-scatter. Four freeboard solutions are generated from combinations of the 2 processing options (HW and ZP or ZP only) and the 2 types of retrackers. In addition, an alternative to the Hamming Window method to filter out side-lobes errors is presented. The impacts of the different approaches to estimate freeboard are quantified from comparisons with Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) and the Beaufort Gyre Exploration project (BGEP) in situ data. Our results show that SAMOSA+ provides more precise freeboard estimations. This new time-series is available on CTOH website. We also identified some impacts of the Hamming Window for both retrackers. Finally, we present the potential of using the simpler threshold retracker but with a correction to account for the surface roughness that is calibrated against SAMOSA+. © 2020 COSPAR","Climate models; Processing; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Arctic; Doppler; Hamming; SAMOSA; TFMRA; Zero padding; Synthetic aperture radar","Arctic; Delay-Doppler Altimetry; Hamming; Remote sensing; SAMOSA+; Sea ice freeboard; TFMRA; Zero-padding","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080059329"

We examine the controls on the size of this floating ice body by comparing the propagation of six large fractures on the ice tongue's northern side using 21 years of Landsat imagery with hydrostatic ice thickness maps and strain rate calculations. We also apply a subglacial hydrology model to estimate the location and discharge from subglacial channels over the grounding line and compare these with basal channels identified along the ice tongue using remote sensing and airborne radar data. Our results suggest that large fractures are inhibited from full-width propagation by thicker ice between basal channels. We hypothesize that only once the ice tongue thins towards the terminus, can fractures propagate and cause large calving events. This suggests an important relationship between the melting of floating ice from subglacial and ocean sources and the expansion of fractures that lead to ice tongue calving.

Model fields of air temperature, sea surface temperature and surface wind as well as the surface current fields retrieved from satellite data were used to analyze the main factors influencing the changes in the sea ice area and types. To derive the sea ice characteristics satellite images and measurements of high (Sentinel-1), moderate (MODIS) and low (AMSR2, SMOS) spatial resolution were used. The Arctic portal ensured the instrumental possibility for data visualization to analyze satellite images and geophysical parameter fields of different spatial and temporal resolutions. The verification of the sea ice type structure analysis was done on the bases of the detailed sea ice maps of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute, whereas the verification of the sea ice thickness was done using the SMOS estimates. We conclude that intensive North Atlantic cyclones, accompanied by the development of storm winds over the Pechora Sea and by positive air temperature anomalies, are the main reasons for the atypically young sea ice type structure by the end of the winter and for the destruction of the sea ice cover a month earlier than traditionally in mild winters. Presumably, an increase in the number of the North Atlantic cyclones and in their intensity as a result of the Arctic climate changes will lead to sharper changes in the characteristics of the sea ice cover of the Pechora Sea (stronger decrease in the sea ice area and thickness) than for the other regions of the Arctic. © 2021 Russian Academy of Sciences,Department of the Earth Sciences.

Sea ice channels, only in which vessels can pass through, change their topology as a result of the appearance and disappearance of sea ice. This paper provides a route planning method for ships that travel through the sea ice channels based on high resolution satellite images. The main processes of the method include: (1) Classification of sea ice using high resolution satellite images. (2) Extraction of sea ice channels topology based on the classification results. (3) Automated route planning based on the topology of sea ice channels. The key algorithms in the processes are presented in this paper. Practically, we used the aforementioned scheme to find the optimal path for voyages on several simulated missions. The simulations indicate that the proposed method is very practical and time-efficient for route planning with high resolution satellite images, while traditional pixel-based-algorithm is unable to cope with large-size images and the dynamic change of the sea ice. Moreover, the proposed method can take the advantages of the widely available high resolution satellite data and the near real-time sea ice observation. Therefore, the proposed method is potential to be applied on the navigation system for vessels travelling in the north and south polar regions. © 2020 IEEE.","Geology; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Ships; Topology; Classification results; Dynamic changes; High resolution satellite data; High resolution satellite images; Near-real time; Ship navigation; South polar region; Time-efficient; Image processing","high resolution image; route planning; sea ice; ship navigation; topology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101958732"

The frequency chosen from those available was in the C-band. For the radiometer layer ice concentrations, land contaminated pixels were removed. For the SAR layers, a novel approach to their use in ice detection was developed using the coefficient of variation (COV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the normalized radar cross section, sigma{0} , to the mean sigma{0}. The COV reduced the complicated signatures of breaking waves and thin ice to bright ice pixels on a dark water background. The co-pol and cross-pol COV layers and the radiometer layer were merged according to physics-based rules, except in regions adjacent to land or the ice edge where only the SAR layers were valid.

Data from both NSIDC and OSI-SAF products exhibited statistically significant (p < 0.001) correlation with drifter data. The OSI-SAF product tended to overestimate ice speed, while underestimation was demonstrated for the NSIDC product, especially for the melt season and the marginal ice zone. Monthly Lagrangian trajectories of ice floes were reconstructed using the products. Larger spatial variability in the deviation between NSIDC and drifter trajectories was observed than that of OSI-SAF, and seasonal variability in the deviation for NSIDC was observed. Furthermore, trajectories reconstructed using the NSIDC product were sensitive to variations in sea-ice concentration. The feasibility of using remote-sensing products to characterize sea-ice deformation was assessed by evaluating the distance between two arbitrary positions as estimated by the products. Compared with the OSI-SAF product, relative errors are lower (<11.6%), and spatial-temporal resolutions are higher in the NSIDC product, which makes it more suitable for estimating sea-ice deformation.

Different snow and ice parameters are applied to illustrate the effects of auxiliary data on the SIT retrievals. Snow depth data are from three sources including climatology observation, microwave remote sensing and reanalysis data, while six snow/ice density combination schemes were adopted. The results show the averaged monthly sea ice freeboard from ICESat-2 ATL20 product well captures the seasonal variation of sea ice freeboard and sea ice growth in Arctic winter, which can be further used to estimate SIT. The difference of monthly SIT from different snow and ice density schemes is smaller than that caused by snow depth. Overall, the largest difference caused by snow depth in mean SIT is ~0.50 m, while that caused by the snow and ice density is ~0.15 m. The best parameter scheme of SIT inversion using ICESat-2 needs to be further investigated using field measurements in the future. ©2021 IEEE","Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Thickness measurement; Arctic; Arctic sea ice; Ice density; ICESat-2; Sea and ice density; Sea ice freeboard; Sea-ice thickness; Snow and ice; Snow density; Snow depths; Sea ice","Arctic; ICESat-2; sea and ice density; Sea ice freeboard; sea ice thickness; snow depth","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129880770"

Despite their roles in both weather and climate, INPs are not well characterized, especially in remote regions such as the Arctic. We present results from a ship-based campaign to the European Arctic during May to July 2017. We deployed a filter sampler and a continuous-flow diffusion chamber for offline and online INP analyses, respectively. We also investigated the ice nucleation properties of samples from different environmental compartments, i.e., the sea surface microlayer (SML), the bulk seawater (BSW), and fog water. Concentrations of INPs (NINP) in the air vary between 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes at any particular temperature and are, except for the temperatures above -10gC and below -32gC, lower than in midlatitudes. In these temperature ranges, INP concentrations are the same or even higher than in the midlatitudes. By heating of the filter samples to 95gC for 1ĝ€¯h, we found a significant reduction in ice nucleation activity, i.e., indications that the INPs active at warmer temperatures are biogenic. At colder temperatures the INP population was likely dominated by mineral dust. The SML was found to be enriched in INPs compared to the BSW in almost all samples. The enrichment factor (EF) varied mostly between 1 and 10, but EFs as high as 94.97 were also observed. Filtration of the seawater samples with 0.2ĝ€¯μm syringe filters led to a significant reduction in ice activity, indicating the INPs are larger and/or are associated with particles larger than 0.2ĝ€¯μm. A closure study showed that aerosolization of SML and/or seawater alone cannot explain the observed airborne NINP unless significant enrichment of INP by a factor of 105 takes place during the transfer from the ocean surface to the atmosphere. In the fog water samples with -3.47gC, we observed the highest freezing onset of any sample. A closure study connecting NINP in fog water and the ambient NINP derived from the filter samples shows good agreement of the concentrations in both compartments, which indicates that INPs in the air are likely all activated into fog droplets during fog events. In a case study, we considered a situation during which the ship was located in the marginal sea ice zone and NINP levels in air and the SML were highest in the temperature range above -10gC. Chlorophyll a measurements by satellite remote sensing point towards the waters in the investigated region being biologically active. Similar slopes in the temperature spectra suggested a connection between the INP populations in the SML and the air. Air mass history had no influence on the observed airborne INP population. Therefore, we conclude that during the case study collected airborne INPs originated from a local biogenic probably marine source. © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic; Europe; cloud condensation nucleus; cloud microphysics; concentration (composition); fog; optical property; seasonal variation; temperature effect","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113257100"

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500-1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500-1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500-1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts. We also describe the remaining questions and challenges to be addressed in advancing to future spaceborne operation of this technology along with recommendations for future research activities. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Aquarius; Satellites; Geophysics; Observatories; Radio interference; Radiometry; Sea ice; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Surface waters; Temperature measurement; Brightness temperature measurement; Emerging technologies; Geophysical properties; Opportunistic sensing; Passive microwave measurements; Radio frequency interference; Spaceborne observations; Surface soil moisture; brightness temperature; microwave imagery; radiometer; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; sea surface salinity; soil moisture; Microwaves","Earth observations; microwave radiometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104256989"

Along with these changes, the Arctic Ocean's ecosystem is affected on various scales. The pelagic microbial food web of the Arctic is of particular interest, because it determines mass transfer to higher trophic levels. In this regard, variations in the size structure of the microbial community reflect changes in size-dependent bottom-up and top-down processes. Here we present analyses of microscopic data that resolve details on composition and cell size of unicellular plankton, based on samples collected between 2016 and 2018 in the Fram Strait. Using the Kernel Density Estimation method, we derived continuous size spectra (from 1 μm to ≈ 200 μm Equivalent Spherical Diameter, ESD) of cell abundance and biovolume. Specific size intervals (3–4, 8–10, 25–40, and 70–100 μm ESD) indicate size-selective predation as well as omnivory. In-between size ranges include loopholes with elevated cell abundance. By considering remote sensing data we could discriminate between polar Arctic- and Atlantic water within the Fram Strait and could relate our size spectra to the seasonal change in chlorophyll-a concentration. Our size spectra disclose the decline in total biovolume from summer to autumn. In October the phytoplankton biovolume size-spectra reveal a clear relative shift toward larger cell sizes (> 30 μm). Our analysis highlights details in size spectra that may help refining allometric relationships and predator-prey dependencies for size-based plankton ecosystem model applications. © Copyright © 2021 Lampe, Nöthig and Schartau.","","Arctic Ocean; kernel density estimates; microbial food web; plankton community structure; plankton size; protist plankton; size selective grazing; size spectra","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100538310"

Satellite remote sensing is an effective way to monitor sea-ice drift globally and daily, especially using the wide swaths of passive microwave missions. Since the late 1990s, many algorithms and products have been developed for this task. Here, we investigate how processing sea-ice drift vectors from the intersection of individual swaths of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) mission compares to today's status quo (processing from daily averaged maps of brightness temperature). We document that the ""swath-to-swath""(S2S) approach results in many more (2 orders of magnitude) sea-ice drift vectors than the ""daily map""(DM) approach. These S2S vectors also validate better when compared to trajectories of on-ice drifters. For example, the RMSE of the 24g h winter Arctic sea-ice drift is 0.9g km for S2S vectors and 1.3g km for DM vectors from the 36.5g GHz imagery of AMSR2. Through a series of experiments with actual AMSR2 data and simulated Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) data, we study the impact that geolocation uncertainty and imaging resolution have on the accuracy of the sea-ice drift vectors. We conclude by recommending that a swath-to-swath approach is adopted for the future operational Level-2 sea-ice drift product of the CIMR mission. We outline some potential next steps towards further improving the algorithms and making the user community ready to fully take advantage of such a product. © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic; Varanidae; algorithm; AMSR-E; ice drift; ice thickness; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112177933"

The present article considers factors of modern sedimentation in marine shallows with the formation of islands (Yaya, Nanosny, Zatoplyaemyy, Leykina, etc.). Among these factors are a decrease in sea ice extent, an increase in the duration of the ice-free period, and the activation of destructive cryogenic processes triggered by the current climate warming. A decrease in ice coverage led to the dominance of hydrodynamic processes in sedimentation, unlike the primary role of sea ice in this process in the 17th–19th centuries. Sediment deficit in these centuries is substituted by its excess owing to the activation of cryogenic processes at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. As a result, the erosional shoreface profile is transforming into an accumulative one. Sedimentation is occurring parallel to a rising sea level related to a warming climate. A rise in the surface of islands and sandbanks is recorded on satellite images where there are modern positive vertical movements. The formation of islands and sandbanks is accompanied by their syngenetic freezing. © 2021 Academic Publishing House Geo.

To overcome such a limitation, a method of retrieving Arctic basin-scale ice thickness is developed. The physical background of this method is that the scattering optical thickness at microwave frequencies within the freeboard layer is linearly proportional to the physical thickness of the ice freeboard. In this study, we relate the optical thickness estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with ice freeboard estimated from the CryoSat-2 (CS2) by employing a piecewise linear fit. The results show a strong linear relationship between the AMSR2-estimated and CS2-measured ice freeboards with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and bias and RMSE of 0.0001 and 0.04 m, respectively; this evidence suggests that the method can provide Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard with a comparable accuracy level of CS2. The method is also applied to estimate ice freeboard for the periods of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) (1978-1987) and AMSR-E (2002-2011). It is shown that the area-averaged ice freeboard has decreased significantly with the linear trends of 1.5 cm/decade. In addition, there seems to be a change of ice freeboard distributions over the Arctic. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the ice thickness retrieval by using the hydrostatic balance equation, showing that operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval will be possible from satellite passive microwave measurements if a realistic snow depth on sea ice is employed. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Chromium compounds; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Optical properties; Piecewise linear techniques; Radiometers; Sea ice; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Correlation coefficient; Hydrostatic balance; Linear relationships; Linearly proportional; Passive microwave measurements; Satellite passive microwave; Scanning multichannel microwave radiometer; algorithm; AMSR-E; correlation; CryoSat; glacioisostasy; ice thickness; microwave radiation; satellite data; scattering; sea ice; Microwaves","Ice freeboard; Passive microwave remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea ice thickness; Surface emissivity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110708417"

In the training phase, the output parameters are generated from quad-pol observations obtained by Radarsat-2 (RS2), and the corresponding input data consist of features obtained from overlapping dual-pol Sentinel-1 (S1) data. Then, two, well-recognized ML methods are studied to learn the functional relationship between the output and input data. These ML approaches are the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) for regression models. The goal is to use the aforementioned ML techniques to generate Arctic sea ice information from freely available dual-pol observations acquired by S1, which can, in general, only be generated from quad-pol data. Eight overlapping RS2 and S1 scenes were used to train and test the GPR and NN models. Statistical regression performance measures were computed to evaluate the strength of the ML regression methods. Then, two scenes were selected for further evaluation, where overlapping optical images were available as well. This allowed the visual interpretation of the maps estimated by the ML models. Finally, one of the methods was tested on an entire S1 scene to perform prediction on areas outside of the RS2 and S1 overlap. Our results indicate that the studied ML techniques can be utilized to increase the information retrieval capacity of the wide swath dual-pol S1 imagery while embedding physical properties in the methodology.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Geometrical optics; Geophysical prospecting; Ground penetrating radar systems; Input output programs; Machine learning; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Physical properties; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Regression analysis; Sea ice; Functional relationship; Gaussian process regression; Neural network (nn); Output and inputs; Performance measure; Polarimetric SAR data; Statistical regression; Visual interpretation; artificial neural network; estimation method; Gaussian method; machine learning; RADARSAT; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Gaussian process regression (GPR); neural network (NN); polarimetry; Radarsat-2; sea ice; Sentinel-1; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106713936"

Surveys of sea ice conditions are required for production of ice charts, and sequences of SAR images are used for monitoring movement and deformation of the ice. Ice charts show the regional distribution of open water areas and different ice types, often supplemented by additional information such as areal fractions of ice types and floe sizes. Ice drift is displayed in maps of vector fields, which may be complemented with data quantifying their errors or reliability and the degree of deformation. A less extensive but nevertheless important topic of this chapter is the surveillance of icebergs. Ice charts and information on ice movements and iceberg occurrences are essential for the safety of ship traffic and offshore operations, and for several scientific questions.

We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions. Characterizing the complex photon backscatter signals of melt ponds on sea ice is a first step toward automating retrievals of pond parameters such as width, melt pond fraction and depth, and improving higher-level ICESat-2 sea ice height and freeboard products. © 2020.

Although noise vectors in both the azimuth and range directions are provided in the standard S1 EW data for subtraction, the residual thermal noise still significantly affects sea ice detection by the EW data. In this article, we improve the denoising method developed in previous studies to remove the additive noise for the S1 EW data in cross-polarization. Furthermore, we propose a new method for eliminating the residual noise (i.e., multiplicative noise) at the subswath boundaries of the EW data, which cannot be well processed by simply subtracting the reconstructed 2-D noise field. The proposed method of removing both the additive and multiplicative noise was applied to EW HV-polarized images processed using different Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) versions. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of EW HV-polarized images under various sea ice conditions and sea states in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing is widely used to observe sea ice independently of sunlight and cloud cover, however, access to SAR in northern communities has been limited. This study 1) defines the sea ice features that influence travel for two communities in the Western Canadian Arctic, 2) identifies the utility of SAR for enhancing mobility and safety while traversing environments with these features, and 3) describes methods for sharing SAR-based maps. Three field seasons (spring and fall 2017 and spring 2018) were used to engage residents in locally guided research, where applied outputs were evaluated by community members. We found that SAR image data inform and improve sea ice safety, trafficability, and education. Information from technology is desired to complement Inuit knowledge-based understanding of sea ice features, including surface roughness, thin sea ice, early and late season conditions, slush and water on sea ice, sea ice encountered by boats, and ice discontinuities. Floe edge information was not a priority. Sea ice surface roughness was identified as the main condition where benefits to trafficability from SAR-based mapping were regarded as substantial. Classified roughness maps are designed using thresholds representing domains of sea ice surface roughness (smooth ice/maniqtuk hiku, moderately rough ice/maniilrulik hiku, rough ice/maniittuq hiku; dialect is Inuinnaqtun). These maps show excellent agreement with local observations. Overall, SAR-based maps tailored for on-ice use are beneficial for and desired by northern community residents, and we recommend that high-resolution products be routinely made available in communities. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","","Arctic sea ice; Cryosphere climate change; Inuit knowledge; Remote sensing; Safety and navigation; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099561950"

We report observations of vivid colder/saltier intrusion activity in intermediate layers and upper pycnocline of the Gdansk Bay (the south-eastern part of the Baltic Sea) in early spring (March–April, 2013). Extremely low water temperature (down to 1.4–2 °C) and specific water salinity (SÃ7.5–7.8) of the intrusions point at a possible area of the intrusion waters formation: within the upper mixed layer in the Arkona/Bornholm basins at the end of March. Data on water temperature and salinity available from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) data repository, data of the Arkona Becken automated station, meteorological information, and remote sensing data for March–April 2013 are used to confirm the conclusions. It is confirmed once again that the transfer from the two-layered winter water stratification to the three-layered summer one in the Baltic Sea is a consequence of the sea-scale exchange process. The latter is manifested as simultaneous advection in upper and intermediate layers of waters with lower and higher salinity, correspondingly. The reported extremely cold intrusions indicate the beginning of the formation of the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL), which thus contains waters of the Arkona/Bornholm basins. The main environmental factors driving the observed vivid intrusions in April 2013 are easterly winds and negative buoyancy fluxes due to seasonal solar heating of waters with the temperature below that of the density maximum. Substantial prolongation of the period of seasonal vertical mixing might be the most important process related to the transition of water temperature over the temperature of the density maximum (Tmd) in the Baltic Sea. With the climate warming, the cooling of surface waters below the Tmd becomes rare, limiting deep ventilation of Baltic waters in spring. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arkona Basin; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Bornholm Basin; Gulf of Gdansk; automation; buoyancy forcing; environmental factor; intermediate water; mixed layer; pycnocline; remote sensing; saline intrusion; salinity; satellite data; seasonality; spring (hydrology); thermohaline circulation; water temperature","Brackish water; Estuarine salinity gradient; Horizontal water exchange; Spring re-stratification; The baltic sea; Thermohaline intrusions, cold intermediate layer, temperature of the maximum density","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097796303"

In the log-domain, this decrease is approximately linear over the typical range of space-borne SAR instruments. A global correction does not consider that different surface types show different rates of decrease in backscatter intensity. Here, we introduce a supervised classification algorithm that directly incorporates the surface-type dependent effect of IA. We replace the constant mean vector of a Gaussian probability density function in a Bayesian classifier with a linearly variable mean. During training, the classifier first retrieves the slope and intercept of the linear function describing the mean value and then calculates the covariance matrix as the mean squared deviation relative to this function. The IA dependence is no longer treated as an image property but as a class property. Based on training and validation data selected from overlapping SAR and optical images, we evaluate the proposed method in several case studies and compare to other classification algorithms for which a global IA correction is applied during pre-processing. Our results show that the inclusion of the per-class IA sensitivity can significantly improve the performance of the classifier. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

The area of small incidence angles remains the least studied both theoretically and experimentally. With the launch of a Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) into orbit as part of the GPM mission, it became possible for the first time to analyze the dependence of the backscattered radar cross section (RCS) on the incidence angle for small angles (<20 degrees). The Okhotsk Sea was chosen as a test site. For three well-known scattering models, the performed comparison showed that, at the small incidence angles, the model constructed within the framework of the perturbation method best describes the dependence of the RCS on the incidence angle.

As a result, mapping of boundaries between solid ice and open water areas using radar may become rather complicated. Another aspect of the problem of wind wave damping due initial stages of ice is that the areas of strong wave damping due to ice can be erroneously interpreted as surface pollutions in radar imagery. Studies of wave damping due to ice floes are still insufficient, and relations between the floe geometry and wave damping are poorly established. The motivation of this study is to improve our understanding of the process of wave damping due to ice floes for elaboration of physical models of wave damping. New wave tank experiments were carried out to investigate the damping of regular mechanically generated waves and of irregular wind waves due to drifting floe imitators (washing sponges) as well as for the case of stationary, non moving floes. Dependencies of the damping coefficient on wave frequencies for regular and wind waves for different floe sizes and different areas occupied by the floes were obtained. One of the most interesting results was that the damping coefficient indicated a local maximum when the floe size was about half the wave length. A physical interpretation of the results was given, based on the analysis of floe movement under the action of the orbital wave motion taking into account the floe added mass.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, the penetration of microwaves into snow-covered thick ice and the achievable height sensitivity for tens-of-centimeters thin ice are two major issues, which limit the accuracy of InSAR-derived sea ice topography. Polarimetry provides scattering information concerning the sea ice properties and has the potential, in combination with interferometry, to achieve an accurate reconstruction of a sea ice digital elevation model (DEM). This article studies the relation between polarimetric signatures and sea ice topography, and explores the possibility to compensate the penetration bias by merging copolar coherence into InSAR processing. The newly generated topographic map has a root-mean-square error under $0.3\,\text{m}$. For thin ice below $1\,\text{m}$, a positive relation between copolar phase $\phi _{\text{coPol}}$ and surface height is observed, suggesting that $\phi _{\text{coPol}}$ can effectively characterize thin sea ice topography. For thick ice with ridges, the maximum polarimetric phase difference $\Delta \phi _{\text{maxPol}}$ reveals a particular shape of the coherence region, which can be interpreted as oriented volume scattering. It suggests that the model-based approach using polarimetric SAR interferometry assuming an oriented volume scattering model is promising in measuring the scattering centers in thick and deformed sea ice. The study of polarimetric behavior for the InSAR DEM is, therefore, a step forward toward accurate modeling of sea ice topography from polarimetric single-pass InSAR data. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Coherent scattering; Interferometry; Maps; Mean square error; Polarimeters; Sea ice; Surveying; Topography; Digital elevation model; Interferometric SAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Model based approach; Polarimetric phase difference; Polarimetric SAR interferometry; Root mean square errors; Scattering information; digital elevation model; height; radar interferometry; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; TanDEM-X; topography; Synthetic aperture radar","Polarimetry; sea ice topography; single-pass interferometry; TanDEM-X","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098756385"

The Arctic recently experienced anomalous years of high and low sea ice extent in the summers of 2013/2014 and 2012/2016, respectively. Here we investigate the interannual variability of oceanic surface FW flux in relation to spatial and temporal variability in sea ice concentration (SIC), sea surface salinity (SSS), and sea surface temperature (SST), focusing on years with summer sea–ice extremes. Our analysis between 2010–2018 illustrate high parameter variability, especially within the Laptev, Kara, and Barents seas, as well as an overall decreasing trend of FW flux through the Fram Strait. We find that in 2012, a maximum average FW flux of 0.32 ×103 ms−1 in October passed over a large portion of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean at 53◦N. This study highlights recent changes in the Arctic and Subarctic Seas and the importance of continued monitoring of key variables through remote sensing to understand the dynamics behind these ongoing changes. Observations of FW fluxes through major Arctic routes will be increasingly important as the polar regions become more susceptible to warming, with major impacts on global climate. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent disintegration events of ice shelves along with glacier retreat indicate a weakening of this important safety band. Predicting calving front retreat is a real challenge due to complex ice dynamics in a data-scarce environment that are unique for each ice shelf and glacier. We explore the extent to which easy-to-access remote sensing and modeling data can help to define environmental conditions leading to calving front retreat. For the first time, we present a circum-Antarctic record of glacier and ice shelf front change over the last two decades in combination with environmental variables such as air temperature, sea ice days, snowmelt, sea surface temperature, and wind direction. We find that the Antarctic Ice Sheet area decreased by-29 618 ± 1193 km2 in extent between 1997-2008 and gained an area of 7108 ± 1029 km2 between 2009 and 2018. Retreat concentrated along the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica including the biggest ice shelves (Ross and Ronne). In several cases, glacier and ice shelf retreat occurred in conjunction with one or several changes in environmental variables. Decreasing sea ice days, intense snowmelt, weakening easterlies, and relative changes in sea surface temperature were identified as enabling factors for retreat. In contrast, relative increases in mean air temperature did not correlate with calving front retreat. For future studies a more appropriate measure for atmospheric forcing should be considered, including above-zero-degree days and temperature extreme events. To better understand drivers of glacier and ice shelf retreat, it is critical to analyze the magnitude of basal melt through the intrusion of warm Circumpolar Deep Water that is driven by strengthening westerlies and to further assess surface hydrology processes such as meltwater ponding, runoff, and lake drainage.  © 2021 Celia A.

A total of 3 667 observations were collected in the Arctic summers of 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. PM SIC were derived from the NASA-Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT) and Climate Data Record (CDR) algorithms based on the SSMIS sensor, as well as the BT, enhanced NASA-Team (NT2) and ARTIST Sea Ice (ASI) algorithms based on AMSR-E/AMSR-2 sensors. The daily arithmetic average of PM SIC values and the daily weighted average of OBS SIC values were used for the comparisons. The correlation coefficients (CC), biases and root mean square deviations (RMSD) between PM SIC and OBS SIC were compared in terms of the overall trend, and under mild/normal/severe ice conditions. Using the OBS data, the influences of floe size and ice thickness on the SIC retrieval of different PM products were evaluated by calculating the daily weighted average of floe size code and ice thickness. Our results show that CC values range from 0.89 (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2) to 0.95 (SSMIS NT), biases range from −3.96% (SSMIS NT) to 12.05% (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2), and RMSD values range from 10.81% (SSMIS NT) to 20.15% (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2). Floe size has a significant influence on the SIC retrievals of the PM products, and most of the PM products tend to underestimate SIC under smaller floe size conditions and overestimate SIC under larger floe size conditions. Ice thickness thicker than 30 cm does not have a significant influence on the SIC retrieval of PM products. Overall, the best (worst) agreement occurs between OBS SIC and SSMIS NT (AMSR-E/AMSR-2 NT2) SIC in the Arctic summer. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Arctic navigation; passive microwave remote sensing; sea ice concentration; ship-based visual observations; summer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092410227"

In this sense, it is important to identify the concentration of sea ice in different regions of Antarctica in order to measure the impact of environmental changes on the region’s ecosystem. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the multiple linear regression and Box–Jenkins methods for predicting the concentration of sea ice along the northwest coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Sea ice concentration data from May to November for the period 1979–2018 were extracted from passive remote sensors including a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer, special sensor microwave imager, and special sensor microwave imager/sounder. Meteorological variables from the atmospheric reanalysis model ERA5 of the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were used as predictor variables, and the leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to calibrate and validate the models.

We use surface ozone from six sites-Summit (Greenland), Pallas (Finland), Barrow (USA), Alert (Canada), Tiksi (Russia), and Villum Research Station (VRS) at Station Nord (North Greenland, Danish realm)-and ozone-sonde data from three Canadian sites: Resolute, Eureka, and Alert. Two global chemistry models-a global chemistry transport model (parallelised-Tropospheric Offline Model of Chemistry and Transport, p-TOMCAT) and a global chemistry climate model (United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol, UKCA)-are used for model data comparisons. Remotely sensed data of BrO from the GOME-2 satellite instrument and ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) at Eureka, Canada, are used for model validation. The observed climatology data show that spring surface ozone at coastal sites is heavily depleted, making ozone seasonality at Arctic coastal sites distinctly different from that at inland sites. Model simulations show that surface ozone can be greatly reduced by bromine chemistry. In April, bromine chemistry can cause a net ozone loss (monthly mean) of 10-20 ppbv, with almost half attributable to open-oceansourced bromine and the rest to sea-ice-sourced bromine. However, the open-ocean-sourced bromine, via sea spray bromide depletion, cannot by itself produce ozone depletion events (ODEs; defined as ozone volume mixing ratios, VMRs, <10 ppbv). In contrast, sea-ice-sourced bromine, via sea salt aerosol (SSA) production from blowing snow, can produce ODEs even without bromine from sea spray, highlighting the importance of sea ice surface in polar boundary layer chemistry. Modelled total inorganic bromine (Brγ) over the Arctic sea ice is sensitive to model configuration; e.g. under the same bromine loading, BrY in the Arctic spring boundary layer in the p-TOMCAT control run (i.e. with all bromine emissions) can be 2 times that in the UKCA control run. Despite the model differences, both model control runs can successfully reproduce large bromine explosion events (BEEs) and ODEs in polar spring. Model-integrated tropospheric-column BrO generally matches GOME-2 tropospheric columns within ∼50% in UKCA and a factor of 2 in p-TOMCAT. The success of the models in reproducing both ODEs and BEEs in the Arctic indicates that the relevant parameterizations implemented in the models work reasonably well, which supports the proposed mechanism of SSA production and bromide release on sea ice. Given that sea ice is a large source of SSA and halogens, changes in sea ice type and extent in a warming climate will influence Arctic boundary layer chemistry, including the oxidation of atmospheric elemental mercury. Note that this work dose not necessary rule out other possibilities that may act as a source of reactive bromine from the sea ice zone.  © 2020 Author(s).","Arctic; arctic environment; atmospheric transport; bromine; climate modeling; GOME; ground-based measurement; open ocean; oxidation; ozone; remote sensing; sea ice; warming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098224716"

In the Arctic seas, one of the major challenges of SSS remote sensing is the presence of sea ice. This paper proposes a data-driven ice correction (IC) algorithm which extracts emission from the water portion of measured brightness temperature (TB) in scenes mixed with water and ice. Emission of the ice portion was removed based on estimation according to the ice fraction (fice) in the satellite footprint and ice signature derived from surrounding pixels. The IC algorithm is applied to SMAP TB data to obtain TB with IC (TBIC), which are used for SSS retrieval using the standard JPL SMAP CAP processing system. We show that the algorithm is most effective near the ice edge, thereby increasing the fice threshold for possible SSS retrieval to 15% from the current 3% without IC. SMAP SSS are validated using in situ salinity collected during NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission from 2016 to 2020 along the Greenland coast. The number of collocations between OMG and SMAP daily gridded salinity increased by more than 30% with IC. The statistical analysis shows a similar retrieval accuracy with or without IC, with the standard deviation of the difference between OMG and SMAP of 1.41 psu (with IC) and 1.42 psu (without IC). The bias-adjusted SMAP SSS depicts salinity patterns and gradients around Greenland consistent with OMG measurements. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Greenland; Integrated circuits; Oceanography; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Silicon carbide; Soil moisture; Surface waters; Timing circuits; Arctic Sea; Empirical algorithms; Green land; Ice effects; L-band radiometer; Ocean temperature; Salinity (geophysical); Sea measurements; Sea surface salinity; SMAP; accuracy assessment; algorithm; brightness temperature; data processing; empirical analysis; error correction; image analysis; pixel; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite mission; sea ice; sea surface salinity; soil moisture; Temperature measurement","Arctic seas; sea ice; sea surface salinity; soil moisture active passive (SMAP)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119397176"

These phenomena occur in the surface ocean for a period of several days, on scales between a few hundred meters and few tens of kilometers. Remote sensing and modeling suggest that eddies and fronts may influence marine ecosystem dynamics, but their limited temporal and spatial scales make them challenging for observation and in situ sampling. Here, the study of a submesoscale filament in summerly Arctic waters (depth 0–400 m) revealed enhanced mixing of Polar and Atlantic water masses, resulting in a ca. 4 km wide and ca. 50 km long filament with distinct physical and biogeochemical characteristics. Compared to the surrounding waters, the filament was characterized by a distinct phytoplankton bloom, associated with depleted inorganic nutrients, elevated chlorophyll a concentrations, as well as twofold higher phyto- and bacterioplankton cell abundances. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacterioplankton communities revealed enrichment of typical phytoplankton bloom-associated taxonomic groups (e.g., Flavobacteriales) inside the filament. Furthermore, linked to the strong water subduction, the vertical export of organic matter to 400 m depth inside the filament was twofold higher compared to the surrounding waters. Altogether, our results show that physical submesoscale mixing can shape distinct biogeochemical conditions and microbial communities within a few kilometers of the ocean. Hence, the role of submesoscale features in polar waters for surface ocean biodiversity and biogeochemical processes need further investigation, especially with regard to the fate of sea ice in the warming Arctic Ocean. © 2021 The Authors.

Variations in these parameters were analyzed for three individual 10-year increments (1988 - 1997, 1998 - 2007, and 2008 - 2017) as well as for the entire 30-year period, and spatial comparisons of both were made for the sub-regions. Results showed that the mean sea-ice concentration for the entire Antarctic region over the 30-year period was 0.506. From 2008 to 2017, the sea-ice concentration decreased at a rate of -0.28% yr-1. The Weddell Sea was found to have the largest area of multi-year sea ice, whereas the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean had the least. Spatially, the multi-year sea ice area increased mainly in the Weddell Sea, whereas the Bellingshausen Sea, Amundsen Sea, and Ross Sea experienced decreasing sea ice areas. In conclusion, regional differences in the spatial distribution of the Antarctic sea ice were observed. The temporal trend and range of the sea-ice concentration differed between the five sub-regions, as did the spatial distribution and temporal trend of multi-year sea ice. © 2021 Chinese Geoscience Union.

The winter event lasted from February 20 to March 3, 2018 and the summer event persisted from August 2 to September 5, 2018. The minimum ice concentration derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations was 72% and 65% during the winter and summer events, respectively. The occurrence of both events can be related to strengthened southerly winds associated with an increased east-west zonal surface level air pressure gradient across the north Greenland due to perturbation of mid-troposphere polar vortex. The relatively warm air temperature during the 2017/2018 freezing season in comparison with previous years, together with the occurrence of the winter polynya, formed favourable pre-conditions for ice field fracturing in summer, which promoted the formation of the summer polynya. Diminished southerly winds and increased cover of new ice over the open water were the dominant factors for the disappearance of the winter polynya, whereas increased ice inflow from the north was the primary factor behind the closure of the summer polynya. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were found better suited than AMSR2 observations for quantification of a new ice product during the polynya event because the SAR images have high potential for mapping of different sea ice regimes with finely spatial resolution. The unprecedented polynya events north of Greenland in 2017/2018 are important from the perspective of Arctic sea ice loss because they occurred in a region that could potentially be the last “Arctic sea ice refuge” in future summers. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Arctic Ocean; Greenland; ice concentration; ice motion; polynya; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092355494"

In addition, regional pressures associated with growing human populations and economies result in changes in infrastructure, land use, and other development; greater extraction of fisheries and other natural resources; alteration of benthic seascapes; increased pollution; and eutrophication. Understanding biodiversity is fundamental to assessing and managing human activities that sustain ecosystem health and services and mitigate humankind’s indiscretions. Remote-sensing observations provide rapid and synoptic data for assessing biophysical interactions at multiple spatial and tem-poral scales and thus are useful for monitoring biodiversity in critical coastal zones. However, many challenges remain because of complex bio-optical signals, poor signal retrieval, and suboptimal algorithms. Here, we highlight four approaches in remote sensing that complement the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). MBON observations help quantify plankton community composition, foundation species, and unique species habitat relationships, as well as inform species distribution models. In concert with in situ observations across multiple platforms, these efforts contribute to monitoring biodiversity changes in complex coastal regions by providing oceanographic context, contributing to algorithm and indicator development, and creating linkages between long-term ecological studies, the next generations of satellite sensors, and marine ecosystem management. © 2021, Oceanography Society.

Existing methods suffer from noise interference and the mixture of water and ice caused high segmentation error and less robustness. In this article, we propose a novel sea ice floe segmentation algorithm from HRO images based on texture-sensitive superpixeling and two-stage thresholding. First, sparse components are extracted from the HRO images using the robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and noise is removed by the bilateral filter. The enhanced image is obtained by combining the low-rank matrix and the sparse components. Second, a texture-sensitive simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm is introduced for presegmentation of the enhanced HRO image. Third, a learning-based adaptive thresholding in the two stages is employed to generate the refined segmentation from the derived superpixels blocks. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on two HRO images using visual assessment, quantitative evaluation (with seven metrics), and histogram comparison. The superior performance of the proposed method has demonstrated its efficacy for sea ice floe segmentation.  © 2020 IEEE.","Climate change; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Image texture; Iterative methods; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Superpixels; Textures; Adaptive thresholding; High-resolution optical images; Iterative clustering; Quantitative evaluation; Remote sensing images; Robust principal component analysis; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation error; algorithm; floating ice; pixel; remote sensing; sea ice; segmentation; Image segmentation","Adaptive two-stage thresholding; high-resolution optical (HRO) image; low-rank sparse representation; sea ice floe segmentation; texture-sensitive superpixeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097178134"

The multi-instrument inversion and data assimilation preprocessing system, artificial intelligence version, or MIIDAPS-AI for short, is valid for both polar and geostationary microwave and infrared sounders and imagers as well as for pairs of combined infrared and microwave sounders. The algorithm produces vertical profiles of temperature and moisture as well as surface temperature, surface emissivity, and cloud parameters. Additional products from hyperspectral infrared sensors include selected trace gases. From microwave sensors, additional products such as rainfall rate, first year/multiyear sea ice concentration, and soil moisture can be derived from primary products. The MIIDAPS-AI algorithm is highly efficient with no noticeable decrease in accuracy compared to traditional operational sounding algorithms. The automatically generated Jacobians from this deep-learning algorithm could provide an explainability mechanism to build trustworthiness in the algorithm, and to quantify uncertainties of the algorithm's outputs. The computation gain is estimated to be two orders of magnitude, which opens the door to either 1) process massively larger amounts of satellite data, or to 2) offer improvements in timeliness and significant saving in computing power (and therefore cost) if the same amount of data is processed. Here, we present an overview of the MIIDAPS-AI implementation, discuss its applicability to various sensors and provide an initial performance assessment for a select number of sensors and geophysical parameters.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Acoustic devices; Deep learning; Geostationary satellites; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Orbits; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Soil moisture; Automatically generated; Geophysical parameters; Microwave remote sensing; Performance assessment; Preprocessing systems; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice concentration; Surface temperatures; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; data assimilation; EOS; infrared imagery; microwave imagery; remote sensing; Learning algorithms","Artificial Intelligence (AI); atmosphere; earth observing system; machine learning; neural networks; remote sensing; satellite","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113214484"

In this study, we investigate the spatial and temporal variations in surface snowmelt over the entire pan-Antarctic region from 2002 to 2017 by using passive microwave remote sensing data. The stable orbits and appropriate acquisition times of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) enable us to take full advantage of daily brightness temperature (Tb) variations to detect surface snowmelt. The difference between AMSR-E/2 ascending and descending 36.5 GHz Tb values in vertical polarization (DAV36) was utilized to map the pan-Antarctic region snowmelt, as this method is unaffected by snow metamorphism. We evaluated the DAV36 algorithm against groundbased measurements and further improved the method over the marginal sea ice zone by excluding the effect of open water. Snowmelt detected by AMSR-E/2 data was more extensive and persistent than that detected by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data. Continuous melt onset (CMO) ranged from August in the marginal sea ice zone to January in the Antarctic inland, and the early transient melt events occurred several days to more than 2 months earlier. The pan-Antarctic region CMO was significantly correlated (R D 0:54, p > 0:05) with the summer Southern Annular Mode (SAM). The decreased AIS melt extent was very likely linked (R D -0:82, p > 0:01) with the enhanced summer SAM. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

The scattered signals over sea ice, flooded areas, and even under dense vegetation show a detectable coherent component that can be separated from the incoherent component and processed accordingly. This work derives an analytical formulation of the response of a GNSS-R instrument to a step function in the reflectivity using well-known principles of electromagnetic theory. The evaluation of the spatial resolution then requires a numerical evaluation of the proposed equations, as the width of the transition depends on the reflectivity values of two regions. However, it is found that results are fairly constant over a wide range of reflectivities, and they only vary faster for very high or very low reflectivity gradients. The predicted step response is then satisfactorily compared to airborne experimental results at L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L5 (1176.45 MHz) bands, acquired over a water reservoir south of Melbourne, in terms of width and ringing, and several examples are provided when the transition occurs from land to a rough ocean surface, where the coherent scattering component is no longer dominant. © 2020 by the authors.

We found spatial variability in the trends of these cryospheric, biologic and oceanographic phenomena. For example, in the northern Baffin Bay, we observed decreases in annual sea-ice persistence, yet increases along the Labrador Sea-ice edge during winter, with the latter having significant correlations with broader atmospheric patterns. In general, we observed increases in summer sea surface temperatures across the study region, except a small area of cooling along the southern Greenlandic coast. We also found significant negative trends in April chlorophyll-a and primary production followed by significant positive trends for both biological phenomena in May, owing to anomalously high values in 2014 and 2015. Notably, we found a significant positive correlation between days of monthly sea ice presence in April with May primary production quantities. Finally, we found a significant positive trend in total annual primary production over the study period.

The Delta-Eddington model (BL) and Two-strEam rAdiative transfer model (TEA) are employed to retrieving pond depth Hp and underlying ice thickness Hi according to the ratio X of the melt-pond albedo in two bands. Results showed that when λ1 = 359 nm and λ2 = 605 nm, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient r between X and Hp is 0.99 for the BL model. The result of TEA model was similar to the BL model. The retrievals of Hp for the two models agreed well with field observations. For Hi, the highest r (0.99) was obtained when λ1 = 447 nm and λ2 = 470 nm for the BL model, λ1 = 447 nm and λ2 = 451 nm for the TEA model. Furthermore, the BL model was more suitable for the retrieval of thick ice (0 <Hi < 3.5 m, R2 = 0.632), while the TEA model is on the contrary (Hi <1 m, R2 = 0.842).

Thermokarst lagoons are an important transition stage with complex depositional histories during which permafrost and lacustrine carbon pools are transformed along eroding Arctic coasts. The effects of temperature and salinity changes during thermokarst lake to lagoon transitions on thaw history and lagoon deposits are understudied. We analyzed two 30-m-long sediment cores from two thermokarst lagoons on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Northeast Siberia, using sedimentological, geochronological, hydrochemical, and biogeochemical techniques. Using remote sensing we distinguished between a semi-closed and a nearly closed lagoon. We (1) characterized the depositional history, (2) studied the impact of marine inundation on ice-bearing permafrost and taliks, and (3) quantified the OC pools for different stages of thermokarst lagoons. Fluvial and former Yedoma deposits were found at depth between 30 and 8.5 m, while lake and lagoon deposits formed the upper layers. The electrical conductivity of the pore water indicated hypersaline conditions for the semi-closed lagoon (max: 108 mS/cm), while fresh to brackish conditions were observed beneath a 5 m-thick surface saline layer at the nearly closed lagoon. The deposits had a mean OC content of 15 ± 2 kg/m3, with higher values in the semi-closed lagoon. Based on the cores we estimated a total OC pool of 5.7 Mt-C for the first 30 m of sediment below five mapped lagoons on the Bykovsky Peninsula. Our results suggest that paleo river branches shaped the middle Pleistocene landscape followed by late Pleistocene Yedoma permafrost accumulation and early Holocene lake development. Afterward, lake drainage, marine flooding, and bedfast ice formation caused the saline enrichment of pore water, which led to cryotic talik development. We find that the OC-pool of Arctic lagoons may comprise a substantial inventory of partially thawed and partially refrozen OC, which is available for microbial degradation processes at the Arctic terrestrial-marine interface. Climate change in the Arctic leading to sea level rise, permafrost thaw, coastal erosion, and sea ice loss may increase the rate of thermokarst lagoon formation and thus increase the importance of lagoons as biogeochemical processors of former permafrost OC. © Copyright © 2021 Jenrich, Angelopoulos, Grosse, Overduin, Schirrmeister, Nitze, Biskaborn, Liebner, Grigoriev, Murray, Jongejans and Strauss.","Arctic Ocean; Bykovsky Peninsula; Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia; Biodegradation; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Deposits; Floods; Geochronology; Organic carbon; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Saline water; Sea ice; Sea level; Thawing; Depositional characteristics; Effects of temperature; Electrical conductivity; Hypersaline conditions; Microbial degradation; Middle Pleistocene; North-East Siberia; Terrestrial carbon cycle; coastal erosion; coastal lagoon; deposition; electrical conductivity; lagoon; luminescence dating; organic carbon; permafrost; Pleistocene; remote sensing; talik; thermokarst; Lakes","Arctic Siberia; coastal erosion; inundation; OSL (optically stimulated luminescence); permafrost carbon; talik; Yedoma","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112657226"

One approach to observing SST is via remote sensing. Here we use a 37-year gap-filled, daily-mean analysis of satellite SSTs to quantify SST trends, variability and persistence between 1981–2018. The global mean warming trend is 0.09 K per decade globally, with 95% of local trends being between −0.1 K and + 0.35 K. Excluding perennial sea-ice regions, the mean warming trend is 0.11 K per decade. After removing the long-term trend we calculate the SST power spectra over different time periods. The maximum variance in the SST power spectra in the equatorial Pacific is 1.9 K2 on 1–5 year timescales, dominated by ENSO processes. In western boundary currents characterised by an intense mesoscale activity, SST power on sub-annual timescales dominates, with a maximum variance of 4.9 K2. Persistence timescales tend to be shorter in the summer hemisphere due to the shallower mixed layer. The median short-term persistence length is 11–14 days, found over 71–79% of the global ocean area, with seasonal variations. The mean global correlation between monthly SST anomalies with a three-month time-lag is 0.35, with statistically significant correlations over 54.0% of the global oceans, and notably in the northern and equatorial Pacific, and the sub-polar gyre south of Greenland. At six months, the mean global SST anomaly correlation falls to 0.18. The satellite data record enables the detailed characterisation of temporal changes in SST over almost four decades. © 2020, The Author(s).","article; Greenland; quantitative analysis; sea ice; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; summer; warming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085156438"

In this study, we integrate 10 years of research at the Nakvak Brook watershed in Torngat Mountains National Park of Canada, northern Labrador, to assess the sensitivity of ecological and geomorphological systems to regional climate warming. A time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index indicates that the area has undergone a significant greening trend over the past four decades. Analyses of shrub cross sections suggest that greening has been caused by a combination of rapid establishment and growth that began in the late 1990’s and coincided with warmer growing season temperatures. Recent (2010–2015) vegetation change has been subtle and heavily moderated by soil moisture status. Plant canopy height is greater in wet areas and has an insulating effect on ground surface temperatures during the winter, a consequence of snow trapping by shrub canopies. Observations of subsurface conditions indicate that the study site is best characterized as having discontinuous near-surface permafrost. The importance of subsurface conditions for above-ground vegetation depends on the geomorphological context, with plants in wet areas underlain by fine materials being the most likely to be growth-limited by permafrost, thus being potential hot-spots for future change. With the expectation of sustained climate change, loss of adjacent sea ice, and proximity to the forest-tundra ecotone, it is likely that the Torngat Mountains will continue to be an area of rapid environmental change in the coming decades. © 2020, The Author(s).","Arctic; Canada; Labrador; Newfoundland and Labrador; Torngat Mountains; canopy architecture; environmental change; growing season; NDVI; regional climate; shrub; soil moisture; watershed","Climate change; Dendroecology; Environmental change; NDVI; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Shrubification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095459468"

Herein, the products of sea-ice concentration (SIC) data derived using the arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study (ARTIST) sea ice (ASI) algorithm were evaluated by comparing them with SICs from a high-resolution sea-ice aerial image obtained during the 27th China Antarctic expedition in January 2011. Results suggest that data obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system (AMSR-E) underestimate SICs by 19%. We performed step-by-step comparisons among the aerial image, moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and AMSR-E SIC. These types of comparisons have not been made in previous validation studies. First, SICs acquired from MODIS-Terra imagery were acquired using a tie-point method and corrected by SICs derived from the aerial photography. Second, SICs of MODIS-Aqua images were trained based on the consistency of SIC results between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the selected region on the same day. Finally, the MODIS-Aqua SICs were employed to validate synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products. The results show that the AMSR-E products underestimate SICs by 8.5% in the marginal ice zone in comparison with MODIS SICs. According to our further analysis between sea-ice types and AMSR-E biases, the higher the proportion of first-year ice, the smaller the AMSR-E SIC bias. In other words, results suggest that the higher the thin ice proportion, the more the AMSR-E underestimates the SIC.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System; High resolution; Marginal Ice Zone; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Remote sensing data; Sea ice concentration; Turbulence interactions; Validation study; aerial survey; AMSR-E; concentration (composition); model validation; MODIS; sea ice; Radiometers","Aerial imagery; AMSR-E (advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system) data; sea-ice concentration (SIC); step-by-step validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098737153"

Located in coastal areas, LFSI is of great significance to the physical and ecological systems of the Arctic shelf and in local indigenous communities. We present an overview of the physics of Arctic LFSI and the associated implications on the cryosphere. LFSI is kept in place by four fasten mechanisms. The evolution of LFSI is mostly determined by thermodynamic processes, and can therefore be used as an indicator of local climate change. We also present the dynamic processes that are active prior to the formation of LFSI, and those that are involved in LFSI freeze-up and breakup. Season length, thickness and extent of Arctic LFSI are decreasing and showing different trends in different seas, and therefore, causing environmental and climatic impacts. An improved coordination of Arctic LFSI observation is needed with a unified and systematic observation network supported by cooperation between scientists and indigenous communities, as well as a better application of remote sensing data to acquire detailed LFSI cryosphere physical parameters, hence revolving both its annual cycle and long-term changes.

The fraction and distribution of melt ponds have considerable impacts on Arctic climate and ecosystem by reducing the albedo. There is an urgency to obtain improved accuracy and a wider coverage of melt pond fraction (MPF) data for studying these processes. MPF information has generally been acquired from optical imagery. Conventional MPF algorithms based on high-resolution optical sensors have treated melt ponds as features with constant reflectance; however, the spectral reflectance of ponds can vary greatly, even at a local scale. Here we use Sentinel-2 imagery to demonstrate those previous algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance greatly underestimate MPF. We propose a new algorithm (“LinearPolar”) based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance features and calculates MPF across the vector between melt pond and bare ice axes. The angular coordinate θ of the polar coordinate system, which is only associated with pond fraction rather than reflectance, is used to determinate MPF. By comparing the new algorithm and previous methods with IceBridge optical imagery data, across a variety of Sentinel-2 images with melt ponds at various stages of development, we show that the RMSE value of the LinearPolar algorithm is about 30% lower than for the previous algorithms. Moreover, based on a sensitivity test, the new algorithm is also less sensitive to the subjective threshold for melt pond reflectance than previous algorithms. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Monitoring and mitigation efforts along remote Arctic rivers are possible but logistically complex. In recent years, Earth observation programs have emerged based on spaceborne sensors that record large parts of the Earth's surface at a regular interval and with fast downlink. Most optical satellites have a similar sun-synchronous orbit, and have thus an akin ground track. When different sun-synchronous missions are combined this results in near-simultaneous acquisitions, which make it possible to monitor fast displacements that occur at or near the Earth's surface over large scales. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a new monitoring system; one of observing river ice movement. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-satellite monitoring system by combining data from freely available medium- and coarse-resolution satellites, in this study that is Sentinel-2 and PROBA-V. Velocities of floating river ice during the spring of 2016 are estimated over a more than 700 km long reach of the Lena River in Russia. In order to achieve automatic velocity estimates at such scales, efficient and river-ice specific processing steps are included. Entropy filters are used to detect regions of high contrast and neglects open water or an intact ice cover, and also help the image matching. Post-processing is done through filtering on the general flow direction, stemming from a global river mask dataset. In all, this study shows the potential of extracting river ice movement from a combination of low and medium resolution satellite sensors in sun-synchronous orbit. © 2021 The Author(s)","Lena River; Russian Federation; Satellites; Varanidae; ice breakup; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sentinel; spatial resolution","Mini-satellite; Multi-sensor; PROBA-V; River-ice movement monitoring; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120716404"

To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data. Results: Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be ~ 100m2 which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0%, 1-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%, 81-100%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer's values was used. Initial results (n = 6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52% of their time in open water, and only 15% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period. Conclusion: Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables. © 2020 The Author(s).","","Antarctic Peninsula; Biologging; Ice concentration; Minke whale; Sea ice; Tag-video","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092569971"

In the framework of the Copernicus program, the Sentinel-1 mission is the workhorse for acquiring systematically and providing routinely a large volume of C-band SAR data to the Copernicus services and the global scientific and commercial user community. As part of the Copernicus expansion, ESA completed the study phase for an L-band SAR mission (ROSE-L) last October 2019 and issued the corresponding Request for Proposal for the development of two spacecraft. On the other hand, the availability of high-resolution X-band data is ensured through national European SAR missions, such as TerraSAR-X, Cosmo-SkyMed and PAZ, which are referred to as Copernicus Contributing Missions. L-band SAR data are required for applications, such as surface deformation mapping, monitoring of cryosphere dynamics, sea-ice classification and land cover mapping, among others. As such, L-band data provide complementary information to C- and X-band data. Besides ESA's ROSE-L, Germany is perusing the implementation of the proposed Tandem-L mission, at national level. Recently, disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies have emerged on the EO market. This has triggered discussions on whether or to what extent smallSats can eventually replace or complement large institutional SAR missions. In this paper we provide the overview of the evolution of the Copernicus SAR Space Component: the Sentinel-1 Space Segment and the Spacecraft development status, the ROSE-L development approach and we also discuss the challenges for the evolution. its objectives and implementation, the systematic data acquisition strategy including coverage and revisit frequency, and the end-to-end SAR performance. © 2020 IEEE.","Data acquisition; Forestry; Geology; International cooperation; Mapping; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space flight; Space optics; Acquisition strategies; Development approach; Future perspectives; Land cover mapping; Request for proposals; Sea ice classification; Spacecraft development; Surface deformation; Space-based radar","Copernicus; ROSE-L; SAR; Sentinel-1","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101972136"

In the Kara and Chukchi Seas, noticeable changes in the ice cover occurred in the time period from June to November, in the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea from July to October. Comparison of daily data of 2015-2020 with the average sea ice extent in the last two decades of the previous century has shown that the destruction of the ice cover in recent years begins earlier, and its formation in autumn occurs later, changes in each of the seas having their own specifics. The largest changes in comparison with the ice conditions of the previous century are observed in the East Siberian Sea. The analysis of the sea ice conditions of the Northern Sea Route was carried out for one of the possible navigation trajectories from the group of optimal routes. The most significant changes in sea ice conditions in recent years when compared with the period 1979-1999 belong to the time interval from July to October.

Landfast ice (LFI) on the Baltic Sea is a place for recreational activities such as skiing and ice fishing. Over thick LFI ice roads can be established between mainland and islands to speed up transportation compared to the use of ferries. LFI also allows transportation of material to or from islands without piers for large ships. For all these activities, information on LFI extent and sea ice thickness, snow thickness and degree of ice deformation on LFI is very important. We generated new operational products for these LFI parameters based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and existing products and prediction models on the Baltic Sea ice properties. The products are generated daily and have a 500 m pixel size. They are visualized in a web-portal titled “Baltic Sea landfast ice extent and thickness (BALFI)” which has free access. The BALFI service was started in Feb 2019. Before the BALFI service, information on the LFI properties in fine scale (<1 km) was not available from any single source or product. We studied the accuracy and quality of the BALFI products for the ice season 2019–2020 using ice charts and in-situ coastal ice station data. We suggest that the current products give usable information on the Baltic LFI properties for various end-users. We also identify some topics for the further development of the BALFI products. © 2020 by the authors.

However, it is also true that not all the information is relevant. It may be redundant, corrupted, or unnecessary for the given task, hence decreasing the performance of the algorithms. Therefore, it is crucial to select an optimal set of image attributes which provides the relevant information content to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the image interpretation and retrieval of geophysical parameters. Comprehensive studies have been focused on the analysis of relevant features for sea ice analysis obtained from different sensors, especially synthetic aperture radar. However, the outcomes of these studies are mostly data and application-dependent and can, therefore, rarely be generalized. In this article, we employ a feature selection method based on graph Laplacians, which is fully automatic and easy to implement. The proposed approach assesses relevant information on a global and local level using two metrics and selects relevant features for different regions of an image according to their physical characteristics and observation conditions. In the recent study, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for sea ice classification, using different multi-sensor data combinations. Experiments show the advantage of applying multi-sensor data sets and demonstrate that the attributes selected by our method result in high classification accuracies. We demonstrate that our approach automatically considers varying technical, sensor-specific, environmental, and sea ice conditions by employing flexible and adaptive feature selection method as a pre-processing step. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Image enhancement; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Adaptive feature selection; Classification accuracy; Feature selection methods; Geophysical parameters; Observation condition; Physical characteristics; Remote sensing analysis; Sea ice classification; image analysis; image processing; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; unsupervised classification; Feature extraction","Graph Laplacians; multi-sensor remote sensing; sea ice; unsupervised information selection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112607555"

This may in turn lead to increased sea ice mobility and impacts of ice movement on structures. We investigate space-borne radar interferometry (InSAR) as a technique to measure mm-scale sea ice motion of stationary ice over weeks to months. We find that InSAR enables mapping of bottomfast and stabilized landfast ice as regions with near-zero or reduced deformation. We further use this data to derive landfast ice strain and stress enabling estimation of the fracturing potential along the Northstar Island ice road in the Beaufort Sea, Alaska. We further examine ground-based radar interferometry (GRI) as a tool to collect continuous near real-time measurements on the km-scale not possible with InSAR. Based on GRI measurements conducted in Utqiaġvik, Alaska, we demonstrate the ability to evaluate ice strain in stationary ice and track vertical ice displacement due to tides. We also collected GRI measurements at 500 Hz during a drifting ice camp in the Beaufort Sea. The high sampling rate enabled tracking of continuous strain and detection of subtle variations in behavior between ice regimes. Through this work, interferometry shows promise as a tool to observe ice motion at the relevant scales needed for assessing sea ice stability, identify precursors to failure events, and better understand the relationship between different ice properties and loads on structures. © 2021 Lulea University of Technology.

However, traditional data assimilation methods cannot better extract the valuable information due to the complicated variability of the sea ice concentration in the marginal ice zone. A successive corrections analysis using variational optimization method, called spatial multi-scale recursive filter (SMRF), has been designed in this paper to extract multi-scale information resolved by sea ice observations. It is a combination of successive correction methods (SCM) and minimization algorithms, in which various observational scales, from longer to shorter wavelengths, can be extracted successively. As a variational objective analysis scheme, it gains the advantage over the conventional approaches that analyze all scales resolved by observations at one time, and also, the specification of parameters is more convenient. Results of single-observation experiment demonstrate that the SMRF scheme possesses a good ability in propagating observational signals. Further, it shows a superior performance in extracting multi-scale information in a two-dimensional sea ice concentration (SIC) experiment with the real observations from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager SIC (SSMI). © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","sea ice concentration; spatial multi-scale recursive filter; variational successive corrections","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092388841"

Here, we present a new type of autonomous platform to measure snow depth, air temperature, and barometric pressure on drifting Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. “Snow Buoys” are designed to withstand the harshest environmental conditions and to deliver high and consistent data quality with minimal impact on the surface. Our current dataset consists of 79 time series (47 Arctic, 32 Antarctic) since 2013, many of which cover entire seasonal cycles and with individual observation periods of up to 3 years. In addition to a detailed introduction of the platform itself, we describe the processing of the publicly available (near real time) data and discuss limitations. First scientific results reveal characteristic regional differences in the annual cycle of snow depth: in the Weddell Sea, annual net snow accumulation ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 m (mean 0.34 m) with some regions accumulating snow in all months. On Arctic sea ice, the seasonal cycle was more pronounced, showing accumulation from synoptic events mostly between August and April and maxima in autumn. Strongest ablation was observed in June and July, and consistently the entire snow cover melted during summer. Arctic air temperature measurements revealed several above-freezing temperature events in winter that likely impacted snow stratigraphy and thus preconditioned the subsequent spring snow cover. The ongoing Snow Buoy program will be the basis of many future studies and is expected to significantly advance our understanding of snow on sea ice, also providing invaluable in situ validation data for numerical simulations and remote sensing techniques. © Copyright © 2021 Nicolaus, Hoppmann, Arndt, Hendricks, Katlein, Nicolaus, Rossmann, Schiller and Schwegmann.","","Antarctic; Arctic (Ocean); buoy; measurement; platform; sea ice; snow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104938102"

The detection of sea ice is particularly important, and the classification of sea ice images is an important part of sea ice detection. Traditional sea ice classification based on optical remote sensing mostly uses spectral information only and does not fully extract rich spectral and spatial information from sea ice images. At the same time, it is difficult to obtain samples and the resulting small sample sizes used in sea ice classification has limited the improvement of classification accuracy to a certain extent. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a hyperspectral sea ice image classification method involving spectral-spatial-joint features based on the principal component analysis (PCA) network. First, the method uses the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and Gabor filter to extract textural and spatial information about sea ice. Then, the optimal band combination is extracted with a band selection algorithm based on a hybrid strategy, and the information hidden in the sea ice image is deeply extracted through a fusion of spectral and spatial features. Then, the PCA network is designed based on principal component analysis filters in order to extract the depth features of sea ice more effectively, and hash binarization maps and block histograms are used to enhance the separation and reduce the dimensions of features. Finally, the low-level features in the data form more abstract and invariant high-level features for sea ice classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on two different data collection points in Bohai Bay and Baffin Bay. The experimental results show that, compared with other single feature and spectral-spatial-joint feature algorithms, the proposed method achieves better sea ice classification results (94.15% and 96.86%) by using fewer training samples and a shorter training time. © 2021 by the authors.

It is an indicator of the global surface water cycle, and it is the focus of research in the fields of agriculture, meteorology, and hydrology. Traditional soil moisture monitoring methods generally have disadvantages such as high cost and low temporal and spatial resolution. GNSS-R technology is an emerging remote sensing technology that uses navigation satellite signals and forward scattering signals as signal sources to carry out large-scale surface physical parameter analysis and inversion. With many advantages, it has been widely used in sea surface wind fields, sea ice detection and soil moisture inversion. The existing GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval methods have certain limitations. In this paper, the forward model SCoBi (The Signals of Opportunity Coherent Bistatic scattering model and simulator) based on generalized full polarization released by Mississippi State University is used in the bare or vegetation-covered terrain.

Sea ice classification is an important part of sea ice detection. Hyperspectral imagery and multispectral imagery contain rich spectral information and spatial information and provide important data support for sea ice classification. At present, most sea ice classification methods mainly focus on shallow learning based on spectral features, and the good performance of the deep learning method in remote sensing image classification provides a new idea for sea ice classification. However, the level of deep learning is limited due to the influence of input size in sea ice image classification, and the deep features in the image cannot be fully mined, which affects the further improvement of sea ice classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes an image classification method based on multilevel feature fusion using residual network. First, the PCA method is used to extract the first principal component of the original image, and the residual network is used to deepen the number of network layers. The FPN, PAN, and SPP modules increase the mining between layer and layer features and merge the features between different layers to further improve the accuracy of sea ice classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, sea ice classification experiments were performed on the hyperspectral image of Bohai Bay in 2008 and the multispectral image of Bohai Bay in 2020. The experimental results show that compared with the algorithm with fewer layers of deep learning network, the method proposed in this paper utilizes the idea of residual network to deepen the number of network layers and carries out multilevel feature fusion through FPN, PAN, and SPP modules, which effectively solves the problem of insufficient deep feature extraction and obtains better classification performance.  © 2021 Yanling Han et al.","Classification (of information); Disasters; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Network layers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Bohai Bay; Bohai Sea; Classification methods; Economic development; Features fusions; Ice disaster; Images classification; Multilevels; Remote-sensing; Sea ice classification; Learning systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116670023"

These blooms have a range of fates including physical advection, downward carbon export, or grazing. Here, we determine the magnitude, timing and spatial trends of the biogeochemical (export) and ecological (foodwebs) fates of phytoplankton, based on seven BGC-Argo floats spanning three years across the SIZ. We calculate loss terms using the production of chlorophyll—based on nitrate depletion—compared with measured chlorophyll. Export losses are estimated using conspicuous chlorophyll pulses at depth. By subtracting export losses, we calculate grazing-mediated losses. Herbivory accounts for ~90% of the annually-averaged losses (169 mg C m−2 d−1), and phytodetritus POC export comprises ~10%. Furthermore, export and grazing losses each exhibit distinctive seasonality captured by all floats spanning 60°S to 69°S. These similar trends reveal widespread patterns in phytoplankton fate throughout the Southern Ocean SIZ. © 2020, The Author(s).","Algorithms; Chlorophyll; Datasets as Topic; Ecological Parameter Monitoring; Eutrophication; Food Chain; Herbivory; Ice Cover; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Seawater; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Southern Ocean; chlorophyll; chlorophyll; sea water; open water; particulate organic matter; phytodetritus; phytoplankton; sea ice; seasonality; algal bloom; Article; biogeochemical cycling; biogeochemistry; biomass production; body surface; chemical reaction kinetics; controlled study; eutrophication; marine environment; nonhuman; particulate matter; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; prevalence; sea ice; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Southern Ocean; algorithm; devices; ecosystem monitoring; food chain; herbivory; ice cover; information processing; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; phytoplankton; procedures; remote sensing; sea; season; spatiotemporal analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086659929"

We used genetic mark-recapture-recovery to derive estimates of abundance and survival for the Baffin Bay (BB) polar bear subpopulation — the first time this method has been used successfully for this species. Genetic data from tissue samples we collected via biopsy darting were combined with historical physical capture and harvest recovery data. The combined data set consisted of 1410 genetic samples (2011–2013), 914 physical captures (1993–1995, 1997), and 234 harvest returns of marked bears (1993–2013). The estimate of mean subpopulation abundance was 2826 (95% CI = 2284–3367) in 2012–2013. Estimates of annual survival (mean ± SE) were 0.90 ± 0.05 and 0.78 ± 0.06 for females and males age ≥2 yr, respectively. The proportion of total mortality of adult females and males that was attributed to legal harvest was 0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.26 ± 0.06, respectively. Remote sensing sea-ice data, telemetry data, and spatial distribution of onshore sampling indicated that polar bears were more likely to use offshore sea-ice habitat during the 1990s sampling period compared to the 2010s. Furthermore, in the 1990s, sampling of deep fjords and inland areas was limited, and no offshore sampling occurred in either time period, which precluded comparisons of abundance between the 1993–1997 and 2011–2013 study periods. Our findings demonstrate that genetic sampling can be a practical method for demographic assessment of polar bears over large spatial and temporal scales. © The authors 2021.

It brings new means, new ideas and new perspectives to scientists for Earth science studies. The development of space Earth science will promote the development of a series of disciplines including aerospace technology, remote sensing science, Earth system science, meteorology, hydrology, ecology etc. It is an important cornerstone for the cooperation to jointly build a community of common destiny for all mankind. This article mainly reviews the development of space Earth science, and discusses the role of space observation in the study of key subsystems (e.g., water cycle) of the Earth system. It also looks forward to the future development of space Earth science in China. Space Earth science has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate the Earth as a system, expanding the research of Earth science from local to the global dimensions, from static to dynamic queues, and will continue to expand our knowledge about how the Earth has changed. The current space Earth sciences are showing some new development trends, such as (1) paying more attention to the key cyclic processes in the Earth system, and (2) Combining of satellite remote sensing and Earth system model. Taking the observation of Earth's water cycle from space as an example, the key elements and process variables related to the global water cycle include precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, soil moisture, sea temperature and salinity, surface-water bodies, glaciers, snow, frozen soil, sea ice, polar ice caps and ice sheets, atmospheric water vapor, and groundwater etc. Satellite remote sensing has the unique advantage to provide information on the water status, migration, exchange, and phase change processes, which are essential information involved in the global climate change. At present, meteorological, oceanic and Earth observation satellites that have been launched internationally and have been able to measure many water cycle elements in the atmosphere, ocean, and land. These space observation data have greatly enhanced scientists' knowledge and understanding of the global water cycle process. The outlook for future space Earth observation in the field of water cycle is as follows. (1) Develop satellites for detecting surface state variables of water cycle, including the synthetic aperture microwave radiometer technology, active and passive integrated detection technology, to enable multi-element, high-accuracy, high-resolution simultaneous observation of key state variables such as soil moisture, soil freeze/thaw, snow properties and sea surface salinity, etc. (2) Develop satellites for estimating land-atmosphere water fluxes of water cycle (precipitation and evapotranspiration) by enhancing the atmospheric detection abilities to distinguish between rainfall and snowfall, and combining the thermal infrared and microwave measurements to improve the quantities and qualities of variables related to evapotranspiration. (3) Develop thematic satellites of the cryosphere (water in solid form), including the development of long-wavelength (such as P-band) and wide-band microwave radiometer for the measurement of ice density and temperature profile of ice sheets, the measurement of glacier thickness, and the observation of the thickness of permafrost active layer, etc., and the development of synthetic aperture radar interferometry and lidar for high-precision surveying of ice sheet surface elevation and ice volume. © 2021, Science Press.

We offer a practicable technique using available moderate resolution satellite data with a relatively long historical record to monitor changes to Hofsjökull and its surrounding. Our analysis reveals substantial shifts in snow, ice cover, and vegetation over the study period. Observed is a twenty-three percent decrease in the spatial extent of snow and ice between the two years. The ice front margin has receded along the entire periphery of the ice cap, with an average retreat of 743 m across a sample of transects. In a few cases, the retreat is more than one kilometer from the 1992 margin.

Observations of precipitation are sparse over Antarctica, due to harsh environmental conditions. Precipitation during the summer months (November-December-January) on four expeditions, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, in the Terra Nova Bay area, were monitored using a vertically pointing radar, disdrometer, snow gauge, radiosounding and an automatic weather station installed at the Italian Mario Zucchelli Station. The relationship between radar reflectivity and precipitation rate at the site can be estimated using these instruments jointly. The error in calculated precipitation is up to 40%, mostly dependent on reflectivity variability and disdrometer inability to define the real particle fall velocity. Mean derived summer precipitation is ~55 mm water equivalent but with a large variability. During collocated measurements in 2018-19, corrected snow gauge amounts agree with those derived from the relationship, within the estimated errors.

We then estimate distance and duration of snowmobile travel potential between communities from 1985 through 2019. We find that snowmobile travel in Uummannaq Fjord has potentially become slower and more unpredictable in recent years (2014–2019) relative to thirty years prior (1985–2000), with greater changes for communities located more proximal to the shorefast ice edge. Our results also suggest that reductions in on-ice snow cover impede snowmobile travel more than fractures do. Overall, our analysis demonstrates how remote sensing and transportation modeling may be used to quantify the community-scale impacts of changing shorefast ice conditions and has potential to help manage localized climate-related risk. © 2021 The Author(s).

Imaging remote sensing systems, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), make possible monitoring of sea ice under almost any weather conditions and independent of the illumination conditions. Two main family of approaches have been widely used so far – area-based and feature-based. We evaluate their performance using texture properties of sea ice images which are physically related to the radar signal backscattering within a SAR resolution cell. Here we use the local entropy as indicator determined by gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method describing how often different compositions of pixel brightness values occur in an image. A total of 120 satellite SAR sea ice images acquired over different Arctic seas from Sentinel-1 were processed and analysed.

The results show that the averaged bias of PM SIC (PM SIC minus MODIS) is less than 6% in Arctic and ranges from -8% to 1 % in Antarctic, and the averaged root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 16% in the whole polar regions. Overall, the SSMIS/ASI product has better performance in Arctic, while the FY3/NT2 has lower bias and RMSE in Antarctic.

As the core algorithm of integrated monitoring networks, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is embedded to improve Arctic sea ice mapping algorithms. Since the LSTM is localized in time and space, it can make full use of streaming data characteristics. The sea ice–related parameters from satellite remote sensing raw data are used as the input of the LSTM, while streaming data from shipborne radar networks and/or buoy measurements are used as training datasets to enhance the accuracy and resolution of environmental streaming data from outputs of LSTM.

A-68 iceberg calved from the Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017 and is one of the largest icebergs observed by remote sensing on record. After the calving, there was only a modest decrease in the area (about 1%) in the first six months. It has been drifting along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and is expected to continue its path for more than a decade. It is important to track the huge A-68 iceberg to retrieve information on the physics of iceberg dynamics and for maritime security reasons.

In this study we present two machine learning algorithms, one (multi-layer neural network) for the retrieval of melt pond binary classification and another (multinomial logistic regression) for melt pond fraction using moderate resolution visible satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To minimize the impact of the anisotropic reflectance characteristics of sea ice and melt ponds, normalized MODIS band reflectance differences from top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) measured reflectances were used. The training samples for the machine learning were based on MODIS reflectances extracted for sea ice, melt ponds and open water classifications based on high resolution (~2 m) WorldView (WV) data. The accuracy assessment for melt pond binary classification and fraction is further evaluated against WV imagery, showing mean overall accuracy (85.5%), average mean difference (0.09), and mean RMSE (0.18). In addition to cross-validation with WV, retrieved melt pond data are validated against melt pond fractions from satellite and ship-based observations, showing average mean differences (MD), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.05, 0.12, and 0.41, respectively. We further investigate a case study of the spectral characteristics of melt ponds and ice during refreezing, and demonstrate an approach to mask out refrozen pixels by using yearly maps of melt onset and freeze-up data together with ice surface temperatures (IST). Finally, an example of monthly mean pan-Arctic melt pond binary classification and fraction are shown for July 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019.

The iceberg freeboard is a critical geometric parameter for measuring the thickness of an iceberg and then estimating its volume. This study developed a new, highly efficient shadow-height method to precisely measure the freeboard of various icebergs surrounded by sea ice using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager 15-m bi-temporal panchromatic image shadows at low-solar-elevation angles. We evaluated and validated shadow length precision according to bi-temporal measurements and comparison with the measurements from the unmanned aerial vehicle. We determined freeboard precision according to shadow length precision and solar elevation angle. In our case study area, 4832 available freeboard measuring points with shadow length precision better than 2 pixels covered 376 icebergs with sizes ranging from 0.002 to 0.7 km2 and with freeboard ranging from 2.3 to 83.4 m. At the solar elevation angles of 5.2◦, the freeboard precision of 64.1% data could reach 1 m and 86.9% could reach 2 m. Our proposed method effectively filled in the data gap of existing freeboard measurement methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Moreover, the H2020 'Operational Network of Individual Observation Nodes' (ONION) project analyzed and proposed an overall EU strategy and technical guidelines to develop and implement innovative Earth Observation concepts in the time frame 2021-2027. The top priority that was identified was the Maritime Weather Forecast, and in particular the Arctic sea ice monitoring use-case. Currently, those needs have been addressed with remote sensing satellites or in-situ instruments. However, in-situ instruments often sink or crash with ice blocks. Additionally, these instruments are isolated, making challenging its deployment and the data retrieval, using LEO satellite communications (e.g. Iridium, OrbComm). This also poses a problem in terms of modularity and flexibility, since sensors rely on proprietary communication systems. This work proposes a modular and cost-effective solution to this problem applying the paradigm of the Internet of Things to this context. Particularly, Long Range (LoRa) is one of the most frequently used and efficient technologies that also ensures long ranges.

The proposed modeling was carried out by the parallel processing of a modified JONSWAP directional spectrum function in a two-dimensional hybrid domain. As a novel approach, the scattering formulation has been modified in the form of a two-scale implementation, which is optimized by the product of cosine-power and Gamma probability distribution function (PDF). As a result, a composite model of CRPM under different sea state conditions, including wind speed and direction, has been made possible. Due to the high dynamics of CRPM under sea state conditions, the presence of high entropy samples in the form of random roughness fluctuations is inevitable. These highly textured areas not only reduce the ability to resolve fine details but also make the interpretation difficult from a remote sensing point of view. According to the importance of synthetic aperture radar in the observation of MIZ and analysis of scattering properties, the spectral distribution modeling of these roughness anomalies and their electromagnetic interactions, along with surface tension synthesis, are presented here. Meanwhile, several objective quality metrics under different sea state conditions have been derived. The results show that the sea state not only changes the spectral components, but also affects their contribution to the roughness fluctuations and texture compositions. In short, this is for the first time that the composite modeling of CRPM based on directional spectrum function under sea state conditions along with electromagnetic interactions investigation and its pertinent texture analysis has been done. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Distribution functions; Fractals; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Textures; Wind; Directional spectra; Electromagnetic interactions; Objective qualities; Scattering distributions; Scattering formulations; Spectral distribution; Statistical properties; Wind speed and directions; computer simulation; electromagnetic field; forward modeling; fractal analysis; marginal ice zone; marine technology; numerical model; probability; remote sensing; sea ice; surface tension; synthetic aperture radar; texture; two-dimensional modeling; wind direction; wind velocity; Synthetic aperture radar","Composite directional spectrum function; numerical modeling; roughness; sea state; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107211276"

Annual mean bias of Hamburger/ASI product is lower than the mean of the eight products, negative in winter and spring, and positively increasing in summer. Annual mean bias of NSIDC/NT(NASA Team), NOAA OI SIC and OSISAF products are negative and lower in summer and autumn. Large standard deviations in summer and autumn are mainly found along the Northeast Passage where ice cover is thin (marginal ice zone). There are large variations in standard deviation in the regions of the East Siberian, Laptev and Kara Seas; values increase from 3% in spring to 10%-15% in winter. Correlating the eight products with MODIS images at a resolution of 25 km, we found the lowest correlation coefficient (0.63) in the NOAA OI SIC product (0.25° resolution), while correlation coefficients for the two products from Bremen are highest (both 0.80). Bremen/BT has the lowest mean deviation (7.11%). Products derived using the ASI algorithm have higher mean bias; mean bias of the Bremen/ASI and Hamburger/ASI products are 14.38% and 14.99%, respectively, and deviations fluctuate greatly in summer and autumn. Standard deviation of Bremen/ASI products is 11.01%, and SD of Hamburger/ASI product is 12.16%.

Our understanding of snow thickness distributions on sea ice is severely limited by its vastness and numerous logistical difficulties. As such, we rarely collect enough in situ data from similar geographic locations to determine if and how the snow thickness distribution changes spatiotemporally. Geophysical changes in snow cover manifest as differences in dielectric properties, which are detectable in microwave emission and backscatter. Active microwave remote sensing offers improved spatial resolution when compared to passive microwave approaches. We apply our recently developed method that exploits the indirect thermodynamic control of the snow cover on near ice surface geophysical properties. The variance of C-band (5.3 GHz HH-polarization) microwave backscatter in winter (prior to melt) is assessed and is then used to estimate relative snow cover thickness and distribution. We assess the capability of our approach over landfast, first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and evaluate and compare our method against the Canadian Regional Ice Ocean Prediction system and AMSR2 passive microwave snow thickness estimates.

The Adaptive Canny method has shown to be efficient for the detection of edges of objects in SAR images, according to recent publications and conferences. These studies were only carried out for images that had approximately half of each backscatter, without considering that the dimension of the objects can affect the edge detection process. Here, we present the results of the efficiency of the Adaptive Canny method as the size of the object, from which it is intended to extract the contour, decreases. A systematic analysis of the behavior of the method has been performed with objects of variated dimensions, through a Monte Carlo type experiment with synthetic images, where the contours of the figures were extracted with the Adaptive Canny method and compared with the Ground Truth (GT).

Remote sensing monitoring of sea ice is crucial to understand the role of polar regions in the global climate system and global warming. Sea ice information is of great importance in ship transportation, weather forecasting, and global climate forecast. At present, passive microwave radiometers are the main means of monitoring sea ice concentration; however, because microwaves present wavelength limitations, conventional sea ice concentration products cannot be used in practical applications in small areas. Visible-light-infrared remote sensing can retrieve sea ice concentrations, and its advantages over other sensing methods include high spatial resolution. This work focuses on the development of a sea ice concentration algorithm suitable for medium-resolution images. Few medium-resolution sea ice concentration products based on visible-light remote sensing are available, and only NOAA has released relevant operational products. However, the accuracy of its algorithm for low-concentration sea ice inversion is low. This paper proposes an improved algorithm based on the existing algorithm to determine the ice node via the nearest-pixel method. MODIS data are used as a data source to calculate the sea ice concentration, and Landsat 8 OLI data with a spatial resolution of 30 m are used for comparative verification. Results show that the improved algorithm can improve the inversion accuracy of low-concentration sea ice. The Liu algorithm has the disadvantage of overestimation. In the case of sea ice concentrations of 0% - 50%, the average deviation of the Liu algorithm is 13%, and its standard deviation is 38%. By comparison, the average deviation of the improved algorithm is 5%, and its standard deviation is 32%. In the case of sea ice concentrations of 0% - 100%, the average deviation of the Liu algorithm is 4%, and its standard deviation is 32%. By comparison, the average deviation of the improved algorithm is -3%, and its standard deviation is 28%. In the case of sea ice concentrations of 0% -50%, the accuracy of the improved algorithm is better than that of the Liu algorithm. When the sea ice concentration is close to 100%, the results of the two algorithms are highly similar. Overall, the improvement effect of the proposed algorithm is related to the actual sea ice concentration, and the improved algorithm is more accurate than the Liu algorithm for low-concentration sea ice regions, such as ice-water transitions and broken ice coverage. © 2021, Science Press.

The associated perennial sea ice loss has economic and global security implications associated with Arctic Ocean navigability, since sea ice cover dictates whether an Arctic route is open to shipping. Thus, understanding changes in sea ice thickness, concentration and drift is essential for operation planning and routing. However, changes in sea ice cover on scales up to a few days and kilometers are challenging to detect and forecast; current sea ice models may not capture quickly-changing conditions on short timescales needed for navigation. Assimilating these predictive models requires frequent, high-resolution morphological information about the pack, which is operationally difficult. We suggest an approach to mitigate this challenge by using machine learning (ML) to interpret satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. In this study, we derive ML models for the analysis of SAR data to improve short-term local sea ice monitoring at high spatial resolutions, enabling more accurate analysis of Arctic navigability. We develop an algorithm/classifier that can analyze Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the potential to inform operational sea ice forecasting models. We focus on detecting two sea ice features of interest to Arctic navigability: ridges and leads (fractures in the ice shelf). These can be considered local extremes in terms of ice thickness, a crucial parameter for navigation. We build models to detect these ice features using machine learning techniques. Both our ridge and lead detection models perform as well as, if not better than, state-of-the- art methods. These models demonstrate Sentinel-1's ability to capture sea ice conditions, suggesting the potential for Sentinel-1 global coverage imagery to inform sea ice forecasting models.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Recognizing the location and number of dams is crucial for studying the impact of human activities on ecosystem change. Although many countries and organizations have established their own dam datasets, it is only the tip of the iceberg of real dam construction. Therefore, effectively and accurately obtaining the geographic location of dams is still a significant problem to be solved. This article proposes an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework to recognize global dams from high-resolution remotely sensed images. First, a dataset named the global dam detection dataset is built based on Google earth high-resolution images, and the dataset is used as the training and testing dataset for the CNN model. Second, an improved dam recognition method (HRLibra-RCNN) is proposed to detect dams on a global scale. Third, an application strategy for global dam recognition from large remote sensing images is established to recognize dams in seven regions around the world. Compared with two two-stage object recognition models (Faster-RCNN and Cascade-RCNN) and a single-stage target detection model (RetinaNet), the proposed method achieved the highest average precision of 79.4%, with the HRNet-40w backbone network structures achieving the highest average precision of 80.7%. The average precision of 70.8% and recall of 90.4% are achieved during the application stage. The dataset and framework developed in this study are the first attempts to combine remote sensing big data and the deep learning method to recognize dams at a global scale.  © 2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Dams; Deep learning; Flood control; Image enhancement; Large dataset; Learning systems; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Stages; Statistical tests; Application strategies; Ecosystem changes; Geographic location; High resolution image; High resolution remotely sensed images; Recognition methods; Remote sensing images; Training and testing; artificial neural network; dam; image classification; image resolution; machine learning; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Convolutional neural networks","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); dams; deep learning; Google earth; object recognition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112091411"

MERIS data together with the data of recently launched successor OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) on board Sentinel 3A and 3B (2016 onwards) can be used to assess the long-term change of the Arctic summer sea ice. An important prerequisite to a high-quality remote sensing dataset is an accurate separation of cloudy and clear pixels to ensure lowest cloud contamination of the resulting product. The presence of 15 visible and near-infrared spectral channels of MERIS allows high-quality retrievals of sea ice albedo and melt pond fraction, but it makes cloud screening a challenge as snow, sea ice and clouds have similar optical features in the available spectral range of 412.5-900  In this paper, we present a new cloud screening method MECOSI (MERIS Cloud Screening Over Sea Ice) for the retrievals of spectral albedo and melt pond fraction (MPF) from MERIS. The method utilizes all 15 MERIS channels, including the oxygen A absorption band. For the latter, a effect correction has been developed to ensure high-quality screening throughout the whole swath. A total of 3 years of reference cloud mask from AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) (Istomina et al., 2010) have been used to train the Bayesian cloud screening forthe available limited MERIS spectral range. Whiteness and brightness criteria as well as normalizeddifference thresholds have been used as well. The comparison of the developed cloud mask to the operational AATSR and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) cloud masks shows a considerable improvement in the detection of clouds over snow and sea ice, with about 10 % false clear detections during May-July and less than 5 % false clear detections in the restof the melting season. This seasonal behavior is expected as the sea ice surface is generally brighter and more challenging for cloud detection in the beginning of the melting season. The effect of the improved cloud screening on the MPF-albedo datasets is demonstrated on both temporal and spatial scales. In the absence of cloud contamination, the time sequence of MPFs displays a greater range of values throughout the whole summer. The daily maps of the MPF now show spatially uniform values without cloud artifacts, which were clearly visible in the previous version of the dataset.The developed cloud screening routine can be applied to address cloud contamination in remote sensing data over sea ice.

A sensitivity analysis of the mixed layer depth criteria that affects the predicted sea ice formation/ablation has been carried out to tune the model. Sea ice concentration from AMSR2 OSISAF, sea ice edge from SSMIS/ASCAT OSISAF, and sea surface temperature from OISST AVHRR-only products were then assimilated into the tuned model using a combined optimal interpolation method. Extending previous studies, which used a constant drag formulation in their assimilation schemes, we use a variable drag formulation to represent the friction associated with effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice–atmosphere and ice–ocean interfaces. The variable drag coefficient is estimated from properties of the sea ice cover such as the ice concentration, the vertical extent and area of the ridges, the freeboard, the floe draft, the size of floes and melt ponds. The new features of the assimilated model include tracers to estimate ridged ice, level ice, melt ponds, freeboard, sail height and keel depth. The estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are then compared with the ice concentration product from the Canadian Ice Service. The results show that the updates provided to the tracers through the assimilation of sea ice products are reasonable and the model estimates of ice concentration from the assimilated models are better than the non-assimilated model estimates. Finally, the estimates of updated sea ice parameters such as ridged ice area, volume and ice thickness are compared with the estimates from non-assimilated models and the literature to verify the results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Hudson Bay; Labrador Sea; Drag; Lakes; Oceanography; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Surface roughness; Tracers; Canadian Ice Services; Ice concentration; Ice surface roughness; Mixed layer depths; Optimal interpolation; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice formations; Sea surface temperature (SST); estimation method; ice; ice-ocean interaction; numerical model; remote sensing; sea ice; Parameter estimation","Data assimilation; Ice concentration; Ice edge; Remote sensing; Sea ice modelling; Variable drag","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098622919"

Sea ice thickness is one of the most important sea ice parameters. Accurately obtaining the sea ice thickness and its changes has great significance to Arctic and global change research. Satellite altimeters can be used to derive long-term and large-scale changes in sea ice thickness. The leads detection is vital in sea ice thickness estimation by using satellite altimetry. Different leads detection methods are compared with remote sensing images, and results show that the detection method that uses waveform parameters can obtain improved results. The model for the conversion of freeboard to thickness is optimized by considering the incomplete penetration of snow for radar altimeters. We derive the estimates of the Arctic sea ice thickness for November 2010 to December 2019 by using the CryoSat-2 altimetry data. The sea ice thickness from the IceBridge and draft data from the upward-looking sonar are used to validate our thickness results. Validations show that the accuracy of our thickness estimates is within 0.2 m. Variations in the Arctic sea ice thickness are analyzed using the PIOMAS model and air and sea surface temperatures.

In spite of the outstanding spatial resolution and precision of ICESat-2, the spatial sparsity of the data can be a critical issue for sea ice monitoring. This study employs a geostatistical approach (i.e., ordinary kriging) to characterize the spatial autocorrelation of the ICESat-2 freeboard measurements (ATL10) to estimate weekly freeboard variations in 2019 for the entire Ross Sea area, including where ICESat-2 tracks are not directly available. Three variogram models (exponential, Gaussian, and spherical) are compared in this study. According to the cross-validation results, the kriging-estimated freeboards show correlation coefficients of 0.56–0.57, root mean square error (RMSE) of ~0.12 m, and mean absolute error (MAE) of ~0.07 m with the actual ATL10 freeboard measurements. In addition, the estimated errors of the kriging interpolation are low in autumn and high in winter to spring, and low in southern regions and high in northern regions of the Ross Sea. The effective ranges of the variograms are 5–10 km and the results from the three variogram models do not show significant differences with each other. The southwest (SW) sector of the Ross Sea shows low and consistent freeboard over the entire year because of the frequent opening of wide polynya areas generating new ice in this sector. However, the southeast (SE) sector shows large variations in freeboard, which demonstrates the advection of thick multiyear ice from the Amundsen Sea into the Ross Sea. Thus, this kriging-based interpolation of ICESat-2 freeboard can be used in the future to estimate accurate sea ice production over the Ross Sea by incorporating other remote sensing data. © 2021 by the authors.

Compared with the traditional remote sensing which only views the ground surface in one direction, multi-angle remote sensing provides angle-dimensional information and improves the capability of obtaining vegetation structure parameters. It helps to improve the retrieval accuracy of key biophysical parameters and provides better data support for the research of ecological environment and climate change. After a detailed analysis of the publications in multi-angle remote sensing, we summarize the basic concepts, characteristics, advantages and developments of multi-angle remote sensing. Multi-angle remote sensing platforms vary from ground-based, airborne to spaceborne observation equipment. The first ground-based observation equipment appeared in 1952. All the ground-based equipment is classified as the fixed field of view mode or the changeable field of view mode. For the airborne or spaceborne platforms, only the fixed field of view mode is acceptable due to the heterogeneity of the land surfaces. With the development of UAV technique, the airborne multi-angle remote sensing is becoming more and more popular due to its flexibility and high spatial resolution. The multi-angle models play important roles in parameters inversion. Classic multi-angle remote sensing models include radiative transfer models, geometric optical models, hybrid models, and computer simulation models. They are all physical models which are developed based on some assumptions and theoretical analysis. Semi-empirical models combine the advantages of the empirical model and the physical model, as a result, they are simple and stable in inversion. The most widely used semi-empirical model is the linear kernel driven model used by the operational MODIS BRDF/albedo products algorithm. With the development of observing equipment and models, multi-angle remote sensing is widely used in many applications. Due to the anisotropic reflection characteristic, land surface albedo can only be retrieved by multi-angle remote sensing with high accuracy. Multi-angle remote sensing shows great potentials in vegetation structural parameters inversion which include the clumping index, LAI, FVC profile and canopy height. It has been found to be superior in vegetation type identification than the traditional vertical observation. Multi-angle remote sensing is also very useful in the cloud and aerosol parameters retrieval, such as the cloud albedo, height and types, as well as the aerosol optical depth and shapes. Large difference of optical scattering between the cloud and ice/snow in different viewing directions makes the identification of these covers easier with multi-angle remote sensing. The sea ice roughness can also be retrieved by multi-angle observations. In the last of this paper, we put forward the prospects of multi-angle optical quantitative remote sensing. As the multi-angle remote sensing observation data based on spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms become more and more abundant, the main research direction of multi-angle remote sensing in the future should focus on the following aspects: developing multi-angle reflection/radiation models for complex surfaces, enhancing the preprocessing capabilities of multi-angle remote sensing data, and promoting the comprehensive abilities of multi-source data integration in application, etc. © 2021, Science Press.

The influence of air temperature (T air) and surface wind on the sea ice concentration (SIC) and the navigability of routes is determined. It is found that the annually averaged SICs of the different routes have decreased over the past 41 years. The fastest rate of decrease occurred in the Kara Sea (∼−1% per year), while the slowest rates of decrease occurred in the Laptev/East Siberian Sea (∼−0.42% per year). The number of navigable days for the Kara Sea has become ∼1–2 months longer than the Laptev/East Siberian Sea route as a result. The effect of T air on SIC, quantified by ΔSIC/ΔT air in the routes through the eastern Kara Sea and Laptev/East Siberian Sea in 2010s was ∼−0.04/°C, two to three times that seen during the 1980s. Air temperature is becoming a significant driving force of melting ice in these routes. Surface winds are also a crucial factor for the navigability of the Vilkitsky Strait and Long Strait, as they drive ice drift, and affect the navigability of the Kara Strait by introducing warm air. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arctic Ocean; East Siberian Sea; Kara Sea; Laptev Sea; Atmospheric temperature; Digital storage; Sea ice; Air temperature; Driving forces; Long strait; Melting ice; Remote sensing data; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice conditions; Surface winds; air temperature; melting; navigation; remote sensing; sea ice; surface wind; Remote sensing","air temperature; Arctic navigation; Northeast Passage; Sea ice concentration; surface wind","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105139932"

The current literature investigating this relationship is primarily based on remote sensing, which often lacks data for half of the year or more. One prominent hypothesis holds that, following ice retreat in spring, buoyant meltwaters enhance available irradiance, triggering a bloom which follows the ice edge. However, an analysis of Biogeochemical Argo (BGC-Argo) data sampling under Antarctic sea ice suggests that this is not necessarily the case. Rather than precipitating rapid accumulation, we show that meltwaters enhance growth in an already highly active phytoplankton population. Blooms observed in the wake of the receding ice edge can then be understood as the emergence of a growth process that started earlier under sea ice. Indeed, we estimate that growth initiation occurs, on average, 4-5 weeks before ice retreat, typically starting in August and September. Novel techniques using on-board data to detect the timing of ice melt were used. Furthermore, such growth is shown to occur under conditions of substantial ice cover (> 90 % satellite ice concentration) and deep mixed layers (> 100 m), conditions previously thought to be inimical to growth. This led to the development of several box model experiments (with varying vertical depth) in which we sought to investigate the mechanisms responsible for such early growth. The results of these experiments suggest that a combination of higher light transfer (penetration) through sea ice cover and extreme low light adaptation by phytoplankton can account for the observed phenology. © Author(s) 2021.

However, the practical use of this model is difficult because it requires a large amount of information as inputs. To resolve this issue, two different approaches have been developed to retrieve the Arctic basin-scale refractive index from satellite passive microwave measurements using the bulk radiative transfer concept. One is the simplified three-layer sea ice radiative transfer (3SRT) approach and the other is the Brewster’s angle approximation (BAA) approach. Although these methods are different, both find polarized emissivities for the microwave emitting layer of sea ice to estimate the refractive index using a relationship between polarized emissivities and the refractive index. A typographical erroneous version of the equation for this relationship has been used in numerous studies without noting the errors. This study provides the correct equations for the relationship. The refractive index obtained using the 3SRT method is within a reasonable range of 1.2–1.8. However, the refractive index obtained using the BAA approach shows too high values ranging from 1.2 to 3.2. The sensitivity of the approaches to variation in the emissivity is analysed. The BAA method is sensitive to the surface emissivity because of the assumptions considered. The refractive index of sea ice obtained from the 3SRT approach is compared with that obtained from the Debye relaxation model. The results show that a plausible refractive index over Arctic sea ice can be estimated from satellite passive microwave measurements using the 3SRT method. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arctic Ocean; Electromagnetic wave emission; Microwaves; Radiative transfer; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Approximation approach; Arctic sea ice; Debye relaxation; Large amounts; Passive microwave measurements; Passive microwaves; Polarized emissivity; Practical use; Relaxation models; Satellite passive microwave; algorithm; comparative study; radiative transfer; refractive index; remote sensing; sea ice; Refractive index","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117075615"

The ice classification algorithm is developed based on the threshold values of an advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) and advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 (here, AMSR2). These values are calculated via the features of various ice types, including open ice, first-year (FY) ice, multi-year (MY) ice, MY ice including icebergs (MY IB), ice shelves, coastal ice sheets, and inland ice sheets. To verify the validity of the ice classification algorithm, the algorithm results are compared with visual observation data and satellite imagery. Except for the flaw polynya and area with surface melting, the FY ice, MY ice, and the ice shelf areas estimated here using the proposed ice classification algorithm match those discernible from the verification data. Inter-annual changes in the areal extents of FY ice, MY ice, and the ice shelves are investigated here using the proposed ice classification algorithm. Investigation of MY ice and ice shelf areas revealed that the breakup of MY ice induced a breakup of an ice shelf. A comparison of the FY ice and MY ice areas showed the replacement of these ice types. The proposed ice classification algorithm can detect ice breakup events as quantitative changes in the distribution and ice type. In future work, we plan to classify sea ice in other sea ice areas, applying the proposed algorithm throughout the Antarctic region. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we examined the geomorphological dynamics of a beach located at Edmonson Point (74◦ S) not far from the Italian Antarctic Station “Mario Zucchelli” between 1993 and 2019 using different remote sensing techniques and field measurements. Our data demonstrate that the average rate of surficial increase of the beach (0.002 ± 0.032 m yr−1) was slightly higher than the uplift rate determined by previous authors (0–1 cm yr−1) in case of pure isostatic rebound. However, we suggest that the evolution of EPNB is likely due to the couple effect of vertical uplift and high wave-energy events. Indeed, the coastline accumulation could be related to the subsurface sea water infiltration and annually freezing at the permafrost table interface as aggradational ice as suggested by the ERT carried out in 1996. This ERT suggests the occurrence of saline frozen permafrost or hypersaline brines under the sea level while permafrost with ice occurred above the sea level. The beach also revealed areas that had quite high subsidence values (between 0.08 and 0.011 m yr−1) located in the area where ice content was higher in 1996 and where the active layer thickening and wind erosion could explain the measured erosion rates. Here, we also dated at the late morning of 15 February 2019 coastal flooding and defined a significant wave height of 1.95 m. During the high oceanic wave event the sea level increased advancing shoreward up to 360 m, three times higher than the previous reported storm surge (81 m) and with a sea level rise almost five times higher than has been previously recorded in the Ross Sea. © 2021 by the authors.

Two NASA-sponsored deployments of the Saildrone vehicle provided a unique opportunity for validating sea-surface salinity (SSS) derived from three separate products that use data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite. To examine possible issues in resolving mesoscale-to-submesoscale variability, comparisons were also made with two versions of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) model (Carroll, D; Menmenlis, D; Zhang, H.). The results indicate that the three SMAP products resolve the runoff signal associated with the Yukon River, with high correlation between SMAP products and Saildrone SSS. Spectral slopes, overall, replicate the-2.0 slopes associated with mesoscale-submesoscale variability. Statistically significant spatial coherences exist for all products, with peaks close to 100 km.

In the summer of 2018, the ice conditions were observed and recorded by a video camera system installed on MV Tianyou during the Arctic cruise. And the ice concentration was obtained from the images. It is shown that the sea ices consist of broken ices and a few ice ridges as well as melting pools. The overall concentration is 17.8% in average with a maximum value of 80%.

Results suggest that using a combination of Sentinel-1 backscatter for FYI and MISR NDAI for MYI may be optimal for mapping winter sea-ice roughness in the CAA. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging capability is independent of weather conditions and is widely used in sea ice classification. U-Net, a deep learning framework, has achieved great success in the field of biomedical image classification. In this study, we construct a U-Net-based 'end-to-end' model to classify the sea ice and open water pixels in SAR imagery. Five SAR images acquired in the Gulf of Alaska near Bering Strait are used in this case study. We manually label the SAR images as ice and water. The labeled images from the first four SAR image are divided into chips to be fed into the U-Net model for training. The fifth SAR image is employed as the testing data. Experiments show that the precision and the recall of the testing image is 91.64% and 91.70%, respectively. Most of the sea ice, including small chunks and sinuous ice edges, can be successfully classified. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep learning; Geology; Image classification; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Bering strait; Gulf of Alaska; Imaging capabilities; Labeled images; Learning frameworks; Learning models; Robust classification; Sea ice classification; Radar imaging","classification; deep learning; SAR image; sea ice; U-Net","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101984025"

Being moored to ice floes at high Arctic for a whole year, thus including the winter season, the main goal of the expedition is to better understand and quantify relevant processes within the atmosphere-ice-ocean system that impact the sea ice, ultimately leading to improved climate models. Satellite remote sensing, specially multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a major role to achieve this goal. Two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. A comprehensive set of C- and L- band SAR images were acquired during the course of MOSAiC. In this initial study we evaluate the effects of seasonal changes on C- and L-band backscatter in respect to three different sea ice types, i.e., Young Ice, Smooth Ice and Rough/Deformed Ice along with the performance of sea ice type retrieval of a established algorithm. Areas of deformed, smooth and young sea ice were observed in the vicinity of R/V Polarstern and these areas are included whenever possible in the yearlong time series. For both frequencies a change in all backscatter channels values can be observed during the early melt season. This is first noticeable in the C-band images and later followed by a change in the L-band images, probably caused by their different penetration depth and volume scattering sensitivities. © 2021 IEEE.","","ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; MOSAiC; Polarimetry; RADARSAT-2; SAR; Sea Ice type","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126014196"

'CoastWatch') aims to improve decision outcomes by facilitating the use of ocean satellite data in applications and research for understanding, managing and protecting ocean, coastal and inland water resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, human health, weather, and climate. Earth observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and repeating temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements.. CoastWatch satellite data products are free and open (publicly available without the need for registration), and include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (e.g. chlorophyll), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. CoastWatch also distributes outputs from environmental models which incorporate several of these basic physical parameters to derive more complex information. These products cover multiple spatial regions (global and regional coverage) and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves, and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and other environmental satellite missions. CoastWatch is well positioned to link upstream ocean satellite data producers with downstream user needs for real life applications. Our central 'hub' is colocated with the ocean satellite data scientists in College Park, MD and our 'spokes' are our seven regional Nodes distributed geographically around the country and across NOAA mission line offices. Our Gulf of Mexico Node is co-located with the NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, in the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (NOAA/OAR/AOML) in Miami, FL. Our Central Pacific Ocean Watch Node is co-located with the National Marine Fisheries Service at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC). CoastWatch operates 1) interactive and interoperable data portals to facilitate search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading; 2) a central helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc.; 3) routine data quality and availability services that enable the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets; 4) in-person training courses along with evolving online tutorial and virtual training opportunities. CoastWatch Utilities is a software package that helps users analyze and visualize satellite data products on their own. Coastwatch also collaborates directly with users to provide satellite data expertise in the development of applications that solve user-specific problems. Some examples and short demonstrations of data products, discovery and access pathways, tutorials and several user applications will be presented with an emphasis on our Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and our Central Pacific products, services and application tools.

Three metrics were utilized: (1) the global long-term (30 years) mean for 1988–2017, (2) the local accuracy evaluation based on comparison with observations recorded at buoys located at 11 global oceanic points with varying climatological characteristics, and (3) the physical consistency with the freshwater balance related to the global water cycle. The globally averaged value of the surface net heat flux of J-OFURO3 was −22.2 W m−2, which is largely imbalanced to heat the ocean surface. This imbalance was due to the turbulent heat flux being smaller than the net downward surface radiation. On the other hand, compared with the local buoy observations, the average difference was −5.8 W m−2, indicating good agreement. These results indicate a paradox of the global surface net heat flux. In relation to the global water cycle, the balance between surface latent heat flux (ocean evaporation) and precipitation was estimated to be almost 0 when river runoff from the land was taken into consideration. The reliability of the estimation of the latent heat flux was reconciled by two different methods. Systematic ocean-heating biases by surface sensible heat flux (SHF) and long wave radiation were identified. The bias in the SHF was globally persistent and especially large in the mid- and high latitudes. The correction of the bias has an impact on improving the global mean net heat flux by +5.5 W m−2. Furthermore, since J-OFURO3 SHF has low data coverage in high-latitudes areas containing sea ice, its impact on global net heat flux was assessed using the latest atmospheric reanalysis product. When including the sea ice region, the globally averaged value of SHF was approximately 1.4 times larger. In addition to the bias correction mentioned above, when assuming that the global ocean average of J3 SHF is 1.4 times larger, the net heat flux value changes to the improved value (−11.3 W m−2), which is approximately half the original value (−22.2 W m−2). © Copyright © 2021 Tomita, Kutsuwada, Kubota and Hihara.","","air-sea heat flux; air-sea interaction; buoy; J-OFURO; satellite-remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101267050"

However, comprehensive observations of the regional and temporal variability of the eddy field characteristics are difficult to obtain remotely due to the presence of sea ice, and the available in situ observations remain relatively sparse. Nonetheless, with continuing global warming, increasingly large areas of the Arctic Ocean become seasonally ice-free and can be observed with remote sensing. Here, we use satellite altimetry data acquired between 1993 and 2018 over the seasonally ice-free Western Arctic Ocean to detect the signatures and hot spots of large mesoscale eddies, validating their detection method using independent optical and infrared satellite observations. The altimetry measurements were most frequent from July to October, revealing signatures of over 2000 individual eddies that were roughly equally partitioned between cyclones and anticyclones, with radii between 20 and 60 km and characteristic orbital velocities of about 0.05–0.4 m/s. A maximum number of eddies were detected in October in the Beaufort Sea and in November in the Chukchi Sea. The interannual variability of eddies in the Beaufort Sea is correlated with variations of intensity and freshwater content in the Beaufort Gyre. Using the regional eddy statistics, we discuss the potential eddy formation mechanisms over the key regions of their observations in the Amundsen Gulf, the area adjacent to the Mackenzie River mouth, the western part of the Beaufort Sea, and the Chukchi Sea. © 2021.

Yet, little is known about the biogeochemical processes in the Arctic fjords. We measured the nutrients and the optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in both seawater and sediment pore water, along with the remote sensing data of the ocean surface, from three West Svalbard fjords. A cross-fjord comparison of fluorescence fingerprints together with downcore trends of salinity, Cl−, and PO43− revealed higher impact of terrestrial inputs (fluorescence index: ~1.2–1.5 in seawaters) and glaciofluvial runoffs (salinity: ~31.4 ± 2.4 psu in pore waters) to the southern fjord of Hornsund as compared to the northern fjords of Isfjorden and Van Mijenfjorden, tallying with heavier annual runoff to the southern fjord of Hornsund. Extremely high levels of protein-like fluorescence (up to ~4.5 RU) were observed at the partially sea ice-covered fjords in summer, in line with near-ubiquity ice-edge blooms observed in the Arctic. The results reflect an ongoing or post-phytoplankton bloom, which is also supported by the higher levels of chlorophyll a fluorescence at the ocean surface, the very high apparent oxygen utilization through the water column, and the nutrient drawdown at the ocean surface. Meanwhile, a characteristic elongated fluorescence fingerprint was observed in the fjords, presumably produced by ice-edge blooms in the Arctic ecosystems. Furthermore, alkalinity and the humic-like peaks showed a general downcore accumulation trend, which implies the production of humic-like DOM via a biological pathway also in the glaciomarine sediments from the Arctic fjords. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the magnitude, timing, and distribution of this freshwater have been challenging to quantify due to minimal direct observations of subsurface iceberg geometry and melt rates. Here we present novel in situ methods capturing iceberg change at high-temporal and -spatial resolution using four high-precision GPS units deployed on two large icebergs (>500 m length). In combination with measurements of surface and subsurface geometry, we calculate iceberg melt rates between 0.10 and 0.27 m/d over the 9-day survey. These melt rates are lower than those proposed in previous studies, likely due to using individual subsurface iceberg geometries in calculations. In combining these new measurements of iceberg geometry and melt rate with the broad spatial coverage of remote sensing, we can better predict the impact of increasing freshwater injection from the Greenland Ice Sheet. © 2021.

The space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer from Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. is China's first commercial GNSS-R instrument. On July 3, 2021, this payload was equipped on the Jilin-1 wide-range 01B satellite (J1-01B) developed by Changguang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. and entered the polar orbit with the height about 500km from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.The attitude of J1-01B is stable to the ground within 0.1 degrees, which can guarantee the high accuracy of GNSS-R antenna gain model on the detection of sea surface wind speed and direction, soil moisture and etc. Meanwhile, its orbital characteristics ensure that its trajectory can cover the north and south poles of the earth, providing opportunities for researches on sea-ice detection and sea-ice thickness retrieval. The payload supports the mutual switching between dual system (GPS L1 or BDS B1) signal mode and dual working mode (generate the doppler delay maps (DDM) in manual-adjustable resolution on the satellite, or collect intermediate frequency (IF) data with 58Mb/s rate), which guarantees the verification and continuous development of multi-system compatibility, data quality analysis and application scenario expansion.After two weeks of satellite's launch, the satellite has entered normal working mode. In two periods from 6:0 to 6:15 and from 7:32 to 7:42 on July 16, 2021, GNSS-R data were collected in DDMs as well as IFs formats, when J1-01B was over the Pacific Ocean.

These bromine explosions comprise photochemical heterogeneous chain reactions that release bromine molecules, Br2, to the troposphere and lead to tropospheric plumes of bromine monoxide, BrO. This autocatalytic mechanism depletes ozone, O3, in the boundary layer and troposphere and thereby changes the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. The phenomenon also leads to accelerated deposition of metals (e.g., Hg). In this study, we present a 22-year (1996 to 2017) consolidated and consistent tropospheric BrO dataset north of 70° N, derived from four different ultraviolet visible (UV VIS) satellite instruments (GOME, SCIAMACHY, GOME-2A and GOME-2B). The retrieval data products from the different sensors are compared during periods of overlap and show good agreement (correlations of 0.82 0.98 between the sensors). From our merged time series of tropospheric BrO vertical column densities (VCDs), we infer changes in the bromine explosions and thus an increase in the extent and magnitude of tropospheric BrO plumes during the period of Arctic warming. We determined an increasing trend of about 1.5 % of the tropospheric BrO VCDs per year during polar springs, while the size of the areas where enhanced tropospheric BrO VCDs can be found has increased about 896 km2 yr-1. We infer from comparisons and correlations with sea ice age data that the reported changes in the extent and magnitude of tropospheric BrO VCDs are moderately related to the increase in first-year ice extent in the Arctic north of 70° N, both temporally and spatially, with a correlation coefficient of 0.32. However, the BrO plumes and thus bromine explosions show significant variability, which also depends, apart from sea ice, on meteorological conditions.  © 2020 Author(s).","Arctic; bromine; data set; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatiotemporal analysis; troposphere; ultraviolet radiation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094908123"

The years with the lowest summertime sea ice minimum were found to be accompanied by the latest freeze-up onset on record. Here, a synthetic approach is taken to examine the connections between sea ice melt timing and summer sea ice evolution from the remote sensing perspective. A 40-year (1979–2018) satellite-based time-series analysis shows that the date of autumn sea ice freeze-up is significantly correlated with the sea ice extent in early summer (r = −0.90, p < 0.01), while the spring melt onset is not a promising predictor of summer sea ice evolution. The delay in Arctic sea ice freeze-up (0.61 days year−1) in the Arctic was accompanied by a decline in surface albedo (absolute change of −0.13% year−1), an increase in net short-wave radiation (0.21 W m−2 year−1), and an increase in skin temperature (0.08 °C year−1) in summer. Sea ice loss would be the key reason for the delay in autumn freeze-up, especially in the Laptev, East-Siberian, Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, where sea ice has significantly declined throughout the summer, and strong correlations were found between the freeze-up onset and the solar radiation budget since early summer. This study highlights a connection between the summer sea ice melting and the autumn refreezing process through the ice-albedo feedback based on multisource satellite-based observations. © 2021 by the author.

Profiles frequently show a depression a few meters deep about 200–800 m upstream of the front, with higher values on the eastern portion of the ice shelf. This structure results from bending due to buoyancy of a submerged ice bench generated by ice-front melting near the waterline when warm water is present in summer. These bending stresses may cause small-scale calving events whose frequency would change as summer sea ice and atmosphere–ocean heat exchanges vary over time. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

These products are further compared against various ground-truth observations, including those from ice mass balance observations and airborne measurements. Large mean snow depth discrepancies are observed over the Atlantic and Canadian Arctic sectors. The differences between climatology and the snow products early in winter could be in part a result of the delaying in Arctic ice formation that reduces early snow accumulation, leading to shallower snowpacks at the start of the freeze-up season. These differences persist through spring despite overall more winter snow accumulation in the reanalysis-based products than in the climatologies. Among the products evaluated, the University of Washington (UW) snow depth product produces the deepest spring (March-April) snowpacks, while the snow product from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) provides the shallowest spring snow depths. Most snow products show significant correlation with snow depths retrieved from Operational IceBridge (OIB) while correlations are quite low against buoy measurements, with no correlation and very low variability from University of Bremen and DMI products. Inconsistencies in reconstructed snow depth among the products, as well as differences between these products and in situ and airborne observations, can be partially attributed to differences in effective footprint and spatial-temporal coverage, as well as insufficient observations for validation/bias adjustments. Our results highlight the need for more targeted Arctic surveys over different spatial and temporal scales to allow for a more systematic comparison and fusion of airborne, in situ and remote sensing observations. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

However, many ships discard the waste directly into the ocean. Shipment of iron ore powder scattered on the surface of sea ice will pollute the sea ice and accelerate the melting of it, causing pollution to the marine environment. The research on the spectral reflectance of sea ice contaminated by iron ore powder can provide data basis for sea ice quality monitoring using optical remote sensing images. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference and basis for the estimation of the range of iron powder pollution by measuring on-site spectral differences between sea ice and that covered iron ore powder particles with different area proportions. The experiment was conducted on natural sea ice in the Bohai Sea. The spectral characteristics of sea ice with iron ore powder were obtained and analyzed, and the correlation between these spectral characteristics and the area fraction of iron ore powder particles was discussed. In order to retrieve the fraction of the area of iron ore powder on the surface of sea ice, the end-member extraction of sea ice and iron ore powder was performed using the spectral vector angle cosine value (Acos) and the spectral absorption index (SAI) threshold. Based on the linear spectral unmixing theory, a feature-based inversion model of iron powder fraction on the surface of sea ice was proposed. The proportion of iron ore powder on the surface of sea ice in this paper is 0 (clean sea ice), 25.8%, 37.2%, 46.1%, 52.1%, 65.1%, 72.5%, 82.3%, 92.3%, 93.1%, and 100% (Pure iron ore powder), etc., the data collection wavelength range is 350~2 500 nm. The results show that the absorption index at 1 460 nm band is the best for extraction of sea ice and iron ore powder. The reflectance in the range of 918~1 400, 1 500~1 780 and 2 250~2 300 nm have a great correlation with the area fraction, which are all greater than 0.90. The correlation coefficients of reflectance and area fraction at more than 86% are above 0.90, and more than 91.75% of bands have a correlation coefficient that above 0.80. The average reflectance of 1 610 to 1 630 nm was selected to estimate the proportion of iron ore powder area. The predicted results of samples with larger area performed better than these of smaller. The average accuracy of area fraction prediction of the iron ore powder on the sea ice is 94.23%. © 2021, Peking University Press.

As shown, the ice conditions in the SEB and in the CL are strongly varying from year to year and do not always correlate with each other. In the SEB, ice cover may form only within 5–15 km band along the coast or spread up to 100 km offshore covering almost the entire region. The mean ice season duration here is 45 days. The CL is almost fully ice-covered every year apart of its northern part subjected to sea water inflow and active shipping. The ice regime is also more stable here, however, it also possesses multiple periods of partial melting and re-freezing. In this study we also perform a validation of three SAR-based ice thickness products (Envisat ASAR 0.5-km and 1-km, and RADARSAT-2 0.5-km) produced by the Finnish Meteorological Institute versus in-situ measurements in the CL. As shown, all satellite products perform rather well for the periods of gradual ice thickness growth. When the ice thickness grows rapidly, all products underestimate the observed values by 10–20 cm (20–50%).

However, detailed dynamic precursors and drivers prior to a fast-calving process remain unclear due to sparse remote sensing observations. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation on hydrological and kinematic precursors before the calving event on 26 July 2017 of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland, by jointly using remote sensing observations at high-temporal resolution and an ice-flow model. Time series of ice-flow velocity fields during July 2017 were retrieved with Sentinel-2 observations with a sub-weekly sampling interval. The ice-flow speed quickly reached 30 m/d on 26 July (the day before the calving), which is roughly 10 times quicker than the mean glacier velocity. Additionally, a significant decrease in the radar backscatter coefficient of Sentinel-1 images suggests a rapid transformation from landfast sea ice into open water, associated with a decrease in sea ice extent. Additionally, the area of melt ponds on the floating ice tongue began to increase in mid-May, quickly reached a peak at the end of June and lasted for nearly one month until the calving occurred. We used the ice sheet system model to model the spatial-temporal damage and stress on the floating ice, thereby finding an abnormal stress distribution in a cracked region. It is inferred that this calving event may relate to a weakening of the sea ice, shearing of the tributary glacier, and meltwater infiltrating crevasses. © 2021 by the authors.

In ISOBAR ground-based flux and profile observations are combined with boundary layer remote sensing methods and the extensive usage of different unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). During February 2017 and 2018 we carried out two major field campaigns over the sea ice of the northern Baltic Sea, close to the Finnish island of Hailuoto at 65°N. In total 14 intensive observational periods (IOPs) resulted in extensive SBL datasets with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which will form the basis for various numerical modeling experiments. First results from the campaigns indicate numerous very stable boundary layer (VSBL) cases, characterized by strong stratification, weak winds, and clear skies, and give detailed insight in the temporal evolution and vertical structure of the entire SBL. The SBL is subject to rapid changes in its vertical structure, responding to a variety of different processes. In particular, we study cases involving a shear instability associated with a low-level jet, a rapid strong cooling event observed a few meters above ground, and a strong wave-breaking event that triggers intensive near-surface turbulence. Furthermore, we use observations from one IOP to validate three different atmospheric models. The unique finescale observations resulting from the ISOBAR observational approach will aid future research activities, focusing on a better understanding of the SBL and its implementation in numerical models. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Atmospheric movements; Numerical models; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Shear flow; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Weather forecasting; Innovative strategies; Intensive observational periods; Numerical weather prediction models; Spatio-temporal resolution; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; Stable boundary layer; Strong stratification; Unmanned aircraft system; Atmospheric boundary layer","Arctic; Atmosphere; Boundary layer; Field experiments; Numerical analysis/modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099020334"

Recent studies have reported a distributional shift in benthic macrofaunal biomass in the Pacific Arctic, likely caused by changes in food availability for benthic organisms. Here, we assessed the influence of differences in post-bloom supply of phytoplankton to the sediment on the growth of a common Pacific Arctic bivalve (Macoma calcarea) based on field and satellite observations, and feeding experiments. Among the sampling stations examined, the spatial distribution of M. calcarea body size showed clear variations and was associated with phytoplankton size structure during the post-bloom period. In addition, our feeding experiment exposing M. calcarea to different feeding treatments suggest that the continuous settlement of fresh phytoplankton is more important for the bivalve's growth than the total amount of phytoplankton settlement. This could explain the significant linkage between M. calcarea body size and phytoplankton size structure during the post-bloom period, because the larger phytoplankton represent an influx of fresh phytoplankton to the sediment and hereby support better growth and/or longevity of bivalves. Our study provides novel insights into a variety of processes related to the growth of M. calcarea and its relationship with the phytoplankton community. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR","Arctic; Pacific Ocean; Bivalvia; Calcarea; Macoma calcarea; benthos; bivalve; body size; food availability; growth; longevity; marine ecosystem; phytoplankton; size structure; spatial distribution","Arctic ocean; Bivalve; Laboratory experiment; Phytoplankton size structure; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089442566"

In this study we investigate how including the nominal noise profiles as a feature directly into the model affects the classification. Our noise-aware approach can be used in conjunction with any other deep learning model for sea ice classification. Hence our findings pave the way for getting refined and smoother sea ice maps for ice charting.

This work investigates the use of the Gamma portable radar interferometer (GPRI) to characterize sea ice displacement and surface topography. We find that the GPRI is best suited to derive lateral surface deformation due to mm-scale horizontal accuracy. We model interferometric phase signatures from sea ice displacement and evaluate possible errors related to noise and antenna motion. We compare the analysis with observations acquired during a drifting ice camp in the Beaufort Sea. We used repeat-scan and stare-mode interferometry to identify two-dimensional shear and to track continuous uni-directional convergence. This paper demonstrates the capacity of the GPRI to derive surface strain on the order of 10−7 and identify different dynamic regions based on sub-mm changes in displacement.

The sea and land segmentation is based on the normalized water body index. By analyzing the spectral characteristics of sea water and sea ice, the sea ice region is extracted by the maximum likelihood method, and the sea ice thickness is inverted by the exponential albedo model. The inversion results are compared with the ice thickness calculated by Zubov empirical model. The correlation coefficient is 0. 884, which proves the feasibility of medium high resolution optical remote sensing data in sea ice thickness inversion. At the same time, taking advantage of the medium and high resolution remote sensing data, using ice thickness information to extract sea ice types and estimate sea ice resources, it can provide reference for the prevention and mitigation of sea ice disaster and the utilization of sea ice resources in the Bohai Sea. © 2021 Science Press.

In this paper, the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea in China were monitored using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data during the freezing period from January to March in 2018. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the spectral characteristics of seawater and sea ice in visible bands, supplemented by the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we proposed a new method based on decision tree classification for extracting sea ice types in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea. Using the remote sensing data of eight satellite overpasses acquired from Sentinel-2A/B satellites, the distribution and area of the different sea ice types in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period of 2017/2018 were obtained. Compared with the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method and the support vector machine (SVM) classification method, the proposed method has higher accuracy when discriminating the sea ice types, which proved the new method proposed in this paper is suitable for extracting sea ice types from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data in Liaodong Bay. And its classification accuracy reaches 88.05%. The whole process of evolution such as the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period from January to March in 2018 was monitored. The maximum area of sea ice was detected on 27 January 2018, about 10,187 km2. At last, the quantitative relationship model between the sea ice area and the mean near-surface temperature derived by MODIS data in Liaodong Bay was established. Through research, we found that the mean near-surface temperature was the most important factor for affecting the formation and melt of sea ice in Liaodong Bay. © 2021 Zhiyong Wang et al.","Atmospheric temperature; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Freezing; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Surface properties; sea water; Bohai Sea; Classification methods; Comprehensive analysis; Growth and development; Ice disaster; Liaodong Bay; Near surface temperature; Remote sensing data; Sea ice type; Spectral characteristics; accuracy; Article; bay; Bohai Sea; China; comparative study; decision tree; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; freezing; infrared radiation; maximum likelihood method; normalized difference snow index; normalized difference vegetation index; optics; radiometry; remote sensing; sea ice; spatiotemporal analysis; support vector machine; workflow; Sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118935393"

Simulations were conducted using the land-atmospheric component setup of CAS-FGOALS-g3 with given sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions to assess its new capabilities. It was shown that anthropogenic groundwater use led to increased latent heat flux of about 20 W∙m−2 in three groundwater overexploitation areas: North India, northern China, and central United States. The groundwater lateral flow accompanied by this exploitation has led to deepening water table depth in these regions. The derived permafrost extent from the soil freeze-thaw front (FTF) was comparable to observations, and the inclusion of FTF dynamics enabled simulations of seasonal variations in freeze-thaw processes and related eco-hydrological effects. Inclusion of riverine nitrogen transport and its joint implementation with the human activity scheme showed large dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations in major rivers around the globe, including western Europe, eastern China, and the U.S. Midwest, which were affected by nitrogen retention and surface water use during transport. The results suggest that the model is a useful tool for studying the effects of land-surface processes on global climate, especially those influenced by human interventions. © 2020.

Traditionally, Arctic sea-ice types are mainly identified based on the scatterometer, radiometer, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the medium-incidence angles (about 20°-60°). The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), as a new type sensor with the low-incidence angles (0°, 2°, 4°, 8°, and 10°), is different from traditional remote sensors. SWIM has the potential to recognize sea-ice types based on its echo signals and backscattering information, whereas relevant research is still under development. In this research, the sea-ice classification using the SWIM's observations of the low-incidence angles is studied. Firstly, the waveform features of the six low-incidence angles were extracted from the SWIM echoes from November 2019 to April 2020, including the maximum power (MAX), the backscattering power (BSP), the pulse peakiness (PP), the stack standard deviation (SSD), the leading-edge width (LEW), and the trailing-edge width (TEW). Secondly, the Euclidean distances among the sea-ice types (the first-year ice (FYI) and the multi-year ice (MYI)) and the open water (OW) are used to analyze the distinction of the three categories based on the waveform features in the incidence angles. Thirdly, the FYI, MYI, and OW are classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the waveform features, and the three kinds of kernel (Gaussian kernel, Linear kernel, and Polynomial kernel) for SVM are analyzed for their capabilities of sea-ice classification. Then, the classification results are compared with the ice charts of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) to evaluate the classification accuracies. It is found that the accuracies of the waveform features in the low-incidence angles for the Gaussian kernel are the highest, and the accuracies of the Linear kernel are the lowest. It is revealed that the accuracies of all features in the different angles using Gaussian kernel is up to 77%. It is concluded that SWIM has the capacity for the sea-ice classification. In the future, our work will focus on the development of recognition methods based on more waveform features or feature sets to improve the accuracies of the sea-ice classification. This research will expand new horizons for the SWIM ocean detection application.  © 2021 IEEE.","Backscattering; Gaussian distribution; Meteorological instruments; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic sea ice; Edge widths; First-year ices; Gaussian kernels; Incidence angles; Monitoring instruments; Multi-year ices; Sea ice classification; Sea ice type; Waveform features; Surface waves","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126396808"

State-of-the-art atmospheric correction approaches either require extensive filed experiments or prior knowledge of atmospheric characteristics to improve the predicted accuracy, which are computational expensive and unsuitable for real time application. To take full advantages of remote sensing observation in quickly and reliably acquiring data for a large area, an automatic and efficient processing tool is required for atmospheric correction. In this paper, we propose a time-dependent neural network for automatic atmospheric correction and target detection using multi-scan hyperspectral data under different elevation angles. In addition to the total radiance, the collection day and time are also incorporated to improve the time-dependency of the network and represent the seasonal and diurnal characteristics of atmosphere and solar radiation. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to accurately provide atmospheric characteristics and estimate precise reflectivity spectra with 95.72% averaged accuracy for different materials, including vegetation, sea ice, and ocean. Additional experiments are designed to investigate the network's temporal dependency and performance on missing data. The error analysis confirms that our proposed network is capable of estimating atmospheric characteristics under both seasonally and diurnally varying environments and handling the influence of missing data. Both the predicted results and error analysis are promising and demonstrate that our network has the ability of providing accurate atmospheric correction and target detection in real time. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Satellite-based SIC products have become increasingly abundant in recent years; however, the uncertainty of these products still exists and needs to be further investigated. To comprehensively evaluate the consistency of the SIC derived from different SIC algorithms in long time series and the whole polar regions, we compared four passive microwave (PM) satellite SIC products with the ERA-Interim sea ice fraction dataset during the period of 2015-2018. The PM SIC products include the SSMIS/ASI, AMSR2/BT, the Chinese FY3B/NT2, and FY3C/NT2. The results show that the remotely sensed SIC products derived from different SIC algorithms are generally in good consistency. The spatial and temporal distribution of discrepancy among satellite SIC products for both Arctic and Antarctic regions are also observed. The most noticeable difference for all the four SIC products mostly occurs in summer and at the marginal ice zone, indicating that large uncertainties exist in satellite SIC products in such period and areas. The SSMIS/ASI and AMSR2/BT show relatively better consistency with ERA-Interim in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively, but they exhibit opposite bias (dry/wet) relative to the ERA-Interim data. The sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) derived from PM and ERA-Interim SIC were also compared. It is found that the difference of PM SIE and SIA varies seasonally, which is in line with that of PM SIC, and the discrepancy between PM and ERA-Interim data is larger in Arctic than in Antarctic. We also noticed that different algorithms have different performances in different regions and periods; therefore, the hybrid of multiple algorithms is a promising way to improve the accuracy of SIC retrievals. It is expected that our findings can contribute to improving the satellite SIC algorithms and thus promote the application of these useful products in global climate change studies. © 2020 by the authors.","Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Antarctic regions; Global climate changes; Long time series; Marginal Ice Zone; Multiple algorithms; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration; Spatial and temporal distribution; Climate change","ERA-Interim; Passive microwave; Polar region; Sea ice concentration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091830641"

The Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), which has nearly 30 years of observation, is a powerful tool for that purpose owing to its ability to detect thin ice areas. However, previous SSM/I thin ice thickness algorithms differ between regions, probably due to the difference in dominant type of thin sea ice in each region. In this study, we developed an SSM/I thin ice thickness algorithm that accounts for three types of thin sea ice (active frazil, thin solid ice, and a mixture of two types), using the polarization and gradient ratios. The algorithm is based on comparison with the ice thickness derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for 22 polynya events off the Ross Ice Shelf, off Cape Darnley, and off the Ronne Ice Shelf in the Southern Ocean. The algorithm can properly discriminate the ice type in coastal polynyas and estimate the thickness of thin sea ice (≤20 cm) with an error range of less than 6 cm. We also confirmed that the algorithm can be applied to other passive microwave radiometers with higher spatial resolution to obtain more accurate and detailed distributions of ice type and thickness. The validation of this algorithm in the Arctic Ocean suggests its applicability to the global oceans. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Antarctica; Ross Ice Shelf; West Antarctica; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Radiometers; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Overturning circulation; Passive microwaves; Ross ice shelves; Sea ice production; Southern ocean; Spatial resolution; Special sensor microwave imagers; algorithm; computer simulation; ice cover; ice thickness; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sea ice","Algorithms; Ice thickness; Microwave observations; Remote sensing; Satellite observations; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105509007"

Sea ice image classification is an important component of sea ice detection. Optical data contain rich spectral information, but they do not allow one to easily distinguish between ground objects with a similar spectrum and foreign objects with the same spectrum. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data contain rich texture information, but the data usually have a single source. The limitation of single-source data is that they do not allow for further improvements of the accuracy of remote sensing sea ice classification. In this paper, we propose a method for sea ice image classification based on deep learning and heterogeneous data fusion. Utilizing the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in terms of depth feature extraction, we designed a deep learning network structure for SAR and optical images and achieve sea ice image classification through feature extraction and a feature-level fusion of heterogeneous data. For the SAR images, the improved spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network was used and texture information on sea ice at different scales was extracted by depth. For the optical data, multi-level feature information on sea ice such as spatial and spectral information on different types of sea ice was extracted through a path aggregation network (PANet), which enabled low-level features to be fully utilized due to the gradual feature extraction of the convolution neural network. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two sets of heterogeneous sentinel satellite data were used for sea ice classification in the Hudson Bay area. The experimental results show that compared with the typical image classification methods and other heterogeneous data fusion methods, the method proposed in this paper fully integrates multi-scale and multi-level texture and spectral information from heterogeneous data and achieves a better classification effect (96.61%, 95.69%). © 2021 by the authors.

Even though being threatened by climate change and facing possible biodiversity loss, these deep-sea ecosystems are poorly understood. So are macrobenthic communities and their functions within these ecosystems. Biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships as well as their link to environmental drivers can be assessed with the biological trait analysis. We used this approach for the first time for macrofauna assemblages across the deep Fram Strait between Greenland and Svalbard (1000–5500 m water depth) to evaluate their community-specific function from the upper continental slope down to the deepest known Arctic depression, the Molloy Deep. We aimed to investigate whether there are changes in benthic functioning along the bathymetric gradient and if so, which environmental stressors may drive these changes. In total, 16 stations were sampled with a giant box corer (0.25 m2) in 2016 and 2018. Sediments were sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh size sieve and fauna was identified to lowest possible taxonomic entity. Functions of species were characterized by using six traits split in 24 modalities gathered in a fuzzy coded species × traits array. Environmental parameters shaping the benthic habitat and reflecting food availability were gathered from remote sensing, mooring deployments, and sediment sampling. A distance-based redundancy analysis indicated near-bottom water temperature, seabed inclination, water depth as well as phytodetritial matter at the sea surface and seafloor (indicating food availability) to be the best variables explaining the trait and station distribution. Stations clustered into three groups based on their trait composition. Shallower stations characterized by high chlorophyll a concentration with large organisms, living within the sediment as well as predating specimens clustered in one group. A second group was characterized by stations with low chlorophyll a concentration and medium-sized, suspension feeding, epifaunal living macrofauna. A third group comprised stations with water depths ≥ 3000 m and was dominated by medium sized, surface deposit feeding and infaunal living specimens. Overall, the functional structure of macrofauna communities in the Fram Strait followed a food availability-driven gradient. Based on the relationship between sea ice, surface water primary production and food availability at the seafloor, these results point to macrobenthos being sensible to predicted anthropogenically generated environmental variations in polar regions. Alterations in benthic ecosystem functions might be expected when environmental conditions change. © 2021 The Authors","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Fram Strait; Greenland; Molloy Deep; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Ferroelectric RAM; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sediments; Surface waters; Suspensions (fluids); Biodiversity and ecosystem functions; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Environmental conditions; Environmental parameter; Environmental stressors; Environmental variations; Functional structure; Macrobenthic community; benthos; biodiversity; climate change; community dynamics; community structure; continental slope; deep-sea benthos; deposit feeding; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; environmental conditions; food availability; marine ecosystem; polar region; Ecosystems","Biological trait analysis (BTA); Deep Sea; Ecological function; HAUSGARTEN; Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER); Macrofauna","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098997453"

Our previous study found that SMAP SSS shows signatures consistent with the inter-annual anomalies of observed sea ice concentration and river discharge, but with large uncertainty (1 psu) compared with limited in-situ data. One of error sources is the un-corrected sea ice contamination effect. The JPL SMAP algorithm retrieves SSS at each wind-salinity-cell if the matchup sea ice concentration (SIC) is less than 3% with no ice correction implemented yet. Since L-band brightness temperature (TB) of sea ice is much higher than that of seawater, SSS retrieved from TB from a field of view (FOV) mixed with water and ice will result in false fresh signature if the sea ice effect is not accurately accounted for. In this study, we develop an empirical observation-driven sea ice correction algorithm. We characterize the sea ice signature using SMAP TB and ancillary SIC data. The sea ice effect is corrected near ice edge where SIC is under a predetermined threshold for SSS retrieval. We consider the seasonal variation of TB over ice to be likely associated with seasonal change of physical temperature and summer melting pond. The sea ice fraction (ICEF) is calculated by integration of SIC over SMAP FOV weighted by antenna gain patterns. An empirical sea ice correction algorithm is proposed. The impact of sea ice correction is demonstrated by comparing TBs with or without sea ice correction. © 2020 IEEE.","Antennas; Climate change; Geology; Remote sensing; Seawater effects; Stream flow; Surface waters; Antenna gain patterns; Brightness temperatures; Correction algorithms; Physical temperature; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice signatures; Sea surface salinity; Spatial and temporal variability; Sea ice","Arctic Ocean; radiometer; sea ice; sea surface salinity; SMAP","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101984740"

A series of in situ snow measurements were conducted during the seventh Chinese Arctic expedition in summer 2016 in the western Arctic Ocean. In this study, we made an analysis of snow features on Arctic sea ice based on in situ observations and the satellite-derived parameter of snow grain size from MODIS spectral reflectance data. Results indicate that snow depth on Arctic sea ice varied between 19 and 241 mm, with a mean value of 100 mm. The mean density of the snow was 340.4 kg/m3 during the expedition, which was higher than that reported in previous literature. The measurements revealed that a depth hoar layer was widely developed in the snow, accounting for 30%∼50% of the total snow depth. The equivalent snow grain size was small on the surface and large at the bottom in snow pits. The average relative error between MODIS-derived snow grain size and in situ measured surface snow grain size is 14.6%, indicating that remote sensing is a promising method to obtain large-scale information of snow grain size on Arctic sea ice. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We explore the large-scale impacts of springtime and early summer (March through July) cloud and radiative fluxes on sea ice by comparing these fluxes to seasonal ice volume losses over the central Arctic basin, calculated for available observational years 2004-2007 (ICESat) and 2011-2017 (CryoSat-2). We also supplement observation data with sea-ice volume computed from the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) during summer months. We find that the volume of sea ice lost over the melt season is most closely related to observed downwelling longwave radiation in March and early summer (June and July) longwave cloud radiative forcing, which together explain a large fraction of interannual variability in seasonal sea-ice volume loss (R2= 0.71, p = 0.007). We show that downwelling longwave fluxes likely impact the timing of melt onset near the sea-ice edge, and can limit the magnitude of ice thickening from March to April. Radiative fluxes in June and July are likely critical to seasonal volume loss because modeled data show the greatest ice volume reductions occur during these months. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

We also tried to apply interferometric SAR data analysis for the data pair acquired during the period from Feb.11 to Mar.7. The C-band SAR backscattering coefficients in both VV and VH have the maximum values at 30 to 35 cm of the ice thickness, and the relatively significant correlation found in the east part of the lake. We also find that the phase difference presumably caused by a tidal change in several areas surrounded the lake. In the relatively thick ice area, the coherence decreases with ice thickness, which is caused by the dominant scattering mechanism change. © 2020 IEEE.","Backscattering; Coherent scattering; Geology; Lakes; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; C-band SAR data; Ice thickness; In-situ observations; Interferometric SAR; Phase difference; Sampling points; Scattering mechanisms; Ice","backscattering mechanism; coherence; phase difference; sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102016585"

The geographical location and climate impose additional constraints on satellite-based monitoring, making it necessary to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Dark features or low backscatter areas are frequent within the SAR images and their occurrence may indicate oil spills or so-called lookalikes. Automatic oil spill detection hinges on accurate separation of the lookalikes from actual oil spills. Two main types exist in the Barents Sea: newly formed sea ice and low wind regions, where the former occur during the freezing part of the year (approx. November - April) and the other year around. Mapping the occurrence of oil spills and lookalikes in the Barents Sea on a seasonal basis would add to our understanding and knowledge of the low backscatter phenomena. Awareness of the major locations of oil spills, natural oil seeps, or lookalikes, are important for operational services and their effort to reduce false alarms. Here, we explore the use of a segmentation-based dark feature detection method with Sentinel-l Extra Wide-Swath SAR images. We test the method on images acquired over the Barents Sea during the freezing season, and cross-validate the results with two sets of dark features segmented by operational expert oil spill and sea ice monitoring services.

However, biases can emerge when comparing these 1-D measurements to a broader 2-D regional scale due to the spatial anisotropy inherent to sea-ice cover. Automated processing of available sea-ice maps could significantly ease the decision on how to set up an optimised flight pattern, which would result in representative ice thickness numbers for the region. In this study, first we investigate the extent to which the sea-ice anisotropy can influence the representativeness of an airborne survey compared to the regional situation. Second, we propose a method to process sea-ice maps prior to flights to help preparing the most representative flight plan possible for the local area. The method is based on automated segmentation of radar satellite images and extensive simulation of flight transects over the image. The spatial analysis of these transects enables for the identification of the most representative survey trajectories for the area. The method was applied for seven different synthetic aperture radar satellite images over Arctic sea ice north of Svalbard. The results indicate that the proposed method improved the representativeness of the airborne survey by identifying the most suitable transect over the ice pack. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

To examine the changes of the complex glacial environment, a multiple hierarchical object- and rule-based classification (MHORC) scheme is proposed by combining Landsat time series images and topographic data. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is introduced due to its capabilities of handling data contextually and hierarchically and using multi-source data jointly so that multiple hierarchical rule-based classification can be developed to distinguish the objects with similar spectrum such as debris-covered glaciers and their surrounding terrain. All the available Landsat images from 1987 to 2019 are filtered by the cloud cover condition (less than 10%) and accordingly used in the MHORC to obtain spatial and temporal information of the glacier and snow over the NBGP massif. The images collected in the snow-free season are used to estimate the glacier extent state and the historical changes, and those in the snow-covered are used to estimate the snow cover fluctuation using harmonic analysis. The results show that the NBGP contains 65 glaciers (≥0.1 km2) with a total area of 462.7 km2, among which valley glaciers account for 21.5% in number but cover an area of 354.2 km2, more than 76% of the total area. An accelerating reduction trend of the glacier area is confirmed as the area change velocity is −0.62 km2 yr−1 between 1999 and 2003 and reach −2.95 km2 yr−1 between 2003 and 2015. The seasonal snow cover area shows a reduction in the secular trend and an increase in fluctuation amplitude. Both glacier and seasonal snow display heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal patterns. Such heterogeneous dynamics might be related to the trade-off between water vapor supply and regional thermal conditions. This MHORC developed in this study demonstrates its effectiveness in delineating the debris-covered glacier environment and the potential of using Landsat time series to track glacial environment evolution. Besides, the analysis of seasonal snow fluctuations provides a novel perspective to re-recognize the glacial environment dynamics, and the knowledge of glacier extent changes and season snow fluctuations over the NBGP massif can improve the understanding of environmental effects from climate change. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The retrieval of their thickness by remote sensing is, in general, a difficult task. A processing system was developed and refined by the present authors in the framework of the EU SPICES project; it is meant for routinely deriving ice thickness in frazil-pancake regions using the spectral changes in wave spectra from imagery provided by space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. This methodology was successfully tested in the Beaufort Sea through comparison with ground truth collected during the cruise of the ""Sikuliaq"" in the fall of 2015. In the present study, this technique has been adapted and applied to Antarctic frazil/pancake icefields using COSMO-SkyMed satellite images. Our retrievals were analyzed and validated through a comparison with co-located in situ observations collected during the 2017 PIPERS cruise in Terra Nova Bay polynya.

It has the unique advantages of short imaging time interval (20s) and high resolution (50m). In order to analyze the effect of GF-4 satellite image registration accuracy on sea ice drift in Bohai Sea, firstly, the orthorectification of the 28 image data available from August 2016 to March 2018 in the Bohai Sea area was carried out. Then we selected the sea-land edge points as control points, and registration of two images which have the same time interval. Next, we recorded the marked same name points which searched from the bottom of Liaodong bay, east of Liaodong bay and west of Liaodong bay respectlly. We statisticed the direction and frequency of land point offset sub-regionally, then we created the rose plots and maked histogram of the offset of land point. The results show that, when the time interval is 4 hours and 24 hours, the dominant migration direction in the three regions in Liaodong bay is east; when the time interval is 1 minute, the dominant migration direction in Liaodong Bay bottom and Liaodong Bay west coast land is south, Followed by east and southeast respectively; the dominant migration in Liaodong Bay East Coast is north, followed by east; When the time interval is 3 hours, the dominant migration direction in west of Liaodong Bay, bottom of Liaodong Bay and east of Liaodong bay are east, west and south respectively, followed by southeast, east, southeast respectively. The land offset in three regions is major centralized distribution in a range which is from 60m to 80m. That is to say, the offset of land is basically equal to 1.2 times of pixels, and the maximum land offset is less than 2 times of pixels. Through statistical analysis, it can be seen that with the increase of time interval, the land offset will not change much.

Accurate ice segmentation is one most important pieces of technology in ice monitoring research. It can provide the prerequisite information for the calculation of ice cover density, drift ice speed, ice cover distribution, change detection and so on. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography has the advantages of higher spatial and temporal resolution. As UAV technology has become more popular and cheaper, it has been widely used in ice monitoring. So, we focused on river ice segmentation based on UAV remote sensing images. In this study, the NWPU_YRCC dataset was built for river ice segmentation, in which all images were captured by different UAVs in the region of the Yellow River, the most difficult river to manage in the world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first public UAV image dataset for river ice segmentation. Meanwhile, a semantic segmentation deep convolution neural network by fusing positional and channel-wise attentive features is proposed for river ice semantic segmentation, named ICENET.

The spatial pattern of dCH4/dt was poorly related to seabed depth, but could be explained by a process of shoaling of strengthening warm ocean currents that would also advect the CH4 to areas where seasonal deepening of the surface ocean mixed layer depth leads to ventilation of these water masses. © 2019 IEEE.","Gasoline; Geology; Methane; Ocean currents; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Satellites; Sea ice; Seepage; Surface waters; Barents sea; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Satellite data; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice extent; Sea surface temperature (SST); Spatial patterns; Warming; Remote sensing","Barents Sea; Methane; Satellite; Seepage; Warming","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077695393"

Sea and ice surface temperature (SST, IST) are commonly determined with split window algorithms that use the brightness temperature from the 11 μm channel (BT11) as the main estimator and the difference between BT11 and the 12 μm channel (BTD11-12) to correct for atmospheric water vapor absorption. An issue with this paradigm in the Arctic maritime environment is the occurrence of high BTD11-12 that is not indicative of atmospheric absorption of BT11 energy. The Composite Arctic Sea Surface Temperature Algorithm (CASSTA) considers three regimes based on BT11 pixel value: seawater, ice, and marginal ice zones. A single channel (BT11) estimator is used for SST and a split window algorithm for IST. Marginal ice zone temperature is determined with a weighted average between the SST and IST. This study replaces the CASSTA split window IST with a single channel (BT11) estimator to reduce errors associated with BTD11-12 in the split window algorithm. The single channel IST returned improved results in the CASSTA dataset with a mean average error for ice and marginal ice zones of 0.142 K and 0.128 K, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Temperature measurement; Water absorption; Water vapor; Arctic Waters; Atmospheric absorption; Atmospheric water vapor; Brightness temperatures; Ice surfaces; Marginal Ice Zone; Split window algorithms; Temperature algorithms; Atmospheric temperature","Arctic waters; Ice surface temperature; Marginal ice zones; Remote sensing; Satellite temperature algorithm; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074189482"

In the last few decades, a combination of stressors has produced significant declines in reef expanse, with declining reef health attributed largely to thermal stresses. We investigated the correspondence between time-series satellite remote sensing-based sea surface temperature (SST) datasets and ocean temperature monitored in situ at depth in coral reefs near La Parguera, Puerto Rico. In situ temperature data were collected for Cayo Enrique and Cayo Mario, San Cristobal, and Margarita Reef. The three satellite-based SST datasets evaluated were NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch (CoralTemp), the UK Meteorological Office’s Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA), and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (G1SST). All three satellite-based SST datasets assessed displayed a strong positive correlation (>0.91) with the in situ temperature measurements. However, all SST datasets underestimated the temperature, compared with the in situ measurements. A linear regression model using the SST datasets as the predictor for the in situ measurements produced an overall offset of ~1◦C for all three SST datasets. These results support the use of all three SST datasets, after offset correction, to represent the temperature regime at the depth of the corals in La Parguera, Puerto Rico. © 2020 by the authors.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice thickness swath charts were used as reference data for the algorithm development. The algorithm is based on the classification of 36-GHz polarization ratio (PR36) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio (GR3689H) signatures with linear discriminant analysis. We applied an atmospheric correction to the AMSR2 L1R data following established sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval algorithms. The PR36 and GR8936H signatures were adjusted to a constant air temperature (Ta) before the thin ice detection using an empirical relationship between them and Ta. The maximum thickness of detected thin ice was estimated to be 20 cm. The thin ice detection with the L1R data is conducted only when SIC ≥70% and Ta≤-5°C to limit conditions where thick ice may be erroneously detected as thin ice. The thin ice detection algorithm was developed for the Barents and Kara Seas, but it should also be applicable for other Arctic marginal ice zones (MIZs). The daily thin ice chart was validated using an independent set of MODIS daily ice thickness charts. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice was 10% and 32% for vice versa. We demonstrate the use of the daily thin ice chart for monitoring the thin ice fraction in the Barents and Kara Seas. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Kara Sea; Discriminant analysis; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Tantalum compounds; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Arctic; Brightness temperatures; Empirical relationships; Linear discriminant analysis; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Passive microwave remote sensing; polynya; algorithm; AMSR-E; arctic environment; atmospheric correction; brightness temperature; detection method; ice; ice thickness; image classification; MODIS; polynya; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; Radiometers","Arctic; passive microwave remote sensing; polynya; thin sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073931543"

Thus, to solve this problem, it is necessary to preserve several ideas (such as decimeter and decameter waves, vertical looking, wideband, coherent processing, and resolution of multiple reflections). The model is suitable for identifying features of SAR implementation in such a remote sensing application. During the first study, to simplify the model, only basic parameters of the ice surface were realized: the ice is homogenous and both of its surfaces consist of many bright points. The model can simulate reflected signals and radar images with additional information about an ice layer structure. So, a precision wideband radar system can measure the ice thickness, evaluate its dirtiness, uniformity, other object presence, etc. © 2020 IEEE.","Biomedical engineering; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Thickness measurement; Basic parameters; Coherent processing; Decameter waves; Ice thickness; Multiple reflections; Reflected signal; Remote sensing applications; Wide band radar; Synthetic aperture radar","ice thickness measurement; radar system; remote sensing; SAR; sea ice model; signal processing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089659746"

We present a pixel-based classification scheme to identify undeformed and deformed ice, open water, and light, medium, and dark MPs in images of sea ice undergoing melt. The scheme was applied to 0.1-m resolution Operation IceBridge Digital Mapping System imagery covering an area of ~4,000 km2. Observations of both the unconsolidated, marginal ice zone of the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas (B/C Seas) and the consolidated, multiyear ice of the central Arctic (CA) were obtained. Sea ice concentration (SIC), melt pond fraction (MPF), and pond color fraction (PCF) were derived on a per-image basis. SIC averaged 69% in the B/C Seas and 90% in the CA. We find that both MPF and PCF are dependent on the ice type on which ponds form. MPF averaged 25% in the B/C Seas, where dark ponds dominated and had a PCF of 60%, compared to a PCF of 9% and 31%, for medium and light ponds, respectively. MPF averaged 14% in the CA, where the PCF of light ponds was 68%, compared with 16% for both medium and dark ponds. As the multiyear ice of the Arctic Ocean is replaced by a younger, more seasonal ice cover, our results suggest that MPF will increase, and MP color will darken. This would enhance the ice albedo feedback, exacerbating that already due to the multidecadal decline in summer ice extent. © 2020.

In recent years, the ability of the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to acquire remotely, high-resolution imagery has made them very popular in the marine remote sensing field. Observations in the marine environment are very challenging in many ways as they are affected by weather and oceanographic conditions that interact with each other. The UAS aerial surveys deal with many limitations affecting the quality and reliability of the acquired data, directly dependent on the environmental conditions prevailing in the survey area. For example, high wind speed affects the sea surface state and the safety of a UAS survey, resulting in unsatisfying observations of the marine environment. This study presents the validation of a UAS toolbox designed to calculate the optimal flight times on a day for UAS surveys. The ruleset of the toolbox is based on a theoretical UAS data acquisition protocol which summarizes all the parameters that affect the quality and reliability of the UAS acquired data in the marine environment. For the validation of the toolbox, flights were conducted in different conditions, according to the toolbox predictions, while underwater targets were placed and compared as to their characteristics in different conditions. The aerial images of each flight were processed for the creation of high-resolution orthophoto-maps that showed significant differences between the optimal flight times and the non-optimal flights. The present work emphasizes the importance of the environmental conditions during an aerial survey and evidence that data quality is superior during the toolbox suggested flight times.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This approach is based on the assumption that wind has no effect on the kinematics of forming slick bands which, according to our estimation, is incorrect in real sea conditions. This can lead to misinterpretation of remote sensing data in the field of definition of the characteristics of marine eddies, particularly, in radar images. The system of equations for the description of kinematics of a Lagrangian particle (element of surface active substance) in stationary fields of axisymmetric eddy with non-zero radial velocity component and homogeneous wind was obtained. It was shown that the center of the spiral is not collocated with the center of the eddy, and the distance between them can achieve the scale of eddy core. It was shown that the displacement of the spiral center is quasi perpendicular to the wind direction in case of small radial velocity component compared to the tangential one. It was shown analytically that there is a threshold wind velocity which corresponds to the breakdown of the spiral structure. Simulation based on the discrete-time approximation of particle trajectories, as well as radar observation of marine eddies, demonstrates the possibility of appearance of a ""focus""and a ""saddle""in the characteristic shape of slick bands.

This compelling new science mission will attempt to answer the question ""Why is the Arctic warming faster than the rest of the planet?"" by filling an important gap in our knowledge of energy flows in Polar Regions. PREFIRE will fly a pair of small CubeSat satellites to probe a little-studied portion of the radiant energy emitted by Earth for clues about Arctic warming, sea ice loss and ice-sheet melting. Two miniaturized Thermal Infrared Spectrometers (TIRS) on two CubeSat satellites, are based on technology previously flown on the Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The CubeSats will orbit Earth's poles to measure far-infrared emissions and how they change throughout the day and over seasons. By building, characterizing, and operating, TIRS payloads in two different polar orbits, the PREFIRE mission has potential impact on NASA in these focus areas through (1) Quantification of the influence of variable surface conditions on Arctic and Antarctic thermal emission, (2) Estimation of the impact of atmospheric constituents on the polar greenhouse effect, and, (3) Determination of the impacts of variations in far-infrared emissivity and greenhouse effect on ice sheet melt and sea level rise. The observations will allow scientists to assess how changes in thermal infrared emissions at the top of Earth's atmosphere are related to changes in cloud cover and surface conditions below.

This case study focuses on the intra-Arctic modification of long-range transported aerosol and its direct aerosol radiative effect (ARE). Different types of air-borne and ground-based remote sensing observations (from Lidar and sun-photometer) revealed a high tropospheric aerosol transport episode over two parts of the European Arctic in April 2018. By incorporating the derived aerosol optical and microphysical properties into a radiative transfer model, we assessed the ARE over the two locations. Our study displayed that even in neighboring Arctic upper tropospheric levels, aged aerosol was transformed due to the interplay of removal processes (nucleation scavenging and dry deposition) and alteration of the aerosol source regions (northeast Asia and north Europe). Along the intra-Arctic transport, the coarse aerosol mode was depleted and the visible wavelength Lidar ratio (LR) increased significantly (from 15 to 64-82 sr). However, the aerosol modifications were not reflected on the ARE. More specifically, the short-wave (SW) atmospheric column ARE amounted to +4.4-+4.9 W m-2 over the ice-covered Fram Strait and +4.5 W m-2 over the snow-covered Ny-Alesund. Over both locations, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) warming was accompanied by surface cooling. These similarities can be attributed to the predominant accumulation mode, which drives the SW radiative budget, as well as to the similar layer altitude, solar geometry, and surface albedo conditions over both locations. However, in the context of retreating sea ice, the ARE may change even along individual transport episodes due to the ice albedo feedback. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, the influence of the mesoscale eddies in the NPO on the marine ecological environment needs to be examined. The relationship between Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration inside these eddies as well as the response mechanism of these eddies to local ecological processes also warrant further research. In this paper, the Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO)-merged satellite altimeter data are used to identify and track 992 mesoscale eddies in the NPO during the years of 2007-2012, including 442 Cyclonic Eddies (CEs) and 550 Anticyclonic Eddies (AEs), in the NPO between 2007 and 2012. The spatial and temporal distributions of the SST and the Chl-a concentration inside these eddies are analyzed via Operational Sea surface Temperature and sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) SST and MODIS data, and the variability of these parameters inside typical eddies is examined. The results show that the temperature intensity of CEs (ICE) has a higher tendency to demonstrate monthly variations compared with that of AEs (IAE). The seasonal variation of ICE tends to contrast that of IAE. Specifically, ICE shows an obvious annual variation, whereas IAE does not. Stronger ICE and IAE are observed in the Kuroshio Extension intensively. Both CEs and AEs have similar monthly variation tendencies in the temporal and spatial distributions of eddy Chl-a. The annual trends of Chl-a in both AEs and CEs are ambiguous. For AEs and CEs, the highest Chl-a concentration is observed in the high-latitude region. A study of the relationship between the eddy SST and eddy dynamic parameters (e.g., amplitude, vorticity, and Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE)) reveals that SST inner AEs are either positively or negatively correlated to amplitude with a uniform distribution in space. A negative correlation of SST inner CEs can be observed in the Kuroshio Extension, whereas a positive correlation is observed in offshore areas of California. A positive correlation is more frequently observed in AEs than in CEs. The correlation of SST with vorticity in AEs is either positive or negative, while in CEs, SST shows a negative correlation with vorticity. The correlation of SST with EKE in AEs is either positive or negative, but such correlation is only positive uniquely in CEs. The Chl-a concentration in AEs is positively correlated with amplitude and has a uniform distribution in space. In CEs, Chl-a concentration shows a positive correlation with amplitude in the Kuroshio Extension and in Alaska Bay. Chl-a concentration also shows a positive correlation with vorticity in both AEs and CEs, a positive correlation with EKE in AEs, and either a positive or negative correlation with EKE in CEs. We conclude that SST demonstrates obvious monthly and annual variation tendencies in CEs, and high ICE and IAE values are distributed in the Kuroshio Extension of the NPO. The Chl-a concentration in CEs and AEs demonstrate a similar monthly variation tendency and an ambiguous annual variation. Eddies with a high Chl-a concentration are mainly located in the high-latitude region of the NPO. The relationship between the eddy SST and the eddy dynamic parameters is treated as a local feature of the NPO, and a positive relationship between eddy Chl-a concentration and eddy dynamic parameters is observed in the Kuroshio Extension and Alaska Bay. The influence of mesoscale eddies on the ecological processes is related to the type and eddy lifetime of eddies in the NPO. © 2020, Science Press.

To this end, we applied modern machine learning techniques to produce ice-describing semantic maps of the polar regions of the Earth. Time series of these maps can then be exploited for local and regional change maps of selected areas. What we expect, however, are fully-automated unsupervised routine classifications of sea ice regions that are needed for the rapid and reliable monitoring of shipping routes, drifting and disintegrating icebergs, snowfall and melting on ice, and other dynamic climate change indicators. Therefore, we designed and implemented an automated processing chain that analyses and interprets the specific ice-related content of high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We trained this system with selected images covering various use cases allowing us to interpret these images with modern machine learning approaches. In the following, we describe a system comprising representation learning, variational inference, and auto-encoders. Test runs have already demonstrated its usefulness and stability that can pave the way towards future artificial intelligence systems extending, for instance, the current capabilities of traditional image analysis by including content-related image understanding. © Authors 2019.

Examples of sea targets include sea ice, oil rigs, and oil slicks. To distinguish sea targets from sea clutter, one can estimate the sea clutter and subtract it from the DDM, leaving behind only the sea target's signature on the DDM. This is computationally expensive and will not be robust when the sea clutter estimate is poor or if there are DD tracking errors. This article presents two blind methods for the suppression of sea clutter: first, an adaptive filter and second, an infinite impulse response low-pass filter.

Here, we present a framework for assessing the status and trends of key ocean habitat components using synoptic data sources. It aims to quantify ecosystem variability and long-term change, and to provide summaries and indicators of change at scales that are both ecologically meaningful and relevant for management. We illustrate our approach using the Southern Ocean as a case-study and assess habitat based on remotely-sensed sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a. We use Antarctic krill Euphausia superba as an illustrative example of how thresholds and optimum ranges for key taxa (and the ranges they define) can be used to delimit areas that are likely to constitute “good” habitat. Availability of “good” habitat, in terms of area, provides a simple indicator for quantifying change through time, and for assessing regional differences. Our assessment of sea ice reveals that the absence of a strong trend in the mean annual duration of sea ice cover around Antarctica masks a loss of areas with the longest periods of cover. In the polar latitudinal zone of the East Pacific, the area with the longest ice coverage has declined by 123,533 km2 over the past four decades. Our assessment of chlorophyll-a and SST highlights that the area of “good” habitat for krill has increased in the high-latitude zone, but decreased in the polar zone close to the continent in all sectors other than the East Pacific, where the reverse has been true. These examples demonstrate how our general approach can visualise and identify (i) known trends in mean values but also diagnose where changes in the habitat area over time may not match the mean trend; (ii) key habitat thresholds across a range of variables and in different seasons; and (iii) changes in the degree of spatial overlap of areas with desirable ranges for different habitat components. Our approach provides a versatile method to generate summaries of status and trends of ocean habitats at scales meaningful to decision makers. It can readily be adapted to other habitat variables and for other areas, supporting ongoing efforts to assess status and trends of open ocean habitats worldwide. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Southern Ocean; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Ocean habitats; Sea ice; Surface waters; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem status; Science policies; Southern ocean; Southern Ocean ecosystem; climate change; crustacean; ecological impact; ecosystem approach; ecosystem management; environmental assessment; habitat availability; marine ecosystem; open ocean; remote sensing; trend analysis; Oceanography","Ecosystem impacts of climate change; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem status and trends; Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean; Science-policy; Southern Ocean ecosystems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067850639"

Spaceborne optical instruments allow the continuous monitoring of the occurrence, distribution, and amount of Chl-a. In recent years, the Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3 (S3) A and B satellites were launched, which provide data about various aquatic environments on advantageous spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions with high SNR. Although S3 OLCI could be favorable to monitor high northern latitude waters, there have been several challenges related to Chl-a concentration retrieval in these waters due to their unique optical properties coupled with challenging environments including high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. In this work, we aim to overcome these difficulties by developing a machine-learning (ML) approach designed to estimate Chl-a concentration from S3 OLCI data in high northern latitude optically complex waters. The ML model is optimized and requires only three S3 OLCI bands, reflecting the physical characteristic of Chl-a as input in the regression process to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy in terms of the bias (five times improvements.) The ML model was optimized on data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, and showed promising performance. Finally, we present the performance of the optimized ML approach by computing Chl-a maps and corresponding certainty maps in highly complex sub-Arctic and Arctic waters. We show how these certainty maps can be used as a support to understand possible radiometric calibration issues in the retrieval of Level 2 reflectance over these waters. This can be a useful tool in identifying erroneous Level 2 Remote sensing reflectance due to possible failure of the atmospheric correction algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","Chlorophyll; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Signal to noise ratio; Arctic; Atmospheric correction algorithm; Chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Ocean color; Remote-sensing reflectance; Sentinel 3 OLCI; Spaceborne optical instruments; Machine learning","Arctic; Chlorophyll-a; Machine-learning; Ocean color monitoring; Sentinel 3 OLCI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072647161"

The Adaptive Canny method has shown to be efficient for the detection of edges of objects in SAR images, according to recent publications and conferences. These studies were only carried out for images that had approximately half of each backscatter, without considering that the dimension of the objects can affect the edge detection process. Here, we present the results of the efficiency of the Adaptive Canny method as the size of the object, from which it is intended to extract the contour, decreases. A systematic analysis of the behavior of the method has been performed with objects of variated dimensions, through a Monte Carlo type experiment with synthetic images, where the contours of the figures were extracted with the Adaptive Canny method and compared with the Ground Truth (GT).

The orbits of the three platforms have drifted over their years of operation, resulting in changing relative observing times that could cause biases in TB estimates and near-real-time sea ice concentrations derived from the NASA Team algorithm that are produced at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Comparisons of TB histograms and concentrations show that there are small mean differences between sensors, but variability within an individual sensor is much greater. There are some indications of small changes due to orbital drift, but these are not consistent across different frequencies. Further, the overall effect of the drift, while not definitive, is small compared to the intra- and interannual variability in individual sensors. These results suggest that, for near-real-time use, the differences in the sensors are not critical. However, for long-term time series, even the small biases should be corrected for. The strong day-to-day, seasonal, and interannual variability in TB distributions indicate that time-varying algorithm coefficients in the NASA team algorithm would lead to improved, more consistent sea ice concentration estimates. © 2020 by the authors.","Luminance; NASA; Orbits; Sea ice; Temperature; Different frequency; Interannual variability; Passive microwave brightness temperatures; Satellite platforms; Sea ice concentration; Special sensor microwave imagers; Team Algorithms; Time-varying algorithm; Microwave sensors","Antarctic; Arctic; Passive microwave; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088634801"

We review the state-of-the art knowledge concerning the WG from an interdisciplinary perspective, uncovering critical aspects needed to understand this system's role in shaping the future evolution of oceanic heat and carbon uptake over the next decades. The main limitations in our knowledge are related to the conditions in this extreme and remote environment, where the polar night, very low air temperatures, and presence of sea ice year-round hamper field and remotely sensed measurements. We highlight the importance of winter and under-ice conditions in the southern WG, the role that new technology will play to overcome present-day sampling limitations, the importance of the WG connectivity to the low-latitude oceans and atmosphere, and the expected intensification of the WG circulation as the westerly winds intensify. Greater international cooperation is needed to define key sampling locations that can be visited by any research vessel in the region. Existing transects sampled since the 1980s along the Prime Meridian and along an East-West section at ~62°S should be maintained with regularity to provide answers to the relevant questions.

Accurate extraction of sea ice types is of great significance on sea ice conditions assessment, smooth navigation and safty marine operations. Sentinel-2 is an optical satellite launched by the European Space Agency. High spatial resolution and wide range imaging provide powerful support for sea ice monitoring. However, traditional supervised classification method is difficult to achieve fine results for small sample features. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposed a sea ice extraction method based on deep learning and it was applied to Liaodong Bay in Bohai Sea, China. The convolutional neural network was used to extract and classify the feature of the image from Sentinel-2. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the algorithm was 85.79% which presented a significant improvement compared with the tranditional algorithms, such as minimum distance method, maximum likelihood method, Mahalanobis distance method, and support vector machine method. The method proposed in this paper, which combines convolutional neural networks and high-resolution multispectral data, provides a new idea for remote sensing monitoring of sea ice. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","Convolution; Deep learning; Ecology; Extraction; Marine navigation; Maximum likelihood; Network architecture; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; High spatial resolution; Mahalanobis distance method; Maximum likelihood methods; Remote sensing monitoring; Sea ice classification; Supervised classification; Support vector machine method; Sea ice","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078911009"

Another aspect of the problem is to investigate possibilities of discrimination between the marginal ice zone and oil spills in radar imagery. This study is focused on modeling the damping of surface waves due to ice floes in laboratory and field experiment. Laboratory experiments were carried out is a container filled with pure water in order to exclude the effect of surfactant films on wave damping. The container was mounted on a vibration table, so that surface gravity-capillary waves (GCW) could be parametrically generated in the container when the amplitude of the vibrations exceeded some threshold level. The wave damping coefficient could be retrieved when measuring the threshold. The floes in experiment were modeled using thin plastic pieces of two different sizes, the relative square of the ""floe""coverage of the water surface was controlled in experiment. The dependences of the damping coefficient at different relations between the surface wavelength and the floe dimensions as functions of the floe coverage area were obtained. It is obtained that the damping of gravity-capillary waves in the presence of floes comparable in size with GCW can be one to two orders of magnitude greater that the wave damping due to inextensible film. Preliminary field experiments have been conducted on the Gorky Water Reservoir using a research catamaran vessel of the Institute of Applied Physics. Plywood pieces with sizes several times smaller that the studied surface wavelengths were used as imitators of ice floes and were deployed in between the catamaran hulls. Surface waves propagating between the halls were generated mechanically by a vertically oscillating motor boat. The amplitude of attenuating surface waves due to the ""plywood floes""was measured with wire gauges mounted at the bow and the stern of the catamaran. The damping distance due to ice floes obtained in the field experiment was estimated as about 10 wavelengths thus indicating that that wave suppression due to the floes was essentially stronger than the viscous wave damping for clean or contaminated water surface. Wave damping observed both in the laboratory and field experiments can be comparable with the wave damping due to crude oil/oil emulsion films, so the problem of discrimination between, e.g. grease ice and oil spills in radar imagery can be nontrivial.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Firstly, polarization features are extracted to form polarization characteristic vectors for representing individual pixels in a remote sensing image. Secondly, a multiple classifier ensemble strategy, i.e., sliding bagging, is exploited for classifying each polarization characteristic vector into a sea ice type. The sliding bagging strategy not only avoids the limitation of one single classifier for characterizing the sea ice variability over a large-scale region, but also alleviates the data imbalance over different sea ice types. Finally, the spatial structural relationships of sea ice types are encoded with first-order logic (FOL) to refine the sea ice classification resulted from the sliding bagging scheme.

Marine slicks which are the areas of suppressed wind waves can be recorded by different sensors and can be indicators of internal waves, non uniform currents, atmospheric convective cells, etc. Field studies including those simultaneous and co-located with remote observations is the most perspective way to the problem solution. An expedition of the Institute of Applied Physics RAS was organized to study the nature of slick bands and its dynamics in the field of various subsurface processes. Field experiments were carried out in the coastal zone of the Black sea from the Oceanographic Platform of Marine Hydrophysical Institute RAS and from the shore. The structure of the currents in the studied area is characterized by significant heterogeneity, so we were able to register different slick structures in the flow field and wind and the slick dynamics. In some experiments, marine slicks were recorded simultaneously in satellite Sentinel images. Observations of surface manifestations of internal waves were carried out using a digital radar station MRS-1000 and multi-frequency radar complex of IAP RAS. At the same time the measurements of currents in the water column were carried out using the ADCP WH Monitor 1200 kHz, wind speed and direction at a height of 30 meters using WindSonic acoustic anemometer. During the passage of internal waves a system of slick bands with a reduced intensity of small-scale waves were observed. Slick bands were observed mainly over the rear slopes of the internal waves; the data from the accompanying measurements showed that the phase velocity was close to the surface current velocity. Theoretical analysis has shown that in this case the convergent zones, where surfactants are accumulated were formed at the rear slopes of the internal waves. This mechanism of slick formation was predicted earlier theoretically and then was modeled in laboratory experiment.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This is especially true in the polar regions where uncertainties about the interactions between sea ice, ocean, and atmosphere are driving ongoing monitoring efforts. The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is an European Space Agency (ESA) candidate mission which promises to offer high resolution, low uncertainty observation capabilities at the 1.4, 6.9, 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz frequencies. To assess the potential impact of CIMR for sea ice parameter retrieval, a comparison is made between retrievals based on present AMSR2 observations and a retrieval using future CIMR equivalent observations over a data set of validated sea ice concentration (SIC) values. An optimal estimation retrieval method (OEM) is used which can use input from different channel combinations to retrieve seven geophysical parameters (sea ice concentration, multi-year ice fraction, ice surface temperature, columnar water vapor, liquid water path, over ocean wind speed, and sea surface temperature). An advantage of CIMR over existing radiometers is that it would provide higher spatial resolution observations at the lower frequency channels (6.9, 10.65, and 18.7 GHz) which are less sensitive to atmospheric influence. This enables the passive microwave based retrieval of SIC and other surface parameters with higher resolution and lower uncertainty than is currently possible. An information content analysis expands the comparison between AMSR2 and CIMR to all retrievable surface and atmospheric parameters. This analysis quantifies the contributions to the observed signal and highlights the differences between different input channel combinations. The higher resolution of the low frequency CIMR channels allow for unprecedented detail to be achieved in Arctic passive microwave sea ice retrievals. The presence of 1.4 GHz channels on board CIMR opens up the possibility for thin sea ice thickness (SIT) retrieval. A combination of collocated AMSR2 and SMOS observations is used to simulate a full CIMR suite of measurements, and the OEM is modified to include SIT as a retrieval parameter. The output from different retrieval configurations is compared with an operational SIT product. The CIMR instrument can provide increased accuracy for SIC retrieval at very high resolutions with a combination of the 18.7 and 36.5 GHz channels while also maintaining sensitivity for atmospheric water vapor retrieval. In combination with the 1.4 GHz channels, SIT can be added as an eighth retrieval parameter with performance on par with existing operational products. © 2020.

This event is commonly referred to as an “ice push” or “ivu,” the Inupiat word for an ice ridging event. In this article, we report the process and impact of this event by combining traditional ecological knowledge, news accounts, meteorological data, remote sensing, and ground surveys. The midwinter detachment of shorefast ice was caused by a low-pressure system and wind-driven swell that destabilized shorefast ice, while northerly winds developed an open-water lead offshore to the eventual impact area. These conditions preceded the impact of an extratropical cyclone on December 31, 2016, when powerful southerly winds and the second largest storm surge in Kotzebue Sound since at least 2003 led to the compressional failure of the ice cover under uniaxial loading perpendicular to the southern coastline of the Cape, resulting in the ice push event. Ice-pushed debris was shoved up to 6.2 m above mean high water, with ∼3.5 km of coastline experiencing net erosion. The largest accumulation of ice-pushed debris had a volume of 1,000 m3, and rose 3 + m above the surrounding ground surface even after roughly 6 months of melting. On low-lying areas, driftwood and other debris were deposited 130 m landward by the surge 5.0 m above mean high water, indicating the potential threat of such events to property, infrastructure, and, in this case, archeological sites and associated cultural resources. The anomalous environmental and sea ice conditions that preceded the ivu seem to suggest that such events may occur more frequently in a warmer Arctic. © Copyright © 2020 Bogardus, Maio, Mason, Buzard, Mahoney and de Wit.","Alaska; Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Cape Espenberg; Chukchi Sea; Kotzebue Sound; United States; Debris; Erosion; Landforms; Offshore oil well production; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Archeological sites; Cultural resources; Extratropical cyclones; Low pressure systems; Meteorological data; Sea ice conditions; Traditional ecological knowledge; Uni-axial loading; arctic environment; climate change; climate effect; coastal erosion; coastal zone; glaciology; ice cover; low pressure system; sea ice; storm surge; warming; winter; Storms","Arctic; Cape Espenberg; climate change; erosion; ivu; Kotzebue Sound; sea ice; storm surge","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090766937"

These trends have been particularly severe along the rock coast of southern Svalbard. Concerns have been raised over the potential for higher energy storms and longer ice-free open water seasons to increase the exposure of Arctic coasts, and consequently the concentration of infrastructure critical to Arctic community survival, to enhanced rates of erosion. Here we present and apply innovative remote sensing, monitoring and process analyses to assess the impact of recent coastal climatic changes. High resolution analyses demonstrate that the small scale (<0.001 m3) changes that are rarely considered quantitatively exhibit geomorphic responses distinct from those of larger, more readily detected cliff failures. We monitor temperature depth profiles in both the shore platform and the cliff face to show rock sensitivity over time to both global and local influences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of thermal processes on Arctic rock cliffs relative to platforms, and may hold implications for understanding strandflat development rates. New three-dimensional thermography (thermal mapping) and process zone characterisation has been used to spatially assess the sensitivity of Arctic rock coast responses to contemporary processes on deglaciating coasts. Through the spatial and temporal analyses of key geomorphic behaviour zones and comparison over a range of sites, the complex and changing interplay between subaerial weathering and cryogenic and intertidal processes has been highlighted. These data challenge long standing assumptions over the future of Arctic rock coasts and identify new, focused lines of enquiry on the decline in cryogenic processes and understanding the sensitivity of Arctic rock coasts to climatic changes. © 2019 The Author(s)","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Cryogenics; Landforms; Mapping; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Rocks; Sea ice; Weathering; Geomorphic response; High resolution analysis; Laser scanning; Mean annual temperatures; Spatial and temporal analysis; Structure from motion; Temperature depth profiles; Temperature mapping; climate change; deglaciation; geomorphology; ice thickness; laser method; mapping method; open water; photogrammetry; remote sensing; rocky shore; sea ice; shore platform; temperature effect; Climate change","Arctic geomorphology; Climate change; Photogrammetry; Rock coasts; Structure from motion; Temperature mapping; Terrestial laser scanning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075206330"

Seasonal snow cover, which is sensitive to temperature and precipitation changes, is therefore expected to undergo both spatial and temporal changes in response to the changing climate in Svalbard. This will in turn have implications for timing of terrestrial productivity, which is closely linked to the disappearance of seasonal snow. We have produced a 20-year snow cover fraction time series for the Svalbard archipelago, derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra data to map and identify changes in the timing of the first snow-free day (FSFD) for the period 2000-2019. Moreover, we investigate the influence of sea ice concentration (SIC) variations on FSFD and how FSFD is related to the start of the phenological growing season in Svalbard. Our results revealed clear patterns of earlier FSFD in the southern and central parts of the archipelago, while the northernmost parts exhibit little change or trend toward later FSFD, resulting in weaker trends in summer and winter duration. We found that FSFD preceded the onset of the phenological growing season with an average difference of 12.4 days for the entire archipelago, but with large regional variations that are indicative of temperature dependence. Lastly, we found a significant correlation between variations of time-integrated SIC and variations in FSFD, which maximizes when correlating SIC northeast of Svalbard with FSFD averaged over Nordaustlandet. Prolonged sea ice cover in the spring was correlated with late snow disappearance, while lower-than-average sea ice cover correlated with early snow disappearance, indicating that proximity to sea ice plays an important role in regulating the timing of snow disappearance on land through influencing the regional air temperature and therefore rate of spring snowmelt. © 2020, by the authors.","Radiometers; Sea ice; Springs (components); Temperature distribution; Timing circuits; Average difference; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Precipitation change; Regional variation; Sea ice concentration; Seasonal snow cover; Spatial and temporal changes; Temperature dependence; Snow","Arctic climate change; Remote sensing; Sea ice variability; Snow cover; Vegetation growth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084269608"

This work proposes a methodology for determining the speed and direction of the sea surface current and wind waves spectrum by measurements of X-band Doppler radar. Based on the Doppler Effect, it is possible to measure the orbital velocities of wind waves on the sea surface, the velocities of breaking waves, the velocities of the sea surface current and the speed parameters of other oceanic dynamic processes. Using the basic expressions of the wave theory of free waves on water, it is possible to restore the heights of wind waves without additional calibration. Theoretical numerical simulation of the Doppler velocity of the Bragg waves in the field of wind waves and currents were carried out. The simulation used a two-scale model of microwave scattering on an wavy water surface, taking into account the shading of the sea surface by wave crests. A correlation analysis of the surface current, calculated through hydro meteorological parameters and Doppler radar panoramas, showed a maximum correlation coefficient for a velocity value is about 0.88 with a root mean square error of 8 cm/s, and for a direction is about 0.98 with a root mean square error of 14 degrees. The work shows the possibility to recover wind wave spectra from the data on the Doppler shift of microwave radio waves.

However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008–2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States. In addition, methods presented in this study can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of an individual system or region. © 2019 The Author(s)","Florida [United States]; United States; algae; Cyanobacteria; Algae control; Geodetic satellites; Remote sensing; Space optics; Water quality; Algorithm performance; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacterial blooms; Harmful algal blooms; Inland waters; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Satellite observations; Satellite remote sensing; algal bloom; cyanobacterium; Envisat; ice cover; performance assessment; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel; Lakes","Cyanobacteria; Harmful algal blooms; Inland waters; Remote sensing; Water quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076630080"

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. An overview of 16 sites of coastal erosion monitoring at the fastest retreating key sites across the Russian Arctic was made. All of these coasts are composed by permafrost, creating specific conditions of their evolution and making them very sensitive to sea ice reduction and ice-free period increase along with the temperature growth, resulting from the ongoing climate change. Erosion of permafrost coasts is among the fastest destructive geomorphic processes in the Arctic. For each key area, data from literature on sediment composition, coastal morphology, permafrost properties and climate evolution were collected, assessed and compared. Rates of coastal retreat in the XX-XXI century derived from direct field measurements and processing of remotely sensed data were analyzed; mechanisms and drivers of coastal erosion were estimated. Patterns of spatial variability and temporal evolution of the coasts were suggested. The influence of different factors of coastal dynamics on thermodenudation (destruction of the bluffs during thawing of permafrost and ground ice) and thermoabrasion (erosion resulting from direct contact of waves with the frozen bluff) was estimated. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.","Arctic; Russian Federation; abrasion; coastal erosion; denudation; geomorphology; permafrost; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial variation; thawing","climate change; Coastal erosion; ice-free period; permafrost; Russian Arctic","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085528386"

Due to the challenges of accessing the Arctic, remote sensing has been used to obtain large-scale longitudinal data. These data are often associated with errors and biases that must be considered when incorporated into research. However, obtaining reference data for validation is often prohibitively expensive or practically unfeasible. We used the motion of 20 passively drifting high-accuracy GPS telemetry collars originally deployed on polar bears, Ursus maritimus, in western Hudson Bay, Canada, to validate a widely used sea ice drift dataset produced by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Our results showed that the NSIDC model tended to underestimate the horizontal and vertical (i.e., u and v) components of drift. Consequently, the NSIDC model underestimated magnitude of drift, particularly at high ice speeds. Modelled drift direction was unbiased; however, it was less precise at lower drift speeds. Research using these drift data should consider integrating these biases into their analyses, particularly where absolute ground speed or direction is necessary. Further investigation is required into the sources of error, particularly in under-examined areas without in situ data.  © 2020 Author(s).","Canada; Hudson Bay; Ursus maritimus; concentration (composition); ice drift; ice-ocean interaction; satellite altimetry; satellite data; sea ice; telemetry","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086918422"

A crude oil-in-sea ice mesocosm experiment was conducted to identify oil-partitioning trends in sea ice and determine the effect of weathering on crude oil permittivity. The dissolution of the lighter fractions increased with decreasing bulk oil-concentration because of greater oil-brine interface area. Movement of the oil towards the ice surface predominated over dissolution process when oil concentrations exceeded 1 mg/mL. Evaporation decreased oil permittivity due to losses of low molecular weight alkanes and increased asphaltene-resin interactions. Photooxidation increased the permittivity of the crude oil due to the transformation of branched aromatics to esters and ketones.

However, a variety of alternative glacial origins for these enigmatic landforms are also consistent with the available geological and geomorphological evidence, although previous studies have barely considered such alternative processes of formation. From detailed geophysical, sedimentological and remote-sensing studies at two field sites, we demonstrate that: (i) the wastage of stagnating glacier ice is a viable alternative explanation for the formation of ramparted depressions in Wales; (ii) the glacial geomorphology and geology of these landforms is analogous to supraglacial and subglacial landforms from the last Laurentide and Fennoscandian ice sheets; (iii) these landforms have significant potential for characterising the nature of deglaciation around the margins of the Irish Sea during the last glacial cycle, and may record evidence for the overextension and stagnation of the south-eastern margin of the Irish Sea Ice Stream; and (iv) investigations of ramparted depressions within formerly glaciated terrains must consider both glacial and periglacial mechanisms of formation.

The investigation on the accelerated decline in the Arctic sea-ice was performed using different datasets of passive microwave satellite imagery and model reanalysis. Arctic sea-ice declined rapidly in the boreal summer (-10.2 ± 0.8 %decade−1) during 1979–2018, while, the highest decline in sea-ice extent (SIE) (i.e., 82,300 km2 yr−1/-12.8 ± 1.1 %decade−1) is reported in the month of September. Since late 1979, the SIE recorded the sixth-lowest decline during September 2018 (4.71 million km2). Incidentally, the records of twelve lowest extents in the satellite era occurred in the last twelve years. The loss of SIE and sea-ice concentration (SIC) are attributed to the impacts of land-ocean warming and the northward heat advection into the Arctic Ocean. This has resulted in considerable thinning of sea-ice thickness (SIT) and reduction in the multiyear ice (MYI) for summer 2018. Global and Arctic land-ocean temperatures have increased by ~0.78 °C and ~3.1 °C, respectively, over the past 40 years (1979–2018) while substantial warming rates have been identified in the Arctic Ocean (~3.5 °C in the last 40-year) relative to the Arctic land (~2.8 °C in the last 40-year). The prevailing ocean-atmospheric warming in the Arctic, the SIE, SIC and SIT have reduced, resulting in the decline of the sea-ice volume (SIV) at the rate of -3.0 ± 0.2 (1000 km3 decade−1). Further, it observed that the SIV in September 2018 was three times lower than September 1979. The present study demonstrates the linkages of sea-ice dynamics to ice drifting and accelerated melting due to persistent low pressure, high air-ocean temperatures, supplemented by the coupled ocean-atmospheric forcing. © 2020","","Arctic sea-ice; Atmospheric science; Climate change; Earth sciences; Environmental science; Global temperature; Multiyear ice; Natural hazards; Oceanography; Sea-ice thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089352859"

Starting in the mid-2000s, the Argo-float network was extended into higher-latitude regions in front of the sea ice zone, in particular in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Integrated data, including several shipboard observations, enables us to investigate the relationship between interannual changes in the SAM and the surface-to-2000-m oceanic state. In this paper, we show that recent interannual changes in the wintertime subsurface oceanic state in the Indian sector are consistent with the fast response to the SAM proposed by previous model studies. In particular, the change in salinity is highly correlated with SAM variation, which has not been previously reported. © 2019 The Author(s)","Indian Ocean; Southern Ocean; annual variation; climate change; data set; salinity; sea ice; shipborne measurement; Southern Hemisphere","Argo float; Climate change; Southern ocean; Subsurface water","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075890878"

Here, a high-resolution (2-km) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared satellite data set featuring spatial and temporal characteristics of 17 Arctic polynya regions for the winter seasons 2002/2003 to 2017/2018 is directly compared to an akin low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) passive microwave data set for 2002/2003 to 2010/2011. The MODIS data set is purely based on a 1-D energy-balance model, where thin-ice thicknesses (≤ 20 cm) are directly derived from ice-surface temperature swath data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data on a quasi-daily basis. Thin-ice thicknesses in the AMSR-E data set are derived empirically. Important polynya properties such as areal extent and potential thermodynamic ice production can be estimated from both pan-Arctic data sets. Although independently derived, our results show that both data sets feature quite similar spatial and temporal variations of polynya area (POLA) and ice production (IP), which suggests a high reliability. The average POLA (average accumulated IP) for all Arctic polynyas combined derived from both MODIS and AMSR-E are 1.99×105 km2 (1.34×103 km3) and 2.29×105 km2 (1.31×103 km3), respectively. Narrow polynyas in areas such as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are notably better resolved by MODIS. Analysis of 16 winter seasons provides an evaluation of long-term trends in POLA and IP, revealing the significant increase of ice formation in polynyas along the Siberian coast. ©2019.

The often observation of the film near aquaculture facilities has raised awareness on the possibility of the linkage between the development of the film and the anthropogenic activities taking place on site (i.e. artificial feeding and liquid waste). This study aims to investigate the possibility of the detection of biogenic oil film on optical satellite images and discriminate it from other oceanographic phenomena. For the purposes of the study we have used a Sentinel-2 (S2) dataset consisted of 73 images for the year 2019 to detect the film on three aquaculture areas. An automatic procedure was developed on a Python based algorithm which included the following stages: (a) downloading images, (b) preprocessing the input data, (c) identifying dark formations in the adjacent fish farming area, (d) extracting attribute tables with the statistical characteristics of the formations (shape, area, etc.), (e) classification of formations as biogenic film or other (lookalike) and (f) extraction of biogenic film vectors. The developed algorithm was able to detect biogenic oil film successfully however some misleading results regarding the decision of true or false positive (biogenic oil film or lookalike) was evidenced. The efficiency of the algorithm was tested against manual classification with overall accuracy 82,6%. As further step the results of this study should be validated with in-situ measurements and further work is required to verify the results obtained by testing the methods in other sites.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

It affects the Antarctic climate and ecological system. In this study, the first high-resolution, long time series of the landfast ice edge from 2006 to 2011 and 2016 to 2017 is presented. The dataset was produced based on the improved net gradient difference algorithm using 2470 SAR scenes from ENVISAT and Sentinel-1A/B as well as manual analysis of MODIS imagery to fill in SAR data gaps. The study results show that the landfast ice area in November for all studied years was approximately 49.49 ± 3.25 × 104 km2, accounting for about 3%–4% of the total Antarctic sea ice area. The maximum area was 55.70 × 104 km2 in November 2007, compared to the minimum area 44.01 × 104 km2 in 2011. The area in West Antarctica was about 40% of that in East Antarctica. The distribution of landfast ice in Antarctica has significant regional differences. The extent in the Indian Ocean sector is the maximum with a mean value of 16.49 ± 1.1 × 104 km2; however, the ratio of the landfast ice area to the sea ice area in the Pacific Ocean sector is the highest. Twenty-four landfast ice zones with groups of small, grounded icebergs were identified, most of which were located in East Antarctica, particularly along the Wilkes Land and Oates Land. Two cases are presented to illustrate how giant, grounded icebergs affected landfast ice.

Several studies in the high Arctic have reported increased ice drift speeds, and consequently, polar bears Ursus maritimus in these areas expended more energy on counterice movement for station-keeping. However, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of ice drift in Hudson Bay (HB) and its implications for the declining Western Hudson Bay (WH) polar bear subpopulation. Using sea ice drift data from 1987-2015 and polar bear satellite telemetry location data from 2004-2015, we examined trends in drift speeds in HB, polar bear movement relative to drift, and assessed annual and individual variation. In contrast to other areas of the Arctic, we did not find an increase in ice drift speed over the period examined. However, variability in ice drift speed increased over time, which suggests reduced habitat predictability. Polar bear movement direction was not strongly counter to ice drift in any month, and ice drift speed and direction had little effect on bear movement rates and, thus, energy expenditure. On an annual scale, we found individuals varied in their exposure and response to ice drift, which may contribute to variability in body condition. However, the lack of a long-term increase in ice drift speed suggests this is unlikely to be the main factor affecting the body condition decline observed in the WH subpopulation. Our results contrast findings in other subpopulations and demonstrate the need for subpopulation-specific research and risk evaluation. © 2020 Inter-Research.

'CoastWatch', https://coastwatch.noaa.gov) is to improve decision outcomes by facilitating the use of ocean satellite data in applications and research. NOAA CoastWatch provides free and open access to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate. Satellites make observations from which several ocean, coastal, and inland water parameters can be derived. Ocean observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements. While NOAA may be known for operating satellites for use in weather forecasting by the National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA also routinely produces satellite-based ocean data products in support of all NOAA mission services including NWS, National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service, and the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. These ocean products are freely and openly available to everyone, including government, academic, commercial and general public users. NOAA CoastWatch has existed since 1989 when the primary focus was on distributing sea surface temperature data for continental US regions. With time and in response to the continual development of ocean observations from space, the CoastWatch scope has expanded. CoastWatch satellite data products now include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (chlorophyll, etc.), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. These products have global and regional coverage and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and/or non-NOAA satellite missions. We serve a broad audience who use ocean satellite data in operational oceanographic applications. Here, the word 'operational' has an expanded definition compared with traditional weather service usage. The program is organized as a 'hub and spokes'. The 'hub' has the primary processing responsibilities and co-located with the ocean satellite environmental data record (EDR; i.e., Level 2) producers. The 'spokes' are regional Nodes distributed geographically and across NOAA mission line offices, CoastWatch is well-positioned to bridge upstream ocean EDR producers with downstream user needs. The new interactive data portal enables search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading. Casual or occasional users can search, view and download data products using online interactive tools, including a space and time search. Routine 'power' users can use command-line scripts to automate their access. CoastWatch maintains a helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc. The OceanWatch Monitor (https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/om/) enables the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets and an internal Data Monitor tracks operational production output. Beyond the helpdesk, CoastWatch offers training courses, develops tutorials to educate and guide users from the novice to the expert. CoastWatch also develops and distributes CoastWatch Utilities (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/user-resources/coastwatch-utilities.html), a software package, to help users analyze and visualize satellite data products. Some examples of data products, discovery and access pathways, tutorials and several user applications will be presented. © 2019 Marine Technology Society.","Application programs; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Coastal zones; Data visualization; Fisheries; HTTP; Marine applications; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Weather forecasting; Weather information services; Weather satellites; CoastWatch; National Marine Fisheries Services; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National Weather Services; NOAA; Ocean; Satellite environmental data; Sea surface temperature (SST); Oceanography","Coast; CoastWatch; NOAA; Ocean; Remote sensing; Satellite","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079057057"

Using the DMS and reflectivity of ATM L1B, leads are detected to define local sea level height. The total freeboard is then obtained and converted to ice thickness. The estimated mean sea-ice thickness values are found to be in the 0.48-0.99 m range. Along the N-S track, sea ice was thinner southward rather than northward of the fluxgate, resulting in two peaks of modal thickness: 0.35 m (south) and 0.7 m (north). This supports that new ice produced in coastal polynyas is transported northward by katabatic winds off the ice-shelf. The lowest (2%) elevation method used for freeboard retrieval for ICESat is also tested for ATM data. It is found that the lowest elevation method tends to overestimate freeboard, but mean values are less affected than mode values. Using mean thickness values of ICESat and ATM along the 'fluxgate', separating the shelf from the deep ocean, the exported ice volume at this 'fluxgate' is found to be higher during the ICESat years (2003-2008) than during the IceBridge year (2013).

The objective of ACLOUD was to study Arctic boundary layer and mid-level clouds and their role in Arctic amplification. Two research aircraft (Polar 5 and 6) jointly performed 22 research flights over the transition zone between open ocean and closed sea ice. Both aircraft were equipped with identical instrumentation for measurements of basic meteorological parameters, as well as for turbulent and radiative energy fluxes. In addition, on Polar 5 active and passive remote sensing instruments were installed, while Polar 6 operated in situ instruments to characterize cloud and aerosol particles as well as trace gases. A detailed overview of the specifications, data processing, and data quality is provided here. It is shown that the scientific analysis of the ACLOUD data benefits from the coordinated operation of both aircraft. By combining the cloud remote sensing techniques operated on Polar 5, the synergy of multi-instrument cloud retrieval is illustrated. The remote sensing methods were validated using truly collocated in situ and remote sensing observations. The data of identical instruments operated on both aircraft were merged to extend the spatial coverage of mean atmospheric quantities and turbulent and radiative flux measurement. Therefore, the data set of the ACLOUD campaign provides comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observations characterizing the cloudy Arctic atmosphere.

The greening phenomenon, together with warming, sea-level rise and sea-ice decline, represents highly credible evidence of anthropogenic climate change. In this Review, we examine the detection of the greening signal, its causes and its consequences. Greening is pronounced over intensively farmed or afforested areas, such as in China and India, reflecting human activities. However, strong greening also occurs in biomes with low human footprint, such as the Arctic, where global change drivers play a dominant role. Vegetation models suggest that CO2 fertilization is the main driver of greening on the global scale, with other factors being notable at the regional scale. Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by increasing the carbon sink on land and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling. Coupling high temporal and fine spatial resolution remote-sensing observations with ground measurements, increasing sampling in the tropics and Arctic, and modelling Earth systems in more detail will further our insights into the greening of Earth. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108571999"

The processes that occur in the polynyas affect the primary productivity and the formation of bottom water due to brine effect. Despite the Polynyas were mainly investigated using remote sensing, the ocean reanalysis product are becoming an important tool to these studies. This study compared the eleven polynyas areas representation in the reanalysis products and the observations of satellites from sea ice concentration data (by the AMSR-E sensor). The daily average areas of the eleven Antarctic‘s coastal polynyas were calculated in the freezing period (2013 - 2016). The representation of the areas was consistent with previously reported by the literature. It is possible that the most improved resolution portrays accurate and minor areas. Salinity increased in almost all polynyas throughout their development, but there was no correlation with the associated areas. There was significant correlation with winds direction that favors the sea ice divergence, and hence the sea ice formation to each polynya. Finally, understanding their variability allows the refinement of the models by detailing in such areas, mostly as regards in the processes into continental shelf. © 2020, Universidade Estadual Paulista.

Variability in the sea-ice conditions strongly influence the survival and reproduction of animals that are synchronized with the seasonality of sea ice. Although the linkages between Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) and sea-ice conditions are well established, the spatial and temporal scales at which sea ice affects individuals and populations are poorly known. Using 23 years of penguin breeding success and remote-sensing data of sea ice, we investigate the spatial and temporal scales at which sea-ice changes best explain variations in the reproductive success of Adélie penguins at Pointe Géologie, East Antarctica. The best spatial scale encompassed all foraging areas exploited and all the sea-ice conditions encountered by penguins over a breeding season. There was a consistent influence of sea-ice concentration during the guard stage on the overall breeding success. We demonstrate the importance of considering sea ice at a fine temporal scale rather than using an average value over the breeding season to best explain reproductive success in Adélie penguins. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Antarctica; East Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Animalia; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae; aquatic organism; bird; breeding season; concentration (composition); reproductive success; sea ice; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis; time series; vulnerability","East Antarctica; Pygoscelis adeliae; Sea-ice concentration; Spatial and temporal scales; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068760058"

To determine the separability of these two varying but similar appearing low backscatter ocean surfaces, multipolarization features are utilized from both SAR datasets. The discrimination is evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test. All imagery was obtained during several sea ice campaigns in the Arctic Ocean and separate oil spill campaigns in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico, with each campaign collecting in situ observations. We observe that the polarization difference (VV-HH) reliably separates the mineral oil slicks and newly formed sea ice areas using UAVSAR images, due to the low noise floor and subsequent high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiometric performance of the airborne system. The comparably higher noise floor and related lower SNR hampers the separability in the RS-2 images. Simulated noise floors were generated by adding white Gaussian noise to the UAVSAR data, which show that discrimination between the two low backscatter phenomena using multipolarization features is possible, provided that both datasets are still well above the noise floor. The pixel resolution has a limited effect on the separability.

To make the best use of these observations, in this paper we develop a multi-sensor optimal data merging (MODM) method to merge any number of different sea ice observations. Since such merged data are independent on model forecast, they are valid for model initialization and model validation. Based on the maximum likelihood estimation theory, we prove that any model assimilated with the merged data is equivalent to assimilating the original multi-sensor data. This greatly facilitates sea ice data assimilation, particularly for operational forecast with limited computational resources. We apply the MODM method to merge sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice thickness (SIT), respectively, in the Arctic. For SIC merging, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data are merged together with the Norwegian Ice Service ice chart. This substantially reduces the uncertainties at the ice edge and in the coastal areas. For SIT merging, the daily Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data is merged with the weekly-mean merged CryoSat-2 and SMOS (CS2SMOS) data. This generates a new daily CS2SMOS SIT data with better spatial coverage for the whole Arctic. © 2020, Editorial Office of Advances in Polar Science.

In HMA, air temperature and precipitation shifts or increases are reflected in the timing of snowmelt onset. In this study, a long-term series (1979-2018) of snow melt onset time is first derived using spaceborne microwave radiometer data, following which the long-term trend of snow and ice- melt time of Tienshan, Altay, Karakorom, Hindu Kush, and Pamir is analyzed. Previous studies proposed many algorithms for detecting snowmelt onset and freeze-up using microwave remote sensing. The previously proposed algorithms were extensively applied to polar regions (including the Antarctic, Siberia, Greenland, and sea ice surface), where the impact of topography or mixed pixel problem is relatively small. However, for high mountain regions, complex topography and a potential mixed pixel issue would result in a very complicated and noisy satellite-observed active and passive microwave remote sensing signal. This study thus proposes a recently developed snow and ice-melt detection algorithm in which, for passive microwave data, a median filter is first applied to the original signal (brightness temperature) to suppress random, small, or short-duration signal variations. The differential average derivative of a particular date is then calculated using the time series first-order derivative as the average first-order derivative of a specific count of observations after this particular date. Generally, the differential average derivative is an indicator of sudden changes in time series brightness temperature. Results show that the melt onset time in the majority of HMA occurs earlier, except in the case of the Karakorom Mountains and a part of the West Kunlun Mountains. Moreover, the melt onset time derived from satellite morning (6:00 local time) pass data shows that the melt onset time of Karakorom, the West Kulun Mountains, and southeast Tibet remains stable, or even occurs later. The trend of southeast Tibet is unique, with its earlier melt based on afternoon (18:00 local time) pass data and its later melt based on morning pass data. This suggests that the melt-refreeze period of southeast Tibet is increasing together with the increasing diurnal temperature difference. Then, a 2-m air temperature in ERA5 reanalysis data is used for comparison with melt onset time for validation and analysis. ERA5 is the latest climate reanalysis produced by ECMWF, providing hourly data on many atmospheric, land-surface, and sea-state parameters. A strong correlation exists between monthly average air temperatures and melt onset time, with the maximum linear fit R2 of 0.76. This strong correlation indicates the good data quality of ERA5 reanalysis and melt onset time. The unique trend of southeast Tibet can also be explained using ERA5 reanalysis data, which show that the monthly mean daily maximum air temperature is increasing, but the monthly mean daily minimum air temperature is decreasing. This renders a slope of the linear fit of melt onset data in the period of 1988-2018 in the whole HMA region. Because the satellite overpasses time difference, data from only 1988 to 2018 is used for trend analysis. The analysis of the relationship between the melt onset time change rate and elevation shows that the areas with an earlier melt are almost all located in low-elevation regions, and the rate of melt time change is positively correlated with elevation. This suggests that low-elevation regions are more affected by climate changes.

Sea ice leads contribute to the sea ice production and are sources for the formation of dense water which affects the ocean circulation. Atmospheric and ocean models strongly rely on observational data to describe the respective state of the sea ice since numerical models are not able to produce sea ice leads explicitly. For the Arctic, some lead datasets are available, but for the Antarctic, no such data yet exist. Our study presents a new algorithm with which leads are automatically identified in satellite thermal infrared images. A variety of lead metrics is used to distinguish between true leads and detection artefacts with the use of fuzzy logic. We evaluate the outputs and provide pixel-wise uncertainties. Our data yield daily sea ice lead maps at a resolution of 1 km2 for the winter months November-April 2002/03-2018/19 (Arctic) and April-September 2003-2019 (Antarctic), respectively.

Attempts to extend ice-core derived biomass to broader scales using remote sensing approaches has largely focused on the use of under-ice spectral irradiance. Normalized difference index (NDI) based algorithms that relate the attenuation of irradiance by the snow-ice-algal ensemble at specific wavelengths to biomass have been used to explain up to 79% of the biomass of algae in limited areas. Application of these algorithms to datasets collected using tethered remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) has begun, generating methods for spatial sampling at scales and spatial resolution not achievable with ice-core sampling. Successful integration of radiometers with untethered autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) offers even greater capability to survey broader regions to explore the spatial heterogeneity of sea ice algal communities. This work describes the pilot use of an AUV fitted with a multispectral irradiance sensor to estimate ice-algal biomass along transects beneath land-fast sea ice (∼2 m thick with minimal snow cover) in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The AUV obtained continuous, repeatable, multi-band irradiance data, suitable for NDI-type approaches, over transects of 500 m, with an instrument footprint of 4 m in diameter. Algorithms were developed using local measurements of ice algae biomass and spectral attenuation of sea ice and were able to explain 40% of biomass variability. Relatively poor performance of the algorithms in predicting biomass limited the confidence that could be placed in biomass estimates from AUV data. This was attributed to the larger footprint size of the optical sensors integrating small-scale biomass variability more effectively than the ice core in the platelet-dominated ice algal habitat. Our results support continued development of remote-sensing of sea ice algal biomass at m–km spatial scales using optical methods, but caution that footprint sizes of calibration data (e.g., coring) must be compatible with optical sensors used. AUVs offer autonomous survey techniques that could be applied to better understand the horizontal variability of sea ice algae from nearshore ice out to the marginal ice zone. © 2019 Forrest, Lund-Hansen, Sorrell, Bowden-Floyd, Lucieer, Cossu, Lange and Hawes.","Antarctica; East Antarctica; McMurdo Sound; Southern Ocean; Algae; Autonomous vehicles; Biomass; Optical sensors; Remote sensing; Remotely operated vehicles; Sea ice; Snow; Surveys; Antarctica; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Horizontal variability; Ice algae; McMurdo; Normalized difference indices; Remote sensing approaches; Spatial heterogeneity; algal community; algorithm; autonomous underwater vehicle; irradiance; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; Autonomous underwater vehicles","Antarctica; Autonomous underwater vehicles; Biomass; Ice algae; McMurdo; Normalized difference indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069537894"

Terrestrial laserscanning and unmanned aerial vehicles provide very high resolution data with high accuracy. Automatic cameras have become a valuable source of information-mostly in a qualitative manner-in recent years. The availability of satellite data with very high revisiting time has gained momentum through the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions, offering new application potential for Earth observation. This paper reviews the status of recent techniques such as terrestrial laserscanning, remote sensed imagery, and synthetic aperture radar in monitoring high mountain environments with a particular focus on the impact of new platforms such as Sentinel-1 and-2 as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The study area comprises the high mountain glacial environment at the Pasterze Glacier, Austria. The area is characterized by a highly dynamic geomorphological evolution and by being subject to intensive scientific research as well as long-term monitoring. We primarily evaluate landform classification and process characterization for: (i) the proglacial lake; (ii) icebergs; (iii) the glacier river; (iv) valley-bottom processes; (v) slope processes; and (vi) rock wall processes. We focus on assessing the potential of every single method both in spatial and temporal resolution in characterizing different geomorphic processes. Examples of the individual techniques are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of: (i) morphometric analysis; (ii) applicability in high alpine regions; and (iii) comparability of the methods among themselves.

In general, the annual average of global ocean POC flux is about 8.5-14.3 Gt C yr-1 for period of 2003-2018. In the spatial dimension, the POC flux in the mid-latitude ocean (30-60°) is higher than that in the low-latitude (0-30°). The POC flux in Continental Margins with water depth less than 2000 m accounted for 30% of global ocean, which should receive more attention in global carbon cycle research. In the time dimension, the global POC flux decreases year by year generally, but the POC flux abnormally decreases during El Niño and increases during La Niña.

Polynyas were identified visually in the fields of sea ice concentration, and their characteristics were determined semi-automatically using the tools of the GIS system - the Arctic Portal. Eight groups of polynyas of the Kara Sea are considered according to the regions of formation: Southeast Frantz Josef Land, Northern Novozemel'skaya, South Novozemel'skaya, Amderminskaya, Yamal'skaya, Ob'-Eniseiskaya, Central Karskaya, West Severozemel'skaya. During the observation period, 2109 polynyas were found. The average, maximum values of the areas were calculated and the average lifetime of the polynyas was determined. The results obtained indicate a change in the stability of polynyas formed near Novaya Zemlya in the southwestern part of the sea. In the dynamics of the areas, a positive trend was revealed, indicating an increase in the area of polynyas in the Kara Sea by 3.64 km2per year. The analysis of the characteristics of the sandy polynyas according to satellite observations allows us to consider the polynyas of the Kara Sea both as a permanent element of ice conditions, contributing to safe and low-cost navigation at sea, and as evidence of the ongoing climatic changes. © 2020 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery spanning over almost two decades of daily observations at a resolution of up to 250 m provides a good resource for deriving long-term ocean kinematics from sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we present a newly developed automatic algorithm to retrieve dynamic measurements of sea ice from these images. We describe the methodology by presenting results acquired along the East Greenland Current (ECG) for 6.5 weeks in the spring of 2017. During this period, our ice floe tracker was used to identify and track ice floes with length scales ranging from 8 to 65 km. By effectively filtering atmospheric conditions from MODIS images, ice floes were tracked for up to ten consecutive days, and a total of 1061 trajectories were retrieved. A southward mean sea ice flow associated with the ECG was observed along with deviations in both direction and magnitude, suggesting the effect of an underlying turbulent eddy field. The absolute position and tracking errors associated with our method are 255 m and 0.65 cm/s, respectively, each derived from a comparison between manually and automatically identified ice floes. Going forward, our methodology will be employed to process longer time sequences to analyze nonlinear interactions between drifting ice floes and the upper ocean turbulent eddy field in the ECG as well as to investigate other prominent regions of the Arctic Ocean. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean; East Greenland Current; Electrocardiography; Oceanography; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Arctic; East greenland currents; Ice floes; Lagrangian trajectories; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer satellites; MODIS; Nonlinear interactions; Satellite observations; algorithm; ice flow; Lagrangian analysis; MODIS; observational method; satellite imagery; sea ice; upper ocean; Sea ice","Arctic; Ice floes; MODIS; Remote sensing; Sea ice tracking","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073034606"

However, due to the differences in footprint sizes and noise levels of the measurement techniques, as well as sea ice's variability across scales, it is challenging to carry out inter-comparison or consistently study these observations. In this study we focus on the remote sensing of sea ice thickness parameters and carry out the following: (1) the analysis of variability and its statistical scaling for typical parameters and (2) the consistency study between airborne and satellite measurements. By using collocating data between Operation IceBridge and CryoSat-2 (CS-2) in the Arctic, we show that consistency exists between the variability in radar freeboard estimations, although CryoSat-2 has higher noise levels. Specifically, we notice that the noise levels vary among different CryoSat-2 products, and for the European Space Agency (ESA) CryoSat-2 freeboard product the noise levels are at about 14 and 20 cm for first-year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI), respectively. On the other hand, for Operation IceBridge and NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), it is shown that the variability in snow (or total) freeboard is quantitatively comparable despite more than a 5-year time difference between the two datasets. Furthermore, by using Operation IceBridge data, we also find widespread negative covariance between ice freeboard and snow depth, which only manifests on small spatial scales (40 m for first-year ice and about 80 to 120 m for multi-year ice). This statistical relationship highlights that the snow cover reduces the overall topography of the ice cover. Besides this, there is prevalent positive covariability between snow depth and snow freeboard across a wide range of spatial scales. The variability and consistency analysis calls for more process-oriented observations and modeling activities to elucidate key processes governing snow-ice interaction and sea ice variability on various spatial scales. The statistical results can also be utilized in improving both radar and laser altimetry as well as the validation of sea ice and snow prognostic models. © Author(s) 2020.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; CryoSat; ice thickness; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; sea ice; snow cover","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081250667"

The difficulties in the precise monitoring of iceberg calving lie with the coexistence of ice shelf advances and calving. The manual location of iceberg calving is time-consuming and painstaking, while achieving precise extraction has mostly relied on the surface textural characteristics of the ice shelves and the quality of the images. Here, we propose a new and efficient method of separating the expansion and calving processes of ice shelves. We visualized the extension process by simulating a new coastline, based on the ice velocity, and detected the calved area using the simulated coastline and single-temporal post-calving images. We extensively tested the validity of this method by extracting four annual calving datasets (from August 2015 to August 2019) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar mosaic of the Antarctic coastline. A total of 2032 annual Antarctic calving events were detected, with areas ranging from 0.05 km2 to 6141.0 km2, occurring on almost every Antarctic ice shelf. The extraction accuracy of the calved area depends on the positioning accuracy of the simulated coastline and the spatial resolution of the images. The positioning error of the simulated coastline is less than one pixel, and the determined minimum valid extraction area is 0.05 km2, when based on 75 m resolution images. Our method effectively avoids repetition and omission errors during the calved area extraction process. Furthermore, its efficiency is not affected by the surface textural characteristics of the calving fronts and the various changes in the frontal edge velocity, which makes it fully applicable to the rapid and accurate extraction of different calving types. © 2020 by the authors.","Extraction; Landforms; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Antarctic ice sheets; Antarctic ice shelves; Extraction accuracy; Extraction process; In-depth understanding; Positioning accuracy; Synthetic aperture radar mosaics; Textural characteristic; Image processing","Antarctica; Coastline; Ice shelves; Ice velocity; Iceberg calving; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090351283"

Subaerial and subaqueous calving is an important component of glacier mass loss but they have been difficult to track due to spatiotemporal resolution limitations in remote sensing data and few field observations. In this study, we used near-daily 3 m resolution PlanetScope imagery in conjunction with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) survey to quantify calving events and derive an empirical area–volume relationship to estimate calved glacier volume from planimetric iceberg areas. A calving event at Thulagi Glacier in 2017 was observed by satellite from before and during the event to nearly complete melting of the icebergs, and was observed in situ midway through the melting period, thus giving insights into the melting processes. In situ measurements of Thulagi Lake’s surface and water column indicate that daytime sunlight absorption heats mainly just the top metre of water, but this heat is efficiently mixed downwards through the top tens of metres due to forced convection by wind-blown icebergs; this heat then is retained by the lake and is available to melt the icebergs. Using satellite data, we assess seasonal glacier velocities, lake thermal regime and glacier surface elevation change for Thulagi, Lower Barun and Lhotse Shar glaciers and their associated lakes. The data reveal widely varying trends, likely signifying divergent future evolution. Glacier velocities derived from 1960/70s declassified Corona satellite imagery revealed evidence of glacier deceleration for Thulagi and Lhotse Shar glaciers, but acceleration at Lower Barun Glacier following lake development. We used published modelled ice thickness data to show that upon reaching their maximum extents, Imja, Lower Barun and Thulagi lakes will contain, respectively, about 90 × 106, 62 × 106 and 5 × 106 m3 of additional water compared to their 2018 volumes. Understanding lake–glacier interactions is essential to predict future glacier mass loss, lake formation and associated hazards. © Copyright © 2020 Watson, Kargel, Shugar, Haritashya, Schiassi and Furfaro.","Gandaki; Nepal; Thulagi Glacier; Antennas; Glacial geology; Melting; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Water absorption; calving; Corona; Glacial lakes; icebergs; Lake temperatures; NDWI; Structure from motion; glacier; iceberg calving; image resolution; lake water; outburst; proglacial environment; satellite data; trend analysis; Lakes","calving; Corona; glacial lake; glacier velocity; icebergs; lake temperature; NDWI; structure from motion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078314313"

The method of decomposition of the temperature series into empirical orthogonal components (EOCs) was used to study the spatiotemporal TLT structure. Correlation analysis of the identified EOCs for winter and summer seasons and the indices of large-scale modes of natural climatic variability in the Northern Hemisphere is carried out. The first leading EOC, which characterizes a negative temperature trend, produces the main contribution to the overall variability. In winter, the leading mode is associated with the North Atlantic oscillation. In summer, a significant contribution of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and the index of the Arctic sea ice concentration anomalies was revealed. This may be used to improve the reliability of forecasting the regional climate change in the coming decades. The results suggest that the natural climatic variability has a considerable effect on the temperature regime and that it might be difficult to isolate the anthropogenic component of climate change in the studied region. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Urals; brightness temperature; correlation; North Atlantic Oscillation; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; temperature anomaly; troposphere","brightness temperature; climatic indices; empirical orthogonal components method; linear correlation; remote sensing; Southern Urals","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081634220"

The antarctic ecosystem is home of 200 million seabirds. 26 million of them belong to the penguins and only 600.000 are Emperor Penguins. They breed along the remote coasts of Antarctica. Their first colony was discovered in 1902. In the course of the 1950ies more colonies were detected and today with the help of satellite technique we know more than 54 in total. The breeding cycle starts during winter, when a 1.000 kilometer sea ice belt surrounds the continent. Emperor Penguins use Polynjas during this time to get access to the food sources in the sea. During incubation and breeding they are very hard to study due to stormy weather and temperatures of sometimes below minus 30° Celsius. From October onwards the first big icebreakers are capable to reach some of these places and biologists can start to study breeding success by counting chicks and adults. The few best monitored colonies are in the reach of Antarctic winter stations. Remote sensing of faeces stain on the ice give an introspection of the spacing of colonies all over the coasts. Counts in the colonies give figures of population sizes in relation to faeces covered areas. So we got a rough idea about the number of individuals. Satellite imaging over the last 40 years has provided data on the sea and glacier ice loss: Most loss is to be found in western Antarctica, but also in eastern Antarctica we can find more and more melting due to raising temperatures. © 2020, Wiley-VCH Verlag.

Although the selected feature subsets may yield high overall accuracies in the case of spectrally similar classes such as wetlands, several individual accuracies are often low. A reason is that one set of features used to separate one specific class from the rest might not be appropriate for delineating another class. An additional reason is that while the overall accuracy is applied to evaluate the potential of a feature subset, it may be influenced by a few high-accuracy classes that are spectrally distinct and for which collecting enough training data is feasible. In this article, rather than simultaneously mapping all classes, they were individually classified using a different feature selection. Spectral analysis was applied to determine both the order of the classes to be mapped and a merging scheme that was applied to the remaining classes to increase the accuracy of the target class. The proposed approach was applied to wetland mapping using five pilot sites throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The dataset available for each pilot site differed in quality and quantity. However, the proposed method accurately classified wetlands in all pilot sites, even those with limited satellite and/or field data, and outperformed the classic method by increasing the average producer and user accuracies of wetlands by up to 22% and 25%, respectively, and yielding overall accuracies up to 93%. Among wetland classes, Shallow Water was easier to be distinguished, as a result of being spectrally less similar to the rest of the wetland classes. Based on the obtained results, the proposed method can be effectively applied for classifications involving spectrally similar classes, including sea ice and crop mapping. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Canada; Newfoundland and Labrador; accuracy assessment; land classification; land cover; mapping method; remote sensing","Classification; Feature selection; Remote sensing; Wetlands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086853691"

The European Space Agency's Envisat (2002–2010) and CryoSat-2 (2010–present) satellite radar altimeter missions provide a continuous 17-year dataset with the potential to estimate sea ice thickness. However, the satellite footprints are not equal in area and so different distributions of floes and leads are sampled by each mission. Here, we compare lead and floe sampling from Envisat and CryoSat-2 to investigate the impact of geometric sampling differences on Arctic sea ice thickness estimates. We find that Envisat preferentially samples wider, thicker sea ice floes, and that floes in less consolidated ice regions are effectively thickened by off-nadir ranging to leads. Consequently, Envisat sea ice thicknesses that are an average of 80 cm higher than CryoSat-2 over first-year ice and 23 cm higher over multiyear ice. By considering the along-track distances between lead and floe measurements, we are able to develop a sea ice thickness correction that is based on Envisat's inability to resolve discrete surfaces relative to CryoSat-2. This is a novel, physically based approach to addressing the bias between the satellites and reduces the average thickness difference to negligible values over first-year and multiyear ice. Finally, we evaluate our new bias-corrected Envisat sea ice thickness product using independent airborne, moored-buoy and submarine data. The European Space Agency's Envisat and CryoSat-2 satellites have the potential to produce a continuous record of Arctic sea ice thickness since 2002, but this is complicated by the fact that the satellites do not sample the sea ice surface in the same way. We find that Envisat is only able to sample larger, thicker sea ice relative to CryoSat-2, because of its poorer resolution. In this paper we account for these differences in sampling to combine Arctic sea ice thickness estimates from two the satellite missions. Applying a sea ice thickness bias correction to Envisat data reduces the ice thickness difference between Envisat and CryoSat-2 from an average of 53.0 to 0.5 cm. ©2019.

Recently it has been shown that the microwave radar return is determined by both Bragg and non Bragg scattering components, and some evidences have been given that the latter is associated with wave breaking. However, our understanding of different mechanisms of the role of wave breaking on small-scale wind waves (ripples) and thus on the radar return is still insufficient. This paper presents results of laboratory experiments on the influence of wave breaking on Ka-band radar signals. An effect of the radar return suppression after wave breaking has been revealed and attributed with wind ripples suppression by breaking waves. The experiments were carried out in an oval wind wave tank where intense m/dm-scale surface wave trains were generated by a mechanical wave maker, in particular using a method of dispersive wave focusing. Wind waves were independently generated in the wave tank. A Ka-band radar was mounted at a height of about 1 m above the water level the incidence angle of microwave radiation was about 50 degrees. The experiments were performed both for a clean water surface and in the presence of an oleic acid monomolecular film. It has been obtained that the radar return before the wave train was determined by wind ripples, the radar Doppler spectrum was centered close to the Bragg wave frequencies. The radar signal intensity was strongly enhanced in a wide frequency range when the train was passing by the study area. After the intense wave train the radar return dropped and then slowly recovered to the initial level. We believe that the attenuation of radar backscattering after the wave train is due to suppression of wind ripples by turbulence and surfactants associated with wave breaking.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In-situ temperature measurements were used for the years 2014-2018, from 35 narrowly-spaced buoys distributed along the Korean Peninsula coast, to investigate how well the SST analyses represent the temperatures at the coastal regions. Contrary to the overall accuracy of the SSTs in the global ocean and offshore regions, the root-mean-square errors for the analyses were relatively large over 1.27 K. Specifically, all SST analyses resulted in warm biases over 0.31 K, which became quite distinctive in the western and the southwestern coastal regions. Investigation of the errors identified relationships with the coastal zones of vigorous tidal mixing, shallow bathymetry, and absence of microwave measurements. Overall, temporal wavelet coherency between in-situ measurements and SST products revealed high coherency of greater than 0.8 in periods longer than 180 days, however, low coherency (<0.5) in the period shorter than 10 days was observed. Inter-comparisons between the SST analyses illustrated clear spatial differences in the correlations at both the coastal regions, along the southwestern coast of the Korean Peninsula and in the frontal regions, and in the marginal seas of the Northwest Pacific.

In contrast, spaceborne scatterometers are with large swath and high temporal revisit frequency at a global scale, but so far are routinely providing ocean winds rather than waves. This paper addresses the ocean sea state retrieval algorithm by applying state-of-the-art machine learning technology to European Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). A huge collocation database (< 6 million) has been built between L1b/L2 ASCAT products and WaveWatch III (ww3) ocean wave hindcasts within the spatio-temporal criteria of 0.1 degree and 0.5 h for the period of three years, followed by the mining of this big data by means of machine learning (i.e., multi-hidden layer neural network here). The neural network proposed here includes layers: the input layer (13 ASCAT variables), four hidden layers, and the output layer (wave heights). The performance of machine learning based approach for ocean wave height estimation from scatterometer is evaluated using two independent match-ups: ASCAT-WW3 and ASCAT-buoy. The statistical assessment against SWH hindcast shows the root mean square error of 0.55 m and scatter index of 23%, respectively. Results indicate that the data driven algorithm is reasonable for sea state estimation from wide-swath scatterometers, and encouraging for operational implementation in the future.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This paper also presents a novel detailed modeling of the multiresolution probability distribution function of the HMN and its power spectral density function modeling at each scale of the decomposition. Other quality assessment techniques, such as two K-means clustering algorithms and several visualized verification methods, such as gradient vector field, advection mapping and tensor field mapping, have been implemented in this regard to investigate embedded HMN suppression and its adverse effects on the presence of pixel anomalies. As a result, as the decomposition continues, the HMN at each scale of decomposition is constantly altering from high-frequency uncorrelated anomalies to low-frequency joint spatial information within the observed 2-D data. In other words, excessive multiscale HMN suppression will result in spatial information loss that makes the DWT scale selection quite important for texture classification. The results also show that the importance of HMN suppression in SAR sea-ice images in the form of pixel anomaly decomposition for the purpose of further texture investigation should be in accordance with the spectral behavior of the HMN. The results are helpful for SAR remote sensing image restoration and data preservation when dealing with high-resolution SAR images, such as in time series analysis, sea-ice texture change detection, and polar structural mapping. The proposed approach is implemented on real KOMPSAT-5 SAR satellite sea-ice images, while fractal spatial resolution profile simulations are carried out based on the inversed equalized hybrid domain image formation algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.","Backscattering; Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Distribution functions; Fractals; Frequency domain analysis; Image analysis; Image classification; Image reconstruction; Image texture; K-means clustering; Mapping; Phase noise; Pixels; Probability density function; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Spectral density; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Time series analysis; Fractal analysis; Gradient vector field; Multiplicative noise; Raw data generations; Spatial informations; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Texture classification; Time frequency domain; Radar imaging","Discrete wavelet transform; fractal analysis; high-frequency multiplicative noise; raw data generation; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081565641"

High spatial resolution (HSR) imagery is an important data source in Arctic sea ice research for extracting sea ice physical parameters, and calibrating/validating climate models. HSR images are difficult to process and manage due to their large data volume, heterogeneous data sources, and complex spatiotemporal distributions. In this paper, an Arctic Cyberinfrastructure (ArcCI) module is developed that allows a reliable and efficient on-demand image batch processing on the web. For this module, available associated datasets are collected and presented through an open data portal. The ArcCI module offers an architecture based on cloud computing and big data components for HSR sea ice images, including functionalities of (1) data acquisition through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) transfer, front-end uploading, and physical transfer; (2) data storage based on Hadoop distributed file system and matured operational relational database; (3) distributed image processing including object-based image classification and parameter extraction of sea ice features; (4) 3D visualization of dynamic spatiotemporal distribution of extracted parameters with flexible statistical charts. Arctic researchers can search and find arctic sea ice HSR image and relevant metadata in the open data portal, obtain extracted ice parameters, and conduct visual analytics interactively. Users with large number of images can leverage the service to process their image in high performance manner on cloud, and manage, analyze results in one place. The ArcCI module will assist domain scientists on investigating polar sea ice, and can be easily transferred to other HSR image processing research projects. © 2020 by the authors.

Ocean warming has been implicated as a trigger for these changes in glacier dynamics, yet little data exist near glacier termini to assess the role of ocean warming here. We use remotely-sensed iceberg melt rates seaward of two glaciers on the eastern and six glaciers on the western AP from 2013 to 2019 to explore connections between variations in ocean conditions and glacier frontal ablation. We find iceberg melt rates follow regional ocean temperature variations, with the highest melt rates (mean ≈ 10 cm d-1) at Cadman and Widdowson glaciers in the west and the lowest melt rates (mean ≈ 0.5 cm d-1) at Crane Glacier in the east. Near-coincident glacier frontal ablation rates from 2014 to 2018 vary from ~450 m a-1 at Edgeworth and Blanchard glaciers to ~3000 m a-1 at Seller Glacier, former Wordie Ice Shelf tributary. Variations in iceberg melt rates and glacier frontal ablation rates are significantly positively correlated around the AP (Spearman's ρ = 0.71, p-value = 0.003). We interpret this correlation as support for previous research suggesting submarine melting of glacier termini exerts control on glacier frontal dynamics around the AP.

For the first time ever in the industry, this research was based on a complex study of the icebergs origin and properties. For that purpose prior to the trials outlet glaciers of Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya were examined with airborne radar that allowed to measure their thickness and to build 3D models. Satellite remote sensing data were used to derive glacier fronts position, ice surface flow velocity, changes of glacier margins, and parameters of iceberg distribution. The data on the flow rates of the main glaciers were compared with the satellite beacons equipped with GPS (ARGOS) installed on several glaciers. Empirical relationships were derived to determine the mass and geometry of icebergs based on instrumental measurements and airborne data in the Barents and Kara seas. All this information was used to estimate iceberg towing possibilities in different conditions, analyze obtained data and deeper understand the process. Influence of oscillations during the towing process was studied. For a wide range of towing speeds, drag force coefficients were determined for icebergs of various sizes and shapes. Experimental iceberg towing operations performed in ice fields during the early stages of ice formation are described. These works were conducted in October 2017 in the Kara sea. Limitations of iceberg towing under different ice conditions are determined and discussed. Technological features of towing operations within negative air temperatures and the presence of sea ice are also highlighted. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.","Drag; Flow velocity; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Remote sensing; Air temperature; Drag force coefficients; Empirical relationships; Ice conditions; Instrumental measurements; Satellite beacons; Satellite remote sensing data; Technological feature; Sea ice","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086262836"

In this article, we explore sea ice observation with HF radar (HFR) and develop a corresponding signal processing procedure. We derived sea ice radial velocities from raw HFR data and determined angular positions using the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Sea ice velocities were evaluated by comparison with measurements from moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and a drifting buoy. The root-mean-square (rms) differences between the sea ice velocities obtained by HFR and the ADCPs decreased with increasing radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), implying that a high SNR was associated with accurate measurement of sea ice velocity. These results agree with previous validations of HFR ocean current observations. The sea ice pattern mapped by HFR is consistent with the simultaneous C-band microwave radar observations. In particular, the HFR captured the approach of the sea ice edge toward the coast. Sharp attenuation of the HF signal over high concentration sea ice resulted in missing and/or low-SNR data at ranges beyond the front edge of pack ice, in qualitative agreement with model estimates of attenuation. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Computer music; Doppler effect; Microwave acoustics; Radar measurement; Radar signal processing; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Velocity; Acoustic doppler current profiler; Coastal ocean; Drifting buoys; High frequency radar; Microwave radars; Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler; algorithm; coastal zone; data buoy; drifter; ice flow; radar altimetry; remote sensing; sea ice; signal processing; signal-to-noise ratio; Signal to noise ratio","Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP); coastal ocean; drifting buoy; high-frequency radar (HFR); microwave radar; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078038915"

The passive microwave sensors are widely used to estimate sea ice properties because it can penetrate clouds and detect sea ice during the day and night, regardless of cloud cover. The Advanced Microwave Sounding Radiometer2 (AMSR2) aboard the Global Change Observation Mission - Water1 (GCOM - W1) provides record of enhanced sea ice products with high spatial resolution and other improvements than previous several microwave sensors. Sea ice concentration from the AMSR2 is calculated by using NASA Team2 (NT2) sea ice algorithm known to calculate accurate sea ice concentration for the Arctic and Antarctic. The NT2 has been addressed some of the weaknesses of the NASA Team (NT) algorithm by employing high frequency 89 GHz channels unlike many other algorithms in order to consider sea ice with surface affect. Sea ice and open water are characterized by different brightness temperature depending on the wavelength. The NT2 calculates sea ice concentration using ratio based on these characteristics. In this study, we analyzed the radiation characteristics according to the sea ice type and open water in the Kara and Barents Seas through four ratios (PR, GR, PRR, and ?GR) used to distinguish the sea ice types in the NT2 algorithm. In addition, we propose the possibility of developing a classification and retrieval algorithm for sea ice by applying artificial intelligence to these radiation features. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables, lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is adjusted for best performance of the system at hand. The sensitivity tests reveal that the tuning parameter does not critically influence the results.

Still, little is known about seasonal glacier and ice shelf front fluctuations as the manual delineation of calving fronts from remote sensing imagery is very time-consuming. The major challenge of automatic calving front extraction is the low contrast between floating glacier and ice shelf fronts and the surrounding sea ice. Additionally, in previous decades, remote sensing imagery over the often cloud-covered Antarctic coastline was limited. Nowadays, an abundance of Sentinel-1 imagery over the Antarctic coastline exists and could be used for tracking glacier and ice shelf front movement. To exploit the available Sentinel-1 data, we developed a processing chain allowing automatic extraction of the Antarctic coastline from Seninel-1 imagery and the creation of dense time series to assess calving front change. The core of the proposed workflow is a modified version of the deep learning architecture U-Net. This convolutional neural network (CNN) performs a semantic segmentation on dual-pol Sentinel-1 data and the Antarctic TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM). The proposed method is tested for four training and test areas along the Antarctic coastline. The automatically extracted fronts deviate on average 78 m in training and 108 m test areas. Spatial and temporal transferability is demonstrated on an automatically extracted 15-month time series along the Getz Ice Shelf. Between May 2017 and July 2018, the fronts along the Getz Ice Shelf show mostly an advancing tendency with the fastest moving front of DeVicq Glacier with 726 ± 20 m/yr. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Landforms; Neural networks; Sea ice; Sea level; Semantics; Surveying; Time series; Antarctica; Calving front; Coastline; Convolutional neural network; Ice shelves; Semantic segmentation; Remote sensing","Antarctica; Calving front; Coastline; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Getz Ice Shelf; Glacier front; Glacier terminus; Semantic segmentation; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074639701"

To better understand these changes, observations of high-resolution sea ice conditions are needed. Remote sensing is a useful tool for observations in the harsh Arctic environment. For unsupervised ice detection, we demonstrate the promising value of radar phase difference from polarimetric radar measurements in this study, based on full polarimetric complex RADARSAT-2 SAR images in the marginal ice zone. It is demonstrated that the phase difference from co-polarized and cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images show promising capability for high resolution sea ice discrimination from open water. In particular, the phase difference shows superior potential for the detection of frazil ice compared to the traditional methodology based on the radar intensity ratio. The relationship between phase difference and radar incidence angle is also analyzed, as well as the potential influence of high sea state. The new methodology provides an additional tool for ice detection. In order to make the best use of this tool, directions for further studies are discussed for operational ice detection and possible ice classification. © 2020 by the authors.","Ocean currents; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic environments; Ecological process; Ice classification; Marginal Ice Zone; Phase information; Polarimetric radar measurements; Sea ice conditions; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar measurement","Phase difference; Polarimetry; SAR; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086449820"

Remote sensing technology provides an effective means for sea ice detection. Remote sensing sea ice images contain rich spectral and spatial information. However, most traditional methods only focus on spectral information or spatial information, and do not excavate the feature of spectral and spatial simultaneously in remote sensing sea ice images classification. At the same time, the complex correlation characteristics among spectra and small sample problem in sea ice classification also limit the improvement of sea ice classification accuracy. For this issue, this paper proposes a new remote sensing sea ice image classification method based on squeeze-and-excitation (SE) network, convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed method designs 3D-CNN deep network so as to fully exploit the spatial-spectrum features of remote sensing sea ice images and integrates SE-Block into 3D-CNN in-depth network in order to distinguish the contributions of different spectra to sea ice classification. According to the different contributions of spectral features, the weight of each spectral feature is optimized by fusing SE-Block in order to further enhance the sample quality. Finally, information-rich and representative samples are chosen by combining the idea of active learning and input into SVM classifier, and this achieves superior classification accuracy of remote sensing sea ice images with small samples. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three different data from Baffin Bay, Bohai Bay, and Liaodong Bay. The experimental results show that compared with other classical classification methods, the proposed method comprehensively considers the correlation among spectral features and the small samples problems and deeply excavates the spatial-spectrum characteristics of sea ice and achieves better classification performance, which can be effectively applied to remote sensing sea ice image classification. © 2020 Yanling Han et al.","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Ice problems; Image classification; Sea ice; Spectrum analysis; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Classification performance; Images classification; Remote sensing technology; Representative sample; Sea ice classification; Support vector machine (SVMs); Remote sensing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083882951"

In addition, three fjords were examined to investigate how ice extent may vary over short distances (<100 km). Of the 386 outlined, 47 fjords/coastal areas held >5 km2 of ice at least once between 2001 and 2019. Over this span of time, no statistically significant trend in ice extent is found for all ten regions; however, variations between regions and years are evident. Ice extent is assessed through comparison to three weather variables-freezing degree days (FDD), daily new snowfall and daily freshwater supply from rainfall plus snowmelt. Six out of ten regions are significantly positively correlated (p < 0.05) to FDD. In addition, ice in two regions is significantly positively correlated to daily new snowfall, and in one region negatively correlated to rainfall plus snowmelt.

Laser depth sounding has been used for many decades and is now a well-developed commercial technique for bottom depth charting. Airborne lidar also has the capability to generate depth profiles of water scattering properties. Recently, satellite based lidars have also been shown to measure water depth. The NASA satellite ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2) carries a photon-counting laser altimeter used to measure, for example, the elevation of ice sheets, glaciers and sea ice. The raw data can also be used to measure water depth in shallow waters. Passive EO remote sensing from aircraft and satellites can also be used for shallow water bathymetry and environmental monitoring as well as for estimating various optical parameters. In order to plan and execute airborne EO sensing over water, a prior knowledge of optical parameters of the water is important. There are many data sources for optical water parameters including Secchi disc depths, turbidity profiles, phytoplankton, coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), humus substances and others. Many of these parameters are related to water colour and transmission. The paper will give examples of such data for the Baltic Sea and how they relate to geographical and seasonal variations. Examples of laser depth sounding in the Baltic will be given. Depth capability for airborne lidars are discussed in relation to new technology developments.

This makes it a unique asset for many geophysical applications. Initially designed for the measurement of directional ocean wave spectra, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode (WV) vignettes are small 20 km scenes that have been collected globally since 2014. Recent WV data exploration reveals that many important oceanic and atmospheric phenomena are also well captured, but not yet employed by the scientific community. However, expanding applications of this whole massive dataset beyond ocean waves requires a strategy to automatically identify these geophysical phenomena. In this study, we propose to apply the emerging deep learning approach in ocean SAR scenes classification. The training is performed using a hand-curated dataset that describes ten commonly-occurring atmospheric or oceanic processes. Our model evaluation relies on an independent assessment dataset and shows satisfactory and robust classification results. To further illustrate the model performance, regional patterns of rain and sea ice are qualitatively analyzed and found to be very consistent with independent remote sensing datasets. In addition, these high-resolution WV SAR data can resolve fine, sub-km scale, spatial structure of rain events and sea ice that complement other satellite measurements.

Satellite passive microwave sea ice concentration products are commonly used for large-scale sea ice monitoring and predictive modelling; however, these product algorithms are known to underperform during the summer melt period due to the changes in sea ice thermophysical properties. This study investigates the evolution of in situ and satellite-retrieved brightness temperature (TB) throughout the melt season using a combination of in situ passive microwave measurements, thermophysical sampling, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, and satellite-retrieved TB. In situ data revealed a strong positive correlation between the presence of liquid water in the snow matrix and in situ TB in the 37 and 89 GHz frequencies. When considering TB ratios utilized by popular sea ice concentration algorithms (e.g., NASA Team 2), liquid water presence in the snow matrix was shown to increase the in situ TB gradient ratio of 37/19V. In situ gradient ratios of 89/19V and 89/19H were shown to correlate positively with UAV-derived melt pond coverage across the ice surface. Multi-scale comparison between in situ TB measurements and satellite-retrieved TB (by Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) showed a distinct pattern of passive microwave TB signature at different stages of melt, confirmed by data from in situ thermophysical measurements. This pattern allowed for both in situ and satellite-retrieved TB to be partitioned into three discrete stages of sea ice melt: late spring, early melt and advanced melt. The results of this study thus advance the goal of achieving more accurate modeled predictions of the sea ice cover during the critical navigation and breakup period in Hudson Bay.

One, represented by M99 and R06, is used to estimating the sea-surface reflectance ρ, while the other, represented by G01 and L10, is applied in estimating and eliminating the contribution of residual surface-reflected light and sun glint ϵ. Base on the second approach, this paper proposes a new approach (HY approach), which use the quasi-analytical algorithm to estimate the remote sensing reflectance of near infrared band, and then estimate and eliminate ϵ. Given the preliminary estimates of o '.o 'o ' (λ), we can use quasi-analytical algorithm to estimate the inherent optical properties (IOP) of the visible spectrum. With IOP model, IOP of the near infrared band can be calculated, which then can be used to estimate the o '.o 'o ' (NIR) of near infrared wave band. And ultimately the estimating of the ϵ can be realized. The in-situ data were gathered in September, 2018 in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, from 76 stations. The remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) was calculated simultaneously by above-water and in-water methods. Comparing the data analyzing result of HY approach in this paper with other approaches, the variation coefficient of HY and L10 is within 5% for most stations, and within 10% for HY and R06. Compared with the results of Rrs measured by in-water method, the variation coefficient of 80% of the stations is within 15%, and the results of the two methods have a good consistency. HY method avoids the problem of extra measurement of sea surface wind in methods such as R06. This method has simple and clear steps, fast iterative convergence and better calculation speed than L10 method.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The initial goal of this work was to identify vortex structures and their main localization areas in the Caspian Sea. In this paper we used Ocean Color Data for two periods: 1999-2006 and 2007-2013, plus 2 recent years (2019 and 2020). Results of these periods were comparing between each other. About 50% of the scenes from the obtained data are covered by clouds due to difficult weather conditions over the Caspian Sea - a frequent changes of air masses in all seasons of the year. Among cloudless scenes, on average, vortex structures occur on 20-30% of scenes. According to the results of the analysis of the data obtained, a predominance of submesoscale cyclones and anticyclones is noted. It was noted that vortex structures were mainly found in the shelf zone of the Caspian Sea. More intense vortex formation is observed in the South Caspian. The main reasons for their formation: the flow of river runoff, complex bottom and coastal topography, the vorticity of the wind field, shear instability at the periphery of the main circulation elements. The mapping of the main circulation elements in Caspian Sea was carried out. For each part of the Caspian Sea, the six main areas of vortex formation were identified.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Historically, the northern border of the NOW is defined by an ice arch that forms annually in Kane Basin, which is part of the Nares Strait system. In 2007 the NOW ice arch failed to consolidate for the first time since observations began in the 1950s. The non-formation of the NOW ice arch occurred again in 2009, 2010, 2017 and 2019. Satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometry data shows that large floes broke off from the normally stable landfast ice in Kane Basin for each of these years, impeding ice arch formation. A closer analysis of a 2019 event, in which 2500 km2 of ice sheared away from Kane Basin, indicates that significant tidal forces played a role. The evidence suggests that thinning ice from a warming climate combined with large amplitude tides is a key factor in the changing ice dynamics of the NOW region. The non-formation of the NOW ice arch results in an increased loss of multiyear ice through Nares Strait. © 2020 by the author.","Sea ice; Canadian Arctic; Ice dynamics; Key factors; Large amplitude; Multi-year ices; Tidal forces; Very high resolution; Warming climate; Arches","Arctic waters; Marginal ice zones; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Tides","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090404992"

The most obvious and dramatic changes include earlier ice retreat and a longer ice-free season, particularly on Arctic inflow shelves, including the Barents Sea in the Atlantic Arctic and the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea in the Pacific Arctic. The extreme variability observed in recent years in the Pacific Arctic is unparalleled in recorded history. This volume is devoted to studies that integrate research across various components of the Arctic marine ecosystem to better characterize these changes. The intent of this integrated approach is to better understand the linkages and interactions that shape ecosystem processes, influence timing and phenology of events, and inform predictions of future conditions. The studies presented in this Special Issue investigate processes in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Beaufort Sea. The data derive from remote sensing, ship-based surveys, and integrated data products. The research presented includes time-series analyses on environmental change across the greater Pacific Arctic, heat flux, stratification and mixing dynamics, vertical structure, and wind and current patterns. It explores the influence of physical processes on, and seasonal and annual variability in, primary production, nutrient distribution, and the export of biogenic matter. It also examines the effects of oceanographic variability on zooplankton taxa, the distribution of larval fishes, age and growth in Arctic fishes, responses of salmon to warming, and variability in cetacean occurrence. These studies are designed to provide new insights on integrated ecosystem research in the Pacific Arctic, with a focus on improving understanding of ecosystem processes, timing and change. This volume marks the first in a series of research volumes supported by the North Pacific Research Board to integrate ecosystem research in the Pacific Arctic and to inform our collective understanding of the rapid transformation in this region. © 2020","Cetacea; Pisces","","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089857756"

Here, we use remote-sensing observations to investigate recent changes (2000-2018) in the structure and velocity of Thwaites Glacier and its floating tongue. We show that the main trunk of Thwaites Glacier has accelerated by 38% over this period, while its previously intact floating tongue has transitioned to a weaker mélange of fractured icebergs bounded by sea ice. However, the rate of structural weakening and acceleration was not uniform across the observational period and we identify two periods of rapid acceleration and structural weakening (2006-2012; 2016-2018), separated by a period of deceleration and re-advance of the structurally-intact shear margin boundary (2012-2015). The timing of these accelerations/decelerations strongly suggests a link to variable ocean forcing. The weakened tongue now has some dependency on landfast sea ice for structural integrity and is vulnerable to changes in landfast ice persistency. Future reductions in landfast sea ice could manifest from changes in climate and/or the imminent removal of the B-22A iceberg from the Thwaites embayment. Such changes could have important implications for the integrity of the ice tongue and future glacier discharge.

A common method to derive snow depth on an Arctic-wide scale is based on passive microwave satellite observations. However, the uncertainties of this method are not well constrained. In this study, we estimate the influence of geophysical parameters, including ice, snow, and atmospheric properties on passive microwave snow depth retrievals using a Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation. The results are based on model simulations from the Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks, the SNOWPACK model, and from the Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer model. All simulations are based on in situ observations obtained during the N-ICE2015 campaign. The average uncertainty in potential snow depth retrievals is between 11% and 19%, depending on the microwave frequencies used and increases with increasing snow depth. For lower-frequency retrievals (including 6.9 GHz), unknown snow properties are the strongest source of uncertainty while for higher-frequency retrievals (including 36.5 GHz), the contribution of ice, snow properties, and clouds is equally strong. ©2020.

During recent decades, Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has evolved as an efficient tool for sea ice remote sensing. In particular, thanks to the availability of the TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) data over high-latitude regions, remote sensing of sea ice based on spaceborne GNSS-R has been rapidly growing. The goal of this paper is to provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods for sea ice remote sensing offered by the GNSS-R technique. In this review, the fundamentals of these applications are described, and their performances are evaluated. Specifically, recent progress in sea ice sensing using TDS-1 data is highlighted including sea ice detection, sea ice concentration estimation, sea ice type classification, sea ice thickness retrieval, and sea ice altimetry. In addition, studies of sea ice sensing using airborne and ground-based data are also noted. Lastly, applications based on various platforms along with remaining challenges are summarized and possible future trends are explored.

Knowledge of sea ice type is important for climate research and safety in Arctic offshore operations.First-year ice is characterised by a low SAR backscatter intensity in both HH and HV polarisation compared to multi-year ice, while the altimeter waveform parameters show high pulse peakiness and peak power compared to multi-year ice.Thus SAR imagery and altimetry can principally discriminate different ice types. The complexity of the backscattered radar signal however impedes a clear separation of the two types for all cases. Cross comparison of the two sensors offers an opportunity of high resolution validation data, which is often lacking for sea ice studies. © 2019 IEEE.","Aneroid altimeters; Backscattering; Geology; Meteorological instruments; Offshore oil well production; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Altimeter data; Altimeter waveform; Back-scattered radar; Climate research; High resolution; Multi-year ices; SAR backscatter; Validation data; Radar imaging","altimeter; SAR; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077708266"

SIT data are based on radar altimetry measurements of sea ice freeboard from the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) and CryoSat-2 (CS2). The CCI-2 SIT has previously been validated with in situ observations from drilling, airborne remote sensing, electromagnetic (EM) measurements and upward-looking sonars (ULSs) from multiple ice-covered regions of the Arctic. Here we present the Laptev Sea CCI-2 SIT record from 2002 to 2017 and use newly acquired ULS and upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) sea ice draft (VAL) data for validation of the gridded CCI-2 and additional satellite SIT products. The ULS and ADCP time series provide the first long-term satellite SIT validation data set from this important source region of sea ice in the Transpolar Drift. The comparison of VAL sea ice draft data with gridded monthly mean and orbit trajectory CCI-2 data, as well as merged CryoSat-2-SMOS (CS2SMOS) sea ice draft, shows that the agreement between the satellite and VAL draft data strongly depends on the thickness of the sampled ice. Rather than providing mean sea ice draft, the considered satellite products provide modal sea ice draft in the Laptev Sea. Ice drafts thinner than 0.7m are overestimated, while drafts thicker than approximately 1.3m are increasingly underestimated by all satellite products investigated for this study. The tendency of the satellite SIT products to better agree with modal sea ice draft and underestimate thicker ice needs to be considered for all past and future investigations into SIT changes in this important region. The performance of the CCI-2 SIT CDR is considered stable over time; however, observed trends in gridded CCI-2 SIT are strongly influenced by the uncertainties of ENVISAT and CS2 and the comparably short investigation period. © Author(s) 2020.","Arctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean; Laptev Sea; comparative study; Envisat; ice cover; ice thickness; mooring system; observational method; radar altimetry; sea ice","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089724530"

Possibilities to use the Arctic Portal for the Arctic sea ice monitoring on the basis of satellite data, as well as the types of satellite measurements suitable for studying the properties of sea ice: active and passive microwave data; data of spectral radiometers in the infrared (IR) and visible ranges are considered. Every type of satellite data has certain limitations. For the study of sea ice the most suitable are the all-season remote sensing data - measurements of microwave instruments, independent of clouds and time of a day. Existing in the world resources of the sea ice maps and satellite data on sea ice are either closed for users or limited in their informational content. Several types of satellite data are currently available on the Arctic portal: Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, 8-day averaged MODIS reflectivity data, optical and IR MODIS data of original time and spatial resolution, Norwegian Meteorological University sea ice maps, and data on consolidation of sea ice, based on passive microwave radiometer measurements. Some data is additionally available in the test mode. The effectiveness of combined use of various satellite data on the sea ice is proved by the examples of sea ice analyses. © 2020 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

For a 17-year period, a statistically significant positive trend of surface temperature (R2 = 0.27) and a negative trend of photosynthetically active radiation (R2 = 0.24) were established. For the investigated period, the average annual water temperature in the Laptev Sea increased by 1.38°C and photosynthetically active radiation decreased by 3.4 Ein m–2 d–1. The ice-free water area extended insignificantly (0.15% y–1). The total primary production declined by 1.87 TgC or by 1.4% y–1. This decline was accompanied by a decrease in area-specific primary production. For the investigated period, the average annual area-specific primary production values declined by 37.4 mgC m–2 d–1 or by 1.6% y–1. The presented results suggest that changes in Laptev Sea primary productivity for the last 17 years were mainly caused by a decrease in photosynthetically active radiation and area-specific primary production rather than the dynamics of the sea ice cover. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","Arctic Ocean; Laptev Sea; annual variation; nutrient dynamics; photosynthesis; primary production; surface water; water temperature","interannual variability; Laptev Sea; MODIS-Aqua; primary production; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086116154"

Consequently, during this month, the lowest sea ice extent (SIE, 7.5 million km2) and sea ice volume (8900 km3) were recorded. The decadal trend of sea ice decline in September 2019 has reached to ca. − 13% per decade. The latest record shows that average SIE during summer 2019 (5.65 million km2) has set a new lowest record after 2012 (5.32 million km2), since the sea ice formation process has been largely hampered during the summer months.

This review focuses on both interannual and interdecadal timescales. It is shown that circulations play an important role in influencing haze variability. Atmospheric circulations, which would be modulated by EFFs like sea surface temperature, sea ice, and snowpack, can affect the climate variability in haze over North China via modulation of surface-layer parameters that are closely connected with the haze phenomenon. Therefore, EFFs are deemed significant factors impacting the climate variability of haze over North China, serving as paramount precursory signals for haze prediction.

The phenology metrics determined by the adjusted Gaussian fitting method include the bloom amplitude (BA), bloom initiation timing (BIT), and bloom peak timing (BPT). We found the following results for three phenology metrics. The BA tended to increase since 2002, probably related to the formation of open water area by the atmospheric circulation changes on the synoptic scale over the Ross Sea. The significant sea ice loss trend due to the changing winds over the entire southern coast of the Ross Sea was found. Continuous winds in widened open water can move surface water masses more easily along the wind direction, transferring water masses or chlorophyll pigments themselves accordingly. This process has led to the recent intense bloom in the central Ross Sea Polynya. The interannual variability of the BIT is a function of the sea surface temperature in November and wind speed in October, implying that there is a strong association between ice drift and melting, which can be primarily related to the onset of the polynya expansion. Although there was no direct factor to the BPT, it was somewhat related to the BIT and BA.

Hovmoller diagrams of daily MODIS Chl-a along the transect of several atolls show that higher Chl-a also appeared in the downstream side.

Here we present results from a four-year (2003-2006) numerical simulation using a regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model to assess the Fe sources and transport on the AP shelf and toward the southern Scotia Sea. The model was validated with a suite of data derived from in situ surveys and remote sensing. Model results indicate that sediments in the AP shelf and the South Orkney Plateau (SOP) provide the dominant source of Fe to the upper 500 m in the southern Scotia Sea. Additional Fe inputs to the region are associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the northern limb of the Weddell Gyre, deep-ocean sediment sources, dust deposition, and icebergs. Fe on the AP shelf originates primarily from sediments on the relatively shallow inner shelf and is directly injected into the water column and subsequently transported toward Elephant Island by the confluent shelf currents. Off-shelf Fe export is primarily through entrainment of shelf waters by the ACC's Southern Boundary frontal jet along the northern edge of the AP shelf, the Hesperides Trough, and the SOP shelf. About 70% of the off-shelf export takes place below the surface mixed layer, and is subsequently re-supplied to the euphotic zone through vertical mixing, mainly during austral fall and winter. The exported shelf-derived Fe is then advected downstream by the ACC and Weddell Gyre and spread over the southern and eastern Scotia Seas. Taken together, shelf Fe export witin top 500 m meets nearly all of the Fe demand of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the southern Scotia Sea. Waters with elevated Fe concentrations in the Scotia Sea are largely restricted to south of the Southern ACC Front. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antarctic Circumpolar Current; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; Elephant Island; Scotia Sea; South Orkney Plateau; South Shetland Islands; Southern Ocean; Southern Ocean; Weddell Sea; West Antarctica; Biogeochemistry; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sediments; Antarctic Peninsula; Biogeochemical modeling; Off-shelf transport; Scotia Sea; Shelf sediment; euphotic zone; in situ measurement; iron; phytoplankton; pollutant transport; upper ocean; water column; Iron","Antarctic Peninsula; Coupled physical-biogeochemical model; Iron (Fe); Off-shelf transport; Shelf sediment; Southern Scotia Sea","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067935163"

These models are based on the use of a binary representation of the Snell's window image and a Gaussian slope distribution function. It leads to express statistical image moments in terms of the error function. Using its well-known properties, it was possible to establish analytical relationships between the AI differentiated by the zenith angle with the slope variance, as well as between the twice-differentiated ACF of the image with the ACF of the surface slopes. The obtained expressions can already be used in practice to solve inverse problems by a numerical method. At the same time, the results of numerical simulation show that the Snell's window image is an object very sensitive to changes of the roughness of the sea surface. With an increase of wind speed or in the presence of a surfactant film, the number and sizes of patterns near the Snell's window border significantly change that manifests in the statistical moments of the image.

Sea ice covers large areas of polar regions and plays a crucial role in the earth system. In this study, the moon-based observation coverage of sea ice is investigated in terms of geometric configuration. A simulation was carried out based on a simplified geometric model, the relative position of the moon to the earth, and the sea ice extent data. The results revealed both similarities and discrepancies between the moon-based observation coverage of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. The main discrepancy was found in the better observation integrity of Antarctic sea ice. Moreover, the observation duration is longer and the observation coverage of sea ice is larger when the incidence angle is in the range of 20°–60° than in 20°–50°. With characteristics such as latitudinal imaging strip and continuous observation for several days in a sidereal month, the moon-based observation shows a large potential for monitoring Antarctic Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ).

In order to extract useful information from DDM, three delay waveforms are defined and utilized. The delay waveform without Doppler shift is defined as central delay waveform (CDW), while the integration of delay waveforms of 20 different Doppler shift values is defined as integrated delay waveform (IDW). The differential waveform between normalized CDW (NCDW) and normalized IDW (NIDW) is defined as differential delay waveform (DDW), which is a new observable used to describe the difference between NCDW and NIDW, which have different Doppler spread characteristics. The difference is mainly caused by the roughness of reflected surface. First, a new data quality control method is proposed based on the standard deviation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first 48 bins of DDW. Then, several different observables derived from NCDW, NIDW, and DDW are applied to distinguish sea ice from water based on their probability density function. Through validating against sea ice edge data from the Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility, the trailing edge waveform summation of DDW achieves the best results, and its probabilities of successful detection are 98.22% and 96.65%, respectively, in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Charge density waves; Communication satellites; Doppler effect; Mean square error; Probability density function; Quality control; Reflection; Reflectometers; Salinity measurement; Satellites; Sea ice; Data quality control; Delay-doppler maps; Delay-Doppler-map datum; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Reflectometry; Root mean square errors; Satellite application facilities; Wave forms; computer simulation; data quality; Doppler radar; GNSS; Northern Hemisphere; quality control; remote sensing; sea ice; Southern Hemisphere; waveform analysis; Global positioning system","Central delay waveform (CDW); delay-Doppler map (DDM); differential delay waveform (DDW); Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R); integrated delay waveform (IDW); sea ice sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080943822"

Passive microwave data is an important data source for continuous observations of polar sea ice, thanks to its working ability in all-sky conditions and its wide coverage. However, it is difficult to achieve high-resolution monitoring of polar sea ice using passive microwave data due to its coarse resolution. In order to solve this problem, super resolution (SR) reconstruction technique is adopted in this paper to improve the spatial resolution of passive microwave images.

Satellite-derived sea surface temperatures increased in the period 1998–2017 by 1.0 °C as an average for the Barents Sea. We found significant positive relationships between ice-free conditions (open water area and duration) and satellite-based net primary production (NPP). The estimated annual NPP for the Barents Sea more than doubled over the 1998–2017 period, from around 40 to over 100 Tg C. The strong increase in NPP is the result of reduction of sea ice, extending both the area and period available for phytoplankton production. In areas where ice extent has decreased, satellite-derived chlorophyll a shows that the timing of the peak spring phytoplankton bloom has advanced by over a month. Our results reveal that phytoplankton dynamics in the ecosystem have been changing rapidly and that this change is driven mainly by bottom-up climatic processes. Autumn mesozooplankton biomass showed strong interannual variability in the 1990s, displaying an inverse relationship with capelin biomass, the most abundant planktivorous fish. In some regions, e.g. Central Bank, capelin biomass explained up to 50% of the mesozooplankton variability during 1989–2017. Though capelin biomass has varied considerably, mesozooplankton biomass has remained rather stable since the mid-2000s (6–8 g dry wt. m−2), resulting in a weakening of the negative relationship between capelin and mesozooplankton biomass in recent years. The stable zooplankton biomass indicates favorable conditions (prolonged/increased NPP) for mesozooplankton production, partly counteracting high predation levels. Overall, we observed trends in phytoplankton phenology that were strongly associated with changes in sea ice cover driven by fluctuations in temperature regime, a trend that may intensify should the ecosystem become even warmer due to climate change. Further reductions of sea ice and associated ice algae is expected to have adverse effects on sympagic fauna and ice dependent species in the Arctic food web. The ice-free conditions may promote further Atlantification (or borealization) of plankton and fish communities in the Barents Sea. © 2020 The Author(s)","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; algae; Mallotus (fish); Biomass; Climate change; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Fish; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface waters; Favorable conditions; In-situ observations; Interannual variability; Net primary production; Phytoplankton dynamics; Phytoplankton productions; Sea surface temperature (SST); Temporal and spatial dynamics; biomass; climate change; community structure; food web; in situ measurement; net primary production; phytoplankton; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea surface temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; zooplankton; Plankton","Barents Sea; Bloom dynamics; Capelin predation; Climate effects; Key processes; Mesozooplankton; Phytoplankton","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084796941"

We present the results of a long-term survey of the Caspian Sea by use of satellite SARs and multispectral sensors. Our primary attention is focused on the oil showings on the sea surface due to natural hydrocarbon emissions from the seabed. During our satellite survey, we discovered a previously unknown seep of petroleum hydrocarbons from the seabed in the shelf area of the Caspian Sea near the Cheleken Peninsula, which belongs administratively to Turkmenistan. We documented its source point as the persistent location of the origins of 379 oil slicks detected in satellite images taken over the area of interest. We also performed the precise estimation of the actual positions of two offshore seeps on the Iranian shelf near the Cape Sefid Rud on the base of 173 and 198 oil slicks correspondently. For these two regions of interest, we compare the release rates of the crude oil from the seabed to the sea surface.

In view of this, the technique of remote sensing provides information through satellite imagery and atmospheric reanalysis models to understand the impact of climate change on sea ice.

Uncertainties are highest in the blue bands, especially in coastal waters with low blue-band Rrs values. We recently showed that the main uncertainty contributions when observing at sun glint-optimized geometries are due to two components: variability of in-water parameters and skylight reflected from the water surface. Sunlight propagates to the water and back to the top of the atmosphere (TOA), capturing the instantaneous state of in-water conditions and sky light reflected from the wind-roughened wave facets. Both processes are averaged with the spatial resolution of the sensor. This results in the satellite measured TOA radiance spectrum, which is typically different from vector radiative transfer simulations that are based on the mean values of sea surface reflectance coefficient. Preliminary analysis shows that these two uncertainty components are spatially highly variable. Using the recently released provisional Aquatic Reflectance product for Landsat 8, we analyzed spatial scales of these components for multiple scenes in the open ocean and coastal waters at spatial resolutions ranging from 30 m to several kilometers.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

It is a key parameter for the derivation of sea-ice thickness from satellite altimetry. One way to retrieve the basin-scale snow depth on sea ice is by satellite microwave radiometry. There is evidence from measurements and inter-comparison studies that current retrievals likely under-estimate the snow depth over deformed, rough sea ice. We follow up on an earlier study, where satellite passive microwave data were combined with information on the sea-ice topography from the satellite laser altimeter on board the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) in a hybrid approach. Such topography information is spatiotemporally limited because of ICESat's operation mode. In this paper, we aim to derive a proxy for this topography information from satellite microwave radiometry. For this purpose, we co-locate parameters describing the sea-ice deformation taken from visual ship-based observations and the surface elevation standard deviation derived from ICESat laser altimetry with the microwave brightness temperatures (TB) measured via the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer aboard Earth Observation Satellite (AMSR-E) and aboard Global Change Observation Mission-Water 1 (GCOM-W1) (AMSR2). We find that the TB polarization ratio at 6.9 GHz and the TB gradient ratio between 10.7 GHz (horizontal polarization) and 6.9 GHz (vertical polarization), might be suited as such a proxy. Using this proxy, we modify the above-mentioned hybrid approach and compute the snow depths on sea ice from the AMSR-E and AMSR2 data. We compare our snow depths with those of the commonly used approach, the hybrid approach, with the ship-based observations for the years 2002 through 2015 and with the measurements made by drifting buoys for the period of 2014 through 2018. We find a convincing overall agreement with the hybrid approach and some improvement over the common approach. However, our approach is sensitive to the presence of thin ice-here, the retrieved snow depths are too large; and our approach performs sub-optimally over old ice-here, the retrieved snow depths are too small. More investigations and, in particular, more evaluations are required to optimize our approach so that the snow depths retrieved for the combined AMSR-E/AMSR2 period could serve as a data set for sea-ice thickness retrieval based on satellite altimetry. © 2019 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Polarization; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Ships; Snow; Snow melting systems; Topography; AMSR2; Buoy observations; Cryosphere; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Snow depths; Microwaves","AMSR-E; AMSR2; Buoy observations; Marine cryosphere; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; Ship-based observations; Snow depth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073443398"

Recent studies suggest that DMS controls aerosol formation in the summertime Arctic atmosphere and call for an assessment of pan-Arctic DMS emission (EDMS) in a context of dramatic ecosystem changes. Using a remote sensing algorithm, we show that summertime EDMS from ice-free waters increased at a mean rate of 13.3 ± 6.7 Gg S decade-1 (∼33% decade-1) north of 70°N between 1998 and 2016. This trend, mostly explained by the reduction in sea-ice extent, is consistent with independent atmospheric measurements showing an increasing trend of methane sulfonic acid, a DMS oxidation product. Extrapolation to an ice-free Arctic summer could imply a 2.4-fold (±1.2) increase in EDMS compared to present emission. However, unexpected regime shifts in Arctic geo- and ecosystems could result in future EDMS departure from the predicted range. Superimposed on the positive trend, EDMS shows substantial interannual changes and nonmonotonic multiyear trends, reflecting the interplay between physical forcing, ice retreat patterns, and phytoplankton productivity. Our results provide key constraints to determine whether increasing marine sulfur emissions, and resulting aerosol-cloud interactions, will moderate or accelerate Arctic warming in the context of seaice retreat and increasing low-level cloud cover. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

This study analysed multi-year ice motion to investigate the source of this thick ice and the reasons for its unusual movement. For this purpose, a daily multi-year ice distribution product was generated by ice tracking using gridded daily seaice velocities (2003–2018) derived from the AMSR-E and AMSR-2 data. From autumn 2017 to summer 2018, the area of multi-year ice extended westward to the Beaufort Sea and then migrated towards the AG mouth. The primary cause of the unusual ice cover was anomalous AG-ward wind in September 2018. It is known that multi-year ice has become increasingly moveable over the past decades, as indicated by the increasing wind factor (i.e., ratio of icedrift speed and wind speed), but the unusual ice motion in the summer of 2018 cannot be explainable by the wind factor alone. Accurately, predicting monthly wind and monitoring old thick ice will reduce the risk posed by thick Arctic sea ice to shipping. © 2020 N.

The complexity of coastal wind field is the main reason why these areas are so important. It is necessary to retrieve the wind field of coastal areas from remote sensing satellite. In order to retrieve wind speed from CYGNSS, the matched data were processed by matching CYGNSS with NCEP wind speed.

Observing their temporal evolution is crucial for understanding melt processes and predicting sea ice evolution. Remote sensing is the only technique that enables large-scale observations of Arctic sea ice. However, monitoring melt pond deepening in this way is challenging because most of the optical signal reflected by a pond is defined by the scattering characteristics of the underlying ice. Without knowing the influence of meltwater on the reflected signal, the water depth cannot be determined. To solve the problem, we simulated the way meltwater changes the reflected spectra of bare ice. We developed a model based on the slope of the log-scaled remote sensing reflectance at 710 nm as a function of depth that is widely independent from the bottom albedo and accounts for the influence of varying solar zenith angles. We validated the model using 49 in situ melt pond spectra and corresponding depths from shallow ponds on dark and bright ice. Retrieved pond depths are accurate (root mean square error, RMSE D 2:81 cm; nRMSE D 16 %) and highly correlated with in situ measurements (r D 0:89; p D 4:341017). The model further explains a large portion of the variation in pond depth (R2 D 0:74). Our results indicate that our model enables the accurate retrieval of pond depth on Arctic sea ice from optical data under clear sky conditions without having to consider pond bottom albedo. This technique is potentially transferrable to hyperspectral remote sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and satellites.  © Author(s) 2020.

It covers the time period from October 1978 to December 2015 including all available data from the SMMR radiometer aboard Nimbus-7 and all SSM/I and SSMIS radiometers aboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) platforms. SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS data are used for a variety of applications, such as analyses of the hydrological cycle, remote sensing of sea ice, or as input into reanalysis projects. The improved homogenization and inter-calibration procedure ensures the long-term stability of the FCDR for climate-related applications. All available raw data records from different sources have been reprocessed to a common standard, starting with the calibration of the raw Earth counts, to ensure a completely homogenized data record. The data processing accounts for several known issues with the instruments and corrects calibration anomalies due to along-scan inhomogeneity, moonlight intrusions, sunlight intrusions, and emissive reflector. Corrections for SMMR are limited because the SMMR raw data records were not available. Furthermore, the inter-calibration model incorporates a scene dependent inter-satellite bias correction and a non-linearity correction in the instrument calibration. The data files contain all available original sensor data (SMMR: Pathfinder level 1b) and metadata to provide a completely traceable climate data record. Inter-calibration and Earth incidence angle normalization offsets are available as additional layers within the data files in order to keep this information transparent to the users.

Wave generation regions are often colocated with enhanced air-sea fluxes and upper ocean mixing. Ocean wave spectra contain information about storm wind speed, fetch size, and intensity at their generation site. Two years of seismic observations on the Ross Ice shelf, combined with modern optimization (machine learning) techniques, are used to trace the origins of wave events in the Southern Ocean with an accuracy of ±110 km and ±2 hr from a hypothetical point source. The observed spectral energy attenuated within sea ice and in the ice shelf but retains characteristics that can be compared to parametric wave models. Comparison with the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, and ERA5 reanalyses suggests that less than 45% of ocean swell events can be associated with individual Southern Ocean storms, while the majority of the observed wave events cannot be matched with Southern Ocean high wind events. Reanalysis cyclones and winds are often displaced by about 350 km or 10 hr in Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2, and ERA5 compared to the most likely positions inferred from the seismic spectra. This high fraction of displaced storms in reanalysis products over the South Pacific can be explained by the limited availability of remote sensing observations, primarily caused by the presence of sea ice. Deviation of wave rays from their great circle path by wave-current interaction plays a minor role. ©2020.

This paper is focused on results of field studies of non-Bragg backscattering from the clean water surface and from the water surface covered with surfactant films. The study was carried out using dual polarized X-band radars in the coastal zone of the Black Sea in 2017-2019 at an incidence angle of about 60 degrees. It was found that the radar return contains a Non Bragg component not related to the breaking crests and specular tilt areas at wind speeds from a threshold of the wind wave generation up to wind velocities of the order of 10 m/s. The part of the non-Bragg component not related to the wave breaking crests decreases strongly in the areas of film slicks. At high wind velocities the non-Bragg component out of the spikes is strongly modulated (several times larger than the Bragg component) in the long-wave field, in film slicks the modulation of the non-Bragg component increases. Analysis of the Doppler shifts showed that the velocities of the non-Bragg scatterers correspond to the dm-scale free surface waves and vary slightly in the areas of film slicks. Thus, we concluded that nonlinear features associated with the dm-scale wind waves cause the non-Bragg scattering.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We present the first study using airborne hyperspectral imagery of Arctic sea ice and evaluate two atmospheric correction approaches (ATCOR-4 (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction version 4; v7.0.0) and empirical line calibration). We apply an existing, field data-based model to derive the depth of melt ponds, to airborne hyperspectral AisaEAGLE imagery and validate results with in situ measurements. ATCOR-4 results roughly match the shape of field spectra but overestimate reflectance resulting in high root-mean-square error (RMSE) (between 0.08 and 0.16). Noisy reflectance spectra may be attributed to the low flight altitude of 200 ft and Arctic atmospheric conditions. Empirical line calibration resulted in smooth, accurate spectra (RMSE < 0.05) that enabled the assessment of melt pond bathymetry. Measured and modeled pond bathymetry are highly correlated (r = 0.86) and accurate (RMSE = 4.04 cm), and the model explains a large portion of the variability (R2 = 0.74). We conclude that an accurate assessment of melt pond bathymetry using airborne hyperspectral data is possible subject to accurate atmospheric correction.

Satellite remote sensing is an important tool to monitor variability in lake surface area, but monitoring depth is challenging. The distribution of bottomfast ice within a lake provides an indicator of depth and previous research shows that as lake ice develops and becomes bottomfast it exhibits a distinct signature when observed using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This research proposes an efficient computational technique for identifying bottom-fast ice across lakes in the Northwest Territories using multi-temporal SAR backscatter images and applies a function called dynamic time warping (DTW), which provides a shape-based similarity metric for time series data. We used backscatter profiles from surveyed lakes with known bottomfast ice to generate a DTW similarity metric on a pixel by pixel basis for a set of lakes. The similarity metric was used to categorize ice status as bottomfast or floating ice with 89.1% accuracy. DTW is an effective technique to map bottomfast ice using SAR time series and has potential to address limitations of other approaches where certain ice structures over deep lakes can produce backscatter responses similar to bottomfast ice. ©, Copyright © CASI.","Backscattering; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Lakes; Pixels; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface water resources; Time series; Backscatter profiles; Computational technique; Dynamic time warping; Multi-temporal SAR; Satellite remote sensing; Shape based similarities; Similarity metrics; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074606293"

In the Arctic, satellite passive microwave and radar observations have revealed a trend towards an earlier snowmelt onset during the last decades, which is an important aspect of Arctic amplification and seaice decline. Around Antarctica, snowmelt on perennial ice is weak and very different than in the Arctic, with most snow surviving the summer. Here we compile time series of snowmelt onset dates on seasonal and perennial Antarctic sea ice from 1992 to 2014/15 using active microwave observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) European Remote Sensing (ERS) 1 and 2 missions (ERS-1 and ERS-2), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) radar scatterometers. We define two snowmelt transition stages: a weak backscatter rise, indicating the initial warming and destructive metamorphism of the snowpack (pre-melt), followed by a rapid backscatter rise, indicating the onset of thaw-freeze cycles (snowmelt). Results show large interannual variability, with an average pre-melt onset date of 29 November and melt onset of 10 December, respectively, on perennial ice, without any significant trends over the study period, consistent with the small trends of Antarctic sea-ice extent. There was a latitudinal gradient from early snowmelt onsets in mid-November in the northern Weddell Sea to late (end of December) or even absent snowmelt conditions in the southern Weddell Sea. We show that QSCAT Ku-band-derived (13.4 GHz signal frequency) pre-melt and snowmelt onset dates are earlier by 20 and 18 d, respectively, than ERS and ASCAT Cband-derived (5.6 GHz) dates. This offset has been considered when constructing the time series. Snowmelt onset dates from passive microwave observations (37 GHz) are later by 14 and 6 d than those from the scatterometers, respectively. Based on these characteristic differences between melt onset dates observed by different microwave wavelengths, we developed a conceptual model which illustrates how the seasonal evolution of snow temperature profiles may affect different microwave bands with different penetration depths. These suggest that future multi-frequency active and passive microwave satellite missions could be used to resolve melt processes throughout the vertical snow column of thick snow on perennial Antarctic sea ice. © 2019 Author(s).","Antarctica; ASCAT; backscatter; conceptual framework; ERS; latitudinal gradient; satellite data; scatterometer; sea ice; snowmelt; spatiotemporal analysis; time series","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069220402"

In order to produce long-term time series of sea ice freeboard data set, it is essential to investigate the difference and consistency between different satellite-based sea ice freeboard data sets. Hence in this study, the comparison between ice freeboard products from altimeters on board Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 is constructed from February 2017 to January 2018 excluding summer months. The comparisons of echo waveform shapes and along-track radar freeboard estimates suggest that the freeboard difference between these two sensors is caused by the signal range bin number and the chosen retrackers for different surface types (leads and sea ice floes). Monthly gridded freeboard results show that mean values of two different satellite altimeters agree each other reasonably over the whole study period. In general, Sentinel-3A data set shows lower freeboard estimates than CryoSat-2 data set, this phenomenon is found in both First-Year ice (FYI) and Multi-Year ice (MYI) regions. No ice-type-related difference indicates the good consistency between Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 data sets. Over the whole period, mean freeboard estimates for the entire Arctic differs generally by not more than 0.07 m between Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2.

However, a combined, all surface temperature data set for the Arctic has not been generated previously. Here we present the first combined land, ocean, and ice surface temperature data set for the Arctic produced from Along-Track Scanning Radiometer - 2 and the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer satellite sensors: the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature data set. Separate products, produced independently for each sensor and containing quantified uncertainties, together cover the period August 1995 to April 2012. Product validation, utilizing a more extensive in situ database than previous studies, shows that Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature surface temperatures generally agree with in situ data and are similar to previous validation of input surface temperature retrievals. Biases range from −1.74 to 0.23 K over open ocean, sea ice, snow over land, and the Greenland ice sheet with higher variability over snow/ice. However, there are noticeable outliers in the validation results, particularly over Arctic land in boreal summer for Along-Track Scanning Radiometer - 2, which are likely due to cloud contamination resulting from a climatologically static snow field being used for that sensor. This study suggests that the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer Arctic combined Surface Temperature data set presented here is a useful tool for assessment of models in the Arctic. Further work would have clear benefits including improvements to snow cover and cloud clearing to achieve a fully consistently processed, climate quality combined surface temperature data set for the Arctic region. ©2019.

Ability to regularly map the current location of a channel will aid safe passage for commercial, leisure and rescue craft. This work investigates the use of synthetic aperture radar data derived from satellites to provide accurate mapping of moving channels in coastal regions. As images must be collected at low tide, data availability is assessed considering the relationship between the orbital motion of the satellites and the tides. Change detection methods are applied to suitable images to map changes in the location of navigable channels. Pixels that undergo similar changes over time (e.g. from water covered to exposed sand) are grouped together by examining the principal component of the covariance matrix, for a vector composed of pixel values from the same location at different times.

The impact of melt ponds on energy absorption is controlled primarily through their influence on ice albedo, which is, in turn, governed in large part by the ponds' spatial coverage. This work seeks to observe the spatial coverage of melt ponds across the Arctic basin with sufficient accuracy to investigate pond-albedo feedback and presents an improved technique to achieve this goal. We approach the problem by using the Open Source Sea Ice Processing algorithm to classify surface features in submeter resolution optical satellite imagery over select sites where such imagery is available. These data establish “true” estimates of pond coverage and the ponds' spectral reflectance. This information is then used to inform, improve, and test spectral unmixing and machine learning techniques that seek to determine melt pond coverage from more widely available, but lower resolution, optical satellite imagery (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The new machine learning approach improves accuracy from prior work and can contribute to improved efforts to validate melt pond models or understand trends in pond coverage. Nevertheless, we encounter and carefully document significant challenges to retrieving melt pond fractions from low-resolution optical imagery. These limit accuracy to levels below that necessary for resolving climatologically important trends. We conclude that greatly expanding the collection of high-resolution satellite imagery over sea ice is necessary to monitor melt pond coverage with the accuracy needed by the scientific community. ©2020.

In this study, experiments were conducted on natural sea ice in the Bohai Sea of China to obtain the spectral reflectance of sea ice contaminated by different quantities of pulverized coal. The reflection characteristics of sea ice and pulverized coal particles were analyzed using these in-situ measurements, and it was determined that the reflection characteristics of a mixed sea ice–pulverized coal pixel could be described by the linear mixed pixel model. The proportions of pulverized coal surface area on ten sea ice samples were then determined by evaluating the average reflectivity in the 1600–1630 nm wide band using the linear mixed pixel model with an absolute error of 0.23 and a maximum relative error of 16.53%. Notably, the errors were generally larger for pixels with smaller portions of pulverized coal surface area. By overcoming the influence of sea ice background reflectivity, the proposed method of estimating the surface area of pulverized coal particles in mixed sea ice–pulverized coal pixels was found to be accurate. This study provides important basic data and feasible methods for large-scale remote monitoring of pulverized coal on the surface of sea ice using multispectral or hyperspectral infrared bands, and provides technical support for the supervision of environmental pollution near ports. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","mixed pixels; pulverized coal pollution; remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079706905"

In particular, we evaluate the dependency of the drift speed on the near-surface wind speed and sea ice conditions. Considering the seasonal cycle of the Arctic basin averaged drift speed, the model reproduces the summer-autumn drift speed well but significantly overestimates the winter-spring drift speed, compared to satellite-derived observations. Also, the model does not capture the observed seasonal phase lag between drift and wind speed, but the simulated drift speed is more in phase with the near-surface wind. The model calculates a realistic negative correlation between drift speed and ice thickness and between drift speed and ice concentration during summer-autumn when the ice concentration is relatively low, but the correlation is weaker than observed. A daily grid-scale diagnostic indicates that the model reproduces the observed positive correlation between drift and wind speed. The strongest impact of wind changes on drift speed occurs for high and moderate wind speeds, with a low impact for rather calm conditions. The correlation under low-wind conditions is overestimated in the simulations compared to observation/ reanalysis data. A sensitivity experiment demonstrates the significant effects of sea ice form drag from floe edges included by an improved parameterization of the transfer coefficients for momentum and heat over sea ice. However, this does not improve the agreement of the modeled drift speed / wind speed ratio with observations based on reanalysis data for wind and remote sensing data for sea ice drift. An improvement might be achieved by tuning parameters that are not well established by observations. © Author(s) 2020.","Arctic Ocean; climate modeling; coupling; drag; ice drift; ice thickness; parameterization; regional climate; sea ice; surface wind; wind velocity","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085741666"

In this experiment, scan angles of the Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) and Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) were experimentally changed to observe from nadir to about +34°. While the result showed that the precipitation echo could be obtained at wider scan angles, the occurrence of sidelobe and grating lobe clutters not seen in a normal scan were simultaneously observed. The mainlobe clutter height of KuPR increased linearly along the incident angle, and 0.5 mm/h precipitation may be masked up to 4 km over land at the angle of +34°. Besides, the grating lobe clutter clearly occurred in KuPR when the ground surface of the grating lobe direction was land or sea ice. The maximum scan angle without the grating lobe contamination was +23.43°, approximately corresponding to 355 km swath width with the orbit altitude of 407 km. For KaPR, the grating lobe contamination was not significant and the mainlobe clutter height peaked at the scan angle of around 26°, and then tended to decrease at larger scan angles. Therefore, precipitation at the lower altitude may have a chance to be detected even at larger scan angles, while weaker surface echoes at larger scan angles may need new techniques to estimate precipitation for the KaPR. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Clutter (information theory); Planning; Precipitation (meteorology); Radar clutter; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Dual-frequency precipitation radars; Feasibility studies; Global precipitation measurements; Grating lobes; Ground surfaces; Incident angles; Orbit altitude; Precipitation radar; detection method; experimental study; feasibility study; precipitation assessment; remote sensing; SIR; swath bathymetry; Radar measurement","Meteorological radar; radar clutter; spaceborne radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087548751"

Due to the wide variety of marine things and the large differences in morphology, it has brought greater difficulties to the recognition of marine remote sensing images. In order to obtain better segmentation results of ocean remote sensing images, this paper proposes an cross attention mechanism(Horizontal and Vertical) of exponential operation combined with multi-scale convolution algorithm. Among them, the cross attention mechanism and expanded distribution weight coefficient mentioned in this paper are first proposed. First, Input the marine remote sensing image features into an cross attention mechanism algorithm of exponential operation to obtain feature weight coefficients and joint weight coefficients in multiple directions; Then, the features with weight coefficients are input into the multi-access convolutional layer and the multi-scale dilated convolutional layer respectively for deep feature mining; Then the above steps are repeated twice, and finally the semantic segmentation of marine remote sensing images is achieved by fusing multiple deep-level features afterwards. Experiments were conducted on three public marine remote sensing data sets, and the results proved the effectiveness of our proposed cross attention mechanism of extended operation algorithm. The F values of the MAMC model on Beach, Island and Sea ice data sets have reached 99.4%, 91.25%, 87.08% respectively. Compared with other models, the effect is significantly improved, and proved the powerful performance of the algorithm in the semantic segmentation of marine remote sensing images. © 2013 IEEE.","Convolution; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Scales (weighing instruments); Sea ice; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Convolution algorithm; Marine remote sensing; Marine remote sensing data; Ocean remote sensing; Remote sensing technology; Segmentation results; Semantic segmentation; Remote sensing","convolution and dilated convolution; Cross direction attention mechanism; deep learning; marine remote sensing; multi-access convolutional","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090044390"

We propose a semi-supervised classification method that separates open water from sea ice and can utilise ERS-1/2, Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR images. The classification combines automatic segmentation with a manual segment selection stage. The segmentation algorithm requires only the backscatter intensities and incidence angle values as input, therefore can be used to establish a consistent decadal sea ice record. In this study we investigate the sea ice conditions in two Svalbard fjords, Kongsfjorden and Rijpfjorden. Both fjords have a seasonal ice cover, though Rijpfjorden has a longer sea ice season. The satellite image dataset has weekly to daily records from 2002 until now, and less frequent records between 1991 and 2002. Time overlap between different sensors is investigated to ensure consistency in the reported sea ice cover. The classification results have been compared to high-resolution SAR data as well as in-situ measurements and sea ice maps from Ny-Ålesund. For both fjords the length of the sea ice season has shortened since 2002 and for Kongsfjorden the maximum sea ice coverage is significantly lower after 2006.

Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on FY-3B is the microwave radiometer of China's own research and development and has aroused widespread concern. Long time series of earth observation data records play an important role in the research of earth environment changes and trends. The Arctic region is used as the study area and the data of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on Global Change Observation Mission 1st-Water (GCOM-W1) are considered the standard data in providing the intercalibration result and the basis of retrieving remote sensing parameters in Arctic region in the future. Ascending and descending brightness temperatures at 10 channels in 2015 from FY-3B/MWRI are calibrated against those from GCOM-W1/AMSR-2. Before brightness temperature data analysis and intercalibration, the data are processed in five steps. The first step is reading data, in which the DN value of remote sensing is transferred to brightness temperature value in the research region. The second step is data quality control. If the standard deviation of values in a grid and eight surrounding grids is more than 3 K, then the values in the nine grids should be eliminated. The value that is more than 300 K or less than 10 K should also be eliminated. In the third step, stereographic projection is used to project the brightness temperature value, time, longitude, and latitude into 896×608 grids. In the fourth step, data at the land-sea boundary and Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) should be eliminated because of the mixed pixel. First, the grid data of 7×7 around the land data are marked as land, and the data marked as land are removed. Then, the ratio of V187 to V365 from AMSR-2 is used to calculate the MIZ. The ratio, which is equal to 0.92, is viewed as the threshold to divide the sea ice and the open water. Thereafter, the 3×3 grid is set as a template. If the template includes the grids that represent sea ice and open water, then the nine grids are eliminated. The fifth and last step is to set the time window as 30 min and the space window as 12.5 km ×12.5 km and convert 2D matched data to 1D data for intercalibration. The intercalibration results of MWRI and AMSR-2 are as follows. First, the brightness temperature data of each channel of MWRI are smaller than those of AMSR-2, and the absolute values of monthly bias of vertical polarization channels are greater than those of horizontal polarization channels at the same frequency. The difference in monthly bias between ascending and descending orbits is small in each channel, which is less than 1 K. Second, the difference in the monthly bias in each channel between the ascending and descending orbits in the sea ice area is less than 1 K, while that in the open water is between 0 and 1.5 K. Third, linear regression analysis shows that most of the correlation coefficients of MWRI and AMSR-2 in each channel are above 0.99, which indicates a good correlation. The slope and intercept of the intercalibration of each channel in the ascending and descending orbits are obtained. Fourth, the brightness temperature of MWRI after calibration is consistent with that of AMSR-2. This consistency indicates that the intercalibration is effective. © 2020, Science Press.

However, a challenge in the remote sensing field is having a sufficient quantity of data to train a CNN, in particular, for conditions that are observed less frequently. In this study, a CNN is trained and tested to estimate sea ice concentration from synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR). We first investigate the importance of including samples of intermediate ice concentration in the training data, which correspond to samples from the marginal ice zone (MIZ). In the present study, ice concentration from image analysis charts is used to provide training data labels. The MIZ for these ice charts are believed to be less accurate than those of the high and low concentrations, but nevertheless, our results support including these samples in the training data set. Additional experiments are then carried out increasing the number of MIZ sample, both from similar regions and a different ice region. It is found the MIZ is represented best in the test data when more samples from a similar region are included. Overall the results improve upon earlier studies, increasing the classification accuracy of the MIZ from 0.66 to 0.74. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Convolution; Neural networks; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Additional experiments; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Low concentrations; Marginal Ice Zone; Sea ice concentration; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Training data sets; artificial neural network; concentration (composition); data set; image classification; marginal ice zone; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; Remote sensing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065068410"

The unprecedented volume of data collected in this region is nearly optimal to describe the state and changes in the Beaufort Gyre environmental system at synoptic, seasonal, and interannual time scales.

This special collection of studies contributes time series of the Beaufort Gyre data; new methodologies in observing, modeling, and analysis; interpretation of measurements and model output; and discussions and findings that shed light on the mechanisms regulating Beaufort Gyre dynamics as it transitions to a new state under different climate forcing. ©2019.

In order to verify the algorithm of GNSS-R, the simulation of GNSS-R plays an important role in this research field. Delay waveform (DW) and delay-Doppler map (DDM) are the main observables in GNSS-R simulation, and are usually effects by the complex ocean environment, such as wind and swell. Besides the effects of wind, this article focuses on analyzing the influence of swell on the simulation of GNSS-R. In this article, a complex model of DW and DDM is presented with effects of swell. Swell modeled here by narrow-band Gaussian spectrum, and the influence of swell on the sea surface scattering coefficient, which can be calculated using Kirchhoff approximation-geometric optics. Observables obtained from the simulation in the space-borne scene are analyzed. The simulation results show that swell has a stable and significant impact on the simulation of GNSS-R observables. Compared with models under no consideration of swell, the model with effects of swell has higher accuracy. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Soil moisture; Surface scattering; Surface waters; Wind; Delay-doppler maps; Gaussian spectra; Geometric optics; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Kirchhoff approximations; Model and simulation; Ocean environment; Sea surface scattering; algorithm; computer simulation; GNSS; modeling; numerical model; remote sensing; swell; waveform analysis; Global positioning system","Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R); model; observable; simulation; swell","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085493001"

However, the use of Sentinel-1 for sea ice classification has not been popular because of relatively higher level of system noise and radiometric calibration issues. By taking advantage of our recent development on Sentinel-1 image noise correction, we suggest a fully automated SAR image-based sea ice classification scheme which can provide a potential near-real time services of sea ice charting. The denoised images are processed into texture features and a machine learning-based classifier is trained by feeding digitized ice charts. The use of ice chart rather than manually classified reference image makes enable an automated training which minimizes the effects from biased human decision. The resulting classifier was tested over the Fram Strait area for an extensive dataset of Sentinel-1 constellation acquired from October 2017 to May 2018. The classification results are shown in comparison with the ice charts, and the feasibility of the ice chart-feeded automated classifier is discussed. © 2019 IEEE.","Automation; Classification (of information); Ferroelectric RAM; Geology; Information services; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Turing machines; Automated classifiers; Classification results; Dual-polarizations; Radiometric calibrations; Satellite constellations; Sea ice classification; Sentinel-1; Texture features; Image classification","classification; sea ice; Sentinel-1; synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077704418"

Therefore, the variability of wintertime MY ice plays a vital role in modulating the variations in the Arctic sea ice minimum extent during the following summer. As a response, the ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions may be significantly affected by the variations in the MY ice cover. Satellite observations are characterized by their capability to capture the spatiotemporal changes of Arctic sea ice. During the recent decades, many active and passive sensors onboard a variety of satellites (QuikSCAT, ASCAT, SSMIS, ICESat, CryoSat-2, etc.) have been used to monitor the dramatic loss of Arctic MY ice. The main objective of this study is to outline the advances and remaining challenges in monitoring the MY ice changes through the utilization of multiple satellite observations. We summarize the primary satellite data sources that are used to identify MY ice. The methodology to classify MY ice and derive MY ice concentration is reviewed. The interannual variability and trends in the MY ice time series in terms of coverage, thickness, volume, and age composition are evaluated. The potential causes associated with the observed Arctic MY ice loss are outlined, which are primarily related to the export and melting mechanisms. In addition, the causes to the MY ice depletion from the perspective of the oceanic water inflow from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the water vapor intrusion, as well as the roles of synoptic weather, are analyzed. The remaining challenges and possible upcoming research subjects in detecting the rapidly changing Arctic MY ice using the combined application of multisource remote sensing techniques are discussed. Moreover, some suggestions for the future application of satellite observations on the investigations of MY ice cover changes are proposed. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","Arctic Ocean; multiyear sea ice; satellite observation","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088397295"

As such, L-band data provide complementary information to C- and X-band data.As part of the Copernicus expansion, ESA has initiated the study phase for an L-band SAR mission (ROSE-L). At national level, Germany is perusing the implementation of the proposed Tandem-L mission.Recently, disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies have emerged on the EO market.

A realistic representation of sea ice affects the reliability of process representation, environmental forecast, and climate projections. Realistic simulations of sea ice kinematics require the consideration of both large-scale and finescale geomorphological structures such as linear kinematic features (LKF). We propose a multiscale directional analysis (MDA) that diagnoses the spatial characteristics of LKFs. The MDA is different from previous analyses in that it (i) does not detect LKFs as objects, (ii) takes into account the width of LKFs, and (iii) estimates scale-dependent orientation and intersection angles. The MDA is applied to pairs of deformation fields derived from satellite remote sensing data and from a numerical model simulation with a horizontal grid spacing of;4.5 km. The orientation and intersection angles of LKFs agree with the observations and confirm the visual impression that the intersection angles tend to be smaller in the satellite data compared to the model data. The MDA distributions can be used to compare satellite data and numerical model fields using conventional metrics such as a Euclidean distance, the Bhattacharyya coefficient, or the Earth mover's distance. The latter is found to be the most meaningful metric to compare distributions of LKF orientations and intersection angles. The MDA proposed here provides a tool to diagnose if modified sea ice rheologies lead to more realistic simulations of LKFs. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) does not have infrared channels, which makes cloud detection over snow and ice surfaces even more challenging. This study investigates the methodology of applying EPIC's two oxygen absorption band pair ratios in the A band (764, 780 nm) and B band (688, 680 nm) for cloud detection over the snow and ice surfaces. We develop a novel elevation and zenith-angle-dependent threshold scheme based on radiative transfer model simulations that achieves significant improvements over the existing algorithm. When compared against a composite cloud mask based on geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors, the positive detection rate over snow and ice surfaces increased from around 36% to 65% while the false detection rate dropped from 50% to 10% for observations of January 2016 and 2017. The improvement in July is less substantial due to relatively better performance in the current algorithm. The new algorithm is applicable for all snow and ice surfaces including Antarctic, sea ice, high-latitude snow, and high-altitude glacier regions. This method is less reliable when clouds are optically thin or below 3km because the sensitivity is low in oxygen band ratios for these cases. © 2020 Author(s).","Southern Ocean; adsorption; algorithm; detection method; infrared imagery; instrumentation; observational method; oxygen; performance assessment; radiative transfer; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; snow cover","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083098679"

The system consists of a set of original optical devices for recording of range - time - intensity (RTI) images of sea surface from optical sections of the sea surface and camera for the recording of the wave breakings and the sea wave spectra [1-5] by spectral analysis of the sea surface images. These RTI images enable one to receive complete information about kinematics characteristic of various manifestations on the sea surface, including sea surface waves, near surface wind flow manifestations on the sea surface, internal waves (IW) manifestations, oil slicks and so on owing to its ability to screen objects according to their velocity. The recording of wave spectra and temporal variability of the whitecap coverage performs from the photograph of sea surface synchronous with the RTI images of sea surface. A method for retrieval of sea wave's slopes from RTI images is presented. The system of optical devices is suitable for remote sensing of sea surface from sea platform, ship or vehicle. The brightness angular structure of the cloudless sky is studied based on the model of the sunlight single scattering. These model data are compared to the experimental angular characteristics of the sky brightness obtained due to digital imaging of the horizon from the oceanographic platform.

It is therefore of great importance to estimate the annual iceberg encounter frequencies to select robust concepts for offshore field development, to design offshore structures and possibly to plan ice management operations. These encounter frequencies are often estimated using numerical models. Regardless of the model, considerable uncertainties often exist in the input data of icebergs at the sources, i.e., the annual number of icebergs released at the source and their size characteristics. The aim of this work is to reduce these uncertainties by utilizing state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing data and a complementary numerical model of iceberg drift and deterioration. Iceberg length and width distributions derived using Sentinel-2 optical imagery are presented at the major iceberg sources in the Barents Sea, which are Franz Josef Land, the eastern side of Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya. Over 22,000 icebergs were manually identified, with the largest observed iceberg being approximately 1 km long, originating from Franz Josef Land. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to estimate the annual number of icebergs released into the Barents Sea by comparing the model results against Copernicus iceberg density data derived from the satellite synthetic aperture radar system onboard Sentinel-1. The importance of satellite remote sensing data cannot be understated because it is undoubtedly the best way to calibrate and validate the results of numerical iceberg drift models. Finally, with the calibrated model and the derived iceberg size, a map of the Barents Sea with updated annual iceberg encounter frequencies is presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Deterioration; Glacial geology; Numerical models; Offshore oil well production; Offshore structures; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea level; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Calibrated model; Ice management; Iceberg drifts; Offshore field development; Offshore installations; Optical imagery; Satellite remote sensing data; State of the art; complementarity; drift (glacial deposit); iceberg; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; uncertainty analysis; Sea ice","Barents Sea; Iceberg drift model; Iceberg production; Iceberg size characteristics; Sentinel satellites","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089223992"

In addition, the remote sensed ice motion product provided by National Snow and Ice Data Center was used to reconstruct backward and forward ice drifting trajectories from the buoy deployment sites during 1979–2016. Sea ice in the central Arctic Ocean in late summer is trending to have travelled from lower latitudes, and to be advected to the region more involved in the Transpolar Drift Stream (TDS) during 1979–2016. The strengthened TDS has played a crucial role in Arctic sea ice loss from a dynamic perspective. The trajectory of ice is found to be significantly related to atmosphere circulation indices. The Central Arctic Index (CAI), defined as the difference in sea level pressure between 84°N, 90°W and 84°N, 90°E, can explain 34–40% of the meridional displacement along the backward trajectories, and it can explain 27–40% of the zonal displacement along the forward trajectories. The winter Beaufort High (BH) anomaly can explain 18–27% of the zonal displacement. Under high positive CAI values or high negative winter BH anomalies, floes from the central Arctic tended to be advected out of the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait or other marginal gateways. Conversely, under high negative CAI values or high positive winter BH anomalies, ice tended to become trapped within a region close to the North Pole or it drifted into the Beaufort Gyre region. The long-term trend and spatial change in Arctic surface air temperature were more remarkable during the freezing season than the melt season because most energy from the lower troposphere is used to melt sea ice and warm the upper ocean during summer. © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we make use of a combination of ground-based remotely sensed and meteorological measurements at Dumont d'Urville (DDU) station, satellite images, and simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to analyze a major katabatic wind event in Adélie Land. Once well developed over the slope of the ice sheet, the katabatic flow experiences an abrupt transition near the coastal edge consisting of a sharp increase in the boundary layer depth, a sudden decrease in wind speed, and a decrease in Froude number from 3.5 to 0.3. This so-called katabatic jump manifests as a turbulent ""wall""of blowing snow in which updrafts exceed 5 m s21. The wall reaches heights of 1000 m and its horizontal extent along the coast is more than 400 km. By destabilizing the boundary layer downstream, the jump favors the trapping of a gravity wave train-with a horizontal wavelength of 10.5 km-that develops in a few hours. The trapped gravity waves exert a drag that considerably slows down the low-level outflow. Moreover, atmospheric rotors form below the first wave crests. The wind speed record measured at DDU in 2017 (58.5 m s21) is due to the vertical advection of momentum by a rotor. A statistical analysis of observations at DDU reveals that katabatic jumps and low-level trapped gravity waves occur frequently over coastal Adélie Land. It emphasizes the important role of such phenomena in the coastal Antarctic dynamics. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.","Adelie Coast; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Advection; Boundary layers; Clouds; Gravity waves; Ice control; Offshore oil well production; Sea ice; Wind; Abrupt transition; Boundary layer depth; Katabatic winds; Meteorological measurements; Satellite images; Vertical advection; Wave excitation; Weather research and forecasting models; computer simulation; extreme event; gravity wave; katabatic flow; remote sensing; satellite imagery; weather forecasting; wind; Weather forecasting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085759895"

But a large number of unlabeled samples containing abundant information are not fully utilized. In view of this situation, a method combining active learning and semi-supervised learning is proposed to study the classification of sea ice remote sensing spectral images. The active learning part combines BVSB, SOM neural networks and ECBD algorithm to select representative samples containing uncertainty and diversity for training. The semi-supervised learning part integrates the idea of active learning use TSVM to select relatively reliable samples containing information from a large number of unlabeled samples for iterative training. Then, the results of classification and semi supervised classification are used cooperatively to guarantee the correctness of the pseudo-labeled samples through consistency verification. To verify the effectiveness of the method, Hyperion hyperspectral data with a resolution of 30 m in Baffin Bay area (the verification data is Landsat-8 data with a resolution of 15 m) and Landsat-8 data with a resolution of 15 m in Liaodong Bay (the verification data is Google Earth data with a resolution of 4.77 m) area are used for experiments of sea ice classification. The experimental results show that the cooperative classification method can make full use of the information contained in a large number of unlabeled samples in the case of a small number of label samples, and achieve rapid convergence higher classification accuracy (the overall accuracy is 90.003% and 93.288%, re-spectively), which verifies that the method is suitable for classification of sea ice remote sensing. © 2020, Editorial Office of Haiyang Xuebao.

Based on those comparisons, spectral signatures were associated with thick multiyear ice and thin ice.

The Ice Concentration Retrieval from the Analysis of Microwaves (IceCREAM) algorithm is based on an optimal estimation, with a simple radiative transfer model derived from satellite observations at 0% and 100% SIC. Observations at low and high frequencies have different spatial resolutions, and a scheme is developed to benefit from the low errors of the low frequencies and the high spatial resolutions of the high frequencies. This effort is specifically designed for the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) project, equipped with a large deployable antenna to provide a spatial resolution of ~5 km at 18 and 36 GHz, and ~15 km at 6 and 10 GHz. The algorithm is tested with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations, for a clear scene over the north polar region, with collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimates and the Ocean Sea Ice-Satellite Application Facilities (OSI SAF) operational products. Several algorithm options are tested, and the study case shows that both high spatial resolution and low errors are obtained with the IceCREAM method. It is also tested for the full polar regions, winter and summer, under clear and cloudy conditions. Our method is globally applicable, without fine-tuning or further weather filtering. The systematic use of all channels from 6 to 36 GHz makes it robust to changes in ice surface conditions and to weather interactions. © 2020 by the authors.","Image resolution; Microwave antennas; Microwave measurement; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; High spatial resolution; Large deployable antenna; Low and high frequencies; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Radiative transfer model; Satellite application facilities; Satellite passive microwave; Microwaves","Copernicus imaging microwave radiometer; Inversion; Optimal estimation; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085551041"

Under such heterogeneous surfaces, drifting phytoplankton communities are experiencing a wide range of irradiance conditions and intensities that cannot be sampled representatively using single-location measurements. Combining experimentally derived photosynthetic parameters with transmittance measurements acquired at spatial scales ranging from hundreds of meters (using a remotely operated vehicle, ROV) to thousands of meters (using a surface and underice trawl, SUIT), we assessed the sensitivity of water column primary production estimates to multiscale underice light measurements. Daily primary production calculated from transmittance from both the ROV and the SUIT ranged between 0.004 and 939 mgC·m−2·day−1. Upscaling these estimates at larger spatial scales using satellite-derived sea ice concentration reduced the variability by 22% (0.004–731 mgC·m−2·day−1). The relative error in primary production estimates was two times lower when combining remote sensing and in situ data compared to ROV-based estimates alone. These results suggest that spatially extensive in situ measurements must be combined with large-footprint sea ice coverage sampling (e.g., remote sensing, aerial imagery) to accurately estimate primary production in ice-covered waters. Also, the results indicated a decreasing error of primary production estimates with increasing sample size and the spatial scale at which in situ measurements are performed. Conversely, existing estimates of spatially integrated phytoplankton primary production in ice-covered waters derived from single-location light measurements may be associated with large statistical errors. Considering these implications is important for modeling scenarios and interpretation of existing measurements in a changing Arctic ecosystem. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Satellites could be particularly valuable for surveying polar bears (Ursus maritimus) because of their remote circumpolar distribution and status of concern in the face of Arctic warming. However, the white coloration of bears does not contrast well with sea ice or snow in panchromatic imagery. We took advantage of the close-range observation capabilities of a drone to determine the spectral signature of polar bears as they would appear in multispectral satellite imagery, capturing low-altitude (≤100 m) multispectral images of bears in natural landscapes in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. The bears' spectral curves were similar to those previously measured from pelts, with reflectance increasing with wavelength through the visible spectrum, although live bears had higher reflectance than pelts in the red-edge and near-infrared region. Bears had sufficiently consistent reflectance across the overhead surface of their body that ≥50% of pixels comprising each subject could be confidently matched to its core spectral signature, boding well for detection in coarser satellite imagery. Bears were clearly distinguishable from snow by their much lower reflectance in the blue and green region, but could potentially be confounded with large bright boulders. Currently available multispectral satellite imagery may still be too coarse (1.2 m/pixel) to reliably detect polar bears on sea ice, but resolution will likely continue to increase in future systems. Drones are a useful tool to resolve the spectral signature of wildlife species that could potentially be detected in satellite imagery. © 2019","Canada; Churchill; Manitoba; Manitoba; Ursus maritimus; bear; climate change; conservation status; measurement method; panchromatic image; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; sea ice; spatial resolution; spectral reflectance; surveying; unmanned vehicle; wildlife management","Climate change; Conservation; Image analysis; Polar biology; Remote sensing; Unmanned aircraft","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068472607"

In this paper, the latest sea ice data sets from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative were firstly combined to comprehensively analyze the spatial and temporal variation of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice thickness (SIT) from 2002 to 2017. The results show that during this period, the SIC of the Kara Sea and the Barents Sea decreases the most significantly, reaching −1.11%·year−1. The Arctic annual average sea ice extent (SIE) and sea ice area (SIA) exhibit noticeable decreasing trends, reaching −0.0592 × 106 km·year−1 and −0.0628 × 106 km·year−1, respectively. Both of Arctic SIE and SIA vary seasonally, and they reach the minimum values of 4.97 × 106 km2 and 3.96 × 106 km2 in September and the maximum values of 14.58 × 106 km2 and 13.35 × 106 km2 in March, respectively. Moreover, the Arctic SIE and SIA anomaly series from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed based on the linear regression method. It is found the most noticeable decreasing trends of the Arctic SIE and SIA are from July to October. The maximum variation of the SIE is −1.06 × 106 km2(10a)−1, and the maximum variation of the SIA is −1.09 × 106 km2(10a)−1. The Arctic SIE and SIA present the smallest decreasing trends from April to May, which are −0.19 × 106 km2(10a)−1 and −0.2 × 106 km2(10a)−1, respectively. The Arctic SIT also displays a pronounced decreasing trend with −0.015 m·year−1 in autumn and −0.018 m·year−1 in winter. The annual average SIT reaches a minimum of 1.28 m in 2013 and a maximum of 1.66 m in 2005. Particularly, the SIT of the Hudson Bay decreases the most significantly, reaching −0.051 m·year−1. Finally, the Arctic average SIT was tested by the Mann-Kendall method. It is found that the SIT has a sudden change in 2007, from a slight increase in 2003–2007 to a significant decrease in 2007–2017. Overall, the decreasing trend of the Arctic sea ice (both SIC and SIT) is significant in the past decade. These findings can contribute to future research on polar regions and global climate change. © 2020.

The remotely sensed SIC products include the Chinese Feng Yun-3B with enhanced NASA Team (NT2) sea ice algorithm (FY3B/NT2), the Chinese Feng Yun-3C with NT2 (FY3C/NT2), the DMSP SSMIS with Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm (SSMIS/ASI), and the GCOM-W AMSR2 with NASA Bootstrap (BT) algorithm (AMSR2/BT). The OISSTV2 (NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily Temperature Analysis Version 2) dataset was adopted as a reference to compare and evaluate the performance of four satellite-based SIC products. The results show that remotely sensed SIC values are generally in good consistency with OISSTV2. Meanwhile, it is observed that different products have different bias in polar regions. Overall, the SSMIS/ASI product has better performance during the whole period, demonstrating that ASI algorithm may be more potential in SIC estimation. Our results also illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristic of discrepancy between microwave remotely sensed SIC products and reanalysis dataset for the whole Arctic and Antarctic regions. The large difference for all the four SIC products mostly occurs in summer and marginal ice zone, indicating a great deal of uncertainty of satellite SIC products in this period and areas. The results will be useful to find possible errors in the satellite SIC products for further algorithm improvement. © 2019 IEEE.","Geology; NASA; Satellites; Sea ice; Algorithm improvements; consistency; Microwave remote sensing; Optimum interpolation; Reanalysis; Sea ice concentration; Spatial and temporal distribution; Turbulence interactions; Remote sensing","consistency; microwave remote sensing; reanalysis data; sea ice concentration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077692128"

Space-based SSS are currently provided by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites. However, there are no planned missions to guarantee continuity in the remote SSS measurements for the near future. The CIMR mission is in a preparatory phase with an expected launch in 2026. CIMR is focused on the provision of global coverage, high resolution sea-surface temperature (SST), SSS and sea-ice concentration observations. In this paper, we evaluate the mission impact within the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) SSS processing chain. The CMEMS SSS operational products are based on a combination of in situ and satellite (SMOS) SSS and high-resolution SST information through a multivariate optimal interpolation. We demonstrate the potential of CIMR within the CMEMS SSS operational production after the SMOS era. For this purpose, we implemented an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) based on the CMEMS MERCATOR global operational model. The MERCATOR SSSs were used to generate synthetic in situ and CIMR SSS and, at the same time, they provided a reference gap-free SSS field. Using the optimal interpolation algorithm, we demonstrated that the combined use of in situ and CIMR observations improves the global SSS retrieval compared to a processing where only in situ observations are ingested. The improvements are observed in the 60% and 70% of the global ocean surface for the reconstruction of the SSS and of the SSS spatial gradients, respectively. Moreover, the study highlights the CIMR-based salinity patterns are more accurate both in the open ocean and in coastal areas. We conclude that CIMR can guarantee continuity for accurate monitoring of the ocean surface salinity from space. © 2019 by the authors.","Image processing; Interpolation; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Oceanography; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Soil moisture; Surface waters; CIMR; Copernicus marine service; Microwave remote sensing; Multivariate optimal interpolation; Observing system simulation experiments; Optimal interpolation algorithm; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); In situ processing","CIMR; Copernicus marine service; Sea surface salinity; microwave remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070453583"

Specifically, in the Mediterranean Sea, the air-ocean temperature deviations have a profound role during the several stages of Mediterranean cyclonic events. Subsequently, this enhances the need for better knowledge and representation of the sea surface temperature (SST). In this work, an analysis of the impact and uncertainty of the SST from different well-known datasets on the life-cycle of Mediterranean cyclones is attempted. Daily SST from the Real Time Global SST (RTG_SST) and hourly SST fields from the Operational SST and Sea Ice Ocean Analysis (OSTIA) and the NEMO ocean circulation model are implemented in the RAMS/ICLAMS-WAM coupled modeling system. For the needs of the study, the Mediterranean cyclones Trixi, Numa, and Zorbas were selected. Numerical experiments covered all stages of their life-cycles (five to seven days). Model results have been analyzed in terms of storm tracks and intensities, cyclonic structural characteristics, and derived heat fluxes. Remote sensing data from the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (IMERG) for Global Precipitation Measurements (GPM), Blended SeaWinds, and JASON altimetry missions were employed for a qualitative and quantitative comparison of modeled results in precipitation, maximum surface wind speed, and wave height. Spatiotemporal deviations in the SST forcing rather than significant differences in the maximum/minimum SST values, seem to mainly contribute to the differences between the model results. Considerable deviations emerged in the resulting heat fluxes, while the most important differences were found in precipitation exhibiting spatial and intensity variations reaching 100 mm. The employment of widely used products is shown to result in different outcomes and this point should be taken into consideration in forecasting and early warning systems. © 2020 by the authors.","Atmospheric temperature; Heat flux; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Storms; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Uncertainty analysis; Wind; Air-sea interface; Forecasting and early warnings; Global precipitation measurements; Ocean circulation models; Sea surface temperature (SST); SST forcing; Structural characteristics; WAM model; Oceanography","Air-sea interface processes; Mediterranean cyclones; RAMS model; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sensitivity analysis; SST forcing; WAM model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081895044"

Experimental data on the temperature variations of the hot reference load are considered, which together with the relict radiation measurements are used for internal calibration of the radiometer.

Satellite microwave remote sensing based on microwave reflection signals reflected by the sea ice surface has been playing an essential role in monitoring and analyzing the Arctic SIT and sea ice concentration (SIC) during the past decades. Recently, passive microwave satellites incorporating an L-band radiometer, such as soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and soil moisture active passive (SMAP), have been used for analyzing sea ice characteristics, in addition to land and ocean research. In this study, we present a novel method to estimate thin SIT and sea ice roughness (SIR) using a conversion relationship between them, from the SMAP and SMOS data. Methodologically, the SMAP SIR is retrieved. The SMAP thin SIT and SMOS SIR are estimated using a conversion relationship between thin SIT data from SMOS data and SMAP-derived SIR, which is obtained from the spatial and temporal collocation of the SMOS thin SIT and the SIR retrieved from SMAP. Our results for the Arctic sea ice during December for four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018, show high accuracy (bias = -2.268 cm, root mean square error (RMSE) = 15.919 cm, and correlation coeffcient (CC) = 0.414) between the SMOS-provided thin SIT and SMAP-derived SIT, and good agreement (bias = 0.03 cm, RMSE = 0.228 cm, and CC = 0.496) between the SMOS-estimated SIR and SMAP-retrieved SIR. Consequently, our study could be effectively used for monitoring and analyzing the variation in the Arctic sea ice. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Earth (planet); Mean square error; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Microwave remote sensing; Positive and negative effect; Satellite remote sensing; SMAP; SMOS; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Thickness; Soil moisture","Roughness; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; SMAP; SMOS; Thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076526239"

HB is covered by ice and snow in winter, which completely melts in summer. For about six months each year, satellite remote sensing of sea surface salinity (SSS) is possible over open water. SSS links freshwater contributions from river discharge, sea ice melt/freeze, and surface precipitation/evaporation. Given the strategic importance of HB, SSS has great potential in monitoring the HB freshwater cycle and studying its relationship with climate change. However, SSS retrieved in polar regions (poleward of 50°) fromcurrently operational space-based L-band microwave instruments has large uncertainty (~ 1 psu) mainly due to sensitivity degradation in cold water (<5°C) and sea ice contamination. This study analyzes SSS from NASA Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity(SMOS) missions in the context of HB freshwater contents. We found that the main source of the year-to-year SSS variability is sea ice melting, in particular, the onset time and places of ice melt in the first couple of months of open water season. The freshwater contribution from surface forcing P-E is smaller in magnitude comparing with sea ice contribution but lasts on longer time scale through the whole open water season. River discharge is comparable with P-E in magnitude but peaks before ice melt. The spatial and temporal variations of freshwater contents largely exceed the remote sensed SSS uncertainty. This fact justifies the use of remote sensed SSS for monitoring the HB freshwater cycle. © 2020 by the author.

Systematic comparison and assessment of satellite remote sensing ice motion products are still deficient because of limited data length.This study examines the performance of remote sensing ice velocity products with different time intervals in the central Arctic.The region around Fram Straitare systematically evaluated by employing the International Arctic Buoy Programme(IABP) buoy data from 2009 to 2017.The results show that for the central Arctic, the NSIDC ice velocity with one-day interval hasgreater error in winter than that in summer.In winter, the western icemotion in the southern part of the Beaufort Seais overestimated, whereasthe transpolar drift stream from the Kara Sea to the northern armof Greenland is underestimated. For five ice motion products with two-day interval, the accuracy does not depend completely on resolutions of source data.The improvement of the ice motion retrieval algorithm and the merging method can also improve the accuracy of the ice velocity.The order of the root mean square errors (RMSE) is OSISAF-Merged <OSISAF-AMSR<Ifremer-AMSR< OSISAF-SSM<OSISAF-ASCAT.The RMSEs of ice motion products with three-day interval, which employ the same retrieval algorithm, aredependent on the spatial resolution of the source data.

The glaciers showed seasonal speedup initiated between late May and early June, and terminated between late June and early July. Ice speed subsequently decreased from July to September. The timing of the speedup coincided with the onset of the air temperature rise to above freezing, suggesting an influence of meltwater availability on the glacier dynamics. No clear relationship was found between the speedup and the terminus position or the sea-ice/ice-mélange conditions. These results suggest that the meltwater input to the glacier bed triggered the summer speedup. The excess of summer speed (June-August) over the mean for the rest of the year accounted for 0.5-13% of the annual ice motion. Several glaciers showed seasonal frontal variations, i.e. retreat in summer and advance in winter. This was not due to ice-speed variations, but was driven by seasonal variations in frontal ablation. The results demonstrate the dominant effect of glacier surface melting on the seasonal speedup, and the importance of seasonal speed patterns on longer-Term ice motion of marine-Terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland.

During a rapid level fall, started in 1960, its ice conditions also changed. Before 1960, the Aral Sea provided favourable conditions for ice scouring by ice hummocks. After 1960, the rapid level fall favored good preservation of ice gouges on the exposing bottom. However, the study of the scours on the exposed bottom of the Aral Sea using remote sensing methods along with the fieldwrork provided the means to reconstruct a variety of mechanisms of the ice effect acted during sea level fall. It allowed to reconstruct ice conditions and mechanisms of the ice effect on the seabed. We found out traces of former multiple keels bottom scouring, repeated scouring while drifting along the winds and currents, marks of wind direction changes, grounded ice hummocks, scouring on the fast ice rim, etc. In the late 2000s. together with the critical decrease in the wrater area, the formation of ice hummocks diminished and ice effect on the Aral Sea bed ceased.

The monitoring began during the calving of iceberg C28 from the Mertz Ice Tongue in February 2010 and ended in April 2012. The evolution of the iceberg area was determined from ENVISAT ASAR images, and the freeboard change was derived from CryoSat-2 profiles. Two patterns of iceberg area decreases are observed during iceberg drifting. In austral summer (from October to next March), iceberg area shows a gradual decrease and it is interpreted to represent edge wasting, sidewall melting and wave erosion, the gradual decrease of the area of C28A occurred at rates between 8.1 km2/month and 16.5 km2/month. In austral winter (from April to September), iceberg area has several discrete decreases (sudden drop) while it remained constant for most of the time, and it is interpreted to be large rift calving primarily caused by ocean swell and basal melting. Calving area of the two studied icebergs is observed to be greater in the winter. The freeboard decreased at different rates at different locations on the same iceberg (between −0.02 ± 0.22 and −0.82 ± 0.28 m/month for C28A and C28B), suggesting a laterally inhomogeneous melting of icebergs. The average rate of change of the C28B freeboard during its 22-month grounding period was −0.03 ± 0.01 m/month, which is considerably smaller than the −0.76 ± 0.23 m/month observed when it was freely drifting in the ocean. The cold-water regime surrounding the iceberg can help the iceberg maintain a stable state.

The application of our approach is complicated by cloud cover and low sun angles at high latitudes during the periods where rivers typically carry ice floes, and by the fact that the near-simultaneous swath overlaps, by design, do not cover the complete Earth surface. Still, the approach enables direct remote sensing of river surface velocities for numerous cold-region rivers at a number of locations and occasionally several times per year - which is much more frequent and over much larger areas than currently feasible. We find that freeze-up conditions seem to offer ice floes that are generally more suitable for tracking, and over longer time periods, compared with typical ice break-up conditions.

The effect of wind speed on Antarctic sea ice motion is discussed in combination with monthly mean wind speed data. The results show that the Antarctic sea ice velocity is generally increasing from 1979 to 2014, in which the average velocity in winter is the largest, followed by autumn, spring and summer. Sea ice velocity in Weddell Sea and Ross Sea is also accelerating and the average trend of sea ice velocity in winter is stronger than that in summer. The Antarctic sea ice velocity and wind speed are consistent with the seasonal and annual change trends and there is a significant positive correlation between them. Therefore, the strength of wind speed is an important influencing factor for the increase of sea ice velocity. © 2019, Executive Office of the Journal.

The assimilation is performed by a Local Error Subspace Transform Kalman filter coded in the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework. The new estimates can be generally thought of as combined model and satellite thickness (CMST). It combines the skill of satellite thickness assimilation in the freezing season with the model skill in the melting season, when neither CryoSat-2 nor Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sea ice thickness is available. Comparisons with in situ observations from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project, Ice Mass Balance Buoys, and the NASA Operation IceBridge demonstrate that CMST reproduces most of the observed temporal and spatial variations. Results also show that CMST compares favorably to the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System product and even appears to correct known thickness biases in the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. Due to imperfect parameterizations in the sea ice model and satellite thickness retrievals, CMST does not reproduce the heavily deformed and ridged sea ice along the northern coast of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and Greenland.

This was done by comparing data from bio-optical models applied to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery with field samples from 12 campaigns ranging from 2016 to 2019 at the Jupia Reservoir (Brazil), along with analyzing the spectra of different atmospheric correction algorithms, in the search of possible natural effects that hampered the quality of the satellite-derived data. Compared water quality parameters were: Turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and Secchi disk depth. Results showed that, the data presented very low, if not inexistent, correlation. However, the error values estimated reflected that the data were not too far apart, despite having no correlation. The effects that may have caused the low correlation and the errors were analyzed through the retrieval of the spectra in the field sampling points. The compared spectra showed that, effects of haze caused by aerosols, bottom reflectance from optical depth and the presence of submerged plants were the most critical reflectance altering phenomena, which reflected in the extracted water quality data. Inelastic scattering, fluorescence and ozone layer influence were undetected, while the adjacency effect and Sun glint presented little to no effect on the data.

Although triple-window algorithm (TWA) including shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel/s is a proven better option for SST retrieval, generation of linear coefficients including shortwave channels during daylight hours is extremely challenging due to the highly nonlinear contribution of solar reflection and scattering. On the other hand, SWIR channel/s can be easily incorporated in physical deterministic SST (PDSST) retrieval method. A successful implementation of SWIR channels for daytime SST retrieval in operational environment from MODIS-AQUA using PDSST method is discussed here. The performances of newly developed PDSST are validated by two different ways using: a) collocated in-situ measurements (buoys/Argos) quantitively and b) microwave SST from AMSR2 qualitatively. This study mainly focuses on the Indian Ocean region that is known to be a most oceanographic dynamic region among all Oceans. Also, the performances of newly developed PDSST are compared with the quality of the currently NASA-distributed MODIS-AQUA SST, obtained from Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). An enormous improvement in the quality and coverage for daytime SST data by PDSST using SWIR channels as compared to currently operational PO.DAAC SST product that is regression based without SWIR channels is reported in this paper. © 2019 SPIE.","Atmospheric temperature; Hydrophilicity; Infrared radiation; NASA; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Acronyms; Brightness temperatures; Image area; Nonlinear contributions; Operational environments; References; Sea surface temperature (SST); Times Roman; Oceanography","Acronyms; Image area; References; Times Roman","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077792712"

To produce reliable sea-ice information, satellite remote-sensing methods should be established and validated using accurate field data, but obtaining field data on Arctic sea-ice is very difficult due to limited accessibility. In this situation, digital surface models derived from aerial images can be a good alternative to topographical field data. However, to achieve this, we should discuss an additional issue, i.e., that low-textured surfaces on sea-ice can reduce the matching accuracy of aerial images. The matching performance is dependent on the matching cost and search window size used. Therefore, in order to generate high-quality sea-ice surface models, we first need to examine the influence of matching costs and search window sizes on the matching performance on low-textured sea-ice surfaces. For this reason, in this study, we evaluate the performance of matching costs in relation to changes of the search window size, using acquired aerial images of Arctic sea-ice. The evaluation concerns three factors. The first is the robustness of matching to low-textured surfaces. Matching costs for generating sea-ice surface models should have a high discriminatory power on low-textured surfaces, even with small search windows. To evaluate this, we analyze the accuracy, uncertainty, and optimal window size in terms of template matching. The second is the robustness of positioning to low-textured surfaces. One of the purposes of image matching is to determine the positions of object points that constitute digital surface models. From this point of view, we analyze the accuracy and uncertainty in terms of positioning object points. The last is the processing speed. Since the computation complexity is also an important performance indicator, we analyze the elapsed time for each of the processing steps. The evaluation results showed that the image domain costs were more effective for low-textured surfaces than the frequency domain costs. In terms of matching robustness, the image domain costs showed a better performance, even with smaller search windows. In terms of positioning robustness, the image domain costs also performed better because of the lower uncertainty. Lastly, in terms of processing speed, the PC (phase correlation) of the frequency domain showed the best performance, but the image domain costs, except MI (mutual information), were not far behind. From the evaluation results, we concluded that, among the compared matching costs, ZNCC (zero-mean normalized cross-correlation) is the most effective for sea-ice surface model generation. In addition, we found that it is necessary to adjust search window sizes properly, according to the number of textures required for reliable image matching on sea-ice surfaces, and that various uncertainties due to low-textured surfaces should be considered to determine the positions of object points. © 2019 by the authors.","Antennas; Frequency domain analysis; Image matching; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Template matching; Textures; Uncertainty analysis; Aerial images; Arctic sea ice; Computation complexity; Digital surface models; Matching performance; Performance indicators; Satellite remote sensing; Zero-mean normalized cross correlations; Quality control","Aerial image; Arctic sea-ice; Digital surface model; Matching cost","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065719662"

Airborne VSWIR measurement performance for bright Greenland ice and dark bare rock/soil targets is compared against the MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN®) radiative transfer code (version 6.0), and a coincident Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquisition on 29 July 2015 during an in-flight radiometric calibration experiment. Airborne remote sensing flights were carried out in northwestern Greenland in preparation for the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimeter mission. A total of nine science flights were conducted over the Greenland ice sheet, sea ice, and openocean water. The campaign's primary purpose was to correlate green laser pulse penetration into snow and ice with spectroscopic-derived surface properties. An experimental airborne instrument configuration that included a nadirviewing (looking downward at the surface) non-imaging Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Inc. spectrometer that measured upwelling VSWIR (0.35 to 2.5 μm) spectral radiance (Wm-2 sr-1 μm-1) in the two-color Slope Imaging Multipolarization Photon-Counting Lidar's (SIMPL) ground instantaneous field of view, and a zenith-viewing (looking upward at the sky) ASD spectrometer that measured VSWIR spectral irradiance (W m-2 nm-1) was flown. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable radiometric calibration procedures for laboratory, in-flight, and field environments are described in detail to achieve a targeted VSWIR measurement requirement of within 5 % to support calibration/validation efforts and remote sensing algorithm development. Our MODTRAN predictions for the 29 July flight line over dark and bright targets indicate that the airborne nadir-viewing spectrometer spectral radiance measurement uncertainty was between 0.6 % and 4.7 % for VSWIR wavelengths (0.4 to 2.0 μm) with atmospheric transmittance greater than 80 %. MODTRAN predictions for Landsat 8 OLI relative spectral response functions suggest that OLI is measuring 6 % to 16 % more top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance from the Greenland ice sheet surface than was predicted using apparent reflectance spectra from the nadirviewing spectrometer. While more investigation is required to convert airborne VSWIR spectral radiance into atmospherically corrected airborne surface reflectance, it is expected that airborne science flight data products will contribute to spectroscopic determination of Greenland ice sheet surface optical properties to improve understanding of their potential influence on ICESat-2 measurements. © 2019 Author(s).","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; algorithm; calibration; ICESat; Landsat; measurement method; open ocean; radiometer; radiometric method; remote sensing; satellite mission; sea ice; spectrometer; top of atmosphere","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063466957"

A typical example of a river confluence is the merging of the Volga and Oka rivers (Russia). This paper presents some new results on the Volga/Oka rivers confluence based on both 'in situ' measurements of hydrological characteristics in the MZ and on satellite observations. During the 'in situ' measurements a large set of data regarding velocity fields, chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature, turbidity, parameters of organic surface films etc. was obtained. It is found that significant differences between the hydrological characteristics of the Volga and Oka flows are observed at sufficiently large distances downstream the junction apex (about 10 river widths or more); and the mixing zone remains quite narrow. Film sampling and further analysis of the surfactant films in the MZ were carried out. It is shown that the surface tension decreases and the film elasticity grows in the foam/slick bands separating the Volga and Oka flows thus indicating the increased concentration of surfactants in the bands. Satellite images of the Volga-Oka MZ are collected indicating that the confluence area is clearly seen in satellite optical imagery (MSI Sentinel-2 satellite) due to strong difference in color between the flows. The radar imagery shows the mixing zone in the form of a slick/foam band (SAR Sentinel-1) which manifests on the water surface due to enhanced damping of short wind waves. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Image enhancement; Mixing; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; River pollution; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Surface active agents; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Velocity; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Hydrological characteristics; Mixing zones; Radar imagery; River confluence; Satellite observations; Satellite optical imagery; Slicks; Rivers","Mixing zone; River confluence; Satellite optical and radar imagery; Slicks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077796874"

The TCDRs are shown to be in general good agreement with similar products from other sources, such as the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2).

In general, the Kara Sea is fully covered with thicker sea ice in winter, but sea ice cover is continuously declining during the summer. The year 2003 was the year with the most severe ice conditions, while 2012 and 2016 were the least severe. The extensive sea ice begins to break up before May and becomes completely frozen at the end of December again. The duration of ice melting is approximately twice than that of the freezing. Since 2007, the minimum ice coverage has always been below 5%, resulting in wide open-waters in summer. Furthermore, the relevant local driving factors of external atmospheric forcing on ice conditions have been quantitatively calculated and analyzed. Winter accumulated surface air temperature has been playing a primary role on the ice concentration and thickness condition in winter and determining ice coverage index in the following melt-freeze stage. Correlation coefficients between winter accumulated temperature and ice thickness anomaly index, the ice coverage anomaly index, duration of melt-freeze stage can approach -0.72, -0.83 and 0.80, respectively. In summer, meridional winds contribute closely to summer ice coverage anomaly index, with correlation coefficient exceeding 0.80 since 2007 and 0.90 since 2010. Copyright © 2019.

Analysis of historical Envisat ASAR images allowes to obtain detailed spatial statistics of eddy generation sites, their diameters and vorticity sign. As shown, the total number of cyclones strongly dominates over anticyclones. Eddies are frequently observed over continental slope and shelf regions around Svalbard, however, about 80% of them are identified over the deep Fram Strait regions. In general, eddies range in size between 1.5 km and 64 km with a mean value of 8 km. Larger eddies of 10-30 km in diameter are usually found over deep water, while smaller eddies of 3-7 km in diameter prevail around Svalbard. As observed, the overall pattern of eddy field in the strait attributes well to the position of West Spitsbergen Current jet and its southern recirculation branch known from literature. Analysis of sequential Sentinel-1 images allows to retrieve surface current velocity field having a clear signature of an anticyclonic eddy in the Fram Strait marginal ice zone. Mean orbital velocity of the observed eddy is estimated to be around 0.4-0.5 m/s, in good agreement with earlier field observations.

Even covered by thin ice, leads can still serve as prime windows for heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially in the winter. Lead geometry and distribution in the Arctic have been studied using optical and microwave remote sensing data, but turbulent heat flux over leads has only been measured on-site during a few special expeditions. In this study, we derive turbulent heat flux through leads at different scales using a combination of surface temperature and lead distribution from remote sensing images and meteorological parameters from a reanalysis dataset. First, ice surface temperature (IST) was calculated from Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal images using a split-window algorithm; then, lead pixels were segmented from colder ice. Heat flux over leads was estimated using two empirical models: bulk aerodynamic formulae and a fetch-limited model with lead width from Landsat-8. Results show that even though the lead area from MODIS is a little larger, the length of leads is underestimated by 72.9% in MODIS data compared to TIRS data due to the inability to resolve small leads. Heat flux estimated from Landsat-8 TIRS data using bulk formulae is 56.70% larger than that from MODIS data. When the fetch-limited model was applied, turbulent heat flux calculated from TIRS data is 32.34% higher than that from bulk formulae. In both cases, small leads accounted for more than a quarter of total heat flux over leads, mainly due to the large area, though the heat flux estimated using the fetch-limited model is 41.39% larger. A greater contribution from small leads can be expected with larger air-ocean temperature differences and stronger winds. © 2019 Author(s).","Arctic; air-sea interaction; algorithm; atmosphere-ocean coupling; estimation method; heat flux; Landsat; MODIS; numerical model; pack ice; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; surface temperature; turbulent flow","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066781583"

To adequately utilize the massive number of unlabeled samples, which contain abundant information, we propose a cooperative framework based on active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) for sea ice image classification. We acquire the most valuable samples using AL and make full use of the abundant information contained in the unlabeled samples using SSL, and then conduct a label consistency verification procedure to further ensure the quality of the pseudo-labeled samples obtained through cooperation between AL and SSL. In the AL part, we adopt a sampling strategy that integrates uncertainty and diversity criteria to acquire the most valuable samples to label. In the SSL part, we utilize the SSL sampling strategy to choose the unlabeled samples with the most information and little redundancy, and use the transductive support vector machine (TSVM) as the classification model. The cooperation between AL and SSL ensures the accuracy of the pseudo-labeled samples through a consistency verification procedure. We conduct comparative experiments using the method proposed and other methods on two hyperspectral images obtained from the Earth Observation Satellite 1 (EO-1).

Comparison of data products from IceBridge and CryoSat-2 is complicated by the fact that they use different geophysical corrections: Reference ellipsoid, geoid model, tide model, and atmospheric corrections to derive surface elevation and sea-ice freeboard. In this paper, we compare sea-ice surface elevation and freeboard using eight coincident CryoSat-2, Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) observations with direct IceBridge underflights of CryoSat-2 ground tracks. We apply identical geophysical corrections to CryoSat-2 and IceBridge data to eliminate elevation biases due to these differences and focus on differences due to retracker performance. The IceBridge ATM and LVIS elevation and freeboard and Snow Radar snow depth data sets are averaged to each CryoSat-2 footprint for comparison. With snow depth measurements, we are able to compare elevations and freeboards at the snow/ice interface for five different CryoSat-2 retrackers (ESA, GSFCv1, AWI, JPL, and GSFCv2) and IceBridge. The overall mean of freeboard differences between GSFCv2, ESA, AWI, JPL retrackers, and ATM are in agreement within 0.05 m. However, the five different CryoSat-2 retrackers show distinct differences in mean elevation over leads and over floes. This suggests that the physical interpretation of the different retrackers needs to be considered depending on usage, for example, elevations from CryoSat-2 retrackers need to be carefully calibrated before comparing with elevation from other satellites for long-term surface elevation trends. © 2018 IEEE.","Algorithms; Data structures; Geophysics; Radar tracking; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow melting systems; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Tracking radar; altimetry; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric model; Geophysical corrections; Ice surface elevation; Physical interpretation; Sea surfaces; Spatial and temporal scale; airborne survey; airborne thematic mapper; algorithm; atmospheric correction; calibration; comparative study; CryoSat; elevation; geophysical method; polar region; satellite altimetry; satellite mission; sea ice; Snow","Algorithms; altimetry; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054408786"

Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given end user objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modelling, prediction and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess 8 years of sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors on board the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonar (ULS) instruments and Operation IceBridge (OIB), respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice thickness, particularly between ∼40.5 and 4m. Among data compared, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. There is disagreement among the products in terms of the magnitude of the mean thickness trends, especially in spring 2017. Regional comparisons reveal noticeable differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the marginal seas in areas of considerable ship traffic. © 2019 Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; assessment method; AVHRR; climate change; CryoSat; ice thickness; instrumentation; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; sea ice; SMOS; sonar","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064395987"

Retreat and acceleration of outlet glaciers coincides with atmospheric and oceanic warming resulting in a significant contribution to sea-level rise. The relative role of surface meltwater production, runoff and infiltration on the dynamics of these systems is not well-understood. To assess how surface meltwater impacts shear margin dynamics and regional ice flow of outlet glaciers, we investigate the impact of basal lubrication of Jakobshavn Isbræ shear margins due to drainage from water-filled crevasses. We map the areal extent of inundated crevasses during summer (May–August) from 2000 to 2012 using satellite imagery and determined an increasing trend in the total areal extent over this time interval. We use a numerical ice flow model to quantify the potential impact of weakened shear margins due to surface melt derived basal lubrication on regional flow velocities. Ice flow velocities 10km from the lateral margins of Jakobshavn were amplified by as much as 20%, resulting in an increase of ∼0.6 Gt yr−1 in ice-mass discharge through the shearmargins into the ice stream. Under future warming scenarios with increased surface melt ponding, simulations indicate up to a 30% increase in extra-marginal ice flow. We conclude that surface meltwater will likely play an important role in the evolving dynamics of glacier shear margins and the future mass flux through Greenland’s major marine-terminating outlet glaciers. © 2018 Lampkin, Parizek, Larour, Seroussi, Joseph and Cavanagh.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Jakobshavn Glacier; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Dynamics; Flow velocity; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea level; Shear flow; Accelerated mass; Glaciology; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice dynamics; Meltwater; Potential impacts; Surface meltwater; Surface meltwater production; climate change; climate effect; flow velocity; glacier dynamics; glacier retreat; hydrological response; ice flow; ice stream; infiltration; meltwater; runoff; sea ice; warming; Ice","Glaciology; Ice dynamics; Meltwater; Remote sensing; Supraglacial hydrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057082720"

The US Air Force's Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) is one such satellite constellation. A novel aspect of OPIR imagery is its near-continuous capture of single channel shortwave infrared data over the Arctic. Although traditionally used for missile warning and strategic defense, the exceptionally high temporal resolution of the OPIR data stream makes it an attractive source for Arctic remote sensing, particularly as the Arctic has warmed at a rate nearly double that of lower latitudes. This work assesses the feasibility of using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite – 16 (GOES-16) data as a proxy for OPIR imagery in the Arctic. Specifically, we seek to determine whether a single channel shortwave infrared (SWIR) approach can be used to detect and chart Arctic sea ice. We used a series of 32-image daily sets (4 images per hour x 8 h) over four-day periods acquired by GOES-16 in late April 2016 (as well as mid-March, mid-May, and mid-June) to chart sea ice, clouds and water in Hudson Bay, Canada. To do this, we applied image enhancement techniques to raw data imagery and then employed a time-based classification algorithm to the enhanced data cube. Overall, our method successfully discriminated sea ice from water and clouds when all conditions were present with improved discrimination over current daily products for sea ice charting in the Northern Hemisphere. The simple methodology of the developed algorithm is critical to ensuring the temporal resolution of the sensor is capitalized. The rapid timeline for production of this type of data is essential to the relevancy to military operations as well as emergency response/preparedness operations in the Arctic as it becomes more accessible in coming years. Our results make a compelling argument for the application of Air Force Missile Warning data to assist in the mapping, tracking, and assessment of sea ice in the high Arctic. © 2019","Arctic Ocean; Canada; Hudson Bay; algorithm; GOES; infrared radiation; Northern Hemisphere; remote sensing; satellite constellation; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; sea ice; shortwave radiation; warning system","GOES; Missile warning; OPIR; Remote sensing; SBIRS; Sea ice; Shortwave infrared","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066246364"

Laboratory and pool measurements, physical modelling and offshore experiments have been combined to fully understand the signal collected over slick-covered area. As the measured signal is analytically expressed according to the geophysical parameters of the imaged slick, it enables to fully monitor the ocean surface: is a slick present? What kind of slick is it (extremely thin or not)? Is it a known product (existing in the data base)? Can the thickness be probed by the used of optical or radar device? What is the slick volume? In the Health Security and Environment (HSE) context, an exhaustive measurement campaign can be done in order to create a data base with hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon emulsion signatures, extinction coefficients, skin depths, minimum thicknesses perceptible thanks to extinction and thickness values. Thus, it offers more processing options in the optic branch of the tool to monitor the slick. Depending on the available data, optical and/or radar imagery, the capability of slick detection, characterization and quantification will be presented. After a recall of the HSE specificity, the paper will give an overview of the main features of the input data that is to say SAR and optical images. Then, based on modelling results, the optimal observation conditions for radar and optical imagery will be introduced. Afterwards, capability of detection will be described and illustrated for both the radar and the optical case. In the optical domain, the process will distinguish at least two classes: thin and thick. In the HSE context, a database can be used to identify some detected products. The last step is quantification. A sophisticated method, relying on L band radar imagery, will be used to identify pixels covered by a film, meaning presence of oil at the surface, and the ones for which the oil may be as droplets in the volume. The traditional use of SAR data is also extended to the estimation of the oil concentration within an oil and seawater mixture. For optical data, the most direct quantification process relies on automatic Bonn code classification. The code links a class with a range of thickness and computes a minimum and a maximum volume of product in each class. If the product is in the data base a more suited classification and volume assessment can be done. If the thickness is too thin (spectral signature due to absorption is too weak) or too thick (only the upper part of the product layer contributes to the signal), a thickness estimated thanks to pool experiment is associated to each class enabling to compute a volume per class and a global volume. In the other cases, in a near future, modelling would enable to assess the thickness. Concerning hydrocarbon emulsions, modelling in the optical domain is in progress in order to predict skin depth and to derive water content. © 2019 SPIE.","Codes (symbols); Emulsification; Emulsions; Geometrical optics; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Marine pollution; Network security; Offshore oil well production; Oil spills; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Capability of detection; Extinction coefficients; Geophysical parameters; Measurement campaign; Oil slicks; Oil spill detection; Spill volume; Water in oil emulsions; Radar imaging","Offshore remote sensing; Oil slick thickness; Oil spill detection; Oil spill volume; Sea pollution; Water-in-oil emulsion","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077799584"

Current passive microwave retrievals use daily averaged 19 GHz and 37 GHz data from the multi-channel microwave radiometer (SMMR) and/or the special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I). The development of a new passive microwave melt onset method capable of using higher resolution data is desirable. The new passive microwave melt onset method described here, named the Dynamic Threshold Variability Method (DTVM), uses higher resolution data from the 37 GHz vertically-polarized channel from the advanced microwave scanning radiometers (AMSR-E and AMSR-2). The DTVM MO detection methodology differs from previously presented passive microwave Arctic MO methods in that it does not use a fixed threshold of a brightness temperature parameter. Instead, the DTVM determines MO dates based on the distribution of dates corresponding to the exceedance of a range of brightness temperature variability thresholds. The method also uses swath data instead of daily averaged brightness temperatures, which is found to lead to improved melt detection. Two current passive microwave MO methods are compared and evaluated for applicability in the CAA alongside the DTVM. The DTVM provides MO dates at a higher spatial resolution than earlier methods in addition to higher correlation with MO dates from surface air temperature (SAT) reanalyses. It is found that, for some years, MO dates in the CAA exhibit a latitudinal dependence, while in other years the MO dates in the CAA are relatively uniform across the domain. © 2019 by the authors.","Chemical detection; Image resolution; Luminance; Microwave devices; Microwaves; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Temperature; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Brightness temperatures; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; High spatial resolution; Multi-channel microwave radiometers; Passive microwaves; Special sensor microwave/Imager; Surface air temperatures; Microwave sensors","Melt onset; Passive microwave; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067400694"

The number of matched data is 924. Firstly, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) is used to classify satellite remote sensing data into different water bodies, and then the best chlorophyll-a concentration algorithm is established. The results show that the mean percentage difference (MPD) in Case 2 water is 131.2% through comparing the percentage of chlorophyll-a provided by MODIS with the in-situ observations. In addition, the chlorophyll-a concentration of the new algorithm compared with the in-situ chlorophyll-a concentration are also calculated. The mean percentage difference in Case 2 water is 26.6%, and the average chlorophyll-a is 6.16 mg/m3, which is much closer to the in-situ value,7.22 mg/m3 than the average chlorophyll-a of MODIS, 13.7 mg/m3. The chlorophyll-a concentration deduced by the new algorithm of this study is consistent with the in-situ values in Case 2 water, and it is much more convergent than the data of MODIS. Obviously, the new algorithm established in this study can be used to improve the chlorophyll-a concentration estimation results in Case 2 water. When the new algorithm is applied to calculate the chlorophyll-a concentration of the marginal Northwestern Pacific, the value is still higher than the offshore waters. Additionally, the chlorophyll-a concentration calculated by this new algorithm is lower than the value provided by MODIS, but the difference between them in the offshore waters is small. However, the algorithm of this study can improve the overestimation of the original MODIS value. © 2019 SPIE.","Algorithms; Hydrophilicity; NASA; Offshore oil well production; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Space optics; Case 2 water; Chlorophyll-a concentration; In-situ observations; Mean percentage; Observation area; Offshore water; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite remote sensing data; Chlorophyll","Algorithm; Case 2 water; Chlorophyll-a concentration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077797267"

This technology could be used to improve navigation along vessel cruise paths; however, investigations on this topic have been limited. In this study, shipborne photographic observation (P-OBS) of sea ice was conducted using oblique-oriented cameras during the Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition in the summer of 2016. SIC and the areal fractions of open water, melt ponds, and sea ice (Aw, Ap, and Ai, respectively) were determined along the cruise path. The distribution of SIC along the cruise path was U-shaped, and open water accounted for a large proportion of the path. The SIC derived from the commonly used PM algorithms was compared with the moving average (MA) P-OBS SIC, including Bootstrap and NASA Team (NT) algorithms based on Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) data; and ARTIST sea ice, Bootstrap, Sea Ice Climate Change Initiative, and NASA Team 2 (NT2) algorithms based on Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. P-OBS performed better than PM remote sensing at detecting low SIC ( < 10%). Our results indicate that PM SIC overestimates MA P-OBS SIC at low SIC, but underestimates it when SIC exceeds a turnover point (TP). The presence of melt ponds affected the accuracy of the PM SIC; the PM SIC shifted from an overestimate to an underestimate with increasing Ap, compared with MA P-OBS SIC below the TP, while the underestimation increased above the TP. The PM algorithms were then ranked; SSMIS-NT and AMSR2-NT2 are the best and worst choices for Arctic navigation, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Lakes; Microwaves; NASA; Navigation; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Ships; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; Moving averages; Passive microwave data; Passive microwaves; Photographic observation; Sea ice concentration; Shipborne; Special sensor microwave imagers; Microwave sensors","Arctic navigation; Passive microwave; Sea ice concentration; Shipborne observation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071990895"

Anthropogenic debris travels across large distances and is ubiquitous in the water and on the shorelines, yet, observations of its sources, composition, pathways and distributions in the ocean are very sparse and inaccurate. Total amounts of plastics and other man-made debris in the ocean and on the shore, temporal trends in these amounts under exponentially increasing production, as well as degradation processes, vertical fluxes and time scales are largely unknown. Present ocean circulation models are not able to accurately simulate drift of debris because of its complex hydrodynamics. In this paper we discuss the structure of the future integrated marine debris observing system (IMDOS) that is required to provide long-term monitoring of the state of the anthropogenic pollution and support operational activities to mitigate impacts on the ecosystem and safety of maritime activity. The proposed observing system integrates remote sensing and in situ observations. Also, models are used to optimize the design of the system and, in turn, they will be gradually improved using the products of the system. Remote sensing technologies will provide spatially coherent coverage and consistent surveying time series at local to global scale. Optical sensors, including high-resolution imaging, multi- and hyperspectral, fluorescence, and Raman technologies, as well as SAR will be used to measure different types of debris. They will be implemented in a variety of platforms, from hand-held tools to ship-, buoy-, aircraft-, and satellite-based sensors. A network of in situ observations, including reports from volunteers, citizen scientists and ships of opportunity, will be developed to provide data for calibration/validation of remote sensors and to monitor the spread of plastic pollution and other marine debris. IMDOS will interact with other observing systems monitoring physical, chemical, and biological processes in the ocean and on shorelines as well as state of the ecosystem, maritime activities and safety, drift of sea ice, etc. The synthesized data will support innovative multi-disciplinary research and serve diverse community of users. © 2019 Maximenko, Corradi, Law, Van Sebille, Garaba, Lampitt, Galgani, Martinez-Vicente, Goddijn-Murphy, Veiga, Thompson, Maes, Moller, Löscher, Addamo, Lamson, Centurioni, Posth, Lumpkin, Vinci, Martins, Pieper, Isobe, Hanke, Edwards, Chubarenko, Rodriguez, Aliani, Arias, Asner, Brosich, Carlton, Chao, Cook, Cundy, Galloway, Giorgetti, Goni, Guichoux, Hardesty, Holdsworth, Lebreton, Leslie, Macadam-Somer, Mace, Manuel, Marsh, Martinez, Mayor, Le Moigne, Molina Jack, Mowlem, Obbard, Pabortsava, Robberson, Rotaru, Spedicato, Thiel, Turra and Wilcox.","","Antropogenic debris; Marine debris; Marine debris drift; Marine litter; Microplastics; Observing network design; Plastic pollution; Plastics; Sensor development","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069795208"

Satellite remote sensing is a significant tool for monitoring sea ice. The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to distinguish sea ice from sea water is one of the current research hotspots in this topic. To distinguish sea ice from the open sea, the polarization ratio characteristics of sea ice and sea water are studied for L-band and C-band radars, based on an electromagnetic scattering model of sea ice derived from the integral equation method (IEM) and the radiative transfer (RT) model. Numerical experiments are carried out based on the model and the results are given as follows. For L-band, the polarization ratio for sea water depends only on the incident angle, while the polarization ratio for sea ice is related to the incident angle and the ice thickness. For C-band, the sea water polarization ratio is influenced by the incident angle and the root mean square (RMS) height of the sea surface. For C-band, for small to medium incident angles, the polarization ratio for bare sea ice is mainly determined by the incident angle and ice thickness. When the incident angle increases, the RMS height will also affect the polarization ratio for bare sea ice. If snow covers the sea ice, then the polarization ratio for sea ice decreases and is affected by the RMS height of snow surface, snow thickness, volume fraction and the radius of scatterers. The results show that the sea ice and the open sea can be distinguished by using either L-band or C-band radar according to their polarization ratio difference. However, the ability of L-band to make this differentiation is higher than that of C-band. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Integral equations; Polarization; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Seawater; Snow; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Electromagnetic scattering; Global climate system; Integral equation methods; Numerical experiments; Polarization ratios; Radiative transfer model; Satellite remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Sea ice","electromagnetic scattering; polarization ratio; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059157072"

Radar returns may be from all ocean, all sea ice, or a mixture of the two, so the first task is the determination of which surface and then an interpretation of the signal to give range. Subsequently, corrections have to be applied for various surface and atmospheric effects before making a comparison with a reference level. This paper discusses the drivers for improved altimetry in the Arctic and then reviews the various approaches that have been used to achieve the initial classification and subsequent retracking over these diverse surfaces, showing examples from both LRM (low resolution mode) and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) altimeters. The review then discusses the issues concerning corrections, including the choices between using other remote-sensing measurements and using those from models or climatology.

Accurate snow depth is a precondition for representing thermodynamic processes in sea-ice systems and is helpful for estimating sea-ice thickness. To better apply Arctic snow-depth products released by different organizations, we compared four kinds of snow-depth products based on three kinds of passive microwave (PM) sensors and evaluated them against the snow depth measured by ice mass-balance buoys (IMB snow depth) and Operation Ice Bridge airborne snow radar (OIB snow depth).

Comparing the PM remote-sensing snow depths released by UB, NSIDC and NASA against IMB and OIB snow depths, it is found that NSIDC AMSR-E snow-depth product has the highest accuracy. Although these PM remote-sensing snow-depth products released by different organizations differ in accuracy, they all reflect the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of snow depth on Arctic sea ice. These comparisons and analysis of snow-depth products from different sensors released by different organizations provide a basis for further investigation of Arctic sea-ice thickness estimation and benefit the studies of Arctic sea ice and climate change. © 2019 C.

Such structures are called ""Plumes"". Traditionally, we can divided two research methods - contact (in-situ/ship measurements) and non-contact (remote sensing data). But, basically the joint use of in-situ measurements and remote sensing data in existing scientific works - is nominally, each source of information is used separately, and more often direct (in-situ) measurements are preferred, and remote sensing data is used as an auxiliary method for qualitative descriptive works. And there is still no reliable information on the extent to which quantitative estimates can be trusted, obtained from remote sensing data, especially in such difficult estuary areas.

This paper is devoted to the development of remote detection methods of gas leaks from underwater gas pipelines by images of slicks above them. A series of laboratory experiments was carried out, in which the structure of average flows in the water column created by bubble flows with different gas flow rates was obtained. The simulation of surfactant removal to the water surface by bubbles was performed by adding sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the laboratory cuvette at the concentration of 0.5 mg/l. For the surfactant film on the water surface, experimental dependences of its characteristics on the operation time of the ""bubble pump"", such as the surface tension coefficient, elasticity and the relative damping coefficient of small- scale waves under the film, were obtained. It was shown that there are flow convergence zones at some distance from the gas outlet area, which vary depending on the intensity of the gas flow. Surfactant film samples taken in these areas confirmed that over time, the accumulation of surfactants occurs on the water surface. Field experiment conducted in one of the backwaters of the Oka river in the city of Nizhny Novgorod allowed to spot and evaluate the size and shape of the film slick formed around the gas outlet area. The conducted experiments confirmed the formation of a surfactant film spot near the removal area, which indicates the possibility of its remote detection in full-scale conditions, provided the wind near water surface is not more than 2-10 m/s. The obtained data made it possible to get a general idea of the morphology and characteristics of the surfactant spot around the gas outlet from the water. © 2019 SPIE.","Flow of gases; Gases; Hydrophilicity; Morphology; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sodium dodecyl sulfate; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Velocity; Water pollution; Bubble flow; Field experiment; Film slicks; Laboratory experiments; Surfactant films; Velocity field; Gas pipelines","Bubble flow; Field experiment; Film slick; Laboratory experiment; PIV; Remote sensing of the oceans; Surfactant film; Velocity field","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077789538"

To ensure the safety of Arctic navigation, it is necessary to have unbiased data on the influence of ice thickness on vessels' speed and maneuverability. The paper suggests using a geoinformation system which includes data on speed and routes of the vessels of various capacities, as well as data of remote sensing of the earth about ice conditions. Two parts of traditional routes in the western part of the Russian Arctic were considered: the sea crossing from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea through the Kara Strait and the transition from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea through the Cape of Desire. A joint study of this data (layers) on the example of winter navigation of 2018 provides detailed information on the trends of speed reduction of ships under the conditions of fully consolidated ice. Based on the results of the study, the results are presented for four groups of vessels with different gross tonnage, capacity, ice pass and draft. To compare the results, the measured velocities were normalized to relative ones, which made it possible to identify common dependencies and trends. The availability of archival data on measurements of ice thickness in the geographic area under study and the predictive models for increasing ice thickness during the winter time mad it possible to develop adequate methods aimed at estimating the change in the properties of ice by varying the speed of vessels of various classes on the routes in the water area of the Northern Sea Route. Statistical processing of vessel speed in the ice fields made it possible to identify the sameness of the speed-reduction trends for the main groups of vessels and the distinctive features associated with the vessel's power and the use of icebreaker support. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

It is also the most important content in remote sensing monitoring of sea ice. In this study, a practical model of sea ice thickness (PMSIT) was proposed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In the proposed model, the MODIS data of the first band were used to estimate sea ice thickness and the difference between the second-band reflectance and the fifth-band reflectance in the MODIS data was calculated to obtain the difference attenuation index (DAI) of each pixel. The obtained DAI was used to estimate the integrated attenuation coefficient of the first band of the MODIS at the pixel level. Then the model was used to estimate sea ice thickness in the Bohai Sea with the MODIS data and then validated with the actual sea ice survey data. The validation results showed that the proposed model and corresponding parameterization scheme could largely avoid the estimation error of sea ice thickness caused by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sea ice extinction and allowed the error of 18.7% compared with the measured sea ice thickness. © 2018, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; heterogeneity; ice thickness; MODIS; parameterization; pixel; reflectance; remote sensing; sea ice","Bohai Sea; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); practical model; sea ice thickness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049801668"

To examine this damping effect of sea ice on the astronomical tides in the Bohai Sea, where sea ice is common in winter, this study has developed a three-dimensional ice-ocean coupled model with and without sea ice to investigate potential changes in astronomical tides based on the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM). This newly developed model was first evaluated against field observations and remote sensing images, including water elevations and sea ice cover, and showed good agreement between the modelling results and the observed data. In using the air forcing data (2009–2010) and the default sea ice drag coefficient of 0.0075, the model results show that in the presence of sea ice, the major tidal constituent M2 is reduced by 1 cm at the top of the three bays (from north to south: Liaodong Bay, Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay) in the Bohai Sea, but the tidal phase is almost not affected. A sensitivity run shows that the amplitude of M2 is decreased by 2 cm when increasing the drag coefficient from 0.005 to 0.01. Moreover, two extreme combinations of air temperatures and winds are simulated according to the standard deviation of wind speed and temperature over the past ten years, and the damping effects of sea ice on tides are almost negligible as well. Based on the water mass analysis, it is found that both the decreases of average volumetric flow rate for inflow and outflow due to ice through the three bays are relatively small compared to the average volumetric flow rate without ice. The convergence of the cross sectional area increases the tidal amplitude of M2, which compensates the damping effect caused by sea ice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bohai Bay; Bohai Sea; China; Laizhou Bay; Liaodong Bay; Liaoning; Pacific Ocean; Shandong; Yellow Sea; Damping; Drag; Drag coefficient; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Tidal power; Tides; Wind; Convergence; Cross sectional area; FVCOM; Ice-ocean coupled model; Momentum balances; Remote sensing images; Volumetric flow rate; Water mass analysis; damping; drag coefficient; finite volume method; ocean tide; remote sensing; sea ice; three-dimensional modeling; tidal constituent; tidal modeling; water mass; wind velocity; Sea ice","Convergence; FVCOM; Momentum balance; Sea ice drag; Tidal damping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060915067"

First year (FY) ridges and multi-year (MY) ridges may be present in the same region, but MY ridges are stronger and have the potential to cause greater damage to vessels and structures. A new approach has been developed to model electromagnetic (EM) scattering from sea ice ridges. Ridges are represented as having a rough surface over horizontally stratified and isotropic layers. The total scatter from the ridge is the sum of the scatter from the surface and the layers. This paper provides an overview of the modeling process and provides some initial simulation results showing the impacts of radar frequency and ice salinity on the scattered wave. Ice ridge surface and structure characteristics affect the nature of the scattered signal and additional work is required to determine if it is possible to reliably distinguish between ridge types. Future work will involve simulations using more detailed modeling of ice ridge profiles to better determine how radar frequency and ice ridge structure and phenology affect ice discrimination. © 2019 IEEE.","Oceanography; Radar; Remote sensing; Detailed modeling; Electromagnetic scattering; Isotropic layers; Modeling process; Radar frequencies; Remote sensing data; Scattered signals; Structure characteristic; Sea ice","Analytical solution; Ice type; Radar scattering; Sea ice; Simulation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103686568"

A multidisciplinary study of crude oil behavior in a sea ice environment was conducted at the University of Manitoba during the winter of 2016. In the experiment, medium-light crude oil was injected underneath young sea ice in a mesocosm. The physical and thermodynamic properties of the oil-infiltrated sea ice were monitored over a three-week time span, with concomitant analysis of the oil composition using analytical instrumentation. A resonant perturbation technique was used to measure the oil dielectric properties, and the contaminated sea ice dielectric properties were modeled using a mixture model approach. Results showed that the interactions between the oil and sea ice altered their physical and thermodynamic properties. These changes led to an overall decrease in sea ice dielectrics, potentially detectable by remote sensing systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic Regions; Ice Cover; Models, Theoretical; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Thermodynamics; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Arctic Ocean; Climate change; Crude oil; Dielectric materials; Dielectric properties; Perturbation techniques; Remote sensing; Thermodynamic properties; 1 ethylnaphthalene; 1 methylnaphthalene; 1 n butylnaphthalene; 1 n hexylnaphthalene; 1 n pentylnaphthalene; 1 n propylnaphthalene; alkane; cyclohexane; decane; dibenzofuran; dibenzothiophene; dimethylnaphthalene; methylalkylbenzene; methylalkylcyclohexane; methylnaphthalene; n alkylbenzene; n alkylcyclopentane; n butylcyclohexane; n butylcyclopentane; n propylbenzene; naphthalene; nonane; octane; pentamethylnaphthalene; petroleum; phenanthrene; tert butylbenzene; tetramethylnaphthalene; unclassified drug; undecane; unindexed drug; petroleum; Analytical Instrumentation; Arctic sea ice; Chemical compositions; Mixture model; Oil composition; Oil weathering; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Remote sensing system; chemical composition; crude oil; dielectric property; infiltration; marine pollution; mesocosm; physical property; remote sensing; sea ice; thermodynamics; weathering; Article; chemical composition; chemical reaction kinetics; climate change; environmental monitoring; gas chromatography; mesocosm; physical chemistry; physical parameters; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; temperature measurement; thermodynamics; time of flight mass spectrometry; analysis; Arctic; chemistry; ice cover; infrared spectrophotometry; oil spill; theoretical model; water pollutant; Sea ice","Arctic sea ice; Dielectrics; Oil composition; Oil weathering; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063452874"

The measurements in this dataset were compiled from field notes, papers, technical reports, and digital files. SUMup is a compiled, community-based dataset that can be and has been used to evaluate modeling efforts and remote sensing retrievals. Active submission of new or past measurements is encouraged. Analysis of the dataset shows that Greenland Ice Sheet density measurements in the top 1m do not show a strong relationship with annual temperature. At Summit Station, Greenland, accumulation and surface density measurements vary seasonally with lower values during summer months. The SUMup dataset is a dynamic, living dataset that will be updated and expanded for community use as new measurements are taken and new processes are discovered and quantified. © 2018 Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055482636"

ERA-20C performance over Arctic sea ice is assessed by comparisons with measurements and data from other reanalyses. ERA-20C performs similarly with respect to the annual cycle of downwelling radiation, air temperature, and wind speed compared to reanalyses with more extensive data assimilation such as ERA-Interim and MERRA. PIOMAS-20C sea ice thickness and volume are then compared with in situ and aircraft remote sensing observations for the period of ~1950-2010. Error statistics are similar to those for PIOMAS. We compare the magnitude and patterns of sea ice variability between the first half of the twentieth century (1901-40) and the more recent period (1980-2010), both marked by sea ice decline in the Arctic. The first period contains the so-called early-twentieth-century warming (ETCW; ~1920-40) during which the Atlantic sector saw a significant decline in sea ice volume, but the Pacific sector did not. The sea ice decline over the 1979-2010 period is pan-Arctic and 6 times larger than the net decline during the 1901-40 period. Sea ice volume trends reconstructed solely from surface temperature anomalies are smaller than PIOMAS-20C, suggesting that mechanisms other than warming, such as changes in ice motion and deformation, played a significant role in determining sea ice volume trends during both periods. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Arctic Ocean; Earth atmosphere; Error statistics; Remote sensing; Wind; Arctic; Comparisons with measurements; Model based reconstruction; Model evaluation/performance; Reanalysis; Sea ice thickness and volumes; Ship observations; Surface temperature anomalies; arctic environment; atmosphere-ice-ocean system; data assimilation; downwelling; ice cover; performance assessment; reconstruction; sea ice; spatial variation; temperature anomaly; temporal variation; Sea ice","Arctic; Atmosphere; Model evaluation/performance; Reanalysis data; Sea ice; Ship observations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063970894"

Red tide not only endangers marine fisheries and aquaculture, deteriorates the marine environment, affects coastal tourist industry, but also causes human health problems. East China Sea (ECS) is a high incidence region of red tide disasters. Remote sensing is an effective means of monitoring red tides. In this paper, the high-incidence area of the red tide in the East China Sea is selected as the study area, MERIS L2 data is used as the data source to analyze and compare the normalized water radiation (nlw) spectral difference between the red tide water body and the non-red tide water body in the red tide event. Based on the spectral difference, this paper develops nlw560/nlw490>1.25 and nlw681-nlw665>0 algorithm to extract the red tide information of ECS. Applying the algorithm to ECS, the results show that the developed model can effectively determine the location of the red tide and correspond well with the results of the official bulletin.

Satellite remote sensing is the main approach to study the impact of typhoon on the sea surface temperature(SST) and the ocean color environment at present. The Taiwan Strait plays an important role in water and sediment exchange between the East China Sea and the South China Sea. This paper uses the data of the MODIS satellites to analyses the effects of Haitang(2005) on the SST, sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration(Chl-a) and total suspended matter(TSM) in the Taiwan Strait over different periods. During the typhoon-active period, the concentration of TSM significantly increased. The SST for the typhoon-active period was lower than that both the pre- and post- the typhoon periods. During the typhoon, Chl-a concentration increased. After the typhoon, the Chl-a concentration decreased, but still higher than before the typhoon. The Chl-a concentration near the Minjiang Estuary during the typhoon was slightly lower than that before the typhoon and after the typhoon. During the typhoon, the strong cyclonic wind-stress of the typhoon enhanced heat exchange between the water and the atmosphere, and a large amount of rainfall and run-off significantly decreased the SST. During the typhoon, the increased sediment discharged into the strait by rivers, and the re-suspension of seafloor sediment, increased the concentration of TSM in the coastal waters. Seawater with relatively high sediment concentration was transported to the middle of the strait after being carried by wind-induced flows. During the typhoon, in the waters near the typhoon's path, Chl-a concentration increased. After the typhoon, Chl-a concentration near the Minjiang estuary dramatically increased than before the typhoon. Nutrient-rich bottom water stirred by the typhoon promoted an outbreak of aquatic organisms. The increase of Chl-a concentration has a certain delay because the growth of organisms takes time. © 2019 SPIE.","Aquatic organisms; Atmospheric temperature; Chlorophyll; Hurricanes; Hydrophilicity; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Suspended sediments; Suspensions (fluids); Topography; Air-sea interaction process; Biogeochemical process; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Particle transport and depositions; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sediment concentration; Total suspended matter; Oceanography","Chlorophyll-a concentration; Remote sensing; Sea surface temperature; Total suspended matter; Typhoon Haitang","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077792631"

While satellite imagery can provide high spatial resolution, it is temporally sparse and significant ice deformation can occur between observations. This makes it difficult to apply feature tracking or image correlation techniques that require persistent features to exist between images. With this in mind, we propose a technique based on optimal transport, which is commonly used to measure differences between probability distributions. When little ice enters or leaves the image scene, we show that regularized optimal transport can be used to quantitatively estimate ice deformation. We discuss the motivation for our approach and describe efficient computational implementations.

Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data from 2000 to 2015, six turbidity patterns were identified by using the self-organizing map clustering method: high turbidity pattern, moderate turbidity pattern, low turbidity pattern, very low turbidity pattern, extreme high turbidity pattern and sea ice pattern, and the first four patterns appear every year. All patterns have significant seasonal characteristics, and monthly turbidity is dominated by one of these turbidity patterns. The water turbidity in the estuary has decreased in the past 16 years, and the interannual variation of the turbidity pattern is the result of the combination of the sediment transported into the sea by the Yellow River and the wind and waves on the sea surface. ©2019.

The Aquarius measurements may be influenced by marine environmental factors. The result is the inconsistency of data quality under different conditions. Although the data qualities have been considered in some previous studies, they have only been used for data screening. Base on this, a quality weighting method is proposed in this paper. The key differences between our method and traditional method, is way of weighting the data. In the present paper, both distance and data quality are considered in the weighting process. After the weight is determined, the weighted average fitting (WAF) method is used to calculate the grid SSS value. Then weekly 0.25°×0.25°gridded SSS fields between 40°S and 40°N are generated, covering the period from September 2011 through May 2015. The error statistics are calculated and the result shows that the root-mean squared difference (RMSD) is about 0.18 psu, which can improve the accuracy by about 31%.

It provides a new technology and way to observe the salinity over large region from space. However, it is still difficult to get the sea surface salinity of the coastal waters due to that the effect on satellite-observed microwave radiance of radio frequency interference over near-shore regions. Fortunately, the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has conservative or semi-conservative property in the freshwater areas of coastal rivers and it has a good linear correlation between the absorption coefficient of CDOM and salinity. Based on those, a conservative mixing relationship between the fresh water from the Pearl River and the sea water from the South China Sea are established and the distribution of sea surface salinity from MODIS-retrieved absorption coefficient of CDOM (aCDOM) at 355nm wavelength in this study. The linear relationship between salinity and aCDOM at 355 nm under conservative mixing conditions can be established from the in-situ observed salinity and MODIS-retrieved aCDOM at 355 nm at the central water mass in the Pearl River Estuary and the northern basin region of South China Sea. By comparing daily observed MODIS-retrieved sea surface salinity with the in-site observed salinity, it shows that the salinity retrieved from satellite-based aCDOM has good agreement with observations, and it can better capture the location of low salinity fresh water in the Pearl River. For the summer averaged satellite-based salinity from 2002 to 2018, sea surface salinity are gradually increases from the vertical coastline to the sea in the Pearl River Estuary region. The salinity in coastal region is low by the effect of the Pearl River diluted water, and the salinity in offshore region is high. On average, the distribution of salinity shows that the diffusion of fresh water from the Pearl River generally spread along the coastline to the east and west in summer, while the runoff on the westward is larger and on the eastward it is affected by some flushing water of other rivers. In the future, MODIS-retrieved salinity can be as a supplement to salinity inversion of Microwave radiometer in the coastal region. © 2019 SPIE.","Biogeochemistry; Coastal zones; Estuaries; Gems; Hydrophilicity; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Mixing; Offshore oil well production; Organic compounds; Radio interference; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellites; Sea ice; Seawater; Space optics; Absorption co-efficient; Colored dissolved organic matter; Linear relationships; Microwave radiometers; MODIS; Pearl River estuary; Radio frequency interference; Salinity; Water absorption","Colored dissolved organic matter; MODIS; Pearl River Estuary; Salinity","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077786770"

In recent years, the Arctic has undergone major changes, including an increase in temperature, a decrease in the extent and thickness of sea ice, and the reasons for these changes have yet to be further studied. In the Arctic, aerosol is an important factor that causes the temperature and environmental change. The lack of ground-based observation data in the Arctic makes satellite remote sensing an effective means for aerosol monitoring. We first selected the C61 version of the MODIS Level2 10 KM aerosol product from 2000 to 2018 as the Arctic's aerosol monitoring data. Then the products Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was evaluated by 20 ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites in the Arctic. Based on the data with high quality control, the monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic were analyzed. Results show that: 1. MODIS AOD is overestimated in the Arctic and requires quality control to obtain more reliable results; 2. The monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic region does not exceed 0.3 with maximum 0.25 and minimum 0.027, and the average monthly AOD value of 18 years is 0.111.

Arctic sea level determination is challenging due to the seasonal to permanent sea-ice cover, lack of regional coverage of satellites, satellite instruments ability to measure ice, insufficient geophysical models, residual orbit errors, challenging retracking of satellite altimeter data. We present the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Technical University of Denmark (DTU)/Technischen Universität München (TUM) sea level anomaly (SLA) record based on radar satellite altimetry data in the Arctic Ocean from the European Remote Sensing satellite number 1 (ERS-1) (1991) to CryoSat-2 (2018). We use updated geophysical corrections and a combination of altimeter data: Reprocessing of Altimeter Product for ERS (REAPER) (ERS-1), ALES+ retracker (ERS-2, Envisat), combination of Radar Altimetry Database System (RADS) and DTUs in-house retracker LARS (CryoSat-2). Furthermore, this study focuses on the transition between conventional and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) altimeter data to make a smooth time series regarding the measurement method. We find a sea level rise of 1.54 mm/year from September 1991 to September 2018 with a 95% confidence interval from 1.16 to 1.81 mm/year. ERS-1 data is troublesome and when ignoring this satellite the SLA trend becomes 2.22 mm/year with a 95% confidence interval within 1.67-2.54 mm/year. Evaluating the SLA trends in 5 year intervals show a clear steepening of the SLA trend around 2004. The sea level anomaly record is validated against tide gauges and show good results.

To be specific, the feature was selected as the mean value along the delay-axis (128 in length) at each Doppler bin (20 in all).

In practice, this trained SVMs-FS algorithm showed improved accuracy but less data storage demands than the existing neural networks (NNs)- A nd convolutional neural networks-based methods.

This water area in the period of intense chromaticity of cyanobacteria is distinguished by their completely heterogeneous spatial-temporal distribution with scales of patchiness from several tens of meters and high temporal variability. For this reason, direct methods of ""spot"" measurements in place on water samples in a small part of the reservoir for 3 hours relative to the satellite's span do not provide us with reliable and statistically proved data. In this regard, the work proposed an original method of high-performance sub-satellite synchronous measurements of the brightness of the water column, concentrations of Chl-a and TSM with a fluorescent lidar onboard a high-speed vessel. This technique is provided with a spatial (8 m) and a temporary (1 s) resolution. Based on this, 4 independent regional models for the recovery of Chl-a concentrations, as well as TSM were developed based on in-situ measurements of the brightness of the water surface, or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images. To ensure the possibility of using satellite images, the analysis of atmospheric correction algorithms was performed and the best one was determined. The proposed models can be used for regular environmental monitoring of the Gorky Reservoir according to the in-situ ship measurements of the brightness of the water surface or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images.

Because Arctic sea ice prone regions are a significant challenge for charting Arctic routes, state-of-the–art remote sensing datasets can provide an accurate and reliable approach to monitoring near real-time large-scale variability of Arctic sea ice conditions. Large-sized datasets of weather/climate modeling can provide a short-term forecast and long-term prediction on changes of Arctic sea ice and related weather/climate conditions, which are indispensable for the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation. Based on these big data, the authors established the near real-time dynamic optimal trans-Arctic route system to guarantee safe, secure, and efficient trans-Arctic navigation.

As of today, countless research projects aimed at both modelling and mapping past, actual and future sea ice conditions were completed using sea ice numerical models, statistical models, educated guesses or remote sensing imagery. From this research, reliable information helping to understand sea ice evolution in space and in time is available to stakeholders. However, no research has, until present, assessed the evolution of sea ice cover with a frequency modelling approach, by identifying the underlying theoretical distribution describing the sea ice behaviour at a given point in space and time. This project suggests the development of a probabilistic tool, named IcePAC, based on frequency modelling of historical 1978-2015 passive microwave sea ice concentrations maps from the EUMETSAT OSI-409 product, to study the sea ice spatiooral behaviour in the waters of the Hudson Bay system in northeast Canada. Grid-cell-scale models are based on the generalized beta distribution and generated at a weekly temporal resolution. Results showed coherence with the Canadian Ice Service 1981-2010 Sea Ice Climatic Atlas average freeze-up and melt-out dates for numerous coastal communities in the study area and showed that it is possible to evaluate a range of plausible events, such as the shortest and longest probable ice-free season duration, for any given location in the simulation domain. Results obtained in this project pave the way towards various analyses on sea ice concentration spatiooral distribution patterns that would gain in terms of information content and value by relying on the kind of probabilistic information and simulation data available from the IcePAC tool. © 2019 Author(s).","Canada; Hudson Bay; coastal zone management; detection method; ice cover; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatiotemporal analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061327401"

Within such a large-scale system, the physical processes in the Bering Sea carry interannual variability. The special topography in the Bering Sea traps a strong jet along the Bering Slope, whose instability enriches the eddy activity in the region. A Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS), coupled with a sea ice module, is employed to study multiple-scale variability in the sea ice and oceanic circulation in the Bering Sea for interannual, seasonal, and intra-seasonal eddy variations. The model domain covers the whole Bering Sea and a part of the Chukchi Sea and south of Aleutian Islands, with an averaged spatial resolution of 5 km. The external forcings are momentum, heat, and freshwater flux at the surface and adaptive nudging to reanalysis fields at the boundaries. The oceanic model starts in an equilibrium state from a multiple year cyclical climatology run, and then it is integrated from years 1990 through 2004. The 15 year simulation is analyzed and assessed against the observational data. The model accurately reproduces the seasonal and interannual variations in the sea ice coverage compared with the satellite-observed sea ice data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). Sea surface temperature and eddy kinetic energy patterns from the ROMS agree with satellite remote sensing data. The transportation through the Bering Strait is also comparable with the estimate of mooring data. The mechanism for seasonal and interannual variation in the Bering Sea is connected to the Siberia-Aleutian index. Eddy variation along the Bering Slope is discussed. The model also simulates polynya generation and evolution around the St. Lawrence Island. © 2019 by the authors.","Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Large scale systems; Oceanography; ROM; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface waters; Topography; Bering sea; Interannual variability; Oceanic circulations; Regional oceanic modeling systems; Satellite data; Satellite remote sensing data; Sea surface temperature (SST); Seasonal and interannual variations; Remote sensing","Bering Sea; ROMS; Satellite data; Sea ice; Seasonal and interannual variations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068103403"

Microwave radiometer sea ice concentration datasets are also utilized to illustrate the intimate link between oceanic cumuliform snowfall production and decreased sea ice coverage. Three metrics are calculated to illustrate seasonal cumuliform snowfall signatures: (a) cumuliform snowfall frequency of occurrence, (b) mean cumuliform snowfall rate, and (c) fraction of snowfall attributed to cumuliform snowfall events. Distinct seasonal cumuliform snowfall cycles are observed over the Northern Hemispheric oceans. Cumuliform snowfall frequency of occurrence (mean snowfall rate) peaks in months SON (DJF) at most latitudes. Maximum mean cumuliform snowfall rates exceed 300 mm/year in various North Atlantic Ocean locations, with DJF exhibiting the largest areal extent of higher snowfall rates. Cumuliform snow occurrence fraction frequently exceeds 0.5, but regional seasonal sensitivity is observed where transient sea ice coverage exists. Annual snowfall rate fraction attributed to cumuliform snow does not vary appreciably during SON, DJF and MAM north of ∼70°N, but seasonal zonal variability is evident south of this latitudinal threshold. Land cumuliform snowfall features do not universally display strong seasonal signals. Southern Hemisphere seasonal results indicate a strong mean cumuliform snowfall rate maximum (minimum) in JJA (DJF) accompanied by a seasonal latitudinal shift in the snowfall rate peak. Maximum regional snowfall rates exceed 300 mm/year over a broader area compared to the Northern Hemisphere. Cumuliform snowfall production is again strongly linked to seasonal sea ice coverage. Southern Hemispheric cumuliform snowfall occurrence and snowfall rate fraction seasonality is not as obvious as in the Northern Hemisphere, but some latitudinal zones experience ∼5–20% seasonal variability in these quantities. Typical cumuliform snowfall fractions range from 0.4 to 0.6 in the prominent cumuliform snowfall belt covering most of the Southern Ocean. Some subtle seasonal cumuliform snowfall signatures are observed over Antarctica. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Classification (of information); Clouds; Microwave devices; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Cloud classification; CloudSat; Microwave radiometers; North Atlantic Ocean; Northern Hemispheres; Sea ice concentration; Seasonal snowfall variability; Seasonal variability; cloud microphysics; CloudSat; convective system; cumulus; marine atmosphere; Northern Hemisphere; remote sensing; sea ice; seasonal variation; snow; Southern Hemisphere; Snow","CloudSat; convective snowfall; cumuliform snowfall; sea ice; seasonal snowfall variability; snow; snowfall remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041023603"

There is a rising demand for Arctic sea ice prediction at daily to seasonal time scales, which is partly a sea ice initial condition problem. Thus, a multivariate data assimilation that integrates sea ice observations to generate realistic and skillful model initialization is needed to improve predictive skill of Arctic sea ice. Sea ice data assimilation is a relatively new research area. In this review paper, we focus on two challenges for implementing multivariate data assimilation systems for sea ice forecast. First, to address the challenge of limited spatiotemporal coverage and large uncertainties of observations, we discuss sea ice parameters derived from satellite remote sensing that (1) have been utilized for improved model initialization, including concentration, thickness and drift, and (2) are currently under development with the potential for enhancing the predictability of Arctic sea ice, including melt ponds and sea ice leads. Second, to strive to generate the “best” estimate of sea ice initial conditions by combining model simulations/forecasts and observations, we review capabilities and limitations of different data assimilation techniques that have been developed and used to assimilate observed sea ice parameters in dynamical models. © 2018 Science China Press","Forecasting; Remote sensing; Arctic sea ice; Data assimilation; Data assimilation techniques; Dynamical model; Initial conditions; Model initialization; Multivariate data; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice","Arctic sea ice prediction; Data assimilation; Remote sensing","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058053933"

In this case, the damping is determined by the elasticity of the film and the surface tension coefficient. The parameter of elasticity itself was introduced for a monomolecular film. The elasticity is determined by dependence of the surface tension on surfactant concentration. Therefore, the usage of this parameter when describing an oil film of nonzero thickness is generally not indisputable. In this paper, we justified the capability of the usage of a phenomenologically introduced parameter - elasticity for quantitative description of the wave damping due to oil films in the wide range of oil film thickness. It is shown that the value of the elasticity dramatically affects dependences of wave characteristics on film thickness. The analysis is based on comparison between results of our laboratory measurements and numerical calculations carried out in the framework of a model of two viscous layer fluids with elastic interface. © 2019 SPIE.","Damping; Elasticity; Film thickness; Hydrophilicity; Lubricating oils; Sea ice; Surface tension; Surface waves; Finite thickness; Gravity capillary waves; Laboratory measurements; Numerical calculation; Phenomenological modeling; Quantitative description; Surface tension coefficient; Surfactant concentrations; Remote sensing","Elasticity; Oil films of finite thickness on the water surface; Phenomenological model of surface wave damping","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077797759"

Among the low altitude remote sensing platforms, helicopters usually carried onboard icebreakers for scientific research activities and logistics have been recognized as a reliable remote sensing platform from enhanced endurance and verified stability, and have flexibility for the attachment of multiple sensors. Although areal reference datasets, e.g., helicopter-borne high-resolution images, can be used to validate lower resolution sea ice information from the characteristics of enough coverage and fine spatial resolution, continuous drift of sea ice causes distorted locations of image acquisition along the drift; thus, becomes an obstacle for precise image mosaicking and matching with the sea ice information extracted from lower-resolution remote sensing imagery. This study presents methods for the cost-effective acquisition of helicopterborne high-resolution images over drifting Arctic sea ice using a simple configuration of imaging sensor and GPS logger, and for the compensation of the effect from sea ice drift from each imaging location using the drift trajectory of sea ice. After mosaicking the sea ice drift compensated high-resolution helicopter-borne images with structure-from-motion technique, the applicability of the mosaicked image was assessed by comparing with lower resolution satellite synthetic aperture radar image. The results suggest that the proposed methods can be applicable to the high-resolution images from other low altitude remote sensing platforms, e.g., UAVs, and can be used for precise comparison with various sea ice products from satellite remote sensing. © 2019 SPIE.","Antennas; Arctic vehicles; Cost effectiveness; Helicopters; Hydrophilicity; Image acquisition; Ocean currents; Sea ice; Ship instruments; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); High resolution image; Remote sensing imagery; Remote sensing platforms; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite synthetic aperture radar images; Scientific researches; Structure from motion; Very high resolution; Remote sensing","Helicopter-borne imaging; Sea ice; Structure-from-motion; Very high-resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077788360"

SKIM will also make unprecedented direct measurements of strong currents, from boundary currents to the Antarctic circumpolar current, and their interaction with ocean waves with expected impacts on air-sea fluxes and extreme waves. For the first time, SKIM will directly measure the ocean surface current vector from space. The main instrument on SKIM is a Ka-band conically scanning, multi-beam Doppler radar altimeter/wave scatterometer that includes a state-of-the-art nadir beam comparable to the Poseidon-4 instrument on Sentinel 6. The well proven Doppler pulse-pair technique will give a surface drift velocity representative of the top two meters of the ocean, after subtracting a large wave-induced contribution.

GNSS-R is a new Earth remote sensing technology, and it has been a research focus in recent years. Delay-Doppler Mapping (DDM) is a significant GNSS-R observation for retrieving geophysical parameters. The reliability of GNSS-R DDM simulation results directly affects GNSS-R theoretical research and satellite mission engineering parametric design. In this thesis, the effects of delay and Doppler intervals on a simulated DDM is investigated, and the suitable parameters for both intervals is determined to generate a reliable DDM simulation result. GREEPS, which was a GNSS-R simulator based on Z-V models and was developed by the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is currently used to simulate DDM waveforms with different delay and Doppler intervals. To evaluate the accuracy of the simulated DDM waveforms, the 1D delay mapping with 0 Hz Doppler and the peak's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and position of the simulated DDM are compared with theoretical ones. The results shows that the smaller the delay and Doppler intervals are, the higher the correlation coefficient of the simulated DDM waveform and the theoretical waveform will be. When the delay interval is less than 1/16 GPS L1 C/A code chips, the correlation coefficient of the simulated DDM waveform and the theoretical waveform is greater than 0.99. The relative deviation of the peak SNR of the simulated DDM waveform is approximately 0.1% when the delay interval is set to be 1/16 GPS L1 C/A code chips. However, the relative deviation of the peak position of the simulated DDM waveform is extremely high. Even if the delay interval is set to be 1/64 GPS L1 C/A code chips, the relative deviation of the peak position of the simulated DDM is just 2.3%. When the Doppler interval is less than 200 Hz, the correlation coefficient of the simulated DDM waveform and the theoretical waveform is close to 1. When the Doppler interval is less than 50 Hz, the relative deviation of the peak SNR and the peak position is less than 0.1%. It is can be concluded that the smaller the delay and Doppler intervals are, the higher the coincidence degree of the simulated DDM and the theoretical DDM will be. When the delay interval and the Doppler interval are set to be 1/16 GPS L1 C/A code chips and 50 Hz, respectively, the simulated waveforms and the theoretical waveforms highly coincide with one another. The correlation coefficient is more than 0.99, and the relative deviation of the peak SNR of DDM is less than 0.1%. The effect of the delay interval on the peak's position of DDM is greater than that of the Doppler interval. The relative deviation of the position of the peak SNR is greater than 2% even if the delay interval is set to 1/64 GPS L1 C/A code chips. © 2019, Science Press.

Unlike the single-polarized wave mode SARs in Europe, GF-3 is the first satellite acquiring the quad-polarized SAR data in wave mode configuration, which could benefit the ocean wave estimation. Here, the ocean wave spectra estimation from quad-polarized GF-3 wave mode is presented and its performances are evaluated. For the period from January to October in 2017, the ocean wave spectra were inverted from GF-3 wave mode data. The quad-polarized SAR-ocean spectra inversion scheme was utilized, in which the azimuthal and range wave slopes are obtained from the vertically and linearly polarized normalized radar cross sections and then converted to ocean wave slope spectra. The validation was also performed through comparisons against directional wave buoy observations. The spatio-temporal criteria of 100 km and 0.5 h, yield 87 matchups. Two representative cases illustrate the consistency between the GF-3 SAR ocean wave spectra and buoy measurements. Statistical assessment shows the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 m, 19.52 m and 24.89° for the significant wave height, peak wavelength and wave direction, respectively.

To gain insight on the microscopic behavior of the individual oil constituents and their potential for partitioning within sea ice, an oil-in-ice mesocosm experiment was performed in a temperature controlled cold room located at the Centre for Earth Observation Science. Throughout the experiment, corn oil was used as a surrogate for medium crude oil, to assess the microscopic oil movement tendencies in sea ice at ambient conditions of -20, -15, and -10°C. The resultant impact of ice porosity and the physical properties of the oil constituents on partitioning were assessed through measurement and modeling techniques. Throughout the ice growth, the temperature profile of the ice was measured in situ by thermocouples frozen into the ice, and physical sampling of the ice and water column was performed to determine the bulk salinity profile and oil distribution within the ice. We used multidimensional gas chromatography high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry to generate a spatial and temporal mapping of the individual corn oil fatty acids in sea ice and their respective concentrations. Compact Micro-Computed Tomography x-ray analysis was used to assess the sea ice porosity in conjunction with calculated brine volumes. Computational quantum chemistry was used to calculate various physical properties of the individual oil constituents using the experimentally measured temperatures and salinities of the ice. The movement of the oil constituents were found to be driven primarily by their physical properties, the temperature of the sea ice and its thickness. Based on our findings, an assessment was made as to the implications of chemical partitioning on remote sensing detection and mitigation potential of oil in sea ice, as well as the potential for persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances entering the water column. © 2019 Proceedings - 42nd AMOP Technical Seminar on Environmental Contamination and Response.

In turn, it is subject to impacts of multiple co-acting environmental forcings responsible for spatio-temporal dynamics in E. huxleyi blooms. To reveal the individual importance of each forcing factor (FF) that is known to significantly control the extent and intensity of E. huxleyi blooms, the 1998-2016 spaceborne time series of sea surface temperature and salinity, incident photosynthetically active radiation, and the Ekman depth relevant to the North, Norwegian, Greenland, Labrador, Barents and Bering seas were employed. The descriptive statistical approach showed that E. huxleyi phytoplankton blooms were capable of arising and developing within wide but expressly sea-specific FFs ranges. Sea-specific FFs ranges, within which the blooms are particularly extensive were identified. The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) allowed to reliably rank the FFs in terms of their role in E. huxleyi bloom spatiotemporal dynamics in each target sea. High prediction ability of RFC modelling (>70%) confirms the adequacy of the developed FFs prioritization models. Although the parameters of the carbon chemistry system per se were beyond consideration, however, over the twenty years of observations, the prioritized FFs have not failed to explain the registered patterns of the spatial extent of and particulate inorganic carbon content in E. huxleyi blooms. Also, several verifications (pastcasts) showed a high degree of their consistency with the observations. Collectively, these results tell in favor of sufficiency of the FFs employed. © 2019 SPIE.","Carbon; Decision trees; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Sea ice; Surface waters; Arctic Sea; Bloom forcing factors; Descriptive statistics; E. huxleyi blooms; Long-term remote sensing observations; Prioritization; Random forest classifier; Remote sensing","Bloom forcing factors; Descriptive statistics; E. huxleyi blooms; Factors prioritization; Long-term remote sensing observations; Random Forest Classifier; Statistical models; Subarctic and Arctic seas","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077798299"

The study is based on the data obtained in the course of a satellite survey of the study region. The study region includes two areas of the heaviest oil pollution of the Black Sea surface. These are the areas of natural seepages off the Georgian coast near the town of Poti as well as the shelf area off the eastern coast of Turkey near the town of Rize. Our main result is the discovery of significant seasonal variability in the spatial distribution of natural oil films affected by local winds and surface currents prevailing in given periods. Further, we show that meso- and sub-mesoscale processes significantly affect the drift of natural oil spills. In the case of moderate winds and weak currents, the influence of these processes on the oil spills drift becomes paramount. We found that in 10-15 percent of cases, the oil film gets involved in vortical motions after its emersion on the sea surface, which often radically changes the trajectory of the slick propagation. Risks of oil surface pollution due to natural hydrocarbon showing are assessed for the test areas. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Lubricating oils; Oil spills; Pollution; Risk assessment; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Surface waters; Tracking radar; Black sea; Natural hydrocarbons; Oil pollution; Radar imagery; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surfaces; Surface films; Remote sensing","Natural hydrocarbon seeps; Oil pollution; Radar imagery; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surface; Surface films; The Black Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077802285"

Here, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) method based on nonparametric deep learning algorithms. The RNN model was implemented to predict monthly air concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at the high Arctic monitoring station Alert. To train the RNN system, we used MODIS satellite remotely sensed forest fire data, air emissions, meteorological data, sea ice cover area, and sampled PAH concentration data from 1996 to 2012. The system was applied to forecast monthly PAH concentrations from 2012 to 2014 at the Alert station. The results were compared with monitored PAHs and an atmospheric transport model (CanMETOP) for POPs. We show that the RNN significantly improved PHE and BaP predictions from 2012 to 2014 by 62.5 and 91.1%, respectively, compared to CanMETOP predictions.

The basis of the study was remote sensing data in the optical range, such as Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Terra/Aqua MODIS, as well as archival Landsat-5 TM data. Also, Sentinel-1 SAR-C and archival ERS-1/2 SAR and Envisat ASAR radar data were used. The main objectives of the study were: determination of areas occupied by ice, identification of trends in ice formation and clearing periods, their inter-annual variability. To solve the problem of determining the parameters of ice cover, we used the multisensory approach whenever possible, i.e. comprehensive integrated analysis of heterogeneous data. The analysis of a vast array of satellite data, differing in nature and spatial resolution, and ice mapping was carried out using the toolkit of the See the Sea (STS) information system developed at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI RAS). STS enables working with multi-year archival data, conduct joint analysis of different satellite data together with hydrometeorological information. It was found that during the study period, from the 1998-1999 winter to the present time, the largest area of ice cover of over 90,000 sq. km was observed in the 2011/2012 winter period. Ice was observed even in the bays of the Southern Caspian. Another direction of research, the results of which are presented, is the identification of capabilities and limitations in the use of satellite data obtained in different ranges (radar and optical) and at different polarizations. © 2019 SPIE.","Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space optics; Space research; Synthetic aperture radar; Caspian sea; Interannual variability; Ocean color; Remote sensing data; Russian Academy of Sciences; Satellite monitoring; Satellite radar; Space research institute; Space-based radar","Ocean Color Data; Satellite radar observation; Sea ice; The Caspian Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077786983"

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, compact polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact po-larimteric acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification in operational environment. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification.

It has made a great negative impact on the marine ecosystem, aquaculture, and coastal tourism. Fortunately, satellite observation can monitor and track the growth of large algae such as Sargassum in a timely and effective manner, providing scientific basis for disaster prevention and mitigation in fisheries and environmental protection departments. Most of traditional extraction methods of macroalgae are pixel-oriented. Although these methods can be performed easily, they loss the rich texture information of the natural objects. The Sargassum seen from remote sensing imageries tends to aggregate in groups, like strips, covering several to dozens of pixels. Therefore, this paper considered distinguishing Sargassum from a certain area based on scene by utilizing contextual relationships among pixels and the diversity of spatial and structural features. In this paper, the image acquired by GF-1 during the golden tide disaster in the sea area near Jiangsu Province of China on December 31, 2016 were used. We adopter an unsupervised feature learning method to distinguish Sargassum. The Voting method was used to divide the original image into small image blocks guided by the corresponding saliency image. After 0-meanization and ZCA whitening, the initial weights were obtained by training the sparse autoencoder, then these weights were convolved as the convolution kernel to obtain the local features of the image, the features convoluted were passed. We pooled them to reduce the eigenvectors of the convolutional layer output so that the global statistical features of the image could be extracted. Finally, the Softmax classifier was used to distinguish the regions of Sargassum in the original image. The experimental accuracy was 77.79% and superior to the threshold extraction methods compared with the result of manual labeling. © 2019 SPIE.","Convolution; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecosystems; Extraction; Hydrophilicity; Machine learning; Pixels; Sea ice; Textures; Contextual relationships; Disaster prevention and mitigations; Environmental protection departments; GF-1; Remote sensing imagery; Sargassum; Satellite observations; Unsupervised feature learning; Remote sensing","GF-1; Sargassum; Unsupervised feature learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077789217"

First, local binary pattern(LBP) features are extracted from selected spectral bands. PCA bagging is employed to generating hashing codes of the extracted features. Then, a piece of short but strong code is obtained to represent the features of each pixel. Finally, these hashing codes are fed into the extreme learning machine for classification.

Detection and tracking of large icebergs using space-borne scatterometers, altimeters and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems have seen a large amount of work in the last decades. However, the identification of small icebergs is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this work, a recently proposed iceberg detector the intensity Dual-Pol Ratio Anomaly Detector (iDPolRAD) is tested using ALOS-2 L-band data. The detector is designed for dual-polarized incoherent SAR images, however in this work we want to investigate the loss of performance with respect to using coherent data. Therefore different versions of the iDPolRAD requiring quad-pol data are proposed here and tested. The ALOS-2 data were acquired on the East Coast of Greenland, where a large number of icebergs are visible in the images. The results show that different polarisations could bring different information and therefore the availability of dual-pol could improve the detection although a quad-pol algorithm will not be operational at the moment due to the limited size of the swath. © 2018 IEEE.","Geology; Meteorological instruments; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; ALOS-2; Anomaly detector; Coherent data; Detection and tracking; Dual-polarized; Large amounts; Loss of performance; Scatterometers; Sea ice","ALOS-2; Iceberg detection; Polarimetry; SAR","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064148683"

However, overlay of signals from different ice type largely reduces the overall accuracy from supervised classification of RadarSat-2 image.

In the viewpoints of its safety and robustness of the installed system, LED pulse beam was selected as the lidar light source. Its shallow angle observation visualizes the sea wave motion from just a front of the ship to 300m ahead. At the coast experiment, two types of LED mini lidars were used for polarization measurement and Raman scattering measurement. They were almost the same optical characteristics except for their LED wavelength, that is, 365nm for polarization lidar and 365nm for Raman lidar. To visualize the sea wave dynamics, the summation time was shortened to 0.2s. The shallow angle (depression angle) of the lidar observation was set in 2 - 10 degrees against the horizontal direction. The fundamental information of sea wave, which were wave speed, height, period and wavelength, was deduced from the lidar echo. The polarization echo measurement revealed its dependency due to the LED beam incident angle against the sea surface. The Raman echo measurement visualized the correlation between the surface atmosphere activity and the sea wave dynamics. The surface atmosphere activity on water vapor Raman echo related to the sea wave motion from the fluorescent backscattered light of sea water, while it had its original change. These results are valid for safe cruise of small boat. This additional sea wave activity information will be effective for low fuel consumption operation and the automatic control in safety cruise.

On average, it covers up to ~ 15% of the world’s oceans for at least some of the year, with strong and opposing seasonal variability in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Passive microwave observations from satellite-borne sensors have provided information on sea ice cover since the early 1970s and have produced a consistent and near-complete climate record of sea ice concentration and extent since October 1979. Passive microwave sensors are optimal for sea ice because the microwave emission they detect is sensitive to the phase state of water (liquid vs. frozen). Also, the emission is independent of sunlight, which allows continuous coverage through the long polar winter nights. Atmospheric emission (clouds, water vapor, aerosols) is also generally low over sea ice, enabling the surface emission to be clearly detected by the orbiting sensors. Finally, the sensor swath width and sun-synchronous polar orbits yield near-complete daily coverage of all sea ice covered regions. The long-term record from passive microwave data indicates a significant downward trend in Arctic sea ice cover, while the Antarctic time series is more complex and is dominated by strong interannual variability. Other geophysical parameters can also be derived, including temperature, motion, snow depth, and melt/freeze. New passive microwave sensors are also now providing thickness estimates of newly-formed sea ice. The record from passive microwave sensors show a dramatically changing Arctic with large decreases in extent and age, faster ice motion, earlier melt and later freeze-up. The Antarctic is more variable over the satellite record, with small positive trends in extent. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","","Antarctic; Arctic; Climate change; Passive microwave sensing; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice extent; Sea ice thickness","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079082824"

Other factors such as wind and physical characteristics of films can significantly influence the dynamics of slick structures. A perspective approach aimed at measuring surface currents is developed. Based on the approach an impact of wind on the kinematics of artificial slick bands is determined. Simulation of slick band propagation from the localized source of surfactant in the field of wind and eddy-shape current is performed. As a result of simulation the shape of surface slick structure, which is close to the observed on SAR image of water surface, is obtained. It is shown that the possibility of spiral bands formation due to presence of marine submesoscale eddies is determined by near-surface wind. Moreover, it is declared that a traditional estimation of scales of marine eddies based on the scales of spiral slick structures is not basically correct. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Kinematics; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Surface active agents; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Upper atmosphere; Artificial slick bands; Biological process; Near-surface winds; Perspective approach; Physical characteristics; Simulation; Sub-mesoscale eddies; Surface current; Remote sensing","Artificial slick bands; Remote sensing; Simulation; Surface current","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077799756"

Geographically, most of the waves were observed over shelf and shelf break regions (94%), while only 6% of them were found over depths exceeding 200 m. In the Chukchi Sea, the waves were frequently observed in the northern part of the sea centered at about 72.6° N, 168° W, in its southwestern part, around Herald Shoal, near the Barrow Canyon, and in the Bering Strait. In the Beaufort Sea, some ISW activity was observed along the shelf break and north of Cape Bathurst, while a major hot spot of ISW generation was found on the Mackenzie Shelf.

Analysis of literature reveals the necessity of setting a reliable experiment to study the effect of damping of GCW due to turbulence. Available laboratory studies are based on significantly different experimental methods with some disadvantages which have caused a large scatter of experimental data. The previously proposed method, which is based on the simultaneous independent generation of surface waves and turbulence in a wave tank, is free from inherent disadvantages of previously used methods. The method is used to conduct a series of experiments in order to measure the dependence of the damping coefficient of GCW on their frequency at different intensities of turbulence in a wide frequency range. Due to the proposed technique the range of surface wavelengths is extended in order to investigate the case when the surface wavelength is comparable to the scale of turbulence. It is shown that the frequency dependence of the eddy viscosity coefficient is characterized by the presence of a maximum for both turbulent regimes. The maximum value of eddy viscosity coefficient is proportional to the velocity of turbulent pulsations. The results are discussed in application to radar imaging of turbulent ship wake. © 2019 SPIE.","Damping; Gravity waves; Hydrophilicity; Sea ice; Ships; Surface waves; Turbulence; Viscosity; Wakes; Water waves; Damping coefficients; Eddy viscosity; Eddy viscosity coefficients; Experimental methods; Frequency dependence; Gravity capillary waves; Ocean remote sensing; Wide frequency range; Remote sensing","Eddy viscosity; Gravity-capillary waves; Surface waves; Turbulence","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077791343"

The data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR-only optimum interpolation analysis) were used to assimilate SST. The modelled ice parameters including concentration, ice thickness, freeboard and keel depth were compared with parameters estimated from remote-sensing data.

Sediment traps deployed in Fram Strait within the framework of the Arctic long-term observatory FRAM provide a time-series of vertical particle fluxes in a region of high CO2 uptake. Until now the source area (catchment area) of trapped particles is unclear; however, lateral advection of particles is supposed to play an important role. This study presents a Lagrangian method to backtrack the origin of particles for two Fram Strait moorings equipped with sediment traps in 200 and 2,300 m depth by using the time-dependent velocity field of a high-resolution, eddy-resolving ocean-sea ice model. Our study shows that the extent of the catchment area is larger the deeper the trap and the slower the settling velocity. Chlorophyll-a concentration as well as sea ice coverage of the catchment area are highest in the summer months. The high sea ice coverage in summer compared to winter can possibly be related to a weaker across-strait sea level pressure difference, which allows more sea ice to enter the then well-stratified central Fram Strait where the moorings are located. Furthermore, a backward sea ice tracking approach shows that the origin and age of sea ice drifting through Fram Strait, partly responsible for vertical particle fluxes, varies strongly from year to year, pointing to a high variability in the composition of particles trapped in the moorings. © 2018 Wekerle, Krumpen, Dinter, von Appen, Iversen and Salter.","","Catchment area; Fram strait; Lagrangian modeling; Particle trajectories; Sediment trap","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056082699"

To improve sea ice extraction precision, this study combined measured spectra with high-resolution satellite data. In attempting to provide corrected baseline data for large-scale sea ice monitoring by medium-/low-resolution satellites, equivalent reflectivity conversions were performed between spectral data and GF2 satellite data, Euclidean distances based on 16 identification indices were calculated to construct a sea ice extraction model, and rapid sea ice extraction by GF2 was investigated. Spectral curve analysis showed the B2 and B4 bands of the GF2 satellite are most sensitive for monitoring sea ice. Euclidean distance calculations indicated the Euclidean distance of the B2/B4 index was largest among the 16 indices investigated, and that the separability of sea ice and snow, ice/water mixture, and seawater was greatest, thereby providing the optimal sea ice index. Based on the threshold method, information on sea ice distribution could be extracted quickly and the separation of sea ice from other objects of similar appearance could be realized. Comparison of the B2/B4 index with two other methods commonly used for sea ice identification revealed the overall performance of the B2/B4 index was better, and in a seawater/sea ice dual-accuracy classification, the B2/B4 index was slightly better. In a classification of various similar objects, the overall classification accuracy of the B2/B4 index was 96.48% and the Kappa coefficient was>0.5, i.e., higher than for the other indicators by 3.89%~4.85%. © 2018, The Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Sensors and Actuators.

The VHR images are generally acquired lower altitude than cloud height, therefore, the images can be acquired even in unfavourable weather conditions for optical satellite image acquisition, and can be applied to comparison with various kinds of remote sensing datasets. However, producing mosaicked image using the VHR images have suffered from drift of sea ice. The sea ice drift interrupts simultaneous geotagging in overall study area as geographic locations of sea ice moves continuously; therefore, the mosaicked image generated from improperly geotagged individual image depicts a scene of ambiguous time. In this study, we present a case study of VHR sea ice image acquisition using a helicopter equipped with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) geotagging and imaging sensors with a support of IBRV Araon in East Siberian Sea, Arctic Ocean.

Ice flow speeds at PRG increased by up to 15% from 2005 to 2015, with substantial interannual fluctuations. The ice velocities also showed seasonal variations, accelerating by up to 9% between September and January. Multiple mechanisms contribute to the observed seasonal variations: the initial acceleration may result from the lost back-stress provided by the sea ice in the austral spring and the later speedup relate to the surface meltwater that leads to weakened ice shelf and shear margins. The sensitivity of the PRG to oceanic forcing is confirmed by comparing the secular ice velocity increases with ocean temperatures.

In this study, two fieldwork-based methods are proposed, one for the practical acquisition of VHR images over drifting Arctic sea ice using low-cost commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors equipped on a helicopter, and the other for quantifying the compensating effect from continuously drifting sea ice that reduces geolocation uncertainty in the image mosaicking procedure. The drifting trajectory of the target ice was yielded from that recorded by an icebreaker that was tightly anchored to the floe and was then used to reversely compensate the locations of acquired VHR images. After applying the compensation, three-dimensional geolocation errors of the VHR images were decreased by 79.3% and 24.2% for two pre-defined image groups, respectively. The enhanced accuracy of the imaging locations was affected by imaging duration causing variable drifting distances of individual images. Further applicability of the mosaicked VHR image was discussed by comparing it with a TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar image containing the target ice, suggesting that the proposed methods can be used for precise comparison with satellite remote sensing products. © 2019 by the authors.

Our understanding of these processes, is usually limited to the short summer season. Here, we present the results of a one-year-long monitoring of the spatial variability in SPM characteristics in a context of oceanographic and meteorological conditions of a glacial bay next to Hansbreen, a tidewater glacier in Hornsund (southern Spitsbergen). The observed range of SPM concentrations was similar to ranges measured in other sub-polar glaciated fjords, especially in Svalbard. The major source of SPM is the meltwater discharge from the glacier. The maximum water column-averaged SPM concentrations did not correlate with peaks in freshwater discharge and were observed at the beginning of the autumn season, when the fjord water transitioned from stratified to fully mixed. The observed spatiotemporal variations in the total SPM, particulate organic matter (POM) and particulate inorganic matter (PIM) are likely controlled by a combination of factors including freshwater supply, water stratification and circulation, bathymetry, the presence of sea ice, biological productivity and sediment resuspension. During the ablation season, the SPM maximum concentrations were located within the upper water layer, whereas during the winter and spring, the greatest amounts of SPM were concentrated in deeper part. Thus, typical remote sensing-based studies that focus on SPM distributions may not reflect the real SPM levels. POM and PIM concentrations were correlated with each other, during most of the time suggesting that they may have a common source. © 2018 Institute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences","Arctic; Hansbreen; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; chemical composition; concentration (composition); fjord; particulate organic matter; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; suspended particulate matter; tidewater glacier; water column","Fjord; Particulate organic matter; Seasonality; Suspended particulate matter; Svalbard; Tidewater glacier","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045540506"

The results show that 1) the SST decreases when the NRCS increases, that is, the higher wind speed would cause the SST lower; and 2) the gradient of linear relationship between NRCS and SST is related to the temperature difference between air and sea, that is, the higher temperature difference could increase the release of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. © 2019 SPIE.","Atmospheric temperature; Heat transfer; Hydrophilicity; Landforms; Ocean currents; Radar cross section; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Wind; Katabatic winds; Linear relationships; Normalized radar cross section; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sea-surface temperature change; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Temperature differences; Thermal infrared; Radar imaging","Katabatic wind; Synthetic aperture radar; Thermal infrared","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077789953"

Although passive microwave data are processed automatically, it suffers from poor spatial resolution and the higher frequency channels are sensitive to weather conditions. Deep learning has demonstrated its ability to perform complex and accurate analysis of images; here, we apply deep learning to estimate ice concentration from SAR scenes. We developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts SIC from SAR, trained upon passive microwave data. The model achieves a 5.24%/7.87% error on its train and test set, respectively. To assess the real-world applicability, we performed an independent validation on 18 SAR scenes (from two distinct geographical regions), not previously seen during training or test. Comparing against human-generated ice analysis charts, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2059, competitive with passive microwave ( E-L1 = 0.1863 ) for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. For the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2653, significantly better than the passive microwave result ( E-L1 = 0.3593 ). By using novel techniques for model training, as well as training entirely upon passive microwave data, we present an accessible and robust method of developing similar systems for processing SAR.1 Our results suggest that with further postprocessing, CNNs are accurate and robust enough to be used for operational tasks.1Code available: https://github.com/clvcooke/Estimating-SIC-from-SAR-github.com/clvcooke/Estimating-SIC-from-SAR © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Gulf of Saint Lawrence; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Errors; Geographical regions; Image processing; Microwaves; Neural networks; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Canadian Arctic Archipelago; Convolutional neural network; Higher frequencies; Passive microwave data; Passive microwave sensors; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration; Spatial resolution; artificial neural network; estimation method; image processing; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite sensor; sea ice; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Microwave sensors","Image processing; neural networks; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068268973"

The analysis was carried out using Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) images from the catalogue of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and from a recent acquisition. The scene under analysis includes various elements such as sea-ice, open-sea and sections of the Ross Island coast. Over the years, the area of the EIT underwent various changes. Thus, to avoid misinterpretations caused by the temporal variations of the scene elements, it was decided to restrict the analysis to the tongue itself. The first step of the analysis defined a methodology for automatically detecting the EIT in a delimited window. This was accomplished using a Template Matching technique which samples the input image with a manual training pattern of the EIT structure. The result shows the matches of the EIT patch. In the second step, a relaxation method for pixel labelling was developed in order to compare the area of the ice tongue as it was 10 years ago and today. In the case of the Erebus Ice Tongue, the analysis shows a modest decline of the area in the last 10 years, hence a modest ice loss. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Sea level; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Template matching; Cosmo skymed; Ice loss; Italian Space Agency; Marine-terminating ice tongues; Polar environments; SAR Images; Template matching technique; Temporal variation; Remote sensing","Cosmo-SkyMed images; Ice loss; Marine-terminating ice tongues; SAR images","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077798522"

The exploitation of the ANR could shorten the navigational distances from North Asia to Northwestern Europe by 40% (about 2500 nautical miles) and reduce one-third (about 10 days) of the time required for maritime transport by the Royal Road, which can help to save lots of transport costs and bring large environmental benefits. It is very important and urgent to accurately understand the changes in the navigability of the ANR for the development of the route. However, due to the lack of high-quality observed dataset, there are very few observation-based studies. Some model-based studies cannot effectively reflect the real changes in the navigability of the ANR, due to the varying degrees of the data quality issues. In this study, we applied the daily sea ice concentration product provided by the NSIDC and the reconstructed daily SMOS sea ice thickness product into the Arctic Transportation Accessibility Model (ATAM) from the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System (AIRSS) to assess and map the daily navigation risks for open water vessels in the ANR from 2010-2017 and further analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of the Autumn navigability of the route during the eight years. Assuming the navigability of a specific ice regime is affected by the sea ice conditions and the ice-breaking ability of the vessels, the ATAM model can quantify the navigability of a specific ice regime for seven different vessel types. Since the SMOS ice thickness product is more reliable in thin ice area (lower than 0.5 m), we only focus on the navigability changes of the ANR for open water vessels. We found that, although the end of shipping season for open water vessels across the ANR has extended to the day of 297±4 (October 24th) since 2010 (excluding 2013), there is no significant trend in the navigability of the ANR for open water vessels in the last 8 years. Further analysis of the spatial distribution map of the navigation risk for open water vessels at the end of shipping season in different years shows that the navigability of the ANR mainly affected by the ice regime around the Eastern Siberian Sea, the Novosibirsk Islands and the Severnaya Zemlya Islands. In most years, it is the earlier frozen ice over the three regions leading to the end of the entire ANR, in the case that most other areas are still safely navigable. We also performed detailed analysis and found that there are significant differences in the navigability changes in the three key straits for open water vessels over the ANR. The Long strait shows great inter-annual variations in the navigability, but has limit impact on the navigability of the entire route because of its late ending of the shipping season. The Sannikov Strait shows the fastest decline, but small inter-annual variations in the navigability. It is also the earliest one that ending the shipping season, and therefore has a great impact on the long-term trend of the navigability of the ANR. The intra- and inter-annual changes in the navigability of the Vlikitsky Strait are very complex. It always fluctuates dramatically, and thus has great impact on the short-term navigability of the entire ANR. In view of the complexity of the change in the ANR navigability, observed high-quality, near real-time sea ice datasets are very important for the quantification of navigation risk in the ASR. © 2019, Science Press.

Since the SMOS satellite launched in 2009, there have been three microwave salinity satellites (Aquarius, SMOS and SMAP satellites) that could provide us sea surface salinity (SSS) data from space. In this study, we compared the SSS products derived from these three salinity satellites: the Aquarius satellite data have a limited spatial resolution and a short time series of less than 5 years, the SMOS SSS product for the Arctic from Barcelona Expert Center provide a 7-year record of the Arctic SSS in 2011-2017, the SMAPSSS data is more sensitive in low salinity regions. With the data from the SMAP and SMOS satellites, we presented a general view on summertime SSS variation during 2011-2017 in the Arctic area. The SSS maps showed that the SSS mainly varied in the plume area and were stable in the Arctic open sea. Satellite-derived salinity could detect the extremely low SSS area caused by sea ice melting and continental runoff. We extracted the ice-melt water area by combing the microwave salinity satellite data and the ocean color satellite data, which could exclude the continental fresh water input.

Sea-ice is always serious threat for Arctic navigation. In this paper, a classification method of aerial images is proposed to recognize different types of sea-ice scenes, which can be further used to analyze the threat of each scene in Arctic Ocean. However, due to the diverse types and distribution of sea-ice in various scenes, the categories of sea-ice scenes are indistinct. So a grouping way is primarily introduced to define different sea-ice scenes. These scenes are grouped into six typical categories according to the distribution of sea-ice. Then a transfer learning strategy is used to fine-tune a pre-trained deep convolution neural network model. Finally, using that trained network to classify new sea ice scenes. Experimental results show that an acceptable classification accuracy can be obtained. © 2018 IEEE","","Aerial image classification; Deep convolution neural network; Remote sensing; Sea-ice scenes","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063153960"

Doppler velocity is measured by radar sensing at moderate and low grazing angles. The experiments were performed using coherent X-band and Ka-band panoramic digital radars operating with the horizontal polarization for transmission and reception. These radars have high spatial resolution. An algorithm for reconstructing Doppler velocities is proposed and estimates of the fluctuation sensitivity of the method are carried out. The method is applied to the conditions of the fetch-limited wind wave growth, which is typical for enclosed waters and the sea nearshore, where the dominant wavelength is of the order of ten meters. Based on the two-scale model, the dependences of the Doppler velocity on the parameters of the ocean-atmosphere interface are considered. The effect of shadowing by the crests of wind waves on the magnitude of the Doppler velocity at low grazing angles is discussed. The manifestation of the orbital velocity of wind waves is demonstrated. © 2019 SPIE.","Electric currents; Holography; Hydrophilicity; Image resolution; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Velocity; Coherent radar; Dominant wavelength; Doppler velocity; High spatial resolution; Horizontal polarization; Low grazing angles; Orbital velocities; Radar sensing; Radar measurement","Coherent radar; Current; Doppler velocity; Radar sensing; Waves breakers; Waves shadowing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077802353"

These predictions are nowadays made using numerical models based on different theories for wave-ice interactions. To date, hardly any field measurements exist that can be used to validate the proposed theoretical models. Remote sensing observations, on the other hand, have a great potential and they are gaining a widespread interest due to the large amounts of data that can be collected continuously over an extensive area. In this study, we discuss the use of satellite remote sensing to improve our understanding of wave-ice interactions. Three different types of satellite remote sensing are reviewed, including optical, altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We present examples of such data over the Barents Sea, where new in situ data are available. These in situ data, which were collected during the Barents Sea Metocean and Ice Network (BaSMIN) field campaign, are used to illuminate the review. Optical data provide high quality and high-resolution images. However, just a small portion of such data are useful to study wave-ice interactions because only images acquired with daylight and cloud free conditions can be processed. Imagery over our study site reveal a tremendous amount of detail of the sea ice, including a diffusive and compact ice edge. Altimetry data provide accurate wave height information up to the ice edge. Wave height data are collected over our study site and validated with buoy measurements. Since the Polar regions are often dark and cloud covered, active microwave sensors such as SAR are the most valuable source of information in these regions. Four different applications of SAR are reviewed: imaging of ocean waves within the ice cover and determination of the ice edge, ice type and floe size distribution. Regarding ocean waves in sea ice, SAR can provide information on wave attenuation, the change in peak wavelength and the shift in dominant wave direction. © 2019, Lulea University of Technology.

Traditionally, using a theoretical construct, stochastic signals were used as such models and its fluctuations were described by Rayleigh and Rayleigh- Rice. These models are used both for simulation signals, reflected from the Earth's surface, and for signals, reflected from the surface of the sea. At low resolution capability of on-board radars, the similar models describe quite well the statistical characteristics of fluctuating signals. Modern on-board locator has high resolution capability and the Rayleigh and Rice's models can no longer be used in the synthesis and simulation of modern on-board navigation systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to the construction of models of radar signals using both theoretical constructs and experimental data that allows you to take into account the features of reflection of radar signals from small plots of the Underlying Surface of earth and sea. Along with it the correlations between the individual sections and anisotropic reflections are taken into account when observing sites with different angles. The reflections from the sea surface approximated by a log-normal law, reflections from the earth's surface at the sight of the manifold types of surface by the Beckmann and Weibull laws, special cases of which are the laws of Rice, Rayleigh and Hoyt. As the reflection model of the edge uses the distribution law of the vector sum of the signals, reflected from the elementary areas of earth and sea, getting in the resolution cell. In this case, the law of distribution of the total vector is subject to a law similar to Huber's law, in which the above-mentioned laws of distribution of reflections from the earth and the sea are used as the basic distributions. Previously used reflection models turned out as special cases of the proposed models. These models and the modeling algorithms developed for them can be used in the development and research of high- precision methods of radar monitoring for the purposes of environmental reconnaissance, forecasting and prompt prevention of natural and man-made emergency situations. In addition, for testing the operating modes of the equipment of unmanned aerial vehicles, including for multi-position radar systems. Algorithms for modeling location signals based on mathematical models using experimental data of reflections from various types of underlying land and sea surfaces, as well as coastal edges (coastal waters), allow us to bring the results of computer experiments to the results of actual tests of radio-electronic equipment.

Indian Ocean, (3). Pacific Ocean (PO), (4). Ross Sea, and (5). Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea (BS). Empirical mode decomposition was used to extract the trend of the original signal, and then a slope test method was utilized to identify a transition point. The SAL provided by the CM SAF cloud, Albedo, and Surface Radiation dataset from AVHRR data-Second Edition was validated at Neumayer station. Sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) were also analyzed. The trend of the SAL/SIC was positive during summer over the ASIR and five longitudinal sectors, except for the BS (-2.926% and -4.596% per decade for SAL and SIC, correspondingly). Moreover, the largest increasing trend of SAL and SIC appeared in the PO at approximately 3.781% and 3.358% per decade, respectively. However, the decreasing trend of SAL/SIC in the BS slowed down, and the increasing trend of SAL/SIC in the PO accelerated. The trend curves of the SST exhibited a crest around 2000-2005; thus, the slope lines of the SST showed an increasing-decreasing type for the ASIR and the five longitudinal sectors. The evolution of summer albedo decreased rapidly in the early summer and then maintained a relatively stable level for the whole ASIR. The change of it mainly depended on the early melt of sea ice during the entire summer. The change of sea ice albedo had a narrow range when compared with composite albedo and SIC over the five longitudinal sectors and reached a stable level earlier. The transition point of SAL/SIC in several sectors appeared around the year 2000, whereas that of the SST for the entire ASIR occurred in 2003-2005. A high value of SAL/SIC and a low value of the SST existed in the WS which can be displayed by the spatial distribution of pixel average. In addition, the lower the latitude was, the lower the SAL/SIC and the higher the SST would be. A transition point of SAL appeared in 2001 in most areas ofWest Antarctica. This transition point could be illustrated by anomaly maps. The spatial distribution of the pixel-based trend of SAL demonstrated that the change in SAL in East Antarctica has exhibited a positive trend in recent decades. However, inWest Antarctica, the change of SAL presented a decreasing trend before 2001 and transformed into an increasing trend afterward, especially in the east of the Antarctic Peninsula. © 2019 by the authors.","Atmospheric temperature; Pixels; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Solar radiation; Spatial distribution; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Testing; Transition flow; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode; Remote sensing data; Sea ice concentration; Sea surface temperature (SST); Surface albedo change; Oceanography","Antarctica; Ensemble empirical mode; Sea ice albedo; Sea ice concentration; Sea surface temperature","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063989188"

One basic tool to monitor dynamical changes is to analyze and compare the compressibility of image patches using their Normalized Compression Distances. These distances can be converted into similarity matrices providing reliable maps of surface changes. The accuracy of these change maps was quantified for several typical test cases.

As it is extremely difficult to access the interior of a glacier, our knowledge relies mostly on the observation of input variables such as air temperature, and output variables such as the ice flow velocities reflecting the englacial water pressure, and the dynamics of plumes reflecting the discharge of meltwater into the ocean. In this study we use a cost-effective Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to monitor the daily movements of Bowdoin Glacier, north-west Greenland, and the dynamics of its main plume. Using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and feature-tracking techniques, we obtained 22 high-resolution ortho-images and 19 velocity fields at the calving front for 12 days in July 2016. Our results show a two-day-long speed-up event (up to 170%) – caused by an increase in buoyant subglacial forces – with a strong spatial variability revealing that enhanced acceleration is an indication of shallow bedrock. Further, we used the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method to analyze water flow from successive UAV images taken while flying over the main plume of the glacier. We found that PIV successfully captures the area of radially diverging flow of the plume, and provides information on spatial and time variability as no other remote sensing technique can. Most interestingly, the active part of the plume features pulsating water jets at the time scale of seconds, and is 1 to 5 times smaller than its visual footprint defined by the iceberg-free area. Combined with an ice flow model or a non-steady plume model, our approach has the potential to generate a novel set of input data to gather information about the depth of the bedrock, the discharge of meltwater, or the subglacial melting rate of tidewater glaciers. © 2018","Arctic; Bowdoin Glacier; Greenland; Aircraft detection; Aircraft landing; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Flow of water; Flow visualization; Glacial geology; Hydraulics; Martian surface analysis; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Velocimeters; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Feature-tracking; Ice flow; Meltwater plume; Particle image velocimetries; Structure from motion; discharge; flow velocity; glacial history; ice; ice flow; ice-ocean interaction; iceberg; iceberg calving; orthophoto; particle image velocimetry; photogrammetry; sea level change; subglacial environment; tidewater glacier; tracking; unmanned vehicle; water flow; VTOL/STOL aircraft","Calving glaciers; Feature-tracking; Ice flow; Meltwater plume; Particle Image Velocimetry; Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052611108"

There is an urgent need to understand how these changes affect geomorphic processes along Arctic coasts. Here we describe spatial and temporal patterns of shoreline changes along two geomorphologically distinct, storm-wave dominated reaches of the Chukchi Sea coastline over the last 64 years. One study area encompasses the west- to southwest-facing, coarse-clastic shoreline and ice-rich bluffs of Cape Krusenstern (CAKR). The other covers the north-facing, sandy shorelines on barrier islands, ice-rich bluffs, and the Cape Espenberg spit in the Bering Land Bridge National Park (BELA). Both study areas lie within the zone of continuous permafrost, which exists both on and offshore and outcrops as ice-rich bluffs along the BELA coast. We mapped changes in coastal geomorphology over three observation periods: 1950–1980, 1980–2003, and 2003–2014 using aerial and satellite imagery. We then compared these geomorphic changes to changes in sea-ice coverage, which declined ~10 days per decade between 1979 and 2016 in the southern Chukchi Sea. Changes in coastal geomorphology in both BELA and CAKR exhibited high spatial variability over the study period. Between 2003 and 2014, shorelines of barrier islands in BELA exhibited the highest mean rates of change, −1.5 m yr−1, while coarse, clastic barrier beaches in CAKR showed only minimal change. Overall, shorelines in both BELA and CAKR became more dynamic (increasing erosion or increasing accumulation) after ca. 2003, with spatial variability in shoreline changes roughly doubling between the first period of observation (1950–1980) and the last (2003–2014). This increase in coastal dynamism may signal a transitional period leading to new state of geomorphic equilibria along these ice-affected coastlines. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; United States; Antennas; Erosion; Geomorphology; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Storms; Water waves; Arctic; Coastal erosion; Geomorphic process; Observation Period; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatial variability; Temporal and spatial variability; Transitional period; clastic rock; coastal erosion; coastal zone; geomorphology; national park; permafrost; remote sensing; sea ice; shoreline change; spatiotemporal analysis; Landforms","Arctic; Coastal erosion; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Sea-ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050278320"

Taxonomic groups of phytoplankton can be discriminated based on their pigment signatures, which, in turn, impact their absorption spectra, given that different pigments have different absorption windows in the visible. Using concurrent measurements of phytoplankton diagnostic pigments and absorption spectra (aph) collected in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, a novel and direct approach was designed for simultaneously estimating the biomass concentrations of several PTGs (Ci) as well as their specific absorption coefficient. The chemotaxonomic tool CHEMTAX was applied to twelve diagnostic pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Their results revealed that the phytoplankton community composition was made of nine groups, from which six dominant were identified: diatoms, dinoflagellates, c3-flagellate, haptophytes type 7, two types of prasinophytes. Out of 117 samples, twenty pairs of Ci derived by CHEMTAX and measured aph were randomly selected and used in a linear unmixing model to extract the specific absorption spectral of each group. This step was repeated 1000 times to provide the mean specific absorption of a given phytoplankton group. These specific absorption spectra were used to reconstruct total aph, which was consistent with the measured aph (R2 from 0.8 to 0.95) at all visible wavelengths (400-700 nm). The derived specific absorption spectra were further used with the measured aph(λ) at ten Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) wavebands in a linear unmixing model to test the ability to retrieve the concentrations of PTGs from satellite remote sensing. A comparison between estimated and measured Ci showed that the approach used in this study performed best when retrieving five groups (i.e., dinoflagellates, c3-flagellate, haptophytes, two types of prasinophytes) from the nine initially identified using CHEMTAX with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) <35%, except for diatoms with a MAPE value of about 45%. Our approach provides a practical basis for estimation of PTGs using aph(λ) derived from satellite observations and field measurements. © 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","Absorptiometry, Photon; Arctic Regions; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Classification; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Remote Sensing Technology; Absorption spectra; Ecosystems; Forestry; High performance liquid chromatography; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Mean absolute percentage error; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Ocean color remote sensing; Phytoplankton absorptions; Phytoplankton community; Satellite observations; Satellite remote sensing; Specific absorption coefficients; Arctic; chemistry; classification; high performance liquid chromatography; photon absorptiometry; phytoplankton; remote sensing; sea; Phytoplankton","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057125334"

Here, we survey the snow–ice system, then provide recommendations for overcoming present challenges. These include: collecting process-oriented observations for model diagnostics and understanding snow–ice feedbacks, and improving our remote sensing capabilities of snow for monitoring large-scale changes in snow on sea ice.

Polar bears are sensitive to changes of the sea ice distribution and depend on sea ice as a platform for hunting, moving and reproducing. In other words, sea ice is an important part of polar bear habitat. Climate is the main factor of sea ice changes. Therefore, it is very important to understand the current situation of polar bears as well as the effect of climate on the Arctic ecosystem. Although many researchers have devoted to find polar bears habitat using aerial survey in recent years, their methods require considerable human involvement and cannot be used to detect all habitats rapidly and effectively. Thus, it is necessary to find a method to quickly assess the polar bear habitat changes. Based on the sea ice concentration products from the United States National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the ETOPO1 bedrock product provided by the NOAA, the inter-annual variability of sea ice concentration, open water area, sea ice retreat, sea ice advance and the length of the open water season in the Arctic were analyzed. Then, the polar bear habitat stability were analized. The results indicate that from 1989 to 2016 the sea ice concentration has decreased, open water area increased and multiyear ice decreased. Most of the multiyear ice has converted to one-year ice. The sea ice appeared later and retreated earlier, so the length of the open water season increased significantly, an increase of 72 days compared to 1992. Barents Sea is the region with the most significant changes in open water area and the length of open water season among 19 habitats, with increasing rates of 9.71×103 km2/a and 71.69 days/decade, respectively. Based on the change rates of the length of the open water season, we divide the polar bears habitats into three levels of conditions: stable, sub-stable and instable. The three stable habitats, including the Chukchi sea, Western Hudson Bay and Southern Hudson Bay are located in the lower latitudes compared with other habitats. There are 13 sub- stable habitats, including Laptev Sea, Kara Sea, East Greenland, Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, M'Clintock Channel, Viscount Melville, Norwegian Bay, Northern Beaufort Southern Beaufort and Lancaster Sound. The three unstable habitats are located in the north of 70° N, including Arctic Basin, Barents Sea and Kane Basin. Stable habitats are mainly in low latitudes, and unstable regions are all in high latitudes. The classification results show that the high latitude area is covered with more sea ice, but the inter-annual variation is very significant. In three unstable regions, polar bears have less time to adapt to the sea ice changes, and the inter-annual migration changes greatly, which is less favorable to the survival and development of polar bears. © 2018, Science Press.

However, ground truth must be necessary to discuss this kind of approach. Although there are several methods to acquire ice thickness, Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) can be good solution because it can discriminate snow-ice and ice-sea water interface thanks to comparative higher spatial resolution than the other methods. In this paper, we carried out GPR measurement in brackish lake and an electromagnetic field analysis in order to interpret the GPR data. The simulation model was assumed considering the actual snow and ice thickness acquired in field measurement. From the simulation results, although it seems difficult to identify the reflection at snow and ice interface due to a thin layer thickness and a low dielectric constant, snow and ice thickness may be estimated by using multiple reflection components. © Authors 2019.

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large areal coverage, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Although until now, L-Band SAR sensors are rarely used in an operational context, it offers greater capabilities for sea ice type retrieval and is more robust during the melt season compared to higher frequency bands. With the help of JAXA’s ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 sensor, we are able to explore the potential of polarimetric L-band acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification in an operational environment.

The optical method for recording the wind waves spectrum is based on spectral analysis of the optical images of the sea surface with non-nadir observations. An incoherent optical spectrum analyzer developed at the Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences is described that allows one to record two-dimensional spectra of the sea surface in real time in the wave number range from 0.3 to 5.0 rad/cm. Wind-wave spectrum retrieval using microwave radiometers was carried out by the method of Non-linear Radiothermal Resonance Spectroscopy (NRRS), which was developed and are improving at present at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Using a set of radiometers-polarimeters of the 3, 5 and 8-mm ranges, provides restoration of the spectrum in the range of wave numbers from 0.39 to 15.0 rad/cm. Synchronous microwave and optical measurements of wind wave spectra were carried out on a marine hydrophysical platform in the Black Sea. The results of the sea wave's spectrum restoration obtained by means microwave and optical technique gave almost identical estimates of the spectral curves level, which also coincide with the model spectra. This fact confirms the consistency of described wind wave's spectra recording methods and the possibility of their use for monitoring the sea surface state in natural conditions. © 2019 SPIE.","Geometrical optics; Hydrophilicity; Image analysis; Microwave devices; Microwaves; Optical data processing; Optical engineering; Optics; Radiometers; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Restoration; Sea ice; Space optics; Space research; Spectrum analyzers; Surface waters; Water waves; Gravity capillary waves; Sea surfaces; Surface brightness; Surface image; Wind wave; Wind wave spectrum; Spectrum analysis","Gravity-capillary waves; Microwave; Optics; Processing of images; Radiometer; Remote sensing; Sea surface; Spectral analysis; Surface brightness; Surface image; Wind wave spectrum; Wind waves","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077796232"

Hurricane-force winds lead to intensive wave breaking, with formation of spray in the air, and bubbles in the water. It strongly intensifies gas flux characterizing by power dependence of the transfer rate on the 10-m height wind speed used for approximation of the empirical results. But available data demonstrate wide variation which leads large confidence limits for coefficients in empirical approximations. On the other hand there is an obvious problem of obtaining reliable data on the wind speed. Widely used reanalysis data typically underestimate wind speed magnitude, due to the low spatial and temporal resolution. One of the most promising ways to measure near water wind speed is the use of the data of remote sensing. The present study used technique to achieve wind speed based on the processing sea surface images obtained in cross-polarized mode with C-band (5.4 GHz) radar with synthesized aperture (RSA) of RADARSAT satellite. To this propose geophysical model function (GMF) which binds values of wind speed and normalized radar cross section in cross-polarized mode was used. This GMF was developed in a special laboratory experiment on the wind-wave flumes for a wide range of wind speeds, including hurricanes.

Optical and IR satellite images of the ocean have been traditionally used to estimate the current velocities when comparing color or temperature inhomogeneities in co-located subsequent scenes. SAR as all-weather and all-day instrument with high spatial resolution is very perspective for ocean remote sensing, and the procedure similar to the optical/IR observations seems to be usable for SAR for the current velocity estimation, too. Marine biogenic film slicks often observed on the sea surface as systems of ""filamentary"" structures at low/moderate wind conditions can be considered as appropriate features for marine current tracking. However, very few attempts have been made to study the current velocity field when studying slick features in SAR images acquired from different satellites at a comparably short time interval. In this paper two sequential satellite SAR images acquired with Envisat ASAR and ERS-2 SAR have been analyzed in order to estimate the surface marine currents. The acquisition time difference between the images was nearly 30 min. The images were characterized by a number of slick features which were nearly identical within the 30 min time shift, so that it was rather easy to track any chosen slick structure and to retrieve the velocity field. A Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) method has been used for the current retrieval, when analyzing correlation between the sequential images. It has been obtained that for some slick filamentary structures or for their parts the retrieved current velocities were directed nearly along the filaments, so that the slicks can be considered as the current streamlines. On the contrary, for some other slicks the retrieved current velocity vectors were directed at quite large angles to the filament tangent lines. We believe that the latter effect appears for varying currents due to the ""memory"" of slicks which cannot change their orientation or appear/disappear instantaneously according to fast changes of environmental conditions, in particular according to wind speed velocity/direction changes. © 2019 SPIE.","Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Image acquisition; Image analysis; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Wind; Environmental conditions; Filamentary structures; High spatial resolution; Maximum cross correlations; Ocean remote sensing; Satellite SAR; Sequential images; Short time intervals; Radar imaging","Filamentary slick structures; Marine currents; Sequential satellite SAR images","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077798757"

The average total flux over the sampling period was 193.58 mg m                             −2                              d                             −1                             , and the average fluxes of organic carbon (C                             org                             ), inorganic carbon (C                             inorg                             ), and biogenic silica (Si                             bio                             ) were 721.78, 28.67, and 2382.80 μmol m                             −2                              d                             −1                             , respectively. Si                             bio                              was the main contributor to the total mass flux, and strongly correlated with C                             org                             . The high Si                             bio                             /C                             org                              molar ratios (>1) suggest that C                             org                              was transported to deep sea in association with Si                             bio                             . By comparing remote sensing data of sea ice and chlorophyll in the upper water column, we found that the dynamics of carbon fluxes were closely related to changes in sea ice. Algae in sea ice may have a key role in biological pump processes in early summer. Apart from the ice algae bloom period, variations in carbon fluxes generally corresponded with phytoplankton blooms in the upper water. The ballast effect controlled the particle settling velocity and the efficiency of the biological pump. Sea ice rafts initiated the first particle export event and enhanced the particle settling efficiency during melting period. As diatoms might become less dominant in the ice-free area, sea ice loss may cause the efficiency of the biological pump efficiency to decrease over the long term.                          © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Antarctica; East Antarctica; Prydz Bay; algae; Bacillariophyta; Efficiency; Molar ratio; Organic carbon; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Silica; Biological pumps; Particle fluxes; Particle settling velocity; Phytoplankton bloom; Polynya; Prydz Bay; Remote sensing data; Upper water column; biological pump; carbon cycle; carbon flux; efficiency measurement; inorganic carbon; organic carbon; particle settling; polynya; seasonal variation; sediment trap; silica; Sea ice","Ballast effect; Biological pump efficiency; Particle fluxes; Polynya; Prydz Bay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062026678"

A passive reflectometer overcomes this problem by receiving the reflected beam from a known precise signal source in space. Due to the used frequency band, the signal modulation and the availability of their transmitter's ephemerides, GNSS signals are perfectly usable for this purpose. The PRETTY (Passive REflecTometry and dosimeTrY) satellite is currently developed by TU Graz, RUAG Space and Seibersdorf Laboratories under a contract with ESA. PRETTY hosts two payloads: The first payload is a passive GNSS based reflectometer. The main scientific goal is the precise altimetric determination of ocean and sea-ice surfaces using the interferometric phase-delay altimetry approach. The interferometric approach avoids the local generation of the original signal by additionally receiving of the direct (not reflected) signal from the signal source, which subsequently is correlated with the reflected beam. This methodology will be applied for the first time in space. The second payload is a dosimeter for analysis of the space radiation environment in the PRETTY orbit by collecting data from different sensors. The dosimeter is capable of providing information on the total ionizing dose (TID) as well as on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the space radiation environment. The satellite mission has entered the detailed design phase and a launch is scheduled for early 2021, with a nominal operational lifetime of one year. In the present publication, we introduce the mission and observation concept, as well as the current status of the project. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Monitoring the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice can provide crucial information for ice disaster prevention for marine transportation, oil field operation, and regional climate change studies. Although these satellite data cover the study area with fairly high spatial resolution, their typically limited cloudless images pose serious restrictions for continuous observation of short-term dynamics, such as sub-seasonal changes. In this study, high spatiotemporal resolution (500 m and eight images per day) geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI) data with a high proportion of cloud-free images were used to monitor the characteristics of the Bohai Sea ice, including area and thickness. An object-based feature extraction method and an albedo-based thickness inversion model were used for estimating sea ice area and thickness, respectively. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new dataset, a total of 68 GOCI images were selected to analyze the evolution of sea ice area and thickness during the winter of 2012-2013 with severe sea ice conditions. The extracted sea ice area was validated using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data with higher spatial resolution, and the estimated sea ice thickness was found to be consistent with in situ observation results. The entire sea ice freezing-melting processes, including the key events such as the day with the maximum ice area and the first and last days of the frozen season, were better resolved by the high temporal-resolution GOCI data compared with MODIS or AVHRR data. Both characteristics were found to be closely correlated with cumulative freezing/melting degree days. Our study demonstrates the applicability of the GOCI data as an improved dataset for studying the Bohai Sea ice, particularly for purposes that require high temporal resolution data, such as sea ice disaster monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Bohai Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; AVHRR; extraction method; GOCI; ice thickness; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; monitoring; Northern Hemisphere; regional climate; remote sensing; resolution; satellite data; sea ice; spatial resolution","Bohai Sea; Geostationary ocean color imager; Ocean remote sensing; Sea ice monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060969602"

The geometry of film slicks is determined by physical characteristics of surface films and by environmental parameters. At present our understanding of the role of geophysical processes controlling the slick dynamics is still insufficient. This is partly because of the luck of systematic studies of film slicks in controlled experiments. A perspective approach to the problem solution is organization of special experiments with artificial slicks formed by films with known characteristics. Previously we reported on the results of some experiments and proposed a simple model of spreading of surfactant spills accounting for the surface stresses induced by wind waves. In this paper new results of experiments on oil spill evolution are presented and physical mechanisms of this evolution are discussed. The experiments were conducted on the Gorky Water Reservoir. Surfactants (oleic acid) were spilled out from a motor boat. The slick shape was studied using aerial photography and a methodology of contouring slicks using a motor boat with a GPS receiver onboard. It is obtained that the cross-wind slick size grows quite slowly with time being almost independent on wind, while the growth rate of the along-wind axis increases rapidly with wind velocity. To explain the observed effects a mechanism of ""oil overflow"" is hypothesized. It describes the movement of surfactants from an upwind slick side to its downwind side due to the action of along-wind wave induced stresses. This process should contribute also to some additional drift velocity of slicks. The conclusion about the drift is consistent with a hypothesis, discussed in the literature that oil slicks move faster than the surrounding water surface microlayer. © 2019 SPIE.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Global positioning system; Hydrophilicity; Motor boats; Oceanography; Oil spills; Process control; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface active agents; Surface waters; Controlled experiment; Environmental parameter; Ocean remote sensing; Perspective approach; Physical characteristics; Sea surfaces; Slicks; Wind wave; Growth rate","Film spreading; Ocean remote sensing; Radar/optical observations; Sea surface; Slicks; Wind waves","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077795931"

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences. ©2019 IEEE","3D modeling; Lakes; Radar theory; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Solar radiation; Space-based radar; Thickness measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Amplitude information; Antarctic sea ice; Changing climate; Fraction measurements; Multiple frequency; Reflected signal; Satellite mission; Sea-ice thickness; Radar measurement","Antarctic; Arctic; Bistatic radar; Numerical solution; Reflectometry; Satellite missions; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101994742"

The propulsion system consists of two small brushless motors powered by lithium batteries that follow pre-programmed survey transects and are operated by a GPS-guided autopilot control board.

The first SAR sensors have given rise to coarse coastal and maritime monitoring applications, including oil spill, ship and ice floes detection. With the upgrade to very high-resolution sensors in the recent years, with relatively new SAR missions such as Sentinel-1, a great deal of data providing a stronger information content has been released, enabling more refined studies on general targets features and thus permitting complex classifications, as for ship classification, which has become increasingly relevant given the growing need for coastal surveillance in commercial and military segments. In the last decade, several works focused on this topic have been presented, generally based on radiometric features processing; furthermore, in the very recent years a significant amount of research works have focused on emerging deep learning techniques, in particular on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Recently Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) have been presented, demonstrating a notable improvement in capturing the properties of given entities, improving the use of spatial informations, in particular of spatial dependence between features, a severely lacking feature in CNNs. In fact, CNNs pooling operations have been criticized for losing spatial relations, thus special capsules, along with a new iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism, have been proposed. In this work a comparison between Capsule and CNNs potential in the ship classification application domain is shown, by leveraging the OpenSARShip, a SAR Sentinel-1 ship chips dataset; in particular, a performance comparison between capsule and various convolutional architectures is built, demonstrating better performances of CapsNet in classifying ships within a small dataset. © 2019 SPIE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Environmental engineering; Error detection; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Oil spills; Radar target recognition; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Ships; Synthetic aperture radar; Capsule; Classication; Convolutional; Generative Adversarial; Sentinel; Classification (of information)","Capsule; Classication; Convolutional; Deep Learning; Detection; Generative Adversarial; Neural Networks; SAR; Sentinel; Ship","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076886411"

In this study we present a Lagrangian approach to quantify summer sea ice melt in which multiyear ice (MYI) floes that were surveyed by airborne electromagnetic thickness sounding within Nares Strait during summer were backtracked, using satellite imagery, to a region in close proximity (3–20 km) to spring ice thickness surveys carried out in the Lincoln Sea. Typical modal total MYI thicknesses, including ~0.4-m snow, ranged between 3.9 and 4.7 m in the Lincoln Sea during April. Ice-only modal thicknesses were between 2.2 and 3.0 m in Nares Strait during August. Total thinning including snow and ice was 1.3 ± 0.1 m including 0.4 ± 0.09 m of snow melt and 0.9 ± 0.2 m of ice melt.

The history of research on the development of microwave radiometric techniques of remote sensing of natural environment and сreation of equipment that was ahead of the time is presented. The characteristics of the radiometers, the main results of the experiment and the possibility of joint analysis of microwave measurements and visible and infrared satellite data are considered. For the first time, total water content in the clouds W, water vapor in the atmosphere Q, and ocean surface temperature were simultaneously retrieved, areas of precipitation and storm winds were revealed. According to satellite data, water vapor fields were mapped, W and Q dependences on latitude were obtained for individual oceans and for the entire World Ocean, the masses of water vapor and water in clouds in the Earth atmosphere were estimated; the increments of brightness temperatures in atmospheric fronts, in precipitation zones, in the intratropical convergence zone were determined. Edge position and concentration of sea ice around Antarctica were determined, and the features of microwave radiation from continental ice were explained. For terrestrial covers, the effects of moisture and structure of the upper layer of the surface and relief on brightness temperature were shown. Nowadays the direction of remote sensing from space initiated by the world’s first experiment on Kosmos-243 is still being intensively developed. © 2019 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Precipitation controls the snow cover on sea ice, which impedes the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere, inhibiting sea ice growth. Thus, accurate precipitation amounts are needed to inform sea ice modeling, especially for the production of thickness estimates from satellite altimetry freeboard data. However, obtaining a quantitative estimate of the precipitation distribution in the Arctic is notoriously difficult because of a number of factors, including a lack of reliable, long-term in situ observations; difficulties in remote sensing over sea ice; and model biases in temperature and moisture fields and associated uncertainty of modeled cloud microphysical processes in the polar regions. Here, we compare precipitation estimates over the Arctic Ocean from eight widely used atmospheric reanalyses over the period 2000-16 (nominally the ""new Arctic""). We find that the magnitude, frequency, and phase of precipitation vary drastically, although interannual variability is similar. Reanalysis-derived precipitation does not increase with time as expected; however, an increasing trend of higher fractions of liquid precipitation (rainfall) is found. When compared with drifting ice mass balance buoys, three reanalyses (ERA-Interim, MERRA, and NCEP R2) produce realistic magnitudes and temporal agreement with observed precipitation events, while two products [MERRA, version 2 (MERRA-2), and CFSR] show large, implausible magnitudes in precipitation events. All the reanalyses tend to produce overly frequent Arctic precipitation. Future work needs to be undertaken to determine the specific factors in reanalyses that contribute to these discrepancies in the new Arctic. © 2018 American Meteorological Society.","Budget control; Earth atmosphere; Oceanography; Precipitation (chemical); Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Cloud microphysical process; Freezing precipitations; Interannual variability; Precipitation controls; Precipitation distribution; Precipitation events; Quantitative estimates; Reanalysis; Uncertainty analysis","Atmosphere; Freezing precipitation; Precipitation; Reanalysis data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054074965"

The results show that all three methods can distinguish the multi-year (MY) ice and first-year (FY) ice using Ku-band scatterometer data and radiometer data during the ice growth season, while C-band scatterometer data are not suitable for MY ice and FY ice discrimination using HT and SM methods. The SM model has a smaller MY ice classification extent than the HT method from scatterometer data. The classification accuracy of the SM method is the higher compared to ship-based observations. It can be concluded that the SM method is a promising method for discriminating MY ice from FY ice.

Absolute uncertainty (accuracy) is evaluated based on the comparison of the extent between several products. There are clear biases between the extent from the different products that are of the order of 500 000 to 1 × 106 km2 depending on the season and hemisphere. These biases are due to differences in the algorithm sensitivity to ice edge conditions and the spatial resolution of different sensors. Relative uncertainty is assessed by examining extents from the National Snow and Ice Data Center Sea Ice Index product. The largest source of uncertainty, ∼100 000 km2, is between near-real-time and final products due to different input source data and different processing and quality control. For consistent processing, the uncertainty is assessed using different input source data and by varying concentration algorithm parameters. This yields a relative uncertainty of 30 000-70 000 km2. The Arctic minimum extent uncertainty is ∼40 000 km2. Uncertainties in comparing with earlier parts of the record may be higher due to sensor transitions.

In recent years, a variety of detection algorithms for green tide have been proposed. However, the extraction thresholds of each algorithm are uncertain because of atmospheric conditions, the distribution of green tides, etc. In this paper, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and Landsat- 8 data were used to explore the threshold stability of some common detection algorithms for green tide, including the AFAI, DVI, EVI, IGAG, and NDVI. Four scenes of GOCI satellite data from 2016 to 2018 were selected for the experiments. The first step was to extract the green tide areas in one region to determine the threshold for each algorithm. In this step, the extraction results of the Landsat-8 data, which has a resolution of 30 m, was seen as the true value of the green tide coverage. Then, we determined the threshold value for each algorithm by visual inspection. The thresholds determined in the first step were used to extract the green tide area in the other three regions, and the extraction results were compared by visual contrast. A comparison of the extraction precision for each algorithm in the other three regions indicated that the threshold stability of the AFAI algorithm was the best among these data in the YS region. © 2019 SPIE.","Extraction; Geostationary satellites; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Signal detection; Stability; Atmospheric conditions; Detection algorithm; Economic problems; GOCI; Green tides; Macroalgal blooms; Threshold stability; Visual inspection; Data mining","GOCI; Green tide; Remote sensing; Threshold stability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077787465"

Calving glaciers of Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Severnaya Zemlya were examined with airborne radar that allowed to measure their thickness and to build 3D models. Satellite remote sensing data were used to derive glacier fronts position, ice surface flow velocity, changes of glacier margins, and parameters of iceberg distribution. The data on the flow rates of the main glaciers were compared with the satellite beacons equipped with GPS (ARGOS) installed on several glaciers. Systematic differences in the volume of the underwater part for icebergs observed in the winter-spring period and the autumn-summer period are demonstrated. These differences should be taken into account when interpreting satellite remote sensing data or estimating iceberg underwater part. The size distribution of produced icebergs is related to the structure of glaciers. The glacier areas close to flotation, zones of intensive icebergs production, present and potential intensity of icebergs production were assessed. The obtained data can be applied for simulating iceberg production in the Russian Arctic, assessing iceberg risk for offshore oil and gas facilities and ensuring safety of operations in iceberg infested waters as part of geological exploration ice management system. © 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).","Arctic engineering; Flotation; Flow velocity; Glaciers; Information management; Natural resources exploration; Offshore oil well production; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Satellites; Comprehensive research; Geological exploration; Ice management; Iceberg; Kara Sea; Laptev Sea; Russian Academy of Sciences; Satellite remote sensing data; Sea ice","Glacier; Ice management; Iceberg; Kara sea; Laptev sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076470845"

We have developed a method for mapping sea ice surface roughness using angular reflectance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness < 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice. Because of its coarser spatial scale, MISR-estimated roughness data have a variance about half that of ATM roughness data. © 2019 by the authors.","","MISR; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059938096"

One kind of method commonly used to estimate SST based on remote-sensing measurements is the split-window (SW) algorithm. However, the derivation of the linear SW algorithm does not appear to reflect reality because some assumptions and approximations were used. Moreover, the quadratic SW equation cannot be interpreted theoretically although it maintains the structure of the linear SW equation. The Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite launch is planned for 2018. Focusing on exploring the mechanism of the SW algorithm using GF-5 data, this study investigated the assumptions and approximations used to derive the linear SW technique. Two revised equations of these assumptions and approximations were developed. Combining the revised equations, a nonlinear SW algorithm was obtained that could be simplified to the quadratic equation. Compared with previous research, this study focuses more on the theoretical interpretation and improves our understanding of the semi-empirical quadratic SW equation. The matchup data set produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility was used to validate the quadratic SW algorithm.

Understanding the impact of climate change on the sensitive Arctic ecosystem to climate change has so far been hampered by the lack of time-constrained, high-resolution records and by implicit climate data analyses. Here, we show evidence of sharp growth in freshwater green algae as well as distinct diatom assemblage changes since ~1995, retrieved from a high-Arctic (80 °N) lake sediment record on Barentsøya (Svalbard). The proxy record approaches an annual to biennial resolution. Combining remote sensing and in-situ climate data, we show that this ecological change is concurrent with, and is likely driven by, the atmospheric warming and a sharp decrease in the length of the sea ice covered period in the region, and throughout the Arctic. Moreover, this research demonstrates the value of palaeoclimate records in pristine environments for supporting and extending instrumental records. Our results reinforce and extend observations from other sites that the high Arctic has already undergone rapid ecological changes in response to on-going climate change, and will continue to do so in the future. © 2018 The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046380002"

In-situ data, including water depths obtained from bathymetric charts, in-situ hyperspectral attenuation signatures and satellite- based reflectance factors are obtained from atmospherically corrected visible and near infra-red channels of World View-3 satellite imagery. The high spatial, radiometric and 11bit digital resolution satellite imagery is used to study water visibility that is an important ecosystem quality indicator. In shallow coastal waters as well as deeper water areas and nearby coastal waterways, the effects of water surface gravity wave facets and sun glint influence the estimates of water quality related variables estimated at the pixel level. The results have significant implications related to the estimation of the depth of penetration of light using satellite-based methods in coastal waters. Application of atmospherically corrected satellite imagery followed by glint removal is shown using translating and dilating derivative wavelet algorithms to estimate the attenuation depth of light in water.

In this work, we present a new, alternative GNSS-R approach based on the unscented Kalman filter and the so-called inverse modeling approach. The new method makes use of a mathematical description that relates SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) variations to multipath effects and uses a B-spline formalism to obtain time series of reflector height. The presented algorithm can provide results in real time with a precision that is significantly better than spectral inversion methods and almost comparable to results from inverse modeling in post-processing mode. To verify the performance, the method has been tested at station GTGU at the Onsala Space Observatory, Sweden, and at the station SPBY in Spring Bay, Australia. The RMS (root mean square) error with respect to nearby tide gauge data was found to be 2.0 cm at GTGU and 4.8 cm at SPBY when evaluating the output corresponding to real-time analysis. The method can also be applied in post-processing, resulting in RMS errors of 1.5 cm and 3.3 cm for GTGU and SPBY, respectively. Finally, based on SNR data from GTGU, it is also shown that the Kalman filter approach is able to detect the presence of sea ice with a higher temporal resolution than the previous methods and traditional remote sensing techniques which monitor ice in coastal regions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Australia; Halland; Onsala; Sweden; Inverse problems; Reflection; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Sea level; Signal to noise ratio; Surface measurement; Surface waters; Tide gages; Time series; GNSS-R; Kalman-filtering; Mathematical descriptions; Onsala Space Observatory; Real time; Real-time application; Remote sensing techniques; Unscented Kalman Filter; algorithm; data processing; GNSS; Kalman filter; methodology; monitoring system; numerical model; precision; real time; reflectometry; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea level; signal-to-noise ratio; tide gauge; time series analysis; Kalman filters","GNSS-R; Kalman filtering; Real time; Sea ice; Sea level; Time series; Unscented Kalman filter (UKF)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064194242"

The program included a field campaign in the western Arctic during the autumn of 2015, with in situ data collection and both aerial and satellite remote sensing. Many of the analyses have focused on using and improving forecast models. Summarizing and synthesizing the results from a series of separate papers, the overall view is of an Arctic shifting to a more seasonal system. The dramatic increase in open water extent and duration in the autumn means that large surface waves and significant surface heat fluxes are now common. When refreezing finally does occur, it is a highly variable process in space and time. Wind and wave events drive episodic advances and retreats of the ice edge, with associated variations in sea ice formation types (e.g., pancakes, nilas). This variability becomes imprinted on the winter ice cover, which in turn affects the melt season the following year. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Sea-ice thickness (SIT) is a controlling geophysical variable that needs to be understood with greater accuracy. For the first time, a SIT-retrieval method that exclusively uses only airborne SIT data for training the empirical algorithm to retrieve SIT from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) brightness temperature (TB) at different polarization is presented. A large amount of airborne SIT data has been used from various field campaigns in the Arctic conducted by different countries during 2011-15. The algorithm attempts to circumvent the issue related to discrimination between TB signatures of thin SIT versus low sea-ice concentration. The computed SIT has a rms error of 0.10 m, which seems reasonably good (as compared to the existing algorithms) for analysis at the used 25 km grid.

The results show that JZB is not always covered by sea ice in winter, but in some extreme cases, sea ice has covered more than one-third of the sea area of the bay. Sea ice in JZB has generally formed between January 1 and February 5, primarily along the coast, and gradually expanding to the central area of the bay. Both meteorological and artificial factors have played important roles in modulating the sea ice distribution. We found sea ice coverage to have been strongly correlated with the accumulated freezing-degree days nine days before the occurrence of sea ice (R                             2                              = 0.767). North-northwest surface winds have dominated the freezing period of sea water in the JZB, and wind speed has exerted a more significant influence on the formation of sea ice when the sea ice coverage has been generally small. Additionally, artificial factors began to affect the expansion of sea ice in JZB since 2007. The construction of the Jiao-Zhou-Bay Bridge (JZBB) is believed to have retarded water flow and reduced the tidal prism, thereby leading to the formation of an ice bridge along the JZBB, which effectively prevents the southward expansion of sea ice.                          © 2019, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","","Jiaozhou Bay; Landsat; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052315723"

Estimating surface flux using satellite remote sensing techniques is one possible answer to this challenge. In this paper, we introduce J-OFURO3, a third-generation data set developed by the Japanese Ocean Flux Data Sets with Use of Remote-Sensing Observations (J-OFURO) research project, which represents a significant improvement from older data sets as the result of research and development conducted from several perspectives. J-OFURO3 offers data sets for surface heat, momentum, freshwater fluxes, and related parameters over the global oceans (except regions of sea ice) from 1988 to 2013. The surface flux data, based on a 0.25° grid system, have a higher spatial resolution and are more accurate than the previous efforts. This has been achieved through the adopting of the state-of-the-art algorithms that estimate the near-surface air specific humidity and the improvement of techniques using observations from multi-satellite sensors. Comparisons with in situ observations using a systematic system developed along with the J-OFURO3 data set confirmed these improvements in accuracy, as did comparisons with other data sets. J-OFURO3 data are of good quality, facilitating a clearer understanding of more fine-scale ocean–atmosphere features (such as ocean fronts, mesoscale eddies, and geographic features) and their effects on surface fluxes. The information contained in this long-term (26 year) data set is demonstrably beneficial to understanding climate change and its relationship to oceans and the atmosphere. © 2018, The Author(s).","air-sea interaction; climate change; estimation method; global climate; heat flux; observational method; parameterization; remote sensing","Air-sea interaction; Air–sea flux; Global climate; J-OFURO; Remote sensing; Surface freshwater flux; Surface heat flux; Surface momentum flux","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053040727"

A correlation analysis of the link between the identified EOC for winter and summer seasons and indices of large-scale modes of natural climate variability in the Northern hemisphere was carried out. The first leading EOC, which describes a negative temperature trend, makes the major contribution to the overall variability. For winter, the leading mode is associated with the North Atlantic oscillation. For summer, a significant contribution of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation and the index of the Arctic sea ice concentration anomalies is revealed, which can be used to improve the reliability of the future scenarios of the regional climate change. The results suggest a significant impact of natural climatic variability on the temperature regime and a possible difficulty in identifying the anthropogenic component of climate change in the studied region. © 2019 г.","","Brightness temperature; Climatic indices; Empirical-orthogonal components method; Linear correlation; Remote sensing; Southern Ural","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067234076"

To optimize planning and minimize impact of inadvertent oil spills, oil-in-ice experiments were performed at the HSVA Arctic Environmental Test Basin (AETB) from 14 March to 4 April 2017. Following an under-ice spill and simulated springtime warming, the microscopic movement and distribution of oil in the sea ice pore space as well as the detectability of oil as it approaches the surface were investigated. Two ice types were studied simultaneously, i.e., columnar ice with and without a granular ice surface layer. Among the detection techniques were electromagnetic (radar, tomographic SAR) and optical (fluorescent, hyperspectral, thermal) sensors, and microscopic distribution of oil in sea ice were determined through X-ray computed tomography (CT). This paper presents the setup of the experiment and general ice properties. It was found that the movement of oil differed considerably between the investigated ice types. Predicting the behavior of oil in ice based on environmental conditions will help optimize the approaches used in spill detection and response. © 2019, Lulea University of Technology.

Recently, researchers noticed that humans and animals learn much better when the examples are organized in a meaningful order, and proposed Self-Paced Boost Learning (SPBL) to simulate the process. Inspired by this, we proposed a novel sea ice change detection method based on SPBL. First, log-ratio operator is utilized for difference image generation. Then, a hierarchical fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is employed to select reliable samples. Finally, based upon these samples, SPBL is employed to classify pixels from the original SAR images into unchanged and changed class.

The ability of these warm waters to reach glacier termini is strongly controlled by fjord bathymetry, which was unmapped for the majority of Greenland's fjords until recently. In response to the need for bathymetric measurements in previously uncharted areas, we developed two companion methods to infer fjord bathymetry using icebergs as depth sounders. The main premise of our methods centers around the idea that deep-drafted icebergs will become stranded in shallow water such that estimates of iceberg surface elevation can be used to infer draft, and thus water depth, under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. When and where available, surface elevations of icebergs stranded on bathymetric highs were extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs) and converted to estimates of iceberg draft. To expand the spatial coverage of our inferred water depths beyond the DEM footprints, we used the DEMs to construct characteristic depth-width ratios and then inferred depths from satellite imagery-derived iceberg widths. We tested and applied the methods in two fjord systems in western Greenland with partially constrained bathymetry, Ilulissat Isfjord and Naajarsuit Fjord, to demonstrate their utility for inferring bathymetry using remote sensing datasets. Our results show that while the uncertainties associated with the methods are high (up to ±93 m), they provide critical first-order constraints on fjord bathymetry. © 2019 by the authors.","Bathymetry; Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Characteristic depths; Digital elevation model; Greenland Ice Sheet; Hydrostatic equilibrium; Ice-ocean interactions; Icebergs; Optical imagery; Surface elevations; Hydrographic surveys","Bathymetry; Digital elevation models; Ice-ocean interactions; Icebergs; Optical imagery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065014990"

When the northerly wind flows across the Bellingshausen sea, it warms the air in the Antarctic Peninsula region which increases the Sea Surface Temperature and thus reduces the Sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea.

Because of its high spatial resolution, repeat time and very long period of activity, SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) on board of MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) geostationary platform, allows us to perform accurate retrieval of these parameters. To take advantage of the data information content, a Kalman filter methodology was developed and implemented for the the simultaneous retrieval of surface emissivity and temperature from SEVIRI infrared radiance measurements (channels at 8.7, 10.8 and 12 μm). That developed is one of the very few physical based approaches for the estimation of surface parameters from infrared instruments on board geostationary platforms and it has shown an accuracy of ±0.005 and ±0.2 K, for surface emissivity and temperature respectively. Based on this Kalman filter methodology a L2 processor has been developed to provide epsilon and Ts in real time, making it very attractive for application in different fields. The processor was applied and tested comparing its results with other satellites retrievals and analysis and here has been applied to the retrieval of Sea surface temperature retrieval of Mediterranean Basin for the years 2013-2017.

The areas around the strong westerly wind belt are characterized by significant sea spray contributions to the total particle and CCN number concentrations in the MBL. Future work will link detailed wave and wind observations to sea spray production. In the Ross and Amundsen Sea polynyas (leg 2), biogenic emissions appear to play an important role for CCN abundance. There are a number of open questions associated with this observation. First, even though this particular region was probed during a phytoplankton bloom period, it was not the only region with microbial activity but showed the clearest link to high CCN concentrations. Hence, either DMS production from dimethylsulfoniopropionate in the water and/or DMS fluxes into the atmosphere were enhanced. Second, the major pathway of how MSA is added to the particle phase remains to be identified. There are two possibilities: It can condense from the gas into the particle phase, or it can be added during cloud processing. The latter process would be consistent with the reduced efficiency of wet removal because of droplet evaporation or snowflake sublimation in the cold and dry airmasses from Antarctica. Our results also indicate that the absence of MSA-related processes in the aerosol model could explain the underestimation of CCN concentration, particularly in high aerosol-MSA regions. Given that the number of CCN influence Nd, this is an important issue to solve, especially close to the coast of Antarctica where clouds could impact the surface snow mass balance by influencing both the surface energy budget and precipitation. Further studies are planned that more closely investigate the linkages between CCN number concentrations and model simulations that take DMS emissions fluxes and particle phase MSA into account. A comparison of satellite-retrieved Nd90 and ship-based measurements of CCN shows a clear underestimation of CCN from remote sensing, even for coupled cloud cases. This is a strong indication of the importance of surface sources as opposed to the free troposphere for particle origin. Further investigation is underway to understand the cause of the discrepancy between the remote sensing and in situ measurements. We did not find direct evidence for new particle formation as an important source of CCN. However, some nucleation events were observed and a nucleation mode was present in the clustered particle size distributions. A dedicated study will investigate the gases involved in these events and the fate of the nucleation mode in the atmosphere. Our ice nucleating particle findings suggest that concentrations are lower than in Northern Hemisphere marine airmasses and that concentrations decreased from summer toward fall with only small differences between open-ocean and coastal Antarctic samples. The ACE-SPACE INP concentrations are also consistent with findings of a recent study in the Southern Ocean (McCluskey et al. 2018a), but much lower than results from several decades ago (Bigg 1973). More detailed studies including information on potential island effects, long-range transport and fluorescent and microbial particles are underway. The ACE-SPACE project is motivated by the idea of constraining uncertainty in anthropogenic radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions through measurement of preindustrial-like aerosol-cloud interactions. We have shown that the in situ data are suitable for constraining the aerosol model for preindustrial-like conditions. After a detailed model-measurement comparison, we will use the aerosol model to further constrain uncertainties of global radiative forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.","Aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Budget control; Nucleation; Particle size; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Space optics; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol-cloud interaction; Dimethylsulfoniopropionate; Long range transport; Microbial activities; New particle formation; Northern Hemispheres; Number concentration; Surface energy budget; Neodymium compounds","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074602846"

Thus, the recently proposed compact polarimetric (CP) SAR configuration for Earth observation could be a compromised choice for operational sea ice observation. This configuration will be included in the future RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM).

For object detection (e.g., ship, sea ice, and drilling platform) in maritime monitoring which has been widely discussed, it is still a challenge to eliminate the false alarms caused by ocean clutter. Accordingly, a modified feature-based framework for ship detection using CP SAR data was proposed in this paper. In particular, a Guard-filter was used after feature extraction to reduce the effect of ocean clutter. Several simulated CP SAR imageries based on Gaofen-3 quad-polarization SAR image were selected for further investigations on ship detection. A SVM classifier was included in the framework to do a pixel-wise classification. The result shows that the proposed method has a better performance compared to traditional methods (e.g., constant false alarm rate and polarimetric whitening filter) and the feature–based method without filtering. Overall false alarm rates are decreased by 35% with the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.","Alarm systems; Clutter (information theory); Errors; Feature extraction; Geology; Image resolution; Object detection; Polarimeters; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Ships; Synthetic aperture radar; False alarms; Gaofen-3; Guard-filter; Polarimetric SAR; Ship detection; Radar imaging","Compact polarimetric SAR; False alarm; Gaofen-3; Guard-filter; Ship detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064182166"

The MultiSpectral Instrument on board the Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites of the European Space Agency offers new possibilities for Arctic research; S-2A and S-2B provide 13 spectral bands between 443 and 2,202 nm and spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m, which may enable the monitoring of large areas of Arctic sea ice. For an accurate retrieval of parameters such as surface albedo, the elimination of atmospheric influences in the data is essential. We therefore provide an evaluation of five currently available atmospheric correction processors for S-2 (ACOLITE, ATCOR, iCOR, Polymer, and Sen2Cor). We evaluate the results of the different processors using in situ spectral measurements of ice and snow and open water gathered north of Svalbard during RV Polarstern cruise PS106.1 in summer 2017. We used spectral shapes to assess performance for ice and snow surfaces. For open water, we additionally evaluated intensities. ACOLITE, ATCOR, and iCOR performed well over sea ice and Polymer generated the best results over open water. ATCOR, iCOR and Sen2Cor failed in the image-based retrieval of atmospheric parameters (aerosol optical thickness, water vapor). ACOLITE estimated AOT within the uncertainty range of AERONET measurements. Parameterization based on external data, therefore, was necessary to obtain reliable results. To illustrate consequences of processor selection on secondary products we computed average surface reflectance of six bands and normalized difference melt index (NDMI) on an image subset. Medians of average reflectance and NDMI range from 0.80–0.97 to 0.12–0.18 while medians for TOA are 0.75 and 0.06, respectively. © 2019 König, Hieronymi and Oppelt.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Reflection; Remote sensing; Snow; Space optics; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical thickness; Arctic; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric parameters; Multispectral instruments; Multispectral remote sensing; Normalized differences; Sentinel-2; atmospheric correction; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel; snow; Sea ice","Arctic; Atmospheric correction; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064226484"

Bulk reflectance, absorptance and transmittance are further influenced by grain size (for snow), bubbles (for glacier ice and lake ice) and brine inclusions (for sea ice). Radiative transfer models for clouds can also be applied to snow; the important differences in their radiative properties are that clouds are optically thinner and contain smaller ice crystals than snow. Absorption of visible and near-ultraviolet radiation by ice is so weak that absorption of sunlight at these wavelengths in natural snow is dominated by trace amounts of light-absorbing impurities such as dust and soot. In the thermal infrared, ice is moderately absorptive, so snow is nearly a blackbody, with emissivity 98-99%. The absorption spectrum of liquid water resembles that of ice from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. At longer wavelengths they diverge, so microwave emission can be used to detect snowmelt on ice sheets, and to discriminate between sea ice and open water, by remote sensing. Snow and ice are transparent to radio waves, so radar can be used to infer ice-sheet thickness.

However, few observation sites in the Arctic have yet to link decadal-scale erosion rates with changing environmental conditions due to temporal data gaps. This study increases the temporal fidelity of coastal permafrost bluff observations using near-annual high spatial resolution (<1 m) satellite imagery acquired between 2008-2017 for a 9 km segment of coastline at Drew Point, Beaufort Sea coast, Alaska. Our results show that mean annual erosion for the 2007-2016 decade was 17.2 m yr-1, which is 2.5 times faster than historic rates, indicating that bluff erosion at this site is likely responding to changes in the Arctic System. In spite of a sustained increase in decadal-scale mean annual erosion rates, mean open water season erosion varied from 6.7 m yr-1 in 2010 to more than 22.0 m yr-1 in 2007, 2012, and 2016. This variability provided a range of coastal responses through which we explored the different roles of potential environmental drivers. The lack of significant correlations between mean open water season erosion and the environmental variables compiled in this study indicates that we may not be adequately capturing the environmental forcing factors, that the system is conditioned by long-term transient effects or extreme weather events rather than annual variability, or that other not yet considered factors may be responsible for the increased erosion occurring at Drew Point. Our results highlight an increase in erosion at Drew Point in the 21st century as well as the complexities associated with unraveling the factors responsible for changing coastal permafrost bluffs in the Arctic. © 2018 The Author(s).

A rapid growth in a short time cause the appearance of blooms which can long-term impact marine ecosystem and fisheries. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations, the proxy pigment of phytoplankton biomass, is measured with conventional in-situ analysis methods and retrieved from satellite observations. Currently, remotely sensed ocean color data constitute a rich and important spatiotemporal database that has been exploited in many scientific studies and has been shown to be relevant in phytoplankton dynamic metrics. Here in this study, we analyze 11 years of ocean color observations, MERIS (2003-2012) and MODIS (2012-2013) archives, over Algerian coasts in order to compute the chl-a concentrations corresponding to the start and end of bloom event. The determination is based on one of the most used definition of bloom in pelagic ocean, when chl-a concentrations rise above and fall below the full time series median for each pixel plus 5%. Satellite data were preprocessed considering flags to eliminate contaminated pixels, land, cloud and open water pixels. Spatial distribution mapping of results was done showing that the highest magnitudes are concentrated near the coasts. For statistical comparison purpose, the shelf waters were divided into six regions, limited from north by the 1000 m bathymetric curve and from south by Algerian coastline. The east and west limits for each region are chosen considering the marine meteorological regions. This study highlights for the first time the spatial distribution, at high resolution (250 m), of bloom initiation magnitudes along Algerian shelf waters, taking into account the influence of important wadis (small Mediterranean river) flowing there, the marine meteorology and north Algeria pluviometry. Statistics, particularly means, based on the proposed regions, seems to be relevant because they are consistent with the dominant regional pluviometry. In fact, the precipitation causes a runoff of the lands and this flow enters the sea loaded with nutrients. The obtained values can be used to determine the bloom start timing and others phenological parameters. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Arid regions; Color; Ecosystems; Hydrophilicity; Meteorology; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Pixels; Radiometers; Runoff; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spatial distribution; bloom; MERIS; MODIS; Ocean color; Ocean color observations; Photosynthetic organisms; Spatio-temporal database; Statistical comparisons; Remote sensing","Algerian coasts; bloom; MERIS; MODIS; ocean color; phytoplankton; remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056458418"

An important part of this work consists in building a database of oil and water-in-oil emulsion reflectance. This database of spectral signatures will be used to analyze the properties of a slick thanks to hyperspectral imagery in the VNIR+SWIR domain and spectral matching techniques. The characterization of the hydrocarbons performed first in laboratory has been completed with a pool experiment. The aim of such an experiment is to measure more realistic spectral signatures in term of background and thickness than in laboratory. Starting from the sample of the emulsion released at sea during NOFO 2015 experiment, emulsion has been remixed once for laboratory measurements and second for the pool experiment. Indeed, its reflectance was measured in the laboratory but for a quite large thickness and it was difficult to predict how the thickness would be once the emulsion freely spread at the water surface. Moreover, depending on the thickness, a signature mixing emulsion and water background could be obtained. In such case, the signatures measured in the lab and in the pool may differ significantly. As a consequence, the use of spectral signature measured in laboratory may give poor spectral matching results. In order to get the answers, a pool experiment, piloted by ONERA in the frame of the NAOMI collaboration with TOTAL, was organized at CEDRE in Brest (France). CEDRE's pool is usually used for oil recovery equipment testing or people operating such equipment training. Thus, the pool is large (1900 m2), fairly deep (3 m) and filled with ocean water. Known volumes of several products, including the NOFO 2015 emulsion, were successively poured into a delimited area within the pool. Two hyperspectral cameras put on board a cherry picker located on the pool quay were lifted at about 15 m above the delimited area in order to take images of each small spill. The obtained spectral signatures have been compared with the laboratory ones. Detection algorithms have been applied to the pool hypercubes in order to identify the pixels covered by the NOFO 2015 emulsion and a thickness assessment has been performed. A wide characterization of the NOFO2015 emulsion has been done thanks to laboratory measurements, in pool experiment and airborne images from the NOFO campaign in 2015. The paper will present the pool experiment and the corresponding image processing. A quick recall of the laboratory measurements will be done before presenting the pool and laboratory spectral signatures comparison. Then the spectral signatures will be compared with data from an airborne image of the 2015 NOFO campaign. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn concerning the information that can be extracted from hyperspectral airborne imagery for such kind of emulsion and more generally. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Emulsification; Emulsions; Equipment testing; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Image processing; Offshore oil well production; Reflection; Remote sensing; Research laboratories; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Hyper-spectral cameras; Hyper-spectral imageries; Hyperspectral signatures; Laboratory measurements; Spectral matching techniques; Spectral matchings; Spectral signature; Water in oil emulsions; Lakes","hydrocarbon index; Hydrocarbons detection; hydrocarbons spectral signature; offshore remote sensing; spectral matching; water-in-oil emulsion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056457208"

They remain extremely under-sampled due to the coarse nature of traditional point sampling methods compounded by the general logistical limitations of surveying in polar regions. This study provides a first assessment of hyperspectral imaging as an under-ice remote-sensing method to capture sea-ice algae biomass spatial variability at the ice/water interface. Ice-algal cultures were inoculated in a unique inverted sea-ice simulation tank at increasing concentrations over designated cylinder enclosures and sparsely across the ice/water interface. Hyperspectral images of the sea ice were acquired with a pushbroom sensor attaining 0.9 mm square pixel spatial resolution for three different spectral resolutions (1.7, 3.4, 6.7 nm). Image analysis revealed biomass distribution matching the inoculated chlorophyll a concentrations within each cylinder. While spectral resolutions >6 nm hindered biomass differentiation, 1.7 and 3.4 nm were able to resolve spatial variation in ice algal biomass implying a coherent sensor selection. The inverted ice tank provided a suitable sea-ice analogue platform for testing key parameters of the methodology. The results highlight the potential of hyperspectral imaging to capture sea-ice algal biomass variability at unprecedented scales in a non-invasive way. © The Author(s) 2017.","algae; biomass; experimental study; ice alga; image resolution; imaging method; pixel; remote sensing; sea ice; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; underwater camera","hyperspectral imaging; ice algae; ice tank; remote sensing; sea ice; under-ice environment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042041541"

Leads regulate the heat, gas and moisture fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere and are areas of high ice growth rates during periods of freezing conditions. Here, an algorithm providing an automatic lead detection based on synthetic aperture radar images is described that can be applied to a wide range of Sentinel-1 scenes. By using both the HH and the HV channels instead of single co-polarised observations the algorithm is able to classify more leads correctly. The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision-recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification. The algorithm is able to produce a lead classification with more that 90% precision with 60% of all leads classified. The precision can be increased by the cost of the amount of leads detected.

Between November 2015 and March 2016, we find a consistent drop of cumulative freezing degree days across the Arctic, with a negative peak anomaly of about 1000 degree days in the Barents Sea, coinciding with an Arctic-wide average thinning of 10 cm in March with respect to the 6 year average. In particular, the loss of ice volume is associated with a significant decline of March first-year ice volume by 13%. This reveals that due to the loss of multiyear ice during previous years, the Arctic ice cover becomes more sensitive to climate anomalies. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

Each mission has provided unique, but sometimes conflicting, insights into the mass trends of land ice. Over the last decade, over fifty estimates of land ice trends have been published, providing a confusing and often inconsistent picture. The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) attempted to synthesise estimates published up to early 2013. Since then, considerable advances have been made in understanding the origin of the inconsistencies, reducing uncertainties in estimates and extending time series. We assess and synthesise results published, primarily, since the AR5, to produce a consistent estimate of land ice mass trends during the satellite era (1992-2016). We combine observations from multiple missions and approaches including sea level budget analyses. Our resulting synthesis is both consistent and rigorous, drawing on (i) the published literature, (ii) expert assessment of that literature, and (iii) a new analysis of Arctic glacier and ice cap trends combined with statistical modelling. We present annual and pentad (five-year mean) time series for the East, West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets and glaciers separately and combined. When averaged over pentads, covering the entire period considered, we obtain a monotonic trend in mass contribution to the oceans, increasing from 0.31 ± 0.35 mm of sea level equivalent for 1992-1996 to 1.85 ± 0.13 for 2012-2016. Our integrated land ice trend is lower than many estimates of GRACE-derived ocean mass change for the same periods. This is due, in part, to a smaller estimate for glacier and ice cap mass trends compared to previous assessments. We discuss this, and other likely reasons, for the difference between GRACE ocean mass and land ice trends. © 2018 The Author(s).

Here we demonstrate a new way to quantitatively estimate aerosol indirect effects on a regional scale from remote sensing observations. In this study, we focus on nighttime, optically thin, predominantly liquid clouds. The method is based on differences in cloud physical and microphysical characteristics in carefully selected clean, average, and aerosol-impacted conditions. The cloud subset of focus covers just g1/4 5g% of cloudy Arctic Ocean regions, warming the Arctic Ocean surface by g1/4g1-1.4gWgmg2 regionally during polar night. However, within this cloud subset, aerosol and cloud conditions can be determined with high confidence using CALIPSO and CloudSat data and model output. This cloud subset is generally susceptible to aerosols, with a polar nighttime estimated maximum regionally integrated indirect cooling effect of g1/4 g0.11gWgmg2 at the Arctic sea ice surface (g1/4g8g% of the clean background cloud effect), excluding cloud fraction changes. Aerosol presence is related to reduced precipitation, cloud thickness, and radar reflectivity, and in some cases, an increased likelihood of cloud presence in the liquid phase. These observations are inconsistent with a glaciation indirect effect and are consistent with either a deactivation effect or less-efficient secondary ice formation related to smaller liquid cloud droplets. However, this cloud subset shows large differences in surface and meteorological forcing in shallow and higher-altitude clouds and between sea ice and open-ocean regions. For example, optically thin, predominantly liquid clouds are much more likely to overlay another cloud over the open ocean, which may reduce aerosol indirect effects on the surface. Also, shallow clouds over open ocean do not appear to respond to aerosols as strongly as clouds over stratified sea ice environments, indicating a larger influence of meteorological forcing over aerosol microphysics in these types of clouds over the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean.","Arctic Ocean; aerosol; arctic environment; CALIPSO; climate forcing; cloud microphysics; CloudSat; energy budget; marine atmosphere; satellite data; surface energy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021167690"

For polar coastal oceans that are undergoing changes in sea ice cover and warming, light, and temperature are particularly important for bloom dynamics. Using colonial Phaeocystis antarctica cultures grown at steady-state, we assessed the combined effect of these two environmental controls on net growth rate (μn), chlorophyll-specific absorption of light ((Formula presented.) (λ)), and quantum yields for growth (ϕμ). Specific net growth rates (μn) varied from 0.04 to 0.34 day−1 within a matrix of light and temperature ranging from 14 to 542 μmol quanta m−2 s−1 and −1.5 to 4°C. Values of (Formula presented.) (λ) varied significantly with light but only slightly with temperature. Values of ϕμ ranged from 0.003 to 0.09 mol C (mol quanta absorbed)−1 with highest values at low light and 4°C. For excess irradiances or low temperatures where growth rate is inhibited, quantum yields were low. The low ϕμ values are attributed both to increased absorption by photoprotective pigments compared to photosynthetic pigments and thermodynamic control of dark reaction enzymes. The systematic changes in photophysiological properties of P. antarctica in relation to temperature and light were used to develop a series of nested light- and temperature-dependent models for μn, (Formula presented.) (λ), and ϕμ. A model for (Formula presented.) (300–700 nm) was developed that takes into account the systematic changes in (Formula presented.) (λ) due to pigment packaging effects and cellular concentrations of chlorophylls and photoprotective pigments. Also, a model for ϕμ was developed based on a cumulative one-hit Poisson probability function. These model parameterizations for absorption and quantum yield are combined into an overall model of net growth that can be applied easily to P. antarctica bloom dynamics using remote sensing data for temperature, light, and chlorophyll a. Furthermore, modeling based on the biophysical variables (Formula presented.) (λ), and ϕμ that are shown to regulate the growth rate provides a more fundamental mechanistic approach compared to other modeling methods that do not explicitly resolve photon flux into the cell or the quantum yield. © Copyright © 2018 Moisan and Mitchell.","","absorption; co-limitation; modeling; Phaeocystis; photophysiology; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; quantum yield","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098935127"

Using a combination of satellite remote sensing of phytoplankton biomass, in situ observations under sea ice from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and in vivo photophysiology, we examined the composition, magnitude and origin of a bloom detected beneath the sea ice Northwest of Svalbard (Southern Yermak Plateau) in May 2010. In situ concentration of up to 20 mg chlorophyll a [Chl a] m−3, were dominated by the northern planktonic spring species of diatoms, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, T. antarctica var. borealis, Chaetoceros socialisspecies complex and Fragilariopsis oceanica. These species were also found south of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Cells in the water column under the sea ice were typically high-light acclimated, with a mean light saturation index (Ek) of 138 μmol photons m−2 s−1 and a ratio between photoprotective carotenoids (PPC) and Chl a (w:w) of 0.2. Remotely sensed data of [Chl a] showed a 32,000 km2 bloom developing south of the MIZ. In effect, our data suggest that the observed under-ice bloom was in fact a bloom developed in open waters south of the ice edge, and that a combination of northward-flowing water masses and southward drifting sea ice effectively positioned the bloom under the sea ice. This have implications for our general understanding of under-ice blooms, suggesting that their origin and connection with open water may be different in different regions of the Arctic. © 2018, The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Yermak Plateau; algae; Bacillariophyta; Chaetoceros; Nitzschia oceanica; Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii; acclimation; advection; algal bloom; autonomous underwater vehicle; cell; chlorophyll a; fluorescence; ice alga; marginal ice zone; phytoplankton; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; species complex; spring (season)","Advection of cells; Arctic; Autonomous underwater vehicle; Chlorophyll a; Photoacclimation; Phytoplankton; Pulse amplitude modulated fluorescence (PAM); Satellite; Sea-ice algae; Under-ice bloom","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041922247"

This study investigates the feasibility of mediating semantic query and catalogue search together to allow more searchable parameters without any changes to the existing metadata database and catalogue service. Limitations of a catalogue's textual search capabilities are analyzed. A use case of searching for sea ice imagery using search criteria that are absent in the NASA ECHO (the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration EOS Clearing House) catalogue service is presented. An ontology dedicated for remotely sensed sea ice data collections is introduced. Details of a two-step hybrid metadata search model, i.e., collection-level discovery search enabled by ontology query, and granule-level inventory search fulfilled by catalogue service, are presented and evaluated. Our results show that this semantically enhanced catalogue search model could easily extend the existing catalogue service to allow more searchable parameters, and, at the same time, maintain a backward compatibility with them.

However, the existing studies are focused primarily on high latitude frozen seas, while studies on the long-Term variability of sea ice cover at middle latitudes are generally lacking. Afforded by continuous satellite imagery, evolution of sea ice cover over nearly three decades from 1988 to 2015 in the Bohai Sea as a peculiar mid-latitude frozen sea area is reported for the first time. An anomalous trend of slight overall increase of 1.38 ± 1.00% yr-1 (R = 1.38, i.e. at a statistical significance of 80%) in Bohai Sea ice extent was observed over the 28 year period. The detrended annual average ice area (AAIA) was further found to correlate with a slight decreasing mean ice-period average temperature (IAT, r =-0.58, p < 0.01) of 11 meteorological stations around the Bohai Sea as well as a mild increasing cumulative freezing degree days (CFDD, r = 0.65, p < 0.01). Correlation with decreasing Arctic Oscillation (AO) index (r =-0.60, p < 0.01) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (r =-0.69, p < 0.01) over the study period suggested AO and NAO as the primary large-scale climate factors for Bohai Sea ice. In addition, the seasonal cycle of ice cover showed a single peak with longer freezing phase than melting phase, due to the different temperature change rate during the freezing and melting phases. The results can provide important references for monitoring the recent climate change in the region and beyond. © 2017 The Author(s).

Total ice thickness including snow depth (htot) averaged over 2004-2008 is 95 cm. The interannual variability of htot is large; from 77.5 cm (2008) to 110.4 cm (2005). The mode of htot varies from 50-60 cm (2007 and 2008) to 70-80 cm (2005). Ice thickness derived from ICESat data is validated from a comparison with that observed by Electromagnetic Induction Instrument (EM) aboard the icebreaker Soya near Hokkaido, Japan. Annual maps of htot reveal that the spatial distribution of htot is similar every year. Ice volume of 6.3 × 1011 m3 is estimated from the ICESat derived htot and AMSR-E derived ice concentration. A comparison with ice area demonstrates that the ice volume cannot always be represented by the area solely, despite the fact that the area has been used as a proxy of the volume in the Sea of Okhotsk. The ice volume roughly corresponds to that of annual ice production in the major coastal polynyas estimated based on heat budget calculations. This also supports the validity of the estimation of sea-ice thickness and volume using ICESat data. © 2018 The Author(s).","Hokkaido; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk; estimation method; ice thickness; ICESat; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; spatial distribution","remote sensing; sea ice; sea-ice geophysics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045074618"

Second, a green-red index (GRI), which was calculated from the remote sensing reflectance at the three wavelengths (510, 560 and 620 nm), was used to retrieve the total absorption coefficients at the reference band, a(510). A semi-analytical model based on a(510) and the GRI was proposed to replace the empirical model in original QAA.

However, undersampling of SO biogeochemical properties limits our understanding of the mechanisms taking place in this remote area. The Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project has been deploying a large number of autonomous biogeochemical floats to study the SO (as of December 2016, 74 floats out of 200 have been deployed). SOCCOM floats measurements can be used to extend remote sensing chlorophyll a (chl a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) products under clouds or during the polar night as well as adding the depth dimension to the satellite-based view of the SO. Chlorophyll a concentrations measured by a sensor embedded on the floats and POC concentrations derived from backscattering coefficients were calibrated with samples collected during the floats' deployment cruise. Float chl a and POC were compared with products derived from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors. We find the Ocean Color Index (OCI) global algorithm to agree well with the matchups (within 9%, on average, for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and 12%, on average, for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Aqua (MODIS)). SO-specific algorithms estimating chl a are offset by ∼45% south of the Sea Ice Extent Front (∼60°S). In addition, POC estimates based on floats agree well with NASA's POC algorithm. © 2017.

The solutions are crucial to microwave remote sensing that requires the preservation of coherent phase information. The heterogeneous snowpack is represented as a bicontinuous medium. Effects of the underlying half-space are included through a half-space Green's function in a volume integral equation formulation. The volume integral equation is then solved using the discrete dipole approximation. The fast Fourier transform is effectuated for all three dimensions with half-space Green's function rather than the conventional free space Green's function. To overcome the snow volume truncation in the finite numerical calculations, periodic boundary conditions are applied in the lateral extent. Thus, in NMM3D, the physical microwave scattering and emission problem is solved without using any radiative transfer equations. In this formulation, the scattering matrix of the snowpack accounts for both the magnitude and phase. The NMM3D simulations are demonstrated at Ku-band frequency for a snow cover up to 25-cm thick. The results are applicable to remote sensing of snow over sea ice, and thin layers of terrestrial snow. Quantitative values of backscattering and bistatic scattering coefficients are derived for active microwave remote sensing, and brightness temperatures for passive microwave remote sensing. The full wave simulation results are compared with those of the partially coherent approach of the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT). The NMM3D results capture effects of backscattering enhancement and coherent layering that are missed in DMRT. The full wave solution to Maxwell equations is important to advance radar polarimetry, interferometry, and tomography that require the preservation of the full phase information and all interface interactions for applications to radar remote sensing of snow cover on land and on sea ice. © 2012 IEEE.","Backscattering; Coherent scattering; Fast Fourier transforms; Functions; Geometry; Green's function; Ice; Mathematical models; Maxwell equations; Microwaves; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Radar; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Scattering; Sea ice; Snow; Space optics; Space-based radar; Backscattering enhancement; Coherent layer; Dense media; Discrete dipole approximation; Full-wave simulations; Passive microwaves; S function; Volume integral equation; backscatter; boundary condition; brightness temperature; equation; Green function; microwave imagery; numerical model; radiative transfer; remote sensing; scattering; sea ice; snow cover; snowpack; three-dimensional modeling; Integral equations","Active and passive microwave; backscattering enhancement; coherent layer effects; dense media radiative transfer (DMRT); dense media scattering; discrete dipole approximation (DDA); full wave simulation; half-space Green's function; snow remote sensing; volume integral equation (VIE)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021834393"

Turbulence within stratocumulus is primarily driven by cloud top cooling that induces convective instability. Using a suite of in situ and remote sensing instruments we characterize turbulent mixing in Arctic stratocumulus, and for the first time we estimate profiles of the gradient Richardson number at relatively high resolution in both time (10 min) and altitude (10 m). It is found that the mixing occurs both within the cloud, as expected, and by wind shear instability near the surface. About 75% of the time these two layers are separated by a stably stratified inversion at 100–200 m altitude. Exceptions are associated with low cloud bases that allow the cloud-driven turbulence to reach the surface. The results imply that turbulent coupling between the surface and the cloud is sporadic or intermittent. ©2017.

The bloom onset provides a warning bell for possible changes in trophic interactions and biogeochemical processes. However, depicting the phenology of phytoplankton blooms at high latitudes, where long-term observations are sparse or unavailable, is not a straightforward task. A data-interpolating empirical orthogonal function algorithm was applied to daily satellite-retrieved chlorophyll-a images to produce a long-term (1998–2014) and cloud-free data set over the North Water (NOW) polynya. The seasonal bloom was modeled using a multi-Gaussian approach from which a baseline of phenological characteristics was extracted. The correlation analysis highlights the influence of environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, cloud fraction, wind stress, and sea-ice concentration, in modulating the bloom start date, its duration, and amplitude. The year-to-year variability in bloom onset appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between oceanographic and meteorological conditions. Blooms last longer during years characterized by a longer open-water period and are shorter during those characterized by greater sea-ice coverage. Noteworthy is the decrease in phytoplankton bloom amplitude over the 17 years examined. Collectively, these outcomes depict the NOW as a climate-sensitive region in which the pelagic marine ecosystem seems to be going toward a decline in chlorophyll-a concentrations. Satellite time series are still too short to differentiate between inter-annual variability, inter-decadal variability, and climate change signal. Should these changes persist; however, the NOW may no longer act as a productive regional oasis supporting thriving populations of zooplankton and top predators. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; North Water Polynya; annual variation; chlorophyll a; climate change; environmental conditions; environmental factor; Gaussian method; ice cover; marine ecosystem; pelagic ecosystem; phenology; phytoplankton; polynya; predator; remote sensing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; trophic interaction; zooplankton","Gaussian model; NOW polynya; Phenology; Physical forcing; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014174432"

Despite its requirement for thermodynamic sea ice modeling, measurement of melt pond areal coverage using satellite remote sensing has proven difficult due to significant spatiotemporal variability in the timing and evolution of melt ponds. Less than optimal results from prior studies employing a spectral mixture analysis (SMA) towards the determination of melt pond areal coverage from satellite remote sensing data provided the incentive for a multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) approach. The MESMA was performed on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using endmember spectra obtained from atmospherically corrected coincident high resolution imagery, surface observations and modeling. Results were validated against a high resolution Quickbird image acquired coincident to the MODIS image. The validation indicates that the best MESMA results provide consistent estimates of melt pond coverage for regions with high pond coverage (within 5% melt pond coverage) but overestimate pond fraction for regions with low pond coverage (by 10% or more). This may be due to deficiencies in the representation of sea ice surfaces within the endmember library used, oversimplified modeling of the ice surface and shortcomings in the validation process. However, it is assumed that with further refinement, the MESMA technique could allow for reliable estimates of the areal coverage of sea ice melt ponds using low resolution (large spatial coverage) optical satellite imagery under a wide variety of spatiotemporal pond evolution and fraction conditions. © 2017","Arctic; Lakes; Mixtures; Ponds; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Melt ponds; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; Quickbird; Satellite remote sensing data; Spatiotemporal variability; Thermodynamic sea ice model; albedo; measurement method; melting; model validation; MODIS; optimization; quantitative analysis; QuickBird; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; thermodynamics; Ice","Melt ponds; MODIS; QuickBird; Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034714175"

Many sensors can be employed to generate detections of sea ice, such as satellite-carried Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and, recently, imagery equipment carried by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).

Using UAS, the resolution and precision of the tracking can be locally improved.

However, the correlation and redundancy among hyperspectral bands reduce the accuracy of traditional sea ice detection methods. Based on the spectral characteristics of sea ice, this study presents an improved similarity measurement method based on linear prediction (ISMLP) to detect sea ice. First, the first original band with a large amount of information is determined based on mutual information theory. Subsequently, a second original band with the least similarity is chosen by the spectral correlation measuring method. Finally, subsequent bands are selected through the linear prediction method, and a support vector machine classifier model is applied to classify sea ice. In experiments performed on images of Baffin Bay and Bohai Bay, comparative analyses were conducted to compare the proposed method and traditional sea ice detection methods. Our proposed ISMLP method achieved the highest classification accuracies (91.18% and 94.22%) in both experiments. From these results the ISMLP method exhibits better performance overall than other methods and can be effectively applied to hyperspectral sea ice detection. © 2017 by the authors.

Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators. © 2017 Inter-Research.","Southern Ocean; algae; Aves; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea; Mammalia; Procellariidae; Procellariiformes; Thalassoica antarctica; age structure; chlorophyll a; crustacean; foraging behavior; grazing; heterogeneity; phenology; primary production; profitability; sea ice; seabird; vertical distribution","Area-restricted search; Euphausia superba; Marginal ice zone; Phytoplankton biomass; Procellariiformes; Sea ice dynamics; Southern Ocean; Thalassoica antarctica","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020397318"

In addition to Cryosphere applications, this mission is of great interest to the Hydrosphere and Oceanographic communities since it allows for quantitative assessment of expected enhanced altimetric capabilities in coastal monitoring, ocean floor topography, gravity field and inland water monitoring. The CS-2 main payload is a Synthetic aperture Interferometric Radar ALtimeter (SIRAL) operating in three different modes, including the SAR interferometric mode (SARin). In the work described in this paper, dedicated algorithms are developed for exploiting SARin mode for enhancing the sea level mapping at coastal regions. When operating in SARin mode the altimeter measurements allow for the derivation of the across-track Angle of Arrival (AoA), and so the reflection points at any range bin can be geolocated. In coastal altimetry, land contamination highly degrades the backscattered echo. This is sometimes, overcome with the SARM when tracks are perpendicular to the coast, since this mode provides an along-track resolution enhancement with respect to LRM mode due to the different footprints shapes (LRM is circular, while SARM is a stripe of the same wide across track but only around 300 m along track). However, across-track interferences still remain an issue in coastal altimetry and SARin mode can provide a solution for their mitigation. This paper proposes two different solutions for the improvement of SSH retrievals in coastal zones starting from L1b SARin products, developing post-L1b algorithms. The first solution is based in the use of the AoA. The second solution goes beyond SARin mode, and provides an algorithm for all operational modes, based in the historical window delay within a coastal track section. For both options, a sub-waveform approach is considered for the waveforms cleaning and retracking. In addition, a SAR L2 retracker inherited from the SAMOSA model is adapted to SARin. The results are analyzed and the potential improvements are assessed with respect to SARin data retracker by the CS-2 ground processor. A dedicated CS-2 SARin area (mask) covering the Cuban archipelago has been created for this investigation. A land-sea mask has been created from the Open Street Map high resolution catalogue for this study.

Detection of small icebergs floating in nonhomegeous sea clutter environments is a challenging task in remote sensing. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for automatic identification of icebergs in high-resolution polarimetric SAR images acquired during different seasons. This involves adapting the algorithm to sea-ice conditions, and facing challenges when it comes to high iceberg density, meteorological and oceanographic phenomena in the marginal ice zone causing heterogeneity in the background clutter.

The satellite observed and retrieved sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud/radiation properties over the Arctic (70°-90°N) have been used to investigate the impact of springtime cloud and radiation properties on September SIC variation. Positive trends of cloud fractions, cloud water paths, and surface downward longwave flux at the surface over the September sea ice retreat areas are found over the period of 1 March to 14 May, while negative trends are found over the period of 15 May to 28 June. The spatial distributions of correlations between springtime cloud/radiation properties and September SIC have been calculated, indicating that increasing cloud fractions and downward longwave flux during springtime tend to enhance sea ice melting due to strong cloud warming effect. Surface downward and upward shortwave fluxes play an important role from May to June when the onset of sea ice melting occurs. The comparison between linearly detrended and nondetrended of each parameter indicates that significant impact of cloud and radiation properties on September sea ice retreat occurs over the Chukchi/Beaufort Sea at interannual time scale, especially over the period of 31 March to 29 April, while strongest climatological trends are found over the Laptev/Siberian Sea. © 2017.

It acts to regulate regional heat and freshwater budgets and subsequent atmospheric and oceanic circulation across the Arctic and at lower latitudes. Satellites have observed a decline in Arctic sea ice extent for all months since 1979. However, to fully understand how changes in the Arctic sea ice cover impact on our global weather and climate, long-term and accurate observations of its thickness distribution are also required. Such observations were made possible with the launch of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) CryoSat-2 satellite in April 2010, which provides unparalleled coverage of the Arctic Ocean up to 88°N. Here we provide an end-to-end, comprehensive description of the data processing steps employed to estimate Northern Hemisphere sea ice thickness and subsequent volume using CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data and complementary observations. This is a sea ice processor that has been under constant development at the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling (CPOM) since the early 1990s. We show that there is no significant bias in our satellite sea ice thickness retrievals when compared with independent measurements. We also provide a detailed analysis of the uncertainties associated with our sea ice thickness and volume estimates by considering the independent sources of error in the retrieval. Each month, the main contributors to the uncertainty are snow depth and snow density, which suggests that a crucial next step in Arctic sea ice research is to develop improved estimates of snow loading. In this paper we apply our theory and methods solely to CryoSat-2 data in the Northern Hemisphere.

The OSI SAF scatterometer products, produced at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, provide superior comparison to both buoy and numerical weather prediction (NWP) datasets. Moreover, the wind processing software is publicly available through the EUMETSAT NWP SAF. An increasing amount of users employs scatterometer wind data for climate studies. However, the wind retrieval algorithms have been continuously improved over the years and the currently existing archives of near-real-time data are not always suitable to fulfill the need for homogeneous datasets spanning a longer period of time. Currently, only few validated vector wind climate datasets are available. Therefore, the OSI SAF is reprocessing several offline datasets. This paper is focusing on two climate data records from SeaWinds and ASCAT winds, which together span the period from 1999 to 2014. The data are compared to the NWP model and buoy winds. The stability of the wind characteristics is assessed and an attempt is made to attribute temporal changes to climatological and NWP model changes over time. © 2017 IEEE.","Geodetic satellites; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Space optics; Space stations; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Wind; Climate; European remote sensing satellites; International Space stations; Numerical weather prediction; Ocean surface winds; Radar remote sensing; Satellite application facilities; Scatterometers; ASCAT; buoy system; climate modeling; climatology; numerical model; radar; remote sensing; scatterometer; SeaWinds; surface wind; weather forecasting; Meteorological instruments","Climate; ocean surface wind; radar remote sensing; scatterometer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019972761"

C-band SAR imagery is regarded as an optimal choice for sea ice applications; however, other SAR frequencies has not been extensively assessed. In this study, we evaluate the potential of fully polarimetric L-band SAR imagery for monitoring and classifying sea ice during dry winter conditions compared to fully polarimetric C-band SAR. Twelve polarimetric SAR parameters are derived using sets of C- and L-band SAR imagery and the capabilities of the derived parameters for the discrimination between First Year Ice (FYI) and Old Ice (OI), which is considered to be a mixture of Second Year Ice (SYI) and Multiyear Ice (MYI), are investigated. Feature vectors of effective C- and L-band polarimetric parameters are extracted and used for sea ice classification. Results indicate that C-band SAR provides high classification accuracy (98.99%) of FYI and OI in comparison to the obtained accuracy using L-band SAR (82.17% and 81.85%), as expected. However, L-band SAR was found to classify only the MYI floes as OI, while merging both FYI and SYI into one separate class. This comes in contrary to C-band SAR, which classifies as OI both MYI and SYI. This indicates a new potential for discriminating SYI from MYI by combining C- and L-band SAR in dry ice winter conditions. © 2017 by the author.","Carbon dioxide; Classification (of information); Ice; Polarimeters; Refrigerants; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification accuracy; Derived parameters; L-band SAR; Polarimetric parameters; Polarimetric SAR; Sea ice classification; Second-year ices; Winter conditions; Radar imaging","Classification; L-band SAR; Polarimetric parameters; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038208575"

Climate-induced changes in primary production and production at higher trophic levels also have been observed in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas. Satellite ocean color observations could enable the monitoring of relatively long term patterns in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations that would serve as an indicator of phytoplankton biomass. The performance of existing global and regional Chl-a algorithms for satellite ocean color data was investigated in the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea using in situ optical measurements from the Healy 2007 cruise. The model-derived Chl-a data using the previous Chl-a algorithms present striking uncertainties regarding Chl-a concentrations – for example, overestimation in lower Chl-a concentrations or systematic overestimation in the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea. Accordingly, a simple two band ratio (Rrs(443)/Rrs(555)) algorithm of Chl-a for the satellite ocean color data was devised for the northeastern Bering Sea and southern Chukchi Sea. The MODIS-derived Chl-a data from July 2002 to December 2014 were produced using the new Chl-a algorithm to investigate the seasonal and interannual variations of Chl-a in the northern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi Sea. The seasonal distribution of Chl-a shows that the highest (spring bloom) Chl-a concentrations are in May and the lowest are in July in the overall area. Chl-a concentrations relatively decreased in June, particularly in the open ocean waters of the Bering Sea. The Chl-a concentrations start to increase again in August and become quite high in September. In October, Chl-a concentrations decreased in the western area of the Study area and the Alaskan coastal waters. Strong interannual variations are shown in Chl-a concentrations in all areas. There is a slightly increasing trend in Chl-a concentrations in the northern Bering Strait (SECS). This increasing trend may be related to recent increases in the extent and duration of open waters due to the early break up of sea ice and the late formation of sea ice in the Chukchi Sea. © 2018, Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Arctic Ocean; Bering Sea; Chukchi Sea; Pacific Ocean; Animalia; Aves; Mammalia; Pisces; algorithm; biomass; chlorophyll a; climate change; concentration (composition); MODIS; ocean color; phytoplankton; primary production; remote sensing","Bering sea; chlorophyll-a; Chukchi sea; ocean color remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042940403"

During three weeks in February 2017, a first field campaign was carried out over the sea ice of the Bothnian Bay in the vicinity of the Finnish island of Hailuoto. Observations were based on ground-based eddy-covariance (EC), automatic weather stations (AWS) and remote-sensing instrumentation as well as more than 150 flight missions by several different Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) during mostly stable and very stable boundary layer conditions. The structure of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and above could be resolved at a very high vertical resolution, especially close to the ground, by combining surface-based measurements with UAV observations, i.e., multicopter and fixed-wing profiles up to 200magl and 1800magl, respectively. Repeated multicopter profiles provided detailed information on the evolution of the SBL, in addition to the continuous SODAR and LIDAR wind measurements. The paper describes the campaign and the potential of the collected data set for future SBL research and focuses on both the UAV operations and the benefits of complementing established measurement methods by UAV measurements to enable SBL observations at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. © 2018 by the authors.","Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Bothnian Bay; Finland; Gulf of Bothnia; Hailuoto; Pohjois-Pohjanmaa; Antennas; Arctic vehicles; Atmospheric structure; Fighter aircraft; Fixed wings; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Turbulence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Weather information services; Wind power; Arctic; In-situ observations; Polar; Remotely piloted aircraft; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; aerial survey; aircraft; arctic environment; boundary layer; complexity; ground-based measurement; remote sensing; remotely operated vehicle; sea ice; turbulence; unmanned vehicle; Atmospheric boundary layer","Arctic; Boundary layer remote sensing; Ground-based in-situ observations; Polar; Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS); Sea ice; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; Turbulence; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050220801"

Effects of wind, total water vapor, liquid water path, and surface temperature on the TBs are evaluated through a radiative transfer model. TBs of open ocean yield higher sensitivity to the atmospheric water due to its low emissivity, whereas that of sea ice is more influenced by the surface conditions such as temperature and ice type. The weather effects are corrected by simulating changes in TBs caused by the atmospheric water absorption/emission and wind roughened ocean surface using numerical weather prediction reanalysis data fields as atmospheric profiles. ASI2 is validated on a collection of AMSR-E observations over open water and 100% SIC. The correction significantly reduces the standard deviation and bias of SIC over open water, yet yields little change over 100% SIC. Combined with an improved weather filter based on the corrected TBs at lower frequencies, ASI2 allows retrieval of low ice concentration and resolves a more exact ice concentration gradient across the ice edge compared to the original ASI algorithm. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Meteorology; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Silicon carbide; Water absorption; Weather forecasting; Arctic regions; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric measurement; Atmospheric model; Brightness temperatures; Numerical weather prediction; Polarization difference; Radiative transfer model; algorithm; AMSR-E; atmospheric correction; brightness temperature; concentration (composition); remote sensing; sea ice; Atmospheric temperature","Arctic regions; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043401675"

We used remotely sensed sea-ice concentration data for Baffin Bay, Canada, and satellite telemetry for adult female polar bears in the 1990s (n = 43) and 2000s (n = 38) to assess whether sea-ice habitat changes have influenced movements and habitat selection. Both the timing and availability of sea-ice habitat changed significantly between the 1990s and 2000s. Mean sea-ice concentration in June-October declined from 22 to 12%. Spring sea-ice retreat occurred 2 wk earlier and fall sea-ice advance 2 wk later in the 2000s. These changes translated directly to changes in habitat use by polar bears. In the 2000s, bears used significantly lower sea-ice concentrations in winter and spring. Also, bears were significantly closer to land in all months, except at the end of spring breakup when they remained on offshore sea ice as long as possible, likely to maximize foraging time prior to coming on land where they are largely food deprived. The presence of summer offshore sea ice facilitated broad movement of bears in the 1990s; however, this ice disappeared in the 2000s and resulted in significant declines in monthly movement rates. In the 2000s, adult females selected for lower sea-ice concentrations if they facilitated access to the continental shelf (< 300 m). Our findings indicate that significant changes in available sea-ice habitat and habitat use in Baffin Bay have occurred since the mid-1990s and this subpopulation will likely experience negative population-level impacts related to a changing climate in the coming decades. In some other parts of the Arctic, such changes have preceded negative nutritional and demographic impacts. © The authors 2018.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Canada; Greenland; Ursus maritimus; bear; geographical distribution; habitat selection; population structure; remote sensing; resource selection; sea ice; spring (season); telemetry; winter","Arctic; Canada; Greenland; Habitat models; Polar bear; Sea ice; Ursus maritimus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047375862"

The abundance of nutrients such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in their excreta promotes the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which makes penguin colonies an important source of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Since the 15th Chinese Antarctica research expedition, studies have been conducted via field observations and laboratory incubation experiments to determine the soil nutrient content in typical penguin colonies, and GHG production and emissions in these regions. These studies have indicated that the deposition of large amounts of penguin guano strongly influences the physical and chemical properties of soils in the Antarctic and creates favorable conditions for the production of CH4 and N2O in the soils and their subsequent emission. These studies have also shown that penguin activity significantly promotes CH4 and N2O emissions when compared with sites such as tundra ecosystems where penguins are absent. However, due to the lack of penguin population data, the total GHG emissions from penguin colonies at the regional and even circum-Antarctic scale have not been estimated. With the development of remote sensing technology, penguin colonies and their population changes have been identified by satellite images since the 1980s. In recent years, with the application of very high resolution (VHR) satellite images and aerial photographs, the identification of penguin populations at the regional scale has gradually been established. Based on previous research, this study comprehensively analyzed GHG emissions from penguins via field observations and laboratory incubation experiments, and introduced a method to estimate GHG emissions from penguin colonies via parameters such as guano deposition rates, CH4 and N2O emission factors, and penguin populations. This study also summarized the satellite data-based population estimations of five Antarctic penguin species: Adélie (Pygoscelis adéliae), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis Antarctica), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri), and Macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus). Taking Adélie penguin as an example, Antarctic penguin colonies were investigated by considering the relationship between penguin guano areas and the number of breeding pairs, which determined a global total Adélie penguin population of 3.79 million breeding pairs. Some studies have shown that Adélie penguin populations have been declining rapidly on the islands of the northern Antarctic Peninsula, but have been increasing in the southern Antarctic Peninsula and the Ross Sea regions. The factors driving penguin populations were studied in terms of the physical and biological changes in the penguins' environment, including changes in sea-ice conditions (concentration, extent, and thickness), air temperature, wind speed, and sea surface temperature, all of which are likely to limit the abundance of Adélie penguins. Competition for food resources such as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and continuous changes in the abundance of these resources also impacts on the number and density of Adélie penguins. Some of the factors that influence penguin population changes were discussed, including environmental factors (sea surface temperature, sea ice area, and Chlorophyll a concentration), human activities (the tourism and fishing industries), and other factors (food sources, volcanic eruptions, and iceberg calving). VHR remote sensing data-based estimations of penguin populations and GHG emissions will become a research focus in the field of polar ecology, and synthesizes the disciplines of remote sensing, biology, soil science, ecology, and geography. © 2017, Science Press.

Since the absorption and scattering by molecules, aerosols, and hydrosols and reflection, transmission over the sea surface, the initially completely unpolarized sunlight becomes partially polarized after transmitting in the coupled atmosphere-ocean system (AOS). Hence, the polarization of the sunlight, which contains embedded information on atmospheric and water optical properties, has largely been neglected. In addition, the parallel polarization radiance (PPR) has two significant advantages in effectively diminishing the sun-glint contamination and enhancing the ocean color signal at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA). In this study, the directional variations in parallel polarized water-leaving radiance of suspended particulate matters in coastal waters, based on the vector radiative transfer simulations (RT), were examined. The simulations reveal that the traditional radiation intensity (I) and parallel polarization radiance (PPR) display significant multidirectional and spectral variations with respect to the observation geometries, and TSM concentrations. Moreover, the water-leaving (Lw) radiance for I and PPR have the same angular distribution pattern and magnitude under different bands. In addition, the relative fraction of Lw to Lt for PPR is large than I, indicating that the PPR can improve to retrieve the Lw radiance at the TOA. Furthermore, an exponent relationship between the Rrs-p and the TSM concentration has been established with low corresponding AD (1.258%) and RMSE (0.202). It demonstrates that the polarization of the Lw radiance is closely related to oceanic constituents, and has great potential for the retrieval of TSM concentrations. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Angular distribution; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Optical properties; Particles (particulate matter); Polarization; Radiative transfer; Sea ice; Surface waters; Coastal waters; Inversion algorithm; Radiative transfer simulations; Suspended particulate matters; Water-leaving radiances; Remote sensing","coastal waters; inversion algorithm; Polarization characterics; radiative transfer simulations; suspended particulate matters; water-leaving radiance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056486594"

Ship navigation benefits from up-to-date sea ice analyses at both regional and local scales. This study presents a satellite-based sea ice navigation system (SatSINS) that integrates observations and scientific output from remote sensing and meteorological data to develop optimum marine navigational routes in sea ice-covered waters, especially in areas where operational ice information is usually scarce. The system and its applications are presented in the context of a decision-making process to optimize the routing of the RV Xuelong during her passage through Prydz Bay, East Antarctica during three trips in the austral spring of 2011-2013. The study assesses scientifically-generated remote sensing ice parameters for their operational use in marine navigation. Evaluation criteria involve identification of priority parameters, their spatio-temporal requirements in relation to navigational needs, and their level of accuracy in conjunction with the severity of ice conditions. Coarse-resolution ice concentration maps are sufficient to delineate ice edge and develop a safe route when ice concentration is less than 70%, provided that ice dynamics, estimated from examining the cyclonic pattern, is not severe. Otherwise, fine-resolution radar data should be used to identify and avoid deformed ice. Satellite data lagging one day behind the actual location of the ship was sufficient in most cases although the proposed route may have to be adjusted. To evaluate the utility of SatSINS, deviation of the actual route from the proposed route was calculated and found to range between 165 m to about 16.0 km with standard deviations of 2.8-6.1 km. Growth of land-fast ice has proven to be an essential component of the system as it was estimated using a thermodynamic model with input from a meteorological station. © 2017 by the authors.","Marine navigation; Meteorology; Navigation; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Ships; Antarctica; Decision making process; Evaluation criteria; Meteorological data; Meteorological station; Navigational routes; Scientific mission; Thermodynamic model; Ice","Antarctica; Marine navigation; Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021077436"

While calving can be quantified by in situ and remote-sensing observations, meltwater run-off, the subglacial transport of meltwater, and submarine melting are not well constrained due to inherent difficulties observing the subglacial and proglacial environments at tidewater glaciers. Remote-sensing and in situ measurements of surface sediment plumes, and their suspended sediment concentration (SSC), have been used as a proxy for glacier meltwater run-off. However, this relationship between satellite reflectance and SSC has predominantly been established using land-terminating glaciers. Here, we use two Svalbard tidewater glaciers to establish a well-constrained relationship between Landsat-8 surface reflecance and SSC and argue that it can be used to measure relative meltwater runoff at tidewater glaciers throughout a summer melt season. We find the highest correlation between SSCs and Landsat-8 surface reflectance by using the red + NIR band combination (r2 = 0.76). The highest correlation between SSCs and in situ field spectrometer measurements is in the 740–800 nm wavelength range (r2 = 0.85), a spectral range not currently measured by Landsat. Additionally, we find that in situ and Landsat-8 measurements for surface reflectance of SSCs are not interchangeable and therefore establish a relationship for each detection method. We then use the Landsat-8 relationship to calculate total surface sediment load, finding a strong correlation between total surface sediment load and a proxy for meltwater run-off (r2 ≥ 0.89). Our results establish a new metric to calculate SSCs from Landsat-8 surface reflectance and demonstrate how the SSC of subglacial sediment plumes can be used to monitor relative seasonal meltwater discharge at tidewater glaciers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Melting; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sedimentation; Submarines; Surficial sediments; Field spectrometer measurements; In-situ measurement; Melt-water discharges; Strong correlation; Subglacial sediment; Surface reflectance; Suspended sediment concentrations; Tidewater glaciers; concentration (composition); discharge; in situ measurement; Landsat; meltwater; plume; remote sensing; runoff; spectrometer; subglacial deposit; surface reflectance; suspended sediment; tidewater glacier; Suspended sediments","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051952384"

The primary instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the distance from the spacecraft to the earth's surface via the roundtrip travel time of individual laser pulses. GLAS utilized pulsed lasers and a direct detection receiver consisting of a silicon avalanche photodiode and a waveform digitizer. Early in the mission, the peak power of the received signal from snow and ice surfaces was found to span a wider dynamic range than anticipated, often exceeding the linear dynamic range of the GLAS 1064-nm detector assembly. The resulting saturation of the receiver distorted the recorded signal and resulted in range biases as large as ∼50 cm for ice- and snow-covered surfaces. We developed a correction for this ""saturation range bias"" based on laboratory tests using a spare flight detector, and refined the correction by comparing GLAS elevation estimates with those derived from Global Positioning System surveys over the calibration site at the salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Applying the saturation correction largely eliminated the range bias due to receiver saturation for affected ICESat measurements over Uyuni and significantly reduced the discrepancies at orbit crossovers located on flat regions of the Antarctic ice sheet. © 2017 IEEE.","Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctica; Bolivia; Aneroid altimeters; Detectors; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Laser beams; NASA; Optical radar; Orbits; Pulsed lasers; Radio altimeters; Receivers (containers); Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Signal receivers; Snow; Surface emitting lasers; Surface waves; Travel time; Ice sheet; Laser altimetry; Laser ranging; Measurement by laser beam; Optical surface waves; correction; GLAS; GPS; ice sheet; ICESat; lidar; measurement method; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite laser ranging; spacecraft; travel time; Ice","Ice sheets; laser ranging; lidar; remote sensing; satellite laser altimetry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028823003"

This chapter focuses on the characterization of MPC properties in the Arctic region from in situ and satellite observations. The frequency of MPC occurrence over the Arctic region is determined from the CALIPSO and CloudSat satellite active remote sensing observations. Results highlight that the spatial, vertical and seasonal variability of MPC can be in part linked to the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean and the melting of sea ice. The microphysical and optical properties of the ice crystals and liquid droplets within MPC and the associated formation and growth processes responsible for the cloud life cycle are evaluated based on in situ airborne observations. Finally, the coupling of in situ MPC airborne measurements with the satellite active remote sensing is presented through a validation study to evaluate remote sensing retrieval algorithms and products such as cloud detection or cloud phase. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Red tide not only harms marine fisheries and aquaculture, deteriorates the marine environment, affects coastal tourist industry, but also causes human health problems. East China Sea (ECS) is a region of high incidence of red tide disasters. Remote sensing has been proven an effective means of monitoring red tides. Phytoplankton-specific light absorption plays a fundamental role in the remote estimation of pigment biomass and red tide. This paper retrieves the phytoplankton absorption coefficient in decade based on MODIS data from July 2002 to June 2012 using quasi-analysis algorithm (QAA), analyzes and compares phytoplankton absorption coefficient spectral curves of red tide events with multiyear monthly averaged ones, as well as phytoplankton absorption coefficient spectral differences at the same location during red tide presence and absence. A new red tide monitoring algorithm based on the phytoplankton absorption coefficient is developed to extract red tide information of the ECS. With the application of the algorithm in the ECS, the results reveal that the developed model can effectively determine the location of red tides, with good correspondence to the results from an official bulletin.

Traditional direct thickness measurements with meter sticks can provide accurate but only spot information, referred to as “needles” due to their pinpoint focus and information, while airborne and satellite remote sensing snow products, referred to as “the haystack,” have large uncertainties due to their scale. We demonstrate the remarkable accuracy and applicability of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) snow thickness measurements by comparing them with in situ meter stick data from two field campaigns to Antarctica in late winter/early spring. The efficiency and millimeter-to-centimeter accuracy of GPR enables practitioners to acquire extensive, semiregional data with the potential to upscale needles to the haystack and to potentially calibrate satellite remote sensing products that we confirm to derive roughly 30% of the in situ thickness. We find the radar wave propagation velocity in snow to be rather constant (± 6%), encouraging regional snow thickness surveys.

The SWFM is determined by the shape of the outgoing laser pulse and the transfer characteristics of the receiver. Knowing the SWFM is essential for performing highly accurate range measurements, for interpreting the LiDAR waveforms correctly, and to derive additional attributes for detected target returns. Often the actual SWFM is not known explicitly, and a Gaussian pulse shape is used in lieu thereof. However, the Gaussian pulse, despite its advantageous properties, does not properly address asymmetries and ringing effects typically present in real-life SWFMs. We present a model of the SWFM composed of harmonic and exponential terms which is able to account for these effects while at the same time being mathematically easy to handle. Unfortunately, the approximation of data by a sum of harmonics and exponentials belongs to the class of ill-posed problems. Nevertheless, we present a pragmatic solution to the problem and demonstrate the versatility of the resulting model. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrophilicity; Laser beams; Optical radar; Pulsed lasers; Sea ice; Waveform analysis; Exponential models; Full waves; Gaussian pulse shapes; Ill posed problem; Model parameters; Range measurements; Transfer characteristics; Wave forms; Remote sensing","bathymetry; exponential model; full-wave; LiDAR; system waveform; waveform analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056482721"

Regional empirical chlorophyll algorithms based on the 3-band OC3M operational algorithm were derived and showed better performance in estimating Chla than the global algorithms. © 2017","Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Chlorophyll; Digital storage; High performance liquid chromatography; Infrared radiation; Optical data storage; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Antarctic Peninsula; Atmospheric correction schemes; Atmospheric corrections; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Operational algorithms; Remote-sensing reflectance; Semi-analytical algorithms; Short-wave near-infrared; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); atmospheric correction; chlorophyll a; coastal water; fluorometry; MODIS; reflectance; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; SeaWiFS; shortwave radiation; Infrared devices","Antarctic Peninsula; Atmospheric correction; Chlorophyll algorithm; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing reflectance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044750721"

The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument is able to provide a long record of ERB for such scientific studies. This manuscript, which is the first of a two-part paper, describes the new CERES algorithm for improving the clear/cloudy scene classification without the use of coincident cloud imager data. This new CERES algorithm is based on a subset of the modern artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm called machine learning (ML) algorithms. This paper describes the development and application of the ML algorithm known as random forests (RF), which is used to classify CERES broadband footprint measurements into clear and cloudy scenes. Results from the RF analysis carried using the CERES Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) data for January and July are presented in the manuscript. The daytime RF misclassification rate (MCR) shows relatively large values (> 30%) for snow, sea ice, and bright desert surface types, while lower values (< 10%) for the forest surface type. MCR values observed for the nighttime data in general show relatively larger values for most of the surface types compared to the daytime MCR values. The modified MCR values show lower values (< 4%) for most surface types after thin cloud data are excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analysis shows that the number of input variables and decision trees used in the RF analysis has a substantial influence on determining the classification error. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Budget control; Clouds; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Earth atmosphere; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Classification errors; Clouds and the Earth's radiant energy systems; Development and applications; Earth radiation Budget; Misclassification rates; Radiative fluxes; Single scanner footprints; Statistical techniques; algorithm; cloud; flux measurement; machine learning; radiation budget; remote sensing; statistical analysis; top of atmosphere; Learning algorithms","Atmosphere; Clouds; Radiative fluxes; Remote sensing; Statistical technique","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032746166"

To better understand the interannual and seasonal changes at Yahtse and the processes driving these changes, we construct velocity and ice surface elevation time series spanning the years 1985–2016 and 2000–2014, respectively, using satellite optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. We find contrasting seasonal dynamics above and below a steep (up to 35% slope) icefall located approximately 6 km from the terminus. Above the icefall, velocities peak in May and reach their minima in October synchronous with the development of a small embayment at the calving terminus. The up-glacier minimum speeds, embayment, and plume of turbid water that emerges from the embayment are consistent with an efficient, channelized subglacial drainage system that lowers basal water pressures and leads to focused submarine melt in the calving embayment. However, velocities near the terminus are fastest in the winter, following terminus retreat, possibly off of a terminal moraine that results in decreased backstress. Between 1996 and 2016 the terminus decelerated by ∼40%at an average rate of ∼0.4 mday−1 year−1, transitioned from tensile to compressive longitudinal strain rates, and dynamically thickened at rates of 1-6 m year−1, which we hypothesize is in response to the development and advance of a terminal moraine. The described interannual changes decay significantly upstream of the icefall, indicating that the icefall may inhibit the upstream transmission of stress perturbations. We suggest that diminished stress transmission across the icefall could allow moraine-enabled terminus advance despite mass loss in Yahtse’s upper basin.

Hence, the polarized Lw can be used to extract additional information on oceanic constituents, which is complementary to the spectral and angular radiance measurements. In this study, the polarization characteristics of underwater upwelling radiance in turbid waters with respect to suspended particulate matters have been investigated. The full Stokes components of the underwater upwelling radiance in the visible spectrum are calculated using a radiative transfer model. And then, the influences of suspended particulate matter concentrations on the directional variations and the polarization of underwater upwelling radiance are examined. The results reveal that the polarization of underwater upwelling radiance (I, Q, U, DOP) shows significant multidirectional variations with respect to observation geometries, wavelengths, and solar zenith angles. Moreover, the polarization of underwater upwelling radiance is highly related to the suspended particulate matter concentrations. It demonstrates the potential of using the polarized signal to retrieve particle concentrations in coastal waters.

To this end, an inversion scheme is introduced that retrieves the effective complex permittivity of the domain prior and after oil injection by comparing the simulated and calibrated measured NRCS data, while roughness parameters calculated using lidar are utilized as prior information. Once the complex permittivity values are obtained, the volume fraction of oil within the sea ice is found using a mixture formula. Based on this volume fraction, a binary detection of oil presence seems to be possible for this test case. Finally, the possible sources of error in the retrieved effective volume fraction, which is an overestimate of the actual value, are identified and discussed by macrolevel and microlevel analyses through bulk salinity measurements and X-ray imagery of the samples, as well as a brief chemical analysis. © 2017 IEEE.","Arctic; Chemical analysis; Crude oil; Data reduction; Meteorological instruments; Oil spills; Optical radar; Permittivity; Radar cross section; Salinity measurement; Sea ice; Volume fraction; Complex permittivity; Controlled conditions; Effective complex permittivities; Electromagnetic detection; Electromagnetic response; Normalized radar cross section; Prior information; Roughness parameters; crude oil; detection method; electromagnetic method; experimental study; fluid injection; geophysical method; lidar; oil spill; permittivity; remote sensing; scattering; sea ice; Ice","Arctic; crude oil; electromagnetic scattering remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019026260"

Focusing on this SAR application issue, this paper proposes and describes a new SAR data processing methodology–SAR data integrated processing (DIP) oriented on Earth environment factor inversions. The simple definition, typical integrated modes and overall implementation ideas are introduced.

A Parameter-based Trafficability Hierarchy (PATH) is presented here as a framework for developing quantitative assessment strategies that can guide planning and execution of operations on or near sea ice and quantify the impacts of recent changes on ice use. A PATH assessment has been completed for three case studies in Arctic Alaska. These cases, which correspond to a range of different icescapes and ice uses, identify and quantify different parameters linked to trafficability and safe operations. For ice road applications, PATH was used to determine an ice thickness compensation factor, a factor increasing the minimal thickness threshold for operations, to help translate sporadic auger ice thickness measurements along the Kotzebue-Kiana community ice road into an envelope for safe operations. A compensation factor as high as 1.5 was found to be necessary to ensure safety because of the high local thickness variability that is currently a concern for ice road operators. A PATH assessment of ice roughness for ice trail routing at Utqiaġvik draws on satellite remote sensing and is relevant for over-ice travel in general, including escape, evacuation, and rescue. We compared the routing of local snowmobile trails with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data products to identify specific ranges of ice conditions, roughness, and topography favored for ice trail construction. The same combination of data sources was used to identify potentially beneficial trail routes. Finally, an ice stability and safety assessment was completed for ice road construction and maintenance by industry near the Northstar Island oil production facility. We evaluated small-scale ice displacement data obtained from SAR interferometry to infer internal ice strain and stress and used these data in assessing the potential for fractures to reduce load-bearing capacity. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Alaska; Arctic; United States; analytical hierarchy process; assessment method; bearing capacity; ice thickness; interferometry; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; topography","Ice roads; Sea ice; Sea ice system services; Sea ice use; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042668618"

Slick shape and its spatial-temporal evolution depend on many environmental processes, such as wind speed, nonuniform marine currents, internal waves, etc. In the context of the problem of oil spill dynamics it is very important, particularly at initial stages of oil spill evolution, to describe correctly processes of oil film spreading. Until recently the most popular was the Fay's model of film spreading which, however, could not correctly explain some obvious effects, e.g., asymmetry of film slicks in the downwind and crosswind directions. In this paper new results of field studies of spreading of surfactant films are presented. The experiments with spills of surfactants were conducted on the Gorky water reservoir using a methodology of contouring slicks with a GPS receiver mounted on a motor boat, and also aerial photography from UAV. The following results have been obtained. First, the effect of elongation of oil spills in the wind direction, revealed in our previous experiment, is confirmed. Quantitative data on growth rates of along- and cross-wind slick axes are obtained characterizing initial stages of the spreading process.

The Southern Ocean is roughly the size of Africa and experiences exceptional seasonality. Its many habitats include the permanently open ocean, sea ice, frontal systems and neritic waters, and different zonal (east-west) and meridional (north-south) regions are on different trajectories in terms of climate, sea ice cover and biological populations. The Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced substantial warming, loss of sea ice and declining Adélie penguin populations, while eastern Antarctica has cooled, shown increased ice cover and increasing numbers of Adélies. In the ocean itself, warming seems to be concentrated north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and at depth rather than in surface waters. Densities of Antarctic krill are correlated with ice cover in the previous winter and in the south-west Atlantic have decreased over the last century while salps have shown increasing numbers south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Even in this example, the mechanisms involved are uncertain, making predictions difficult. The historic loss of an enormous biomass of consumers through fisheries, led to top-down ecological effects including competitive release among predators. These pelagic food webs are, however, strongly physically forced, making them particularly vulnerable to changes in environmental conditions. The size and species composition of the primary producers affect food chain length and the efficiency of the biological pump. Critically, the primary producer community is profoundly shaped by factors influencing the availability of light (e.g. season, ice melt and water column stability), micro and macronutrients. Changes in these will have deeply important bottom-up effects, and this brings us to defining biogeography. In these pelagic systems, biogeographic provinces are defined by the frontal systems that delineate sharp discontinuities in conditions in the water column and the taxa that dominate primary production. Because these are not geographically fixed, changes in biogeography in this context describe the expansion, contraction or simple displacement of biomes. The associated food webs revolve around a small number of key species that differ among habitats and biomes. They are not simple, exhibit considerable flexibility and include a number of taxa, particularly the cephalopods, that are difficult to sample and remain poorly studied. A major difficulty in understanding how climate change is likely to manifest is the brevity of relevant datasets. We have few physical or biological benchmarks to use in separating short-term noise from long-term signal. As a physical example, Southern Ocean fronts can exhibit short-term meridional shifts of >100 km in a matter of weeks. Biologically, regional differences in trajectories of Adélie penguin numbers need to be viewed against the background of substantial variability over the last 45,000 years. Except for ice or sediment cores, such data are available for few variables or species. In addition, research efforts are geographically unbalanced for logistic reasons. Remote sensing and the Argo float programme reduce this problem by increasing spatial coverage enormously for some variables, but not others, and even then offer relatively new time series. Important variables that are undergoing, or will undergo, change include: Sea ice cover (essentially habitat loss), sea temperatures, wind and mixing regimes, the positions of fronts, ultraviolet levels and ocean pH. Many of these will have interacting effects, and the areas likely to be exposed to multiple environmental changes far exceed those already experiencing important changes. Species are potentially vulnerable to stressors at all ontogenetic stages and in many cases sublethal effects (e.g. on reproductive success) are likely to affect population dynamics before stressors reach lethal levels. Likely, and complicated, will be possible changes to the microbial plankton, including increased microbe deposition by aeolian dust and greater susceptibility of potential hosts to viral infection because of other stresses. All these stressors can have direct and interacting effects as well as indirect effects. For example, meridional shifts in frontal positions will alter the foraging ranges of top predators that are land-based during the breeding season. The ecosystem-level consequences will depend on individual species reactions, including the rates at which they can respond and stressors to which they respond, with the potential disruption of species interactions through different phenological responses. Perhaps the key characteristic of predictions for the effects of climate change on the Southern Ocean lies in an even greater degree of uncertainty than the norm. © S. J. Hawkins, A. J. Evans, A. C.

Data used were collected in the thin ice of the advancing autumn marginal ice zone of the western Arctic Ocean in 2015, where pancake ice was found to be prevalent. Multiple buoys were deployed in seven wave experiments; data from four of these experiments are used in the present study. Wave attenuation coefficients are calculated utilizing wave energy decay between two buoys measuring simultaneously within the ice covered region. Wavenumbers are measured in one of these experiments. Forcing parameters are obtained from simultaneous in-situ and remote sensing observations, as well as forecast/hindcast models. Cases from three wave experiments are used to calibrate a viscoelastic model for wave attenuation/dispersion in ice cover. The calibration is done by minimizing the difference between modeled and measured complex wavenumber, using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The calibrated results are validated using two methods. One is to directly apply the calibrated viscoelastic parameters to one of the wave experiments not used in the calibration and then compare the attenuation from the model with measured data. The other is to use the calibrated viscoelastic model in WAVEWATCH III® over the entire western Beaufort Sea and then compare the wave spectra at two remote sites not used in the calibration. Both validations show reasonable agreement between the model and the measured data. The completed viscoelastic model is believed to be applicable to the fall marginal ice zone dominated by pancake ice. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

The lidar data consisted of a 2-D field of surface elevation with horizontal resolutions between 17 and 33 cm, over a swath approximately 150-220 m wide, centred on the ground track of the aircraft. Those data were used to compute directional wavenumber spectra of the surface wave field. Comparison with nearly collocated buoy data found the lidar and buoy measurements to be generally consistent. During the first event, waves traveling from open water into the ice were attenuated by the ice. The low spectral spreading and k7/4 spectral dependence of the attenuation was consistent with dissipative models that treat sea ice as a highly viscous fluid floating on a less viscous ocean. Upper-ocean eddy viscosities calculated using that model were found to be significantly lower than those from previous work. The second event was in off-ice winds and cold temperatures, allowing measurement of the wave fetch relation in ice-forming conditions. The wave growth rate was found to be slightly higher than previous measurements under unstable atmospheric conditions without ice formation. Comparison with WAVEWATCH III model output highlighted the importance of accurate ice information and fine geographic computational resolution when making predictions near the ice edge. Finally, the very short scales over which the wave field was observed to evolve in the MIZ are discussed. © 2018. American Geophysical Union.

Multiple procedures to calibrate and modelling SDB calculation were tested. Regarding to these procedures, the following approaches were studied: i) Based on TOA and WL reflectance, a linear regression, as proposed by Stumpf et al.[3], and a quadratic regression to modelling the SDB algorithm were tested; (ii) several in situ data sets acquired at different epochs were used in order to investigate the dependency of the temporal and the spatial density of the calibration sample; (iii) The tidal level was considered in order to provide a tide height at the time of image acquisition to depth models calibration. Numerous SDB models from Sentinel-2 imagery were derived and compared with a reference hydrographic survey data. The results show that SDB models present a good level of reliability regardless of the acquisition date or source of the in situ datasets. Coefficients of determination (R2) higher than 50% were obtained for the majority of the tested procedures. The quadratic modelling approach also appear to retrieve SDB models in agreement with hydrographic surveys data.

Most of the rift extension has occurred in bursts after overcoming the resistance of suture zones that bind together neighboring glacier inflows. We model the stresses in the ice shelf to determine potential rift trajectories. Calving perturbations to ice flow will likely reach the grounding line. The stability of Larsen C may hinge on a single suture zone that stabilizes numerous upstream rifts.

This feasibility study presents an application of high-resolution optical images from operational satellites, which have become more available in polar regions, for sea ice motion and deformation measurements. The sea ice motion, i.e., Lagrangian vector, is measured by using a maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique and multi-temporal high-resolution images acquired on 14-15 August 2014 from multiple spaceborne sensors on board Korea Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSATs) with short acquisition time intervals. The sea ice motion extracted from the six image pairs of the spatial resolutions were resampled to 4 m and 15 m yields with vector length measurements of 57.7 m root mean square error (RMSE) and -11.4 m bias and 60.7 m RMSE and -13.5 m bias, respectively, compared with buoy location records. The errors from both resolutions indicate more accurate measurements than from conventional sea ice motion datasets from passive microwave and radar data in ice and water mixed surface conditions. In the results of sea ice deformation caused by interaction of individual ice floes, while free drift patterns of ice floes were delineated from the 4 m spatial resolution images, the deformation was less revealing in the 15 m spatial resolution image pairs due to emphasized discretization uncertainty from coarser pixel sizes. The results demonstrate that using multi-temporal high-resolution optical satellite images enabled precise image block matching in the melting season, thus this approach could be used for expanding sea ice motion and deformation dataset, with an advantage of frequent image acquisition capability in multiple areas by means of many operational satellites. © 2017 by the authors.

In this paper, the monthly product of sea ice extent, recorded from 1979 to 2016, was selected to analysis the change characteristics in multi time scales, which are annual, seasonal and monthly. It is found that the sea ice in Arctic was melting continuously for past four decades. And the melting rate was accelerated significantly since 2000. Furthermore, the Arctic was divided into thirteen sub-regions, and the change mechanism of sub-regions was discussed. Different change trends for sub-regions in four seasons were presented. Four active sub-regions were found, and the periodical analysis with the method of wavelet analysis was further carried out. The results show that the changes in the four active regions are periodic and the change period is over 10 years during the period from 1979 to 2016. © Authors 2018.

Surface temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at a rate double that of the global average, known as the Arctic amplification. The Arctic amplification has led to a series of consequences locally such as the accelerated sea ice retreat, the continuous permafrost melting and methane release, and the marine and terrestrial ecological dynamics. It also might cause an increased frequency of extreme weather event in mid-latitudes via perturbing the strength of the polar vortex. The Arctic warming is mainly resulted from the imbalance of energy budget at both surface and top of atmosphere. In order to explore the driving mechanism of Arctic amplification, lots of efforts have been made based on model simulations and observations. Several major competing theories and related evidences have been proposed to explain their contributions to the imbalance of energy budget over the Arctic. The sea-ice albedo feedback, caused by the continuously shrinking summer sea ice potentially increasing the absorption of shortwave radiation, is believed to play a critical role in recent Arctic amplification. But certain model simulations have indicated that sea-ice albedo feedback was likely not the dominant factor-robust warming amplification still occurs in the Arctic in the absence of albedo feedback. The positive lapse rate feedback, is also thought to cause greater warming at the Arctic surface through damping the deep convection process at the bottom atmosphere because of the strong temperature inversion in the cold Arctic. However, whether the lapse rate feedback plays a dominant role in the Arctic amplification has not been widely accepted. The Planck feedback-cold region requires larger temperature increase than warm area to balance certain external radiative forcing, is also believed to contribute to the Arctic amplification. But the magnitude of its contribution remains to be further quantified. An enhanced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) transporting extraordinary amounts of heat northward to the Arctic Ocean has been hypothesized to substantially amplify Arctic warming and accelerate summer sea-ice melting in this region. However, evidence has instead shown significant slowing of the AMOC over the last few decades. The enhanced greenhouse effect, resulted from the increased water vapor and cloudiness, has been suggested as an important driver of the Arctic winter warming and summer sea-ice dynamics. However, whether the increased water vapor comes from the strengthened sea surface evaporation or from an enhanced atmospheric northward transportation, is still unclear. This paper elucidates the theoretical basis of all potential mechanisms, and systematically reviews the research progress of these theories. Based on the comprehensive analysis of these studies, we point out that due to the limitation of current study approaches, the data quality problems such as scarce in situ measurements, difficulty in discriminating clouds from snow cover for some remote sensing products, problematic parameterization schemes and model inputs in some reanalsysis and GCM projects, and the lack of systematic analysis for investigating the internal relations between different climate variables, the conclusions from different studies are discrepant, or even contradictory. The causes of the unprecedented climate change in the Arctic remain unclear and are still under heated debate. Therefore, the development of high quality, long-term radiative product, the optimization of the researching approaches and more accurate quantification of these feedback mechanisms, and the systematic analysis of the potential linkage between different climate variables, will help to advance the study of the Arctic amplification and climate change. © 2018, Science Press.

Since the variety of the image data source, the complexity of the application background and the limitations of edge detection, the robustness and universality of active contour model are greatly reduced in the practical application of edge extraction. This study presented a fast edge detection approach based on global optimization convex model and Split Bregman algorithm. Firstly, the proposed approach defined a generalized convex function variational model which incorporated the RSF model’s principle and Chan’s global optimization idea and could get the global optimal solution. Secondly, a fast numerical minimization scheme based on split Bregman iterative algorithm is employed for overcoming drawbacks of noise and others. Finally, the curve evolves to the target boundaries quickly and accurately. The approach was applied in real special sea ice SAR images and synthetic images with noise, fuzzy boundaries and intensity inhomogeneity, and the experiment results showed that the proposed approach had a better performance than the edge detection methods based on the GMAC model and RSF model.

In this paper, we map the terminus positions of 135 glaciers along the coastline of Victoria Land, Oates Land and George V Land from 1972-2013 at a higher temporal resolution (sub-decadal intervals) than in previous research. These three regions span a range of climatic and oceanic conditions and contain a variety of glacier types. Overall, from 1972-2013, 36% of glaciers advanced, 25% retreated and the remainder showed no discernible change. On sub-decadal timescales, there were no clear trends in glacier terminus position change. However, marine-terminating glaciers experienced larger terminus position changes compared with terrestrial glaciers, and those with an unconstrained floating tongue exhibited the largest variations. We conclude that, unlike in Greenland, West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, there is no clear glacier retreat in the study area and that most of the variations are more closely linked to glacier size and terminus type. © Antarctic Science Ltd 2017.","Antarctic Ice Sheet; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; Arctic; East Antarctica; George V Coast; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Oates Coast; Victoria Land; West Antarctica; coast; decadal variation; glacier dynamics; glacier retreat; iceberg calving; marine environment; remote sensing; sea ice","calving; East Antarctic Ice Sheet; marine- and land-terminating glaciers; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018347711"

Early expeditions produced maps using ground or ship-based observations followed later by vertical and/or oblique aerial photography from aircraft. In the modern era, extensive digital satellite imagery is available which has also been supplemented by the resurrection and scanning of some historic U.S., now ‘declassified’, film-based satellite images. Much of the MGT became detached and drifted away following the collision by the B-9B iceberg in February 2010 and a similar sequence, or extension-detachment cycle, must have occurred some-time after Mawson's 1911–1914 observations. All the available information on the position, shape or appearance of the MGT has been re-examined in an attempt to comprehensively study its past, present and possible future motion. Feature tracking cross correlation methods have been applied for suitably detailed image pairs to accurately measure the MGT advance velocity. The derived mean rate for 1947–2010 is 1180 ± 14 m y− 1 with an accompanying ice-front loss rate of ~ 190 m y− 1. A simple model for the MGT exhibits a ~ 73 year quasi-periodic cycle of rebirth, growth and demise which will affect the volume of bottom water produced in the nearby polynya. Some evidence for this cyclic oceanographic change has recently been reported from regional sediment data. Somewhat speculatively, the model suggests a date of ~ 1937 for the previous MGT break-off and around or before ~ 2083 for the next. With the MGT being primed to break-off every ~ 73 years, the precise date being governed by unpredictable external events such as collisions by large icebergs, such cycles have probably occurred for many thousands of years. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; East Antarctica; Mertz Glacier; Aerial photography; Aircraft accidents; Antennas; Correlation methods; Fighter aircraft; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Antarctica; Cross correlation methods; Digital satellites; Feature-tracking; Mertz Glacier Tongue; Possible futures; Satellite images; Satellite remote sensing; aerial photography; airborne survey; bottom water; digital image; digital photogrammetry; iceberg; polynya; remote sensing; satellite imagery; tracking; Satellite imagery","Antarctica; Feature tracking; Mertz Glacier Tongue; Satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010210761"

First, instead of a single layer, we reformulate the model to consider multiple layers for sea ice and snow to better characterize the radiative effect of vertical temperature and salinity profile within the sea ice and the snow cover. Second, we incorporate small-scale sea ice variability, sea ice leads, which are not distinguishable with the L-band satellite data but have profound impacts on the simulated brightness temperature. Small-scale features of the sea ice cover such as leads can significantly lower the overall brightness temperature (TB ). The results show that the improved radiation model can correct sea ice type dependent biases of TB (R2 from 0.05 to 0.72) and compensate for the overestimation of TB when (refrozen) leads are ignored (R2 from 0.51 to 0.62).

But it is also the most challenging to investigate, both in situ and from satellites. If satellite remote-sensing techniques are developing rapidly, fieldwork remains crucial for the mandatory validation of such data. In April 2016, an Arctic fieldwork campaign was conducted at Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. This campaign provided an opportunity to combine various techniques to record the fjord ice properties ranging from local field sampling to broader ground-based and satellite radar remote sensing of the fjord. Tracking the boat used to access the field sites with hand-held GPS devices offered a good opportunity to map fjord ice and assess the limits of radar identification of small icebergs and thin ice. During 1 week, 17 icebergs and the thin ice edges in two different locations were mapped. The GPS tracks present a good agreement with the Radarsat-2 data analysis for one of the two ice edges. The second ice edge track only partly corresponds to the radar scene. Ice movement, recorded by a ground-based radar, is likely to explain this result. Grounded icebergs could be identified in both Radarsat-2 and ground-based radar. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arctic; Kongsfjorden; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; fjord; GPS; ice; iceberg; radar; RADARSAT; remote sensing; sea ice","icebergs; remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039555651"

We describe a scattering model based on the iterative solutions to the equations of radiative transfer. This model incorporates the dense medium phase and amplitude correction theory (DM-PACT) to account for coherent effects between scatterers, along with Fresnel field amplitude and phase corrections, in the development of the phase matrices of the scatterers. We describe applications of this dense medium model in the remote sensing of sea ice and snow, as well as for vegetation canopies, that is, boreal forests, rice fields, and oil palm plantations. We demonstrate how the model can be used for retrieving sea ice thickness from remote sensing images through inversion algorithms.

Information on their individual movement and distribution patterns is largely unknown due to their association with sea ice habitat where direct observations are limited. The primary objectives of this study are (1) to use satellite telemetry to quantify the movement patterns, distribution, and presumed foraging areas of Antarctic minke whales and (2) to assess the environmental conditions that are associated with areas used by minke whales along the western Antarctic Peninsula. Results: Individual movement patterns from three Antarctic minke whales fitted with ARGOS-linked transmitters were analyzed with respect to environmental conditions. Behavioral states were identified using the Multi-Scale Straightness Index. Satellite telemetry revealed disparate behavioral patterns between these three individuals. Generalized additive model analysis demonstrated environmental variables, particularly sea ice, bathymetry, and sea surface temperature, are the best predictors of presumed foraging areas. Conclusions: Satellite telemetry from three individuals revealed Antarctic minke whale summer foraging spaces are highly individualized but can generally be associated with pack ice habitat over the continental shelf. The coupled relationship between minke whales, krill, and sea ice suggests that these whales may be sensitive to changes in sea ice concentration, extent, and duration, making them particularly vulnerable to climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).","","Antarctic minke whales; Remote sensing; Satellite telemetry; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030244799"

The measurements are based on the maximum cross correlation between two sequential MR backscatter images separated ∼1 min in time, a method that is commonly used to estimate sea ice drift from satellite products. The advantage of MR is that images in close temporal proximity are readily available. A typical MR antenna rotation period is ∼1–2 s, whereas satellite revisit times can be on the order of days. The technique is applied to ∼4 weeks of measurements taken from R/V Sikuliaq in the Beaufort Sea in the fall of 2015. The resulting sea ice velocity fields have ∼500 m and up to ∼5 min resolution, covering a maximum range of ∼4 km. The MR velocity fields are validated using the GPS-tracked motion of Surface Wave Instrument Float with Tracking (SWIFT) drifters, wave buoys, and R/V Sikuliaq during ice stations. The comparison between MR and reference sea ice drift measurements yields root-mean-square errors from 0.8 to 5.6 cm s−1. The MR sea ice velocity fields near the ice edge reveal strong horizontal gradients and peak speeds > 1 m s−1. The observed submesoscale sea ice drift processes include an eddy with ∼6 km diameter and vorticities <–2 (normalized by the Coriolis frequency) as well as converging and diverging flow with normalized divergences <–2 and >1, respectively. The sea ice drift speed correlates only weakly with the wind speed (r2 = 0.34), which presents a challenge to conventional wisdom. © 2018. American Geophysical Union.

In this method, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract the eigenvalue, and the suitable of texture features for sea ice classification was obtained, then we used support vector machine to carried out sea ice classification. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can recognize three types of ice, which are first year ice, multiyear ice and open water. Compared with the traditional methods of Neural Net and Maximum Likelihood, it is feasible to use SVM classification method and texture feature to monitor sea ice type. It also showed that multi-feature is helpful to improve the classification accuracy of SAR image, which verifies the effectiveness of this method and provides a new idea for sea ice classification. © 2018, Editorial Office of Haiyang Xuebao.

The mapping combines a mass conservation algorithm inland, multibeam echo sounding data in the fjord, and high-resolution airborne gravity data at the ice-ocean transition where other approaches have traditionally failed. We obtain a reliable, precision (±40 m) solution for bed topography across the ice-ocean boundary. The results reveal a 700 m deep fjord that abruptly ends on a 100–300 m deep sill along the calving fronts.

In this paper, four parameters including Pulse peakiness (PP), stack standard deviation (SSD), stack kurtosis (SKU) and stack skewness (SSK) are extracted from CryoSat-2 satellite altimetry waveform data. The four parameters are combined into five combinations (PP, PP&SSD, PP&SSD&SKU, PP&SSD&SSK, PP&SSD&SSK&SKU) with constrain conditions to detect the leads. The results of the five methods are compared with MODIS (moderate-resolution imagining spectroradiometer) images and show that, the combination of PP&SSD is better than the single PP, the rest of combinations are the same as the combination of PP&SSD.

Information gained from analysis of satellite data contributes to this understanding. In the course of using in situ data in combination with remotely sensed data, the question of how representative local scale measurements are of a wider region may arise. We compare in situ total sea-ice thickness measurements from the Norwegian young sea ICE expedition in the area north of Svalbard with airborne-derived total sea-ice thickness from electromagnetic soundings. A segmented and classified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) quad-pol ALOS-2 Palsar-2 satellite scene was grouped into three simplified ice classes.

The area fractions of the simplified classes from ground- A nd helicopter-based measurements are comparable with those achieved from the SAR data. Thus, this study shows that there is potential for a stepwise upscaling from in situ, to airborne, to satellite data, which allow us to assess whether in situ data collected are representative of a wider region as observed by satellites. © 2017 The Author(s).","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; ALOS; climate change; electromagnetic method; ice thickness; measurement method; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar","airborne electromagnetic soundings; electromagnetic induction; remote sensing; sea-ice; sea-ice classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042227714"

Hansbreen is a grounded tidewater glacier in southern Spitsbergen, Svalbard, with a rich history of field and remote sensing observations. The available data make this glacier suitable for evaluating mechanisms and controls on calving, some of which are considered in this paper. We use a full-Stokes thermomechanical 2D flow model (Elmer/Ice), paired with a crevasse-depth calving criterion, to estimate Hansbreen’s front position at a weekly time resolution. The basal sliding coefficient is re-calibrated every 4 weeks by solving an inverse model. We investigate the possible role of backpressure at the front (a function of ice mélange concentration) and the depth of water filling crevasses by examining the model’s ability to reproduce the observed seasonal cycles of terminus advance and retreat. Our results suggest that the ice-mélange pressure plays an important role in the seasonal advance and retreat of the ice front, and that the crevasse-depth calving criterion, when driven by modeled surface meltwater, closely replicates observed variations in terminus position. These results suggest that tidewater glacier behavior is influenced by both oceanic and atmospheric processes, and that neither of them should be ignored. © 2017 Otero, Navarro, Lapazaran, Welty, Puczko and Finkelnburg.","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Inverse problems; Models; Remote sensing; Calving; Hansbreen; Svalbard; Terminus position; Tidewater glaciers; calibration; glacier dynamics; glacier retreat; iceberg calving; inverse problem; melange; remote sensing; sea ice; thermomechanics; tidewater glacier; two-dimensional modeling; Ice","Calving; Hansbreen; Modeling; Svalbard; Terminus position; Tidewater glacier","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021362791"

Quantifying ridge characteristics is important for understanding total sea-ice mass and for improving the representation of sea-ice dynamics in high-resolution models. Multi-sensor measurements collected during annual Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne surveys of the Arctic provide new opportunities to assess the sea ice at the end of winter. We present a new methodology to derive ridge sail height from high-resolution OIB Digital Mapping System (DMS) visible imagery. We assess the efficacy of the methodology by mapping the full sail height distribution along 12 pressure ridges in the western and central Arctic. Comparisons against coincident Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) elevation anomalies are used to demonstrate the methodology and evaluate DMS-derived sail heights. Sail heights and elevation anomalies were correlated at 0.81 or above. On average mean and maximum sail height agreed with ATM elevation to within 0.11 and 0.49 m, respectively. Of the ridges mapped, mean sail height ranged from 0.99 to 2.16 m, while maximum sail height ranged from 2.1 to 4.8 m.

The radiometer measures brightness temperature spectra from 0.5 to 2 GHz using 12 channels, each of which measures scene brightness temperatures over an 88-MHz bandwidth resolved into 0.24-MHz intervals. The instrument was flown over northwestern Greenland in September 2016 and acquired the first, wideband, low-frequency brightness temperature spectra over the ice sheet and coastal region. The results reveal strong spatial and spectral variations that correlate well with the physical properties of the surface encountered along the flight path, which started over ocean, then passed the rock near the coast, and then up onto the ablation, wet, percolation, and dry snow zones of the interior ice sheet. In particular, strong spectral responses in percolation and dry snow zones are observed and plausibly explained by varying the distribution of horizontal density layers and isolated icy bodies in the upper portion of the firn.

Although the primary objective is the measurement of SSS, the instrument combination operates continuously, acquiring data over land and sea ice as well. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can occur in both the radiometer and the scatterometer bands of operation, and for this reason detection and mitigation of RFI was included in the data processing of both active and passive instruments.

Since the early 2000s, the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) at the University of Kansas (KU) has designed, developed, and deployed airborne ultrawide-band (UWB) FM-CW radars, called Snow Radars, on National Science Foundation (NSF)-, NASA-, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)-, and Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)-provided aircraft in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and generated a large amount of snow data products.

High-resolution satellite radar imagery for the ice-free season revealed that the coastal region in the south-east Belcher Islands is a hot spot for short-period internal wave activity. For a first investigation of tidal dynamics in the region, we took advantage of the sea ice platform to deploy an ice-tethered mooring consisting of nine conductivity and temperature sensors and an acoustic Doppler current profiler. The mooring was deployed at 65 m depth in January–March 2014 in a narrow channel between Broomfield and O′Leary islands located in the south-east tip of the Belcher Islands group in Hudson Bay (56°20′N, 79°30′W), northeast Canada. The surface mixed layer under the land-fast ice in this area stays relatively fresh through winter presumably because of significant winter river discharge in nearby James Bay. The mooring recorded oscillations of temperature and salinity throughout the whole water column, which were attributed to vertical displacement caused by internal tidal waves. The tidal harmonic analysis performed for the M2 tidal constituent showed the dominance of the baroclinic tide with maximum velocity amplitudes at the surface and decreasing with depth. Vertical displacements of water parcels derived from both temperature and salinity were statistically similar and displayed the maximum values of 11.9 m at 35 m (instrument depth). The combination of winter hydrographic data and summer satellite observations confirmed that the observed internal waves were generated by the interaction of strong tides, typical for Hudson Bay, with highly variable bottom topography south-east of the Belcher Islands archipelago. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Belcher Islands; Canada; Hudson Bay; James Bay; Nunavut; Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler; bottom topography; electrical conductivity; harmonic analysis; internal tide; mixed layer; radar imagery; remote sensing; river discharge; salinity; satellite imagery; sea ice; semidiurnal tide; synthetic aperture radar; water column","Arctic Ocean; Freshwater discharge; Hudson Bay; Internal waves; Land-fast sea ice; Remote sensing; SAR imaging; Semidiurnal tides, tidal analysis; Water dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051948509"

One of approaches to monitor sea ice in large area is microwave remote sensing data analysis. However, ground truth must be necessary to discuss the effectivity of this kind of approach. The conventional method to acquire ground truth of ice thickness is drilling ice layer and directly measuring the thickness by a ruler. However, this method is destructive, time-consuming and limited spatial resolution. Although there are several methods to acquire ice thickness in non-destructive way, ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be effective solution because it can discriminate snow-ice and ice-sea water interface. In this paper, we carried out GPR measurement in Lake Saroma for relatively large area (200m by 300m, approximately) aiming to obtain grand truth for remote sensing data. GPR survey was conducted at 5 locations in the area. The direct measurement was also conducted simultaneously in order to calibrate GPR data for thickness estimation and to validate the result. Although GPR Bscan image obtained from 600MHz contains the reflection which may come from a structure under snow, the origin of the reflection is not obvious. Therefore, further analysis and interpretation of the GPR image, such as numerical simulation, additional signal processing and use of 200MHz antenna, are required to move on thickness estimation. © Authors 2018.

Phytoplankton seasonal phenology is evaluated in the context of the recently proposed “disturbance-recovery” hypothesis relative to more traditional, exclusively “bottom-up” frameworks. All blooms occur when phytoplankton division rates exceed loss rates to permit sustained net population growth; however, the nature of this decoupling period varies regionally in Community Earth System Model. Regional case studies illustrate how unique pathways allow blooms to emerge despite very poor division rates or very strong grazing rates. In the Subantarctic, southeast Pacific small spring blooms initiate early cooccurring with deep mixing and low division rates, consistent with the disturbance-recovery hypothesis. Similar systematics are present in the Subantarctic, southwest Atlantic during the spring but are eclipsed by a subsequent, larger summer bloom that is coincident with shallow mixing and the annual maximum in division rates, consistent with a bottom-up, light limited framework. In the model simulation, increased iron stress prevents a similar summer bloom in the southeast Pacific. In the simulated Antarctic zone (70°S–65°S) seasonal sea ice acts as a dominant phytoplankton-zooplankton decoupling agent, triggering a delayed but substantial bloom as ice recedes.

We present and validate a reconstruction of Arctic snow depth based on observed sea ice motion and snowfall derived from reanalysis data. Overall, the reconstruction is in good agreement with direct measurements of snow depth from Operation IceBridge, slightly underestimating mean IceBridge snow depth. At the local scale (10 km), the reconstruction is more skilled than a weighted climatology over first year ice, but underestimates deeper snow over multi-year ice. Reconstructions of single buoy snow depths are unskilled, but the reconstruction shows skill in simulating the mean snow depth across all buoys. Spring snow depths show a lowto- high cross-Arctic gradient and tend to be greatest in the Atlantic sector of the eastern Arctic. The relationship between ice type (multiyear or first-year ice) and snow depth previously documented in the western Arctic is not evident in the eastern Arctic. Using ice type to weight snow depths for satellite ice thickness retrievals may not be justifiable in the eastern Arctic. Reconstructed snow depth across the Arctic shows significant interannual variability, suggesting that use of a fixed snow depth climatology may lead to biases in retrieved ice thickness and its variability. However, interannual variability in pan-Arctic mean snow depth is comparable or smaller than the uncertainty in both the reconstruction and IceBridge, highlighting the need for high accuracy snow depth products and reconstructions. © 2018.

Simulated sea-ice deformation from numerical simulations with 4.5, 9, and 18 km horizontal grid spacing and a viscous-plastic (VP) sea-ice rheology are compared with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite observations (RGPS, RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System) for the time period 1996-2008. All three simulations can reproduce the large-scale ice deformation patterns, but small-scale sea-ice deformations and linear kinematic features (LKFs) are not adequately reproduced. The mean sea-ice total deformation rate is about 40 % lower in all model solutions than in the satellite observations, especially in the seasonal sea-ice zone. A decrease in model grid spacing, however, produces a higher density and more localized ice deformation features. The 4.5 km simulation produces some linear kinematic features, but not with the right frequency. The dependence on length scale and probability density functions (PDFs) of absolute divergence and shear for all three model solutions show a power-law scaling behavior similar to RGPS observations, contrary to what was found in some previous studies. Overall, the 4.5 km simulation produces the most realistic divergence, vorticity, and shear when compared with RGPS data. This study provides an evaluation of high and coarse-resolution viscous-plastic sea-ice simulations based on spatial distribution, time series, and power-law scaling metrics. © Author(s) 2017.","deformation mechanism; glacier mass balance; numerical model; probability density function; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; sea ice; spatial distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021724917"

The Transpolar Drift conduit of sea ice and freshened upper-ocean waters across the Arctic Ocean passes over the North Pole region on its way to the North Atlantic through Fram and Nares Straits. The exported ice and freshened water stratifies the sub-Arctic seas and limits the vertical convection that ventilates the world ocean. Key variables such as ice thickness, bottom pressure, and hydrography in the North Pole region are thus sensitive indicators of changes over the whole Arctic Basin and how these affect the global ocean. Drifting buoys installed in the North Pole region by Great Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. address what would otherwise be a dearth of ocean, ice, and atmosphere observations in the central Arctic. A suite of satellite remote sensing tools such as ICESat/ICESat-2 from the U.S., GRACE from the U.S. and Germany, and CryoSat2 from the European Union extend the conclusions from central Arctic Ocean in situ observations to other regions. Detecting and understanding climate change requires observations over decadal and longer scales. We propose an international program as the key to sustaining these observations in the North Pole region. Such an international program would help immeasurably by 1) facilitating financial sharing of the burden of long-term measurements among several nations, (2) reducing logistics costs through economies of scale, and 3) providing a buffer against national funding, logistics, and geopolitical difficulties. © The Arctic Institute of North America.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Canada; Fram Strait; France; Germany; Japan; Nares Strait; North Pole; United Kingdom; United States; buoy system; climate change; climate effect; CryoSat; environmental indicator; European Union; global ocean; GRACE; ICESat; international aid; long-term change; oceanic convection; remote sensing; sea ice; upper ocean","Arctic Ocean; Climate; International effort; North Pole; Sustained observations","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045344662"

They typically occur in remote regions of the Arctic and Antarctic, thus remote sensing is essential for monitoring their dynamics. On regional scales, daily passive microwave radiometers provide useful information about their extent because of their independence from cloud coverage and daylight; nonetheless, their coarse resolution often does not allow an accurate discrimination between sea ice and open water. Despite its sensitivity to the presence of clouds, thermal infrared (TIR) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides higher-resolution information (typically 1 km) at large swath widths, several times per day, proving to be useful for the retrieval of the size of polynyas. In this study, we deal with Aqua satellite MODIS observations of a frequently occurring coastal polynya in the Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Ross Sea (Antarctica). The potential of a new methodology for estimating the variability of this polynya through MODIS TIR during the 2010 and 2011 freezing season (April to October) is presented and discussed. The polynya is observed in more than 1600 radiance scenes, after a preliminary filter evaluates and discards cloudy and fog-contaminated scenes. This reduces the useful MODIS swaths to about 50% of the available acquisitions, but a revisit time of less than 24 h is kept for about 90% of the study period. As expected, results show a high interannual variability with an opening/closing fluctuation clearly depending on the regime of the katabatic winds recorded by the automatic weather stations Rita and Eneide along the TNB coast. Retrievals are also validated through a comparison with a set of 196 co-located high-resolution ENVISAT ASAR images. Although our estimations slightly underestimate the ASAR derived extents, a good agreement is found, the linear correlation reaching 0.75 and the average relative error being about 6%. Finally, a sensitivity test on the applied thermal thresholds supports the effectiveness of our setting. © 2018 by the authors.","Estimation; Geodetic satellites; Infrared radiation; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Weather information services; Automatic weather stations; Katabatic winds; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Modis ice surface temperatures; Polynya extent; Terra Nova Bay polynyas; Terra nova bays; Thermal infrared imagery; Ice","Katabatic winds; MODIS thermal infrared imagery; Polynya extent; Sea ice; Terra Nova Bay","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043390944"

The method corrects the 2 m air temperature based on the difference between the modeled and the observed IST. Thus the correction includes biases in the surface forcing and the ability of the model to convert incoming parameters at the surface to a net heat flux. A multisensor, daily, gap-free surface temperature analysis has been constructed over the Arctic region. This study revealed challenges estimating the ground truth based on buoys measuring IST, as the quality of the measurement varied from buoy to buoy. With these precautions we find a cold temperature bias in the remotely sensed data, and a warm bias in the modeled data relative to ice mounted buoy temperatures, prior to assimilation. As a consequence, this study weighted the modeled IST and the observed IST equally in the correction. The impact of IST was determined for experiments with and without the assimilation of IST and sea-ice concentration. We find that assimilation of remotely sensed data results in a cooling of IST, which improves the timing of the snow melt onset. The improved snow cover in spring is only based on observations from one buoy, thus additional good quality observations could strengthen the conclusions. The ice cover and the sea-ice thickness are increased, primarily in the experiment without sea-ice concentration assimilation. © 2018.

They are also neighboring outlets, separated by the topographically unconfined eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier and the southwest tributary of Pine Island Glacier. This tributary begins just downstream of the eastern shear margin and flows into the Pine Island ice shelf. As a result, it is a potential locus of interaction between the two glaciers and could result in cross-catchment feedback during the retreat of either. Here, we analyze relative basal reflectivity profiles from three radar sounding survey lines collected using the UTIG HiCARS radar system in 2004 and CReSIS MCoRDS radar system in 2012 and 2014 to investigate the extent and character of ocean access beneath the southwest tributary. These profiles provide evidence of ocean access ~12 km inland of the 1992-2011 InSAR-derived grounding line by 2014, suggesting either retreat since 2011 or the intrusion of ocean water kilometers inland of the grounding line.

However, once the sea ice area melts, the area starts to absorb the solar radiation which accelerates the global warming. This means that the trend of global warming is likely to be enhanced in sea ice areas. In this study, the authors have developed a method to extract thin ice area using reflectance data of MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua satellites of NASA. The reflectance of thin sea ice in the visible region is rather low. Moreover, since the surface of thin sea ice is likely to be wet, the reflectance of thin sea ice in the near infrared region is much lower than that of visible region. Considering these characteristics, the authors have developed a method to extract thin sea ice areas by using the reflectance data of MODIS (NASA MYD09 product, 2017) derived from MODIS L1B. By using the scatter plots of the reflectance of Band 1(620nm-670nm) and Band 2(841nm-876nm)) of MODIS, equations for extracting thin ice area were derived. By using those equations, most of the thin ice areas which could be recognized from MODIS images were well extracted in the seasonal sea ice zones in the Northern Hemisphere, namely the Sea of Okhotsk, the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. For some limited areas, Landsat-8 OLI images were also used for validation. © Authors 2018.","Global warming; Infrared devices; NASA; Optical sensors; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Aqua satellites; Glaciology; Near infrared region; Northern Hemispheres; Reflectance data; Scatter plots; Sea of Okhotsk; Visible region; Sea ice","Glaciology; Global warming; Optical sensor; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046938434"

The resolution of the SIT chart is 1 km and that of the OWSI chart is 250 m. The charts are targeted to be used in development and validation of sea ice products from microwave sensor data. We improve the original MODIS cloud masks for the IST and R data, with a focus on identifying larger cloud-free areas in the data. The SIT estimation from the MODIS IST swath data follows previous studies. The daily SIT chart is composed from available swath charts by assigning daily median SIT to a pixel. The OWSI classification is simply conducted by a fixed threshold for the MODIS band 1 R. This was based on manually selected R data for various ice types in late winter, early melt, and advanced melt conditions. The composition procedures for the daily SIT and OWSI charts somewhat compensates for errors due to the undetected clouds. The SIT and OWSI charts were compared against manual ice charts by Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in Russia and by Norwegian Meteorological Institute, respectively, and on average, a good relationship between the charts was found. Pixel-wise comparison of the SIT and OWSI charts showed very good agreement in open water vs. sea ice classification, which gives further confidence on the reliability of our algorithms. We also demonstrate usage of the MODIS OWSI and SIT charts for validation of sea ice concentration charts based on the SENTINEL-1 SAR and AMSR2 radiometer data and two different algorithms. © 2017 by the author.","Graphic methods; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Fixed threshold; Microwave radiometers; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Research institutes; Sea ice classification; Sea ice concentration; Sea-ice thickness; Ice","Microwave radiometer; MODIS; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038208149"

However, the PM SIC threshold at the sea ice edge used in previous studies and released sea ice products has not always been consistent. To explore the representable value of the PM SIC threshold corresponding on average to the position of the Arctic sea ice edge during summer in recent years, we extracted sea ice edge boundaries from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea ice product (MOD29 with a spatial resolution of 1 km), MODIS images (250 m), and sea ice ship-based observation points (1 km) during the fifth (CHINARE-2012) and sixth (CHINARE-2014) Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions, and made an overlay and comparison analysis with PM SIC derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS, with a spatial resolution of 25 km) in the summer of 2012 and 2014. Results showed that the average SSMIS SIC threshold at the Arctic sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted from MOD29 was 33%, which was higher than that of the commonly used 15% discriminant threshold. The average SIC threshold at sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted by visual interpretation from four scenes of the MODIS image was 35% when compared to the average value of 36% from the MOD29 extracted ice edge pixels for the same days. The average SIC of 31% at the sea ice edge points extracted from ship-based observations also confirmed that choosing around 30% as the SIC threshold during summer is recommended for sea ice extent calculations based on SSMIS PM data. These results can provide a reference for further studying the variation of sea ice under the rapidly changing Arctic. © 2018 by the authors.

However, the correlation and redundancy among hyperspectral bands reduce the accuracy of traditional sea ice detection methods. Based on the spectral characteristics of sea ice, this study presents an improved similarity measurement method based on linear prediction (ISMLP) to detect sea ice. First, the first original band with a large amount of information is determined based on the mutual information theory. Subsequently, the second original band with the least similarity is chosen by the spectral correlation measure method. Finally, the subsequent bands are selected through the linear prediction method, and the support vector machine classifier model is utilized for sea ice classification. In the experiments of Baffin Bay, comparative analyses are carried out between the proposed method and traditional sea ice detection methods. Our proposed ISMLP method achieves the highest classification accuracy of 91.1805% in the experiment. The experimental results indicate that the ISMLP method exhibits better performance overall than other methods and can be effectively applied in hyperspectral sea ice detection. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Hyperspectral imaging; Information theory; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Band selection; Hyperspectral remote sensing technology; Linear prediction method; Mutual information theory; Similarity measure; Similarity measurements; Spectral characteristics; Support vector machine classifiers; Ice","Band Selection; Classification; Hyperspectral Image; Sea Ice; Similarity Measure","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028504927"

To quantify past landscape changes as a guide to assessing future climate impacts to the YKD and how indigenous society may adapt to change, we photo-interpreted ecotypes at 600 points within 12 grids in a 2118 km2 area along the central YKD coast using a time-series of air photos from 1948-1955 and 1980 and satellite images from 2007-2008 (IKONOS) and 2013-2016 (WorldView). We found that ecotype classes changed 16.2% (342 km2) overall during the ~62 years. Ecotypes changed 6.0% during 1953-1980, 7.2% during 1980-2007 and 3.8% during 2007-2015. Lowland Moist Birch-Ericaceous Low Scrub (-5.0%) and Coastal Saline Flat Barrens (-2.3%) showed the greatest decreases in area, while LowlandWater Sedge Meadow (+1.7%) and Lacustrine Marestail Marsh (+1.3%) showed the largest increases. Dominant processes affecting change were permafrost degradation (5.3%), channel erosion (3.0%), channel deposition (2.2%), vegetation colonization (2.3%) and lake drainage (1.5%), while sedimentation, water-level fluctuations, permafrost aggradation and shoreline paludification each affected < 0.5% of the area. Rates of change increased dramatically in the late interval for permafrost degradation (from 0.06 to 0.26%/year) and vegetation colonization (from 0.03 to 0.16%/year), while there was a small decrease in channel deposition (from 0.05 to 0.0%/year) due largely to barren mudflats being colonized by vegetation. In contrast, rates of channel erosion remained fairly constant. The increased permafrost degradation coincided with increasing storm frequency and air temperatures. We attribute increased permafrost degradation and vegetation colonization during the recent interval mostly to the effects of a large storm in 2005, which caused extensive salt-kill of vegetation along the margins of permafrost plateaus and burial of vegetation on active tidal flats by mud that was later recolonized. Due to the combination of extremely flat terrain, sea-level rise, sea-ice reduction that facilitates more storm flooding and accelerating permafrost degradation, we believe the YKD is the most vulnerable region in the Arctic to climate warming. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Erosion; Forestry; Geomorphology; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Sedimentation; Storms; Time series; Truck drivers; Vegetation; Water levels; Wetlands; Alaska; Coastal ecotypes; Landscape changes; Salinization; Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Ecosystems","Alaska; Coastal ecotypes; Drivers; Landscape change; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Salinization; Time-series; Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051621543"

One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22. The best performing set will be implemented operationally in the next V23 MISR AOD product release. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Antarctica; Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Cameras; Clouds; Lenses; Light scattering; Luminance; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Stray light; Aerosol optical depths; Internal reflections; Light coefficient; Maritime aerosols; MODIS; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Operational retrievals; Spectro-radiometers; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; correction; light; light effect; light scattering; MISR; model; optical depth; reflectivity; remote sensing; wavelength; Air pollution","Air pollution; remote sensing; spectroradiometers; stray light","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038858480"

This paper presents a set of dedicated algorithms able to process consistently returns from open ocean and from sea-ice leads in the Arctic Ocean (detection of water surfaces and derivation of water levels using returns from these surfaces). This processing extends the area over which a precise sea level can be computed. In the frame of the European Space Agency Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (http://cci.esa.int), we have first developed a new surface identification method combining two complementary solutions, one using a multiple-criteria approach (in particular the backscattering coefficient and the peakiness coefficient of the waveforms) and one based on a supervised neural network approach. Then, a new physical model has been developed (modified from the Brown model to include anisotropy in the scattering from calm protected water surfaces) and has been implemented in a maximum likelihood estimation retracker. This allows us to process both sea-ice lead waveforms (characterized by their peaky shapes) and ocean waveforms (more diffuse returns), guaranteeing, by construction, continuity between open ocean and ice-covered regions.

In contrast with other competing remote sensing technologies, such as synthetic aperture radar and optical systems, typically exploited in the field of sea target detection, GNSS-R systems could be employed as satellite constellations, so as to fulfill the temporal requirements for near real-time ships and sea ice sheets monitoring. In this study, the revisit time offered by GNSS-R systems is quantitatively evaluated by means of a simulation analysis, in which three different realistic GNSS-R missions are simulated and analyzed. Then, a sea target detection algorithm from spaceborne GNSS-R DDMs is described and assessed. The algorithm is based on a sea clutter compensation step and uses an adaptive threshold to take into account spatial variations in the sea background and/or noise statistics. Finally, the sea target detector algorithm is tested and validated for the first time ever using experimental GNSS-R data from the U.K. TechDemoSat-1 dataset.

Passive microwave sensors can see through most clouds and collect measurements both day and night, which is especially useful in high latitudes during polar night. Passive microwave measurements are used to derive significant and meaningful climate records of many parameters, including the dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice. Earlier revisions of this significant climate record have been produced as flat, binary, gridded arrays with minimal or no file-level metadata and no machine-readable geolocation. Developed for many applications in polar regions, data were projected to polar azimuthal and global cylindrial projections that users found difficult to handle in standard mapping software packages.

Here, we develop an approach to assess the small-scale deformation of landfast ice critical to on-ice operations using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). InSAR has previously proven successful in determining long-term qualitative climatology of ice deformation around on-ice operations, but is now used to explore its potential for providing quantitative guidance for ice road planning, construction, and maintenance. A validation effort using X-band SAR and high-precision GPS data over Elson Lagoon, Alaska, confirms the ability of InSAR to accurately estimate 3-dimensional sea ice strain values accumulated between SAR image acquisitions, using an inverse model. The inverse model was further applied to L-band InSAR data over the Northstar Island ice road near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Assuming an elasto-brittle rheology, the derived strain values yielded a spatial distribution of internal stress consistent with preexisting ice defects and morphology. In several localized regions of the study area, stress values exceeded expected yield stress. Resulting relative fracture intensity potential was shown to conform with local knowledge based on road inspections by engineers, and may be used to guide ice road planning, construction and maintenance efforts. The results presented here demonstrate that InSAR is an accurate tool for estimating landfast ice deformation and stability in support of ice use. The findings may also provide substantial new insights into the mechanics of landfast ice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alaska; Arctic; Elson Lagoon; United States; Deformation; Fracture; Global positioning system; Highway planning; Interferometry; Knowledge based systems; Radar; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Yield stress; ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Ice roads; Land-fast; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; TerraSAR-X; Trafficability; ALOS; fracture; ice thickness; PALSAR; radar interferometry; remote sensing; sea ice; stress; TerraSAR-X; Ice","ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Ice roads; Ice stability; Ice strain; Ice trafficability; Landfast ice; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; TerraSAR-X","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042333714"

For example, increases in melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and reductions in sea ice and permafrost distribution are likely to alter coastal morphodynamics. The deltas of Greenland are largely unaffected by human activity, but increased freshwater runoff and sediment fluxes may increase the size of the deltas, whereas increased wave activity in ice-free periods could reduce their size, with the net impact being unclear until now. Here we show that southwestern Greenland deltas were largely stable from the 1940s to 1980s, but prograded (that is, sediment deposition extended the delta into the sea) in a warming Arctic from the 1980s to 2010s. Our results are based on the areal changes of 121 deltas since the 1940s, assessed using newly discovered aerial photographs and remotely sensed imagery. We find that delta progradation was driven by high freshwater runoff from the Greenland Ice Sheet coinciding with periods of open water. Progradation was controlled by the local initial environmental conditions (that is, accumulated air temperatures above 0 °C per year, freshwater runoff and sea ice in the 1980s) rather than by local changes in these conditions from the 1980s to 2010s at each delta. This is in contrast to a dominantly eroding trend of Arctic sedimentary coasts along the coastal plains of Alaska, Siberia and western Canada, and to the spatially variable patterns of erosion and accretion along the large deltas of the main rivers in the Arctic. Our results improve the understanding of Arctic coastal evolution in a changing climate, and reveal the impacts on coastal areas of increasing ice mass loss and the associated freshwater runoff and lengthening of open-water periods. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.","Alaska; Arctic; Arctic; Canada; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Siberia; United States; fresh water; aerial photograph; climate change; coastal evolution; coastal plain; environmental conditions; freshwater; glacier mass balance; human activity; morphodynamics; open water; permafrost; progradation; remote sensing; runoff; satellite imagery; sea ice; sediment yield; air temperature; arctic climate; Article; climate change; deglaciation; Greenland; ice sheet; priority journal; runoff; sea ice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030701457"

Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent thin layer effects. The model is applied to study microwave signatures of the Arctic sea ice where the snow cover thickness has rapidly decreased. Microwave signatures are important in classification of sea-ice types and in quantitative characterization of snow cover properties. Both have strong impacts on the thermodynamics of sea ice. In the fully coherent model, a half-space dyadic Green's function is used in the volume integral equation to represent the effects of the underlying sea ice. Discrete dipole approximation is used to solve the volume integral equations, where parallel fast Fourier transform technique is utilized to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplications.

In the Arctic, decreasing sea ice extent is driving increasing fisheries development, highlighting the need for ecological data to inform management. In Cumberland Sound, southwest Baffin Island, an indigenous community fishery was established in 1987 targeting Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) through the ice. Following its development, the Cumberland Sound Management Boundary (CSMB) was designated and a total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to the fishery. The CSMB was based on a sink population of Greenland halibut resident in the northern section of the Sound. Recent fishing activities south of the CSMB, however, raised concerns over fish residency, the effectiveness of the CSMB and the sustainability of the community-based winter fishery. Through acoustic telemetry monitoring at depths between 400 and 1200 m, and environmental and fisheries data, this study examined the movement patterns of Greenland halibut relative to the CSMB, the biotic and abiotic factors driving fish movement and the dynamics of the winter fishery. Greenland halibut undertook clear seasonal movements between the southern and northern regions of the Sound driven by temperature, dissolved oxygen, and sea ice cover with most fish crossing the CSMB on an annual basis. Over the lifespan of the fishery, landfast ice cover initially declined and then became variable, limiting accessibility to favored fisher locations. Concomitantly, catch per unit effort declined, reflecting the effect of changing ice conditions on the location and effort of the fishery. Ultimately, these telemetry data revealed that fishers now target less productive sites outside of their favored areas and, with continued decreases in ice, the winter fishery might cease to exist. In addition, these novel telemetry data revealed that the CSMB is ineffective and led to its relocation to the entrance of the Sound in 2014. The community fishery can now develop an open-water fishery in addition to the winter fishery to exploit the TAC, which will ensure the longevity of the fishery under projected climate-change scenarios. Telemetry shows great promise as a tool for understanding deep-water species and for directly informing fisheries management of these ecosystems that are inherently complex to study. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Animal Distribution; Animal Migration; Animals; Arctic Regions; Canada; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fisheries; Flounder; Oceans and Seas; Remote Sensing Technology; Baffin Island; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Cumberland Sound; Nunavut; Reinhardtius hippoglossoides; acoustic method; biomonitoring; biotelemetry; catch per unit effort; coastal water; fishery management; fishing community; flatfish; ice cover; movement; population estimation; seasonality; spatial analysis; animal; animal dispersal; Arctic; Canada; environmental protection; fishery; flounder; population migration; procedures; remote sensing; sea","acoustic telemetry; Canadian Arctic; catch per unit effort; declining ice cover; fisher location; fisheries planning; Reinhardtius hippoglossoides","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017099430"

The core of the method is a forward model which can ingest bulk data for seven geophysical parameters to reproduce the brightness temperatures observed by a passive microwave radiometer. The retrieval method inverts the forward model and produces ensembles of the seven parameters, wind speed, integrated water vapor, liquid water path, sea and ice temperature, sea ice concentration and multiyear ice fraction. The method is constrained using numerical weather prediction data in order to retrieve a set of geophysical parameters that best fit the measurements. A sensitivity study demonstrates the method is robust and that the solution it provides is not dependent on initialization conditions. The retrieval parameters have been compared with the Arctic Systems Reanalysis model data as well as columnar water vapor retrieved from satellite microwave sounders and the Remote Sensing Systems AMSR-E ocean retrieval product in order to determine the feasibility of using the same setup over pure surface with 100% and 0% sea ice cover, respectively. Sea ice concentration retrieval shows good skill for pure surface cases. Ice types retrieval is in good agreement with scatterometer backscatter data. Deficiencies have been identified in using the forward model over sea ice for retrieving atmospheric parameters, that are connected to the treatment of surface emissivity and surface temperature.

The estimation of these parameters mainly relies on satellite based remote sensing, and current retrieval algorithms usually focus on the retrieval of a single parameter under simple assumptions over the other. In this article, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth through the data synergy two types of concurrent observations of the sea ice cover: the active altimetry and the L-band passive remote sensing. The data synergy is based on two physical constrains: (1) L-band (1.4 GHz) radiation model for the sea ice cover, and (2) the hydrostatic equilibrium as used in satellite altimetry. Two schemes of data synergy are proposed: (1) the synergy between L-band brightness temperature (TB) from passive microwave remote sensing and sea ice freeboard (FBice) as measured by radar altimetry, and (2) the synergy between L-band TB and snow freeboard (FBsnow) as measured by laser altimetry. Based on retrievability studies, we show that both parameters can be retrieved using the two sets of data. Specifically, we show that there is potential problem of ill-posedness for the synergy between L-band TB and FBsnow, with two possible retrieval solutions for a small portion of the solution space. On the other hand, the synergy between L-band TB and FBice is always well-posed. In terms of sensitivity, lower uncertainty is witnessed for thin ice for the retrieval with FBice, while the retrieval with FBsnow shows advantage for thick ice. Besides the input parameters of TB, FBice and FBsnow, the uncertainty associated with certain model parameters such as snow and ice densities is not negligible for the uncertainty estimation of the retrieved parameters. Verification is carried out with observational data from Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns and SMOS satellite, showing that both sea ice thickness and snow depth can be attained by the proposed retrieval algorithms. These algorithms serve as the basis for large-scale retrieval with satellite remote sensing data, including concurrent observation of the Arctic Ocean by independent satellite campaigns such as SMOS, CryoSat-2 and ICESat. © 2017 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Climate change; Luminance; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Space optics; Temperature; Altimetry; Brightness temperatures; Hydrostatic equilibrium; L-band passive microwave remote sensing; Passive microwave remote sensing; Passive remote sensing; Retrieval; Satellite remote sensing data; Ice","Altimetry; Brightness temperature; Passive microwave remote sensing; Retrieval; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032878733"

The distribution of its colonies owns essential significance for the study of Antarctic climate. Emperor penguins are sensitive to changes of the sea ice concentration and distribution. Thus, they have become an essential species for investigation on the effect of climate changes on the Antarctic ecosystems. However, it is difficult for the traditional manual investigation to obtain comprehensive and accurate information of the population colonies. Although some researchers have devoted to find emperor penguin colonies using remote sensing imageries in recent years, but their methods require considerable human involvement and cannot be used to detect all colonies rapidly and effectively. Emperor penguins breed and rest on land-fast sea ice and live in the same area for about six months, leaving extensive yellowish brown faeces which are significantly different from the white ice and snow around them. Inspired by the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which is used for delineating snow cover, we can establish a/some similar index(s) to extract the faeces from extensive snow cover. On the basis of the difference between the reflectance of the faeces produced by emperor penguin in blue and red band, near infrared and shortwave infrared bands, two spectral indexes (NDII, EI) are putted forward to effectively recognize the faeces produced by emperor penguins, and determine their colony locations. According to the 195 scenes appropriate and quality-good Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery in 2009, a total of 38 emperor penguins colonies are obtained, 7 colonies of which are newly discovered (Bowman Island, Dibble Glacier, Auster, Point Geologie, Cape Crozier, Brownson Islands and Rupert Coast), 2 colonies have disappeared (Amundsen Bay disappeared and Ledda Bay), and the positions of the other 25 colonies (except Thuston Glacier, Luitpold, Sanae, Gould, Ragnhild and Beaufort Island) do not change significantly. The overall accuracy of colony detection is about 94% and the performance of the colony detection is influenced by the data quality and colony size. The performance of this method improves with increasing colony population size. Although spectral attributes are chosen to identify faeces produced by emperor penguins, some misclassifications may happen. This method may miss a few small colonies of which the sizes are smaller than spatial resolution of the imagery. The failure of detecting these colonies of small size is most likely due to the mixing of non-colony terrain in the Landsat pixels. These smaller colonies may well be identified by the satellites that have higher pixel resolution, and this method can be adapted to other high spatial resolution of satellite data in the future. The distribution of emperor penguin colonies is closely related to the climatic factors, and colonies tend to gather at the regions where temperature is low and ice concentration is high. It is different for climate change occurring at different colonies. Long-time and regional observations are needed to study the relationship between climate and the changes to the distribution of colonies. With the continued rise of the air temperature and the change of ice concentration, the colonies of which the latitude are below 70 °S are facing greater threat, and emperor penguin population shows a trend to shrink to the southern pole. © 2017, Science Press.

Ice cores extracted during the evolution of the sea ice prior and post oil injection allowed the investigation of the profile's properties and the oil distribution. Furthermore, chemical composition and microstructure analysis were performed via a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and X-ray, respectively. The time-series radar signature of the profile was measured utilizing ground penetration radar at 500 MHz and a C-band scatterometer.

Sea-ice melt pond fraction fp has been shown to be correlated with the September minimum ice extent due to its impact on ice albedo and heat uptake. Ice forecasts should benefit from knowledge of fp as melt ponds form several months in advance of ice retreat. This study goes further back by examining the potential to predict fp during winter using backscatter data from the commonly available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar. An object-based image analysis links the winter and spring thermodynamic states of first-year and multiyear sea-ice types. Strong correlations between winter backscatter and spring fp, detected from high-resolution visible to near infrared imagery, are observed, and models for the retrieval of fp from Sentinel-1 data are provided (r2 ≥ 0.72). The models utilize HH polarization channel backscatter that is routinely acquired over the Arctic from the two-satellite Sentinel-1 constellation mission, as well as other past, current and future SAR missions operating in the same C-band frequency.

In this study, we propose an optical flow and super-resolution approach to accurately estimate motion from remote sensing images at a higher spatial resolution than the original data. First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical flow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector field with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical flow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientific and operational applications. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A number of surface-following buoys were deployed in sea ice from the R/V Sikuliaq, which also hosted an X-band marine radar, during the ONR Arctic Sea State field experiment. The heave-slope-correlation method was used to estimate the root-mean-square wave number from the buoys. The method was highly sensitive to noise, and extensive quality control measures were developed to isolate real signals in the estimated wave number. The buoy measurements were complemented by shipboard marine X-band radar dispersion measurements, which are limited to lower frequencies (<0.32 Hz). Overall, deviation from the linear open water dispersion relation was not significant, and matched the open water relation nearly exactly for the range 0.10–0.30 Hz. Isolating a subset of data during the strongest wave event showed evidence of increased wave numbers at frequencies greater than 0.30 Hz. The ice conditions and deviation from linear open water dispersion were qualitatively consistent with predictions from the mass loading model. However, the dispersion curves did not exactly follow the contours of the mass loading model, suggesting either measurement error or other processes at play. © 2018. American Geophysical Union.

Uncertainties in the retrieved cloud optical thickness and cloud droplet effective radius reff;C may arise from uncertainties in the assumed spectral surface albedo, which is mainly determined by the generally unknown effective snow grain size reff;S. Therefore, in a first step the effects of the assumed snow grain size are systematically quantified for the conventional bispectral retrieval technique of and reff;C for liquid water clouds. In general, the impact of uncertainties of reff;S is largest for small snow grain sizes. While the uncertainties of retrieved are independent of the cloud optical thickness and solar zenith angle, the bias of retrieved reff;C increases for optically thin clouds and high Sun. The largest deviations between the retrieved and true original values are found with 83% for and 62% for reff;C. In the second part of the paper a retrieval method is presented that simultaneously derives all three parameters (, reff;C, reff;S) and therefore accounts for changes in the snow grain size. Ratios of spectral cloud reflectivity measurements at the three wavelengths λ1 D 1040 nm (sensitive to reff;S), λ2 D 1650 nm (sensitive to ), and λ3 D 2100 nm (sensitive to reff;C) are combined in a trispectral retrieval algorithm. In a feasibility study, spectral cloud reflectivity measurements collected by the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem (SMART) during the research campaign Vertical Distribution of Ice in Arctic Mixed-Phase Clouds (VERDI, April/May 2012) were used to test the retrieval procedure. Two cases of observations above the Canadian Beaufort Sea, one with dense snow-covered sea ice and another with a distinct snow-covered sea ice edge are analysed. The retrieved values of , reff;C, and reff;S show a continuous transition of cloud properties across snow-covered sea ice and open water and are consistent with estimates based on satellite data. It is shown that the uncertainties of the trispectral retrieval increase for high values of , and low reff;S but nevertheless allow the effective snow grain size in cloud-covered areas to be estimated. © 2017 Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; algorithm; cloud droplet; cloud water; grain size; instrumentation; optical property; parameter estimation; reflectivity; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; snow; solar radiation; spectral analysis; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028732821"

First, slow rotation 2 r/min AMSR-E data is used to derive regression equations from colocated pairs of AMSR2 and AMSR-E brightness temperatures (Tbs). The regression equations are used to modify AMSR2 Tbs into AMSR-E equivalent Tbs that are then input into the NASA Team 2 (NT2) sea ice concentration algorithm used for the AMSR-E standard products. The regressed Tbs result in changes in sea ice concentration of a few percent compared to using the original un-regressed AMSR2 Tbs. Next, sea ice estimates from the F17 SSMIS sensor are used as a bridge to compare AMSR-E total sea ice extent estimates in 2010 with AMSR2 total sea ice extent estimates in 2013. Based on this comparison, a further adjustment is made to a weather filter threshold used in the NT2 algorithm to minimize the total extent bias between AMSR2 and AMSR-E using a double-differencing approach. The adjustments reduced apparent bias with AMSR-E from ∼200 000 km2 for the original unmodified AMSR2 Tbs to-700 and 4700 km2 for the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. These differences are within the range of previous passive microwave sea ice intercalibrations. The adjusted AMSR2 sea ice fields provide a nearly 15-year time series of sea ice change; depending on the lifetime of AMSR2 and possible follow-on sensors, AMSR2 has the potential to be part of a multidecadal record of sea ice change. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Antarctica; Arctic; NASA; Remote sensing; Sea ice; AMSR2; antarctic; arctic; Brightness temperatures; Passive microwaves; Regression equation; Sea ice concentration; Standard products; algorithm; AMSR-E; calibration; concentration (composition); remote sensing; rotation; satellite data; sea ice; Ice","AMSR2; antarctic; arctic; passive microwave (PM); remote sensing; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023158714"

The CE600 allows measuring radiance simultaneously in all directions of a hemisphere at a 1° angular resolution. The spectral characteristics of the reflectance and its dependency on illumination conditions obtained from the camera are compared to those obtained with a hyperspectral field spectroradiometer manufactured by Analytical Spectral Device, Inc. (ASD). Results confirm the potential of the CE600, with the suggested measurement setup and data processing, to measure commensurable sea ice and snow hemispherical-directional reflectance factor, HDRF, values. Compared to the ASD, the reflectance anisotropy measured with the CE600 provides much higher resolution in terms of directional reflectance (N = 16,020). The hyperangular resolution allows detecting features that were overlooked using the ASD due to its limited number of measurement angles (N = 25). This data set of HDRF further documents variations in the anisotropy of the reflectance of snow and ice with the geometry of observation and illumination conditions and its spectral and spatial scale dependency. Finally, in order to reproduce the hyperangular CE600 reflectance measurements over the entire 400–900 nm spectral range, a regression-based method is proposed to combine the ASD and CE600 measurements. Results confirm that both instruments may be used in synergy to construct a hyperangular and hyperspectral snow and ice reflectance anisotropy data set. ©2018.

According to conventional models the microwave radar backscattering at moderate and large incidence angles is determined by resonance (Bragg) surface waves of cm-scale wavelength range, and by non polarized (non Bragg) component which is associated with wave breaking and is supposed to be independent on polarization. At present our understanding of physical origin of different components of radar return is still insufficient. In particular, an important problem of variations of Bragg and non Bragg components (BC and NBC, respectively) along the profile of a long surface wave remains poorly investigated. This paper is focused on data processing and analysis of results of field studies of BC and NBC variations over the long wave profile using dual co-polarized X-band radar. It is demonstrated that the intensities of Bragg and non Bragg components are non-uniformly distributed over the long wave profile: BC is not strongly modulated due to long surface waves and dominates near the long wave troughs. NBC is characterized by the appearance of strong spikes near the crests of intensive long waves and contributes significantly to the radar return in the spikes supposedly due to intensification of breaking of short, cm-dm-scale wind waves. It is shown that relation between BC and NBC changes in the presence of surfactants on the water surface because of different suppression of the two components in slicks. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Backscattering; Data handling; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Surface waves; Conventional models; Data processing and analysis; Long waves; Ocean remote sensing; Radar backscatter; Radar backscattering; Wavelength ranges; X-band Radars; Water waves","distribution of Bragg and non Bragg components of radar return over the long wave profile; Dual-polarized X-band radar; VV and HH radar backscatter","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056458739"

Passive microwave remote sensing has the advantage of completing all weather observations that disregard cloud interference, which has received increasing attention. FY-3C satellites, which carry a Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI) onboard, were successfully launched on December 23, 2013. Therefore, using the FY-3C MWRI to retrieve the SST is crucial. The FY-3C MWRI SST uses statistical algorithms. First, MWRI precipitation and sea ice products were used to remove the precipitation and sea ice data. Second, the MWRI brightness temperature was matched with the buoy SST using a temporal window of 0.2 h and a spatial window of 0.2°. The matchup with land within 100 km was excluded. Third, the descending and ascending statistical relationship, which was divided into four latitudes and 12 months, between the buoy SST observation and MWRI bright temperature was established. In addition, 4 × 12 × 2 regression coefficients were obtained, and corresponding regression coefficients were used to estimate the SST. The daily SST was obtained using a 0.25° × 0.25° equal latitude and longitude projections. The quality flag is set to 51 when the FY-3C MWRI SST minus a 30-year monthly mean SST is greater than 2.5 K, thereby indicating that these pixels were distributed on the edge of the land and high wind-speed region. The quality validation of the FY-3C MWRI SST after excluding the pixels with a quality flag of 51 shows that the precision of the ascending orbit SST is -0.02±1.22 K and that of the descending orbit SST is -0.15±1.28 K in comparison with the global buoy data. The precision of the ascending daily SST is 0.00±1.03 K and that of the descending daily SST is -0.09±1.08 K in comparison with the global analysis field OISST. The ascending orbit is more accurate than the descending orbit considering the non-uniform heating of the ocean surface during the day (the descending orbit). The Kuroshio Current, Gulf Stream, Western Pacific Warm Pool, and La Nina are included in the monthly SST, thereby suggesting that this SST is applicable to climatology investigation. The results of the quality validation of the FY-3C MWRI SST include the FY-3C quality control system. The SST precision is influenced by the performance, calibration, and positioning accuracy of the MWRI, precipitation and sea ice detection accuracy, land interference, and high wind speed. The improvement of the precision of the SST with a wind speed that is higher than 12 m/s is the emphasis of the next step. The buoy SST and global analysis field OISST cannot be considered a completely true value. Therefore, the triple collocation method will be utilized in the future to improve the comprehensive analysis of the error characteristics of the SST. © 2018, Science Press.

NN retrievals are compared with retrievals obtained using other algorithms, including OCI/OCx and Semi-analytical algorithm for both complex and open ocean waters. VIIRS KB HABs retrievals in the WFS, using NN and other algorithms, are first compared against all co-incident in-situ cell count measurements available between 2012-16. Next, we compared retrievals obtained for different algorithms using in-situ radiometric Rrs measurements against sample measurements, 2017-18, for both the WFS and Atlantic coasts. Retrieval statistics showed (i) the important impact of short term (15-20 minutes) temporal variations and sample depth considerations in complex bloom waters. These limit satellite retrieval accuracies and utility; and (ii) particularly for high chlorophyll bloom waters, better retrieval accuracies were obtained with NN followed by OCI/OCx algorithms. Likely rationales: the longer Rrs wavelengths used with NN are less vulnerable (i) to atmospheric correction inadequacies than the deeper blue wavelengths used with other algorithms, and (ii) to spectral interference by CDOM in more complex waters. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Algae control; Chlorophyll; Complex networks; Hydrophilicity; Neural networks; Oceanography; Radiometry; Reflection; Sea ice; Supercomputers; Toxic materials; Chlorophyll a; Florida; Harmful algal blooms; Karenia brevis; normalized fluorescence height; Ocean color remote sensing; Remote sensing","harmful algal blooms; Karenia brevis; neural networks; normalized fluorescence height; ocean color remote sensing reflectance; retrieved chlorophyll-a; West Florida Shelf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056455339"

The accuracy of sea ice detection depends on the number and quality of labeled samples, but because of environmental conditions in sea ice regions, acquisition of labeled samples can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, we propose a combined active learning (AL) and semisupervised learning (SSL) classification framework for sea ice detection. At first, we acquire most informative and representative samples by AL; then labeled samples acquired by AL are used as the initial labeled samples for SSL, in this framework, we not only choose the most valuable samples but also use the large number of unlabeled samples to enhance the classification accuracy. In AL phase, we use two different sampling strategies: uncertainty and diversity. In the SSL phase, we utilize a sampling function integrating AL to acquire semilabeled samples, and we use a transductive support vector machine as a classification model. We analyze three remote sensing images (hyperspectral and multispectral) and conduct detailed comparative analyses between the proposed method and others. Our proposed method achieves the highest classification accuracies (89.9734%, 97.4919%, and 89.7166%) in both experiments. These results show that the proposed method exhibits better overall performance than other methods and can be effectively applied to sea ice detection using remote sensing. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Artificial intelligence; Sea ice; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Active Learning; Classification framework; Environmental conditions; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing technology; Semi- supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning (SSL); Transductive support vector machine; Remote sensing","active learning; remote sensing image; sea ice; semisupervised learning; transductive support vector machine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047757243"

The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification. We present a comprehensive polarimetric feature analysis and classification results on a dataset acquired off the eastern Greenland coast, along with comparisons of results obtained from near-coincident (spatially and temporally) C -band fully polarimetric imagery acquired by RADARSAT-2. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Greenland; Classification (of information); Ellipsometry; Extraction; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Artificial neural network classifiers; Classification results; Compact polarimetries; Radarsat-2; RISAT-1; Sea ice classification; Supervised classification; Synthetic aperture radar polarimetries; algorithm; artificial neural network; pattern recognition; radar imagery; RADARSAT; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Artificial neural network; compact polarimetry (CP); feature extraction; RADARSAT-2; RISAT-1; sea ice classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019952537"

Unfortunately, observational estimates of this contribution to atmospheric drag variability are spatially and temporally limited. Here we present new estimates of the neutral atmospheric form drag coefficient over Arctic sea ice in early spring, using high-resolution Airborne Topographic Mapper elevation data from NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We utilize a new three-dimensional ice topography data set and combine this with an existing parameterization scheme linking surface feature height and spacing to form drag. To be consistent with previous studies investigating form drag, we compare these results with those produced using a new linear profiling topography data set. The form drag coefficient from surface feature variability shows lower values (<0.5–1 ×10−3) in the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas, compared with higher values (>0.5–1 ×10−3) in the more deformed ice regimes of the Central Arctic (north of Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago), which increase with coastline proximity. The results show moderate interannual variability, including a strong increase in the form drag coefficient from 2013 to 2014/2015 north of the Canadian Archipelago. The form drag coefficient estimates are extrapolated across the Arctic with Advanced Scatterometer satellite radar backscatter data, further highlighting the regional/interannual drag coefficient variability. Finally, we combine the results with existing parameterizations of form drag from floe edges (a function of ice concentration) and skin drag to produce, to our knowledge, the first pan-Arctic estimates of the total neutral atmospheric drag coefficient (in early spring) from 2009 to 2015. ©2017.

The random rough surface models were applied to soil surfaces and ocean surfaces. The discrete random media models were applied to snow and vegetation. For rough surface scattering, we use the surface integral equations of Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai that are solved by the method of moments using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions. The sparse matrix canonical grid method is used to accelerate the matrix column multiplications. In modeling the rough surfaces, we use the exponential correlation functions for soil surfaces and the Durden-Vesecky ocean spectrum for ocean surfaces. In scattering by terrestrial snow and snow on sea ice, we use the volume integral equations formulated with the dyadic half-space Green's function. The microstructure of snow is modeled by the bicontinuous media. In scattering by vegetation, we use the discrete scatterers of cylinder. The NMM3D formulation is based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations in conjunction with the body of revolution for a single scatterer. For rough surface scattering, simulations results are compared with advanced integral equation model, small slope approximation, small perturbation method, and two scale model. For volume scattering by snow, results are compared with the bicontinuous dense media radiative transfer. For scattering by vegetation, results are compared with distorted Born approximation and radiative transfer equation.

In recent 40 years, a series of environmental and climatic issues such as degradation of Arctic natural environment, frequent extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere and global sea-level rise are caused by continuous warming and apparent sea ice decrease in Arctic. So it's important to know the extent, variation, trend of Arctic sea ice and its response to global climate change. The most commonly used datasets such as HadISST and OISST sea ice dataset provided long time series of changes in sea ice of the Arctic regions. However, the spatial resolution of these datasets is relatively low. There are some limits in the study of response of sea ice change in Arctic key regions to weather and climate in China. To overcome these problems and to make up the lack of passive microwave sea ice dataset provided by China, FY (Feng Yun) sea ice dataset is developed by NSMC (National Satellite Meteorological Center) on June 27th, 2011. In this dataset, the Enhanced NASA Team (NT2) algorithm is used based on the data of MWRI (Microwave Radiation Imager) sensor carried on FY satellite. In this algorithm, direct radiative transfer model is used to model MWRI brightness temperature for four surface types (ice-free ocean, new-formed ice, one-year ice and multi-years ice) and for different atmospheric conditions. Then, sea ice coverage lookup table (0% to 100% in 1% increments) is obtained based on modeled brightness temperature considering different atmospheric conditions. Sea ice coverage is confirmed by comparing observed value with modeled value. Sea ice extent is consistent with the actual situation in most Arctic regions. Although matching errors between channels and positioning errors have been corrected in FY dataset, the received echo signal is relatively weak due to the shorter antenna on MWRI. The weak echo signal makes it difficult to correctly differentiate the boundary between sea ice and near sea shore land, which greatly impact the total accuracy of the dataset and its application. In order to solve this problem, this study introduces a method of optimizing FY Arctic sea ice dataset based on NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) sea ice product. In NSIDC product, judgment matrix was created covering the entire grid and identifying each pixel as land, shore, near-shore, offshore or ocean as determined by the land/sea mask. Then, these different pixels are corrected in different degrees, respectively. Sea ice extent calculated from NSIDC product is strongly consistent to the actual situation. The accuracy of FY dataset is greatly improved. The analysis results indicated an extremely significantly positive correlation with the NSIDC product (R2 = 0.9997) during June 27th, 2011-December 31st, 2015. The maximum deviation percent of daily, monthly and annually sea ice extent is 3.5%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. Also, the optimization process of FY dataset has no obvious influence on the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the dataset. The optimized FY dataset can correctly reflect Arctic sea ice extent and its variation, especially in coastline regions. It can provide reliable basic data for the study of Arctic sea ice change. © 2017, Science Press.

Because these currents rival ice drift speeds, we examine the potential for the Beaufort Gyre's shift from a system in which the wind drives the ice and the ice drives a passive ocean to one in which the ocean often, in the absence of high winds, drives the ice. The resultant stress exerted on the ocean by the ice and the resultant Ekman pumping are reversed, without any change in average wind stress curl. Through these curl reversals, the ice-ocean stress provides a key feedback in Beaufort Gyre stabilization.

However, glacier retreat and its climatic controls have not been assessed at the pan-Arctic scale. Consequently, the spatial and temporal variability in the magnitude of retreat, and the possible drivers are uncertain. Here we use remotely sensed data acquired over 273 outlet glaciers, located across the entire Atlantic Arctic (i.e. areas potentially influenced by North Atlantic climate and/or ocean conditions, specifically: Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land and Svalbard), to demonstrate high-magnitude, accelerating and near-ubiquitous retreat between 1992 and 2010. Overall, mean retreat rates increased by a factor of 3.5 between 1992 and 2000 (-30.5 m a-1) and 2000–10 (-105.8 m a-1), with 97% of the study glaciers retreating during the latter period. The Retreat was greatest in northern, western and south-eastern Greenland and also increased substantially on the Barents Sea coast of Novaya Zemlya. Glacier retreat showed no significant or consistent relationship with summer air temperatures at decadal timescales. The rate of frontal position change showed a significant, but weak, correlation with changes in sea-ice concentrations. We highlight large variations in retreat rates within regions and suggest that fjord topography plays an important role. We conclude that marine-terminating Arctic outlet glaciers show a common response of rapid and accelerating retreat at decadal timescales. © The Author(s) 2017.","Arctic; air-ice interaction; climate change; glacier retreat; glaciology; ice-ocean interaction; monitoring; remote sensing","Arctic glaciology; Atmosphere/ice/ocean interactions; Climate change; Glacier monitoring; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033368543"

It is an updated version of the Tool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivities at Microwave Frequencies (TELSEM; Aires et al. 2011). This study presents the parameterization of continental snow and ice and sea ice emissivities in TELSEM2. It relies upon satellite-derived emissivities up to 200 GHz, and it is anchored to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) TELSEM monthly climatology dataset (19-85 GHz). Emissivities from Météo-France and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at frequencies up to 190 GHz were used, calculated from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) observations.

Above continental snow and ice, TELSEM2 is very consistent with the aircraft estimates in spatially homogeneous regions, especially at 89 and 157 GHz.

An experiment was conducted on natural sea ice in Bohai Bay, China, to obtain the spectral reflectance of oil-contaminated sea ice. The spectral absorption index (SAI), spectral peak height (SPH), and wavelet detail coefficient (DWT d5) were calculated using stepwise multiple linear regression. The reflectances of some false targets were measured and analysed. The simulated false targets were sediment, iron ore fines, coal dust, and the melt pool. The measured reflectances were resampled using five common sensors (GF-2, Landsat8-OLI, Sentinel3-OLCI, MODIS, and AVIRIS). Some significant spectral features could discriminate between oil-polluted and clean sea ice. The indices correlated well with the oil area fractions. All of the adjusted R2 values exceeded 0.9. The SPH model1, based on spectral features at 507-670 and 1627-1746 nm, displayed the best fitting. The resampled data indicated that these multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors could be used to detect crude oil on the sea ice if the effect of noise and spatial resolution are neglected.

The IC datasets and the corresponding retrieval algorithms are investigated together with microwave brightness temperature, air temperature, snowfall and bathymetry to understand the failure of the IC retrieval. The artefacts are the result of the application of weather filters in retrieval algorithms. These filters use the 37 and 19 GHz channels to correct for atmospheric effects on the retrieval. These channels show significant departures from typical ranges when the artefacts occur. A melt-refreeze cycle with associated snow metamorphism is proposed as the most likely cause. Together, the areas of the artefacts account for up to 0.5% of the Antarctic sea-ice area and thus cause a bias in sea-IC time series.

Large-scale active and passive remote sensing is the basis for the estimation of these parameters. In traditional altimetry or the retrieval of snow depth with passive microwave remote sensing, although the sea ice thickness and the snow depth are closely related, the retrieval of one parameter is usually carried out under assumptions over the other. For example, climatological snow depth data or as derived from reanalyses contain large or unconstrained uncertainty, which result in large uncertainty in the derived sea ice thickness and volume. In this study, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth using the concurrent active altimetry and passive microwave remote sensing of the sea ice cover. Specifically, laser altimetry and L-band passive remote sensing data are combined using two forward models: the L-band radiation model and the isostatic relationship based on buoyancy model. Since the laser altimetry usually features much higher spatial resolution than L-band data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, there is potentially covariability between the observed snow freeboard by altimetry and the retrieval target of snow depth on the spatial scale of altimetry samples. Statistically significant correlation is discovered based on high-resolution observations from Operation IceBridge (OIB), and with a nonlinear fitting the covariability is incorporated in the retrieval algorithm. By using fitting parameters derived from large-scale surveys, the retrievability is greatly improved compared with the retrieval that assumes flat snow cover (i.e., no covariability). Verifications with OIB data show good match between the observed and the retrieved parameters, including both sea ice thickness and snow depth. With detailed analysis, we show that the error of the retrieval mainly arises from the difference between the modeled and the observed (SMOS) L-band brightness temperature (TB). The narrow swath and the limited coverage of the sea ice cover by altimetry is the potential source of error associated with the modeling of L-band TB and retrieval. The proposed retrieval methodology can be applied to the basin-scale retrieval of sea ice thickness and snow depth, using concurrent passive remote sensing and active laser altimetry based on satellites such as ICESat-2 and WCOM. © Author(s) 2018.","algorithm; altimetry; brightness temperature; data assimilation; ice thickness; ICESat; laser method; methodology; parameter estimation; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; SMOS; snow cover","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044287492"

The NASA team 2 algorithm, previously developed for the NASA advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) product suite, is adapted for operational use with the JAXA AMSR2 sensor through several enhancements. First, the algorithm is modified to process individual swaths and provide concentration from the most recent swaths instead of a 24-hour average. A latency (time since observation) field and a 24-hour concentration range (maximum-minimum) are included to provide indications of data timeliness and variability. Concentration from the Bootstrap algorithm is a secondary field to provide complementary sea ice information. A quality flag is implemented to provide information on interpolation, filtering, and other quality control steps. The AMSR2 concentration fields are compared with a different AMSR2 passive microwave product, and then validated via comparison with sea ice concentration from the Suomi visible and infrared imaging radiometer suite. This validation indicates the AMSR2 concentrations have a bias of 3.9% and an RMSE of 11.0% in the Arctic, and a bias of 4.45% and RMSE of 8.8% in the Antarctic. In most cases, the NOAA operational requirements for accuracy are met.

An important part of our work was accumulation of remote sensing data as the first step in evaluation of circulation patterns and vortex structures presented on the sea surface. An analyzed remote sensing data include color composite images from MSI Sentinel-2, OLI Landsat-8 and ETM+ Landsat-7 as well as radar images from Sentinel-1 and Radardsat-2 that also provide a powerful tool for an identification of circulation processes on the sea surface. Continuous monitoring of the Southeastern Baltic Sea with an analysis of satellite visual and radar images show that the Gulf of Gdańsk is the most frequent area with mesoscale and submesoscale eddies. They appear in this area mostly in summer and mainly under the atmospheric influence. Some eddies remain stable for at least of 8 days and could be easily tracked on color composite images. The other area of the vortex structure was determined to the north of the Cape Taran.

Further, a long time series of scatterometer σ o observations is available to support climate studies. In addition to fundamental scientific research, scatterometer data are operationally used for sea-ice mapping to support navigation. Scatterometers are, thus, invaluable tools for monitoring the polar regions. In this paper, a brief review of some of the polar applications of spaceborne wind scatterometer data is provided.

When multiresolution imagery is collected simultaneously, high quality spatial and spectral image fusion techniques can be applied to the different sensor field of views that helps to improve detection of earth surface features and targets. Multispectral imagery fused with hyperspectral imagery described and results shown in this paper indicates the ability to detect subsurface water features along Florida littoral zones and coastal water regions. The use of multiresolution imaging from the same remote sensing platform provides a valuable approach for detecting sun glint regions and reflectance due to water wave facets and the presence of breaking waves. In littoral regions along Space Coast Florida and the Indian River Lagoon, surface bidirectional reflectance increases 5-6 times the background water surface reflectance, making typical water column constituent estimation questionable. The detection of the influence of surface water gravity waves can be modeled or easily detected using ground sampling distances or spatial resolutions less than or near 0.3 m. Spatial resolutions of approximately one meter or greater do not allow suitable detection of pixels affected by water waves. Satellite imagery based directional reflectance using ground sampling distance greater than 1 meter is contaminated by water wave facet reflection, breaking waves and sun glint effects. Thus bio-geophysical variables such as chlorophyll pigments, suspended matter, dissolved organic matter and light attenuation depths are biased. This bias effect can only be estimated reliably by using small spatial resolution imagery with knowledge gained from analytical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling and multiresolution fused imagery. Application of transferable remote sensing algorithms for water quality applications require bidirectional reflectance corrections for water waves, sun glint, and wave facet effects. Example high quality WorldView-3 multispectral and panchromatic clearly shows the water wave facet reflectance effects that is imbedded into larger GSD imagery of water regions and littoral zones and as shown in hyperspectral Monte Carlo model results. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Biological materials; Coastal zones; Feature extraction; Hydrophilicity; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Monte Carlo methods; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Surface waters; Water quality; Water waves; coastal; Dissolved organic matters; Ground sampling distances; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing algorithms; Spatial resolution imagery; Surface bidirectional reflectances; Remote sensing","coastal; hyperspectral; image fusion; Monte Carlo; multispectral; radiative transfer; water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056485855"

Key open questions are whether assimilation of lower-level data products such as radar freeboard (RFB) can further improve model performance and what performance gains can be achieved through joint assimilation of these data products in combination with a snow depth product. The Arctic Mission Benefit Analysis system was developed to address this type of question. Using the quantitative network design (QND) approach, the system can evaluate, in a mathematically rigorous fashion, the observational constraints imposed by individual and groups of data products. We demonstrate the approach by presenting assessments of the observation impact (added value) of different Earth observation (EO) products in terms of the uncertainty reduction in a 4-week forecast of sea ice volume (SIV) and snow volume (SNV) for three regions along the Northern Sea Route in May 2015 using a coupled model of the sea ice-ocean system, specifically the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model. We assess seven satellite products: three real products and four hypothetical products. The real products are monthly SIT, sea ice freeboard (SIFB), and RFB, all derived from CryoSat-2 by the Alfred Wegener Institute. These are complemented by two hypothetical monthly laser freeboard (LFB) products with low and high accuracy, as well as two hypothetical monthly snow depth products with low and high accuracy. On the basis of the per-pixel uncertainty ranges provided with the CryoSat-2 SIT, SIFB, and RFB products, the SIT and RFB achieve a much better performance for SIV than the SIFB product. For SNV, the performance of SIT is only low, the performance of SIFB is higher and the performance of RFB is yet higher. A hypothetical LFB product with low accuracy (20&thinsp;cm uncertainty) falls between SIFB and RFB in performance for both SIV and SNV. A reduction in the uncertainty of the LFB product to 2 cm yields a significant increase in performance.

The uncertainty in the snow product matters: a higher-accuracy product achieves an extra performance gain. Providing spatial and temporal uncertainty correlations with the EO products would be beneficial not only for QND assessments, but also for assimilation of the products. © 2018 Author(s).","Arctic; Simian immunodeficiency virus; continental freeboard; CryoSat; forecasting method; ice thickness; ice-ocean interaction; network design; performance assessment; satellite data; sea ice; snow; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051538931"

But most methods of target decomposition are based on fully polarized data (quad pol) and seldom utilize dual-polar data for target decomposition. Given this, we proposed a novel two-component decomposition method for co-polar channels of GF-3 quad-pol data. This method decomposes the data into two scattering contributions: surface, double bounce in dual co-polar channels. To save this underdetermined problem, a criterion for determining the model is proposed. The criterion can be named as second-order averaged scattering angle, which originates from the H/α decomposition. and we also put forward an alternative parameter of it. To validate the effectiveness of proposed decomposition, Liaodong Bay is selected as research area. The area is located in northeastern China, where it grows various wetland resources and appears sea ice phenomenon in winter. and we use the GF-3 quad-pol data as study data, which which is China's first C-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) satellite. The dependencies between the features of proposed algorithm and comparison decompositions (Pauli decomposition, An&Yang decomposition, Yamaguchi S4R decomposition) were investigated in the study. Though several aspects of the experimental discussion, we can draw the conclusion: the proposed algorithm may be suitable for special scenes with low vegetation coverage or low vegetation in the non-growing season; proposed decomposition features only using co-polar data are highly correlated with the corresponding comparison decomposition features under quad-polarization data. Moreover, it would be become input of the subsequent classification or parameter inversion. © Authors 2018.","Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Exploratory research; Model based decompositions; Parameter inversion; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Polarimetric target decomposition; PolSAR; Target decomposition; Two-component; Space-based radar","Co-polar data; Gf-3 satellite; Model-based decomposition; PolSAR; Two-component decomposition","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046974115"

In recent years, disasters such as flooding are having increasingly damaging societal and environmental effects. To reduce their impact, real-time and reliable flood monitoring and prevention strategies are required. However, the limited battery life of small lightweight UAVs imposes efficient strategies to subsample the sensing field in this context. This paper proposes a novel solution to maximise the number of inspected flooded surface while keeping the travelled distance bounded. Our proposal solves the so-called continuous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the costs of travelling from one location to another depend not only on the distance, but also on the presence of water. To determine the optimal path between checkpoints, we employ the fast sweeping algorithm using a cost function defined from hyperspectral satellite maps identifying flooded regions. Preliminary results using MODIS flood maps show that our UAV planning strategy achieves a covered flooded surface approximately 3.33 times greater for the same travelled distance when compared to the conventional TSP solution. These results show new insights on the use of hyperspectral imagery acquired from UAVs to monitor water resources. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Antennas; Cost functions; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Floods; Hydrophilicity; Hyperspectral imaging; Motion planning; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water resources; Fast-sweeping algorithms; Flood monitoring; Hyper-spectral imageries; Hyperspectral satellite; Optimal path planning; Prevention strategies; Travelling salesman problem; Travelling salesman problem (TSP); Traveling salesman problem","Flood Monitoring; Hyperspectral Imaging; Optimal Path Planning; UAV","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056457985"

This was done by mapping partial pressure of CO2 in the surface water (pCO2w) using a self-organizing map (SOM) technique incorporating chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea ice concentration, atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio, and geographical position. We applied new algorithms for extracting Chl a from satellite remote sensing reflectance with close examination of uncertainty of the obtained Chl a values. The overall relationship between pCO2w and Chl a was negative, whereas the relationship varied among seasons and regions. The addition of Chl a as a parameter in the SOM process enabled us to improve the estimate of pCO2w, particularly via better representation of its decline in spring, which resulted from biologically mediated pCO2w reduction. As a result of the inclusion of Chl a, the uncertainty in the CO2 flux estimate was reduced, with a net annual Arctic Ocean CO2 uptake of 180 ± 130 Tgyr-1. Seasonal to interannual variation in the CO2 influx was also calculated. © Author(s) 2018.","Arctic Ocean; air-sea interaction; annual variation; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); estimation method; partial pressure; remote sensing; seasonal variation; spectral reflectance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044305510"

It is designed for the purpose of retrieving wind field over oceans. It also provides information on surface soil moisture content and sea ice. Although ASCAT uses a linear frequency modulated pulse with a center frequency of 5.255 GHz (C-band), it is subject to radio frequency interference (RFI). This paper analyses seven years of ASCAT data and shows an increase of the number of noise outliers and an increase of the noise background level over specific land areas. This suggests that the outliers are not a natural occurrence, but are due to RFI from ground-based equipments. As regards the observed increase of the noise background level, it is not straightforward to associate possible RFI sources which could have caused it. However, since the ASCAT has a dynamic range of about 30 dB, the worse measured increase of 1 dB in the noise floor has almost no impact on performance, in particular, on soil moisture retrieval. In addition, the effect of the noise outliers on the estimate of the ASCAT receiver filter shape function used in the processing is also examined and is found to introduce errors of up to 0.4 dB. However, the occurrence of the noise outliers is generally very low, typically two out of 60 000 noise measurements per day, so the impact on the operational use of ASCAT data for wind vector retrieval is limited. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Frequency modulation; Meteorological instruments; Moisture; Partial discharges; Radar systems; Radio interference; Radio waves; Sea ice; Statistics; Wind effects; Background level; Ground-based equipment; Linear frequency modulated; Noise measurements; Operational use; Radio frequency interference; Soil moisture retrievals; Surface soil moisture; ASCAT; backscatter; MetOp; radio wave; remote sensing; satellite data; signal-to-noise ratio; wind field; Soil moisture","Advanced scatterometer (ASCAT); C-band scatterometer; radio frequency interference (RFI)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009853958"

Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image-processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology. We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals. Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high-resolution data. Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data. © 2018 The Authors.

Remote sensing monitoring of Arctic sea ice is crucial for understanding the role of the Arctic in the global climate system and in global warming. Therefore, comparing and evaluating the products of sea ice data retrieved from different satellite observations are necessary. In addition, assessing the accuracy of sea ice distribution from satellite observations is significant in studies on climate change and global warming because the extrapolation of global surface energy flows is very sensitive to the estimation of Arctic sea ice cover. To evaluate sea ice concentration from the Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI) onboard the FY-3B satellite, we compare the data products with the sea ice concentration from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system (AMSR-E) onboard the Aqua satellite. High-resolution moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to validate MWRI and AMSR-E sea ice concentration. The comparison of MWRI and AMSR-E incudes daily and monthly data. MODIS L1B band 2 channel reflectance is chosen to validate the sea ice concentration of MWRI and AMSR-E. The processing procedure of MODIS mainly consists of solar zenith correction, radiometric calibration, removing bow-tie phenomenon, and map projection. The map projection is the polar stereographic projection, which is the same as the MWRI and AMSR-E products. To avoid the misjudgment of ice and water because of the cloud influence, we choose cloudfree MODIS channel 2 sub-region for ice and water recognition. Different thresholds according to the histogram of the reflectance are used to segment the ice and water pixels. The MODIS sea ice concentration in each MWRI and AMSR-E grid is calculated. The comparison results of MWRI and AMSR-E are as follows. First, MWRI and AMSR-E daily mean sea ice concentrations show a consistent change from July to September, and MWRI sea ice concentration is higher than AMSR-E each day. The monthly mean values of daily biases for July, August, and September are 8.55%, 7.67%, and 2.58%, and the monthly mean of daily standard deviations are 12.16%, 12.08%, and 10.43%, respectively. Second, from July to September, the monthly sea ice concentration difference between MWRI and AMSR-E (MWRI minus AMSR-E) shows a decreasing trend. The monthly biases for July, August, and September are 7.37%, 6.53%, and 1.51%, and the monthly standard deviations are 4.61%, 4.36%, and 3.64%, respectively. The validation results of MWRI and AMSR-E sea ice concentration with MODIS are as follows. First, in the region of MODIS sea ice concentration less than 95%, the sea ice concentration difference between MWRI and MODIS (MWRI minus MODIS) is 9.78%±16.90%, and the difference between AMSR-E and MODIS (AMSR-E minus MODIS) is 0.90%±13.09%. MWRI and AMSR-E tend to overestimate sea ice concentration compared with MODIS, the result of AMSR-E is closer to MODIS, and MWRI has a larger error. Second, when MODIS sea ice concentration is greater than or equal to 95%, the sea ice concentration difference between MWRI and MODIS is -5.45%±7.05%, and the difference between AMSR-E and MODIS is -7.97%±6.46%. MWRI and AMSR-E tend to underestimate sea ice concentration compared with MODIS, and the result of MWRI is slightly better. © 2018, Science Press.

The results are compared with other global optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic algorithms (GA) in terms of their statistical goodness of fit and computational time requirements. MVO (743.82 secs) offered computational fastness over both PSO (1261.8 secs) and GA (3818.8 secs).

First we develop a methodology for identifying various submesoscale front signatures in SAR images and list the most common features of front manifestations. We describe characteristic features associated with fronts of different nature which are not usually detectable by traditional observational data sources because of their small scale and because they are often masked by upper-level clouds. The main problem is to discriminate between signatures of fronts in the sea and those in the nearsurface layer of the atmosphere.

Hence, observations of the evolution of snow depth, density, thermal conductivity, and stratigraphy are crucial for the development of detailed snow numerical models predicting energy transfer through the snow pack. Snow depth is also a major uncertainty in predicting ice thickness using remote sensing algorithms.

The satellite was launched on 8 July 2014 to a solar-synchronous circular orbit with a height of 830 km. The 29 channels of the radiometer measure the rising radiation of the Earth at frequencies ν in the range from 10 to 190 GHz when scanning along a cone at an angle of 65° to the local normal. Internal calibration of MTVZA-GY channels is carried out on each scan and provides correction of gain variations and data representation in the antenna temperature scale Ta                             V,H(ν) on vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarizations.

They are related to events of boundary layer enhancement of bromine. Consequently, increased amounts of boundary layer volume mixing ratio (VMR) and vertical column densities (VCDs) of BrO have been observed by in situ observation, ground-based as well as airborne remote sensing, and from satellites. These so-called bromine explosion (BE) events have been discussed serving as a source of tropospheric BrO at high latitudes, which has been underestimated in global models so far. We have implemented a treatment of bromine release and recycling on sea-ice- and snow-covered surfaces in the global chemistry-climate model EMAC (ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry) based on the scheme of Toyota et al. (2011). In this scheme, dry deposition fluxes of HBr, HOBr, and BrNO3 over ice- and snow-covered surfaces are recycled into Br2 fluxes. In addition, dry deposition of O3, dependent on temperature and sunlight, triggers a Br2 release from surfaces associated with first-year sea ice. Many aspects of observed bromine enhancements and associated episodes of near-complete depletion of boundary layer ozone, both in the Arctic and in the Antarctic, are reproduced by this relatively simple approach. We present first results from our global model studies extending over a full annual cycle, including comparisons with Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite BrO VCDs and surface ozone observations. © Author(s) 2018.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044719819"

Within Arctic regions, in situ surveying presents risks to surveyors, is time consuming and costly. To better meet its mandate, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been investigating the potential of remote sensing to compliment traditional charting techniques. This paper focuses on an evaluation of sensors and techniques for operational Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) implementation. Analysis focused on Cambridge Bay, Nunavut using Pléiades, SPOT, WorldView and PlanetScope imagery. Multiple SDB techniques were applied to evaluate their agreement with in-situ bathymetric measurements: • An empirical logarithm band ratio approach. • A multiple band modeling technique. • A multi-dimensional Look-Up-Table approach. Through this analysis, CHS attempted to answer critical questions for operational SDB implementation: • Do specific optical sensors offer advantages for SDB? • Are there advantages/disadvantages with the application of SDB techniques within the examined environment? • Can multiple SDB techniques improve CHS's understanding of the confidence it can place in remotely sensed bathymetry estimates? Early results have achieved overall root mean square errors of 0.56 to 0.99 m relative to in situ survey depths for all sensors and techniques. These similarities suggest that CHS can be confident in the accuracies observed from various SDB approaches. Results do not indicate significant advantages or disadvantages of particular optical sensors, suggesting other factors contain greater importance for SDB image selection (e.g. sea floor visibility). While this analysis provides excellent information for operational empirical SDB implementation within Arctic environments, further work is required within other Canadian coastal regions to support national SDB application. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrographic surveys; Hydrophilicity; Mean square error; Optical sensors; Satellites; Sea ice; Table lookup; Canadian Arctic; Canadian hydrographic services; Empirical model; High resolution; Multi-spectral; Navigational Charting; Remote sensing","Canadian Arctic; Canadian Hydrographic Service; Empirical Models; High Resolution Optical; Multispectral; Navigational Charting; Remote Sensing; Satellite Derived Bathymetry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056476374"

Under conditions of adequate food and appropriate temperature, scallops grow well from the time of ice melting in April to harvesting starting in July. However, over the past decade, Saroma Lake frequently has not been completely covered by ice in winter, and the production of Japanese scallops has shown significant changes. Therefore, this study integrated data from satellite remote sensing, buoys, and in situ observations with climatic events [the winter East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño/La Niña–Southern Oscillation events] to investigate the impact of ice coverage variations on scallop growth in Saroma Lake between 2007 and 2015. Daily ice conditions were detected using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer false colour images and an unsupervised classification method. The results indicated that EAM strongly influenced the ice coverage variation in Saroma Lake through their effects on temperature during winter. Ice coverage variations show a strong correlation with water temperature and spring phytoplankton blooms, which are the two most important environmental factors for scallop growth. In addition, extreme climate events could cause water temperature anomalies (as in 2015) which are unfavourable for scallop growth. Monitoring ice conditions should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for scallop aquaculture in Saroma Lake. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Chlamys nipponensis; Mizuhopecten yessoensis; Pectinidae","climate events; Japanese scallop; MODIS; Saroma Lake; sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041291514"

Here we examine the intensity, directionality, and temporal statistics of the underwater noise radiated by melting icebergs in Hornsund Fjord, Svalbard, using a three-element acoustic array. We present the first estimate of noise energy per unit area associated with iceberg melt and demonstrate its qualitative dependence on exposure to surface current.

Here, we introduce an approach to evaluate ice roughness that can aid in routing of ice roads and assessment of spatial variability and long-term changes in trafficability. Drawing on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry, SAR interferometry (InSAR), and other remote sensing techniques, we integrated approaches into the trafficability assessment that had rarely been applied over sea ice in the past. Analysis of aerial photogrammetry obtained through structure-from-motion helped verify cm-scale accuracy of X-band InSAR-derived ridge height and link L-band polarimetric classification to specific roughness regimes. Jointly, these approaches enable a km-scale evaluation of ridge topography and cm-to m-scale roughness-both critical for the assessment of trafficability. A trafficability index was derived from such SAR data in conjunction with analysis of ice trail routing and ice use near Utqiaġvik, Alaska. The index identifies areas of reduced trafficability, associated with pressure ridges or rubble ice, and served to delineate favorable trail routes for different modes of transportation, with potential uses ranging from ice road routing to emergency evacuation. Community outreach is needed to explore how this approach could assist different ice users in reducing risk, minimizing trail or ice construction efforts, and improving safety. © 2018 IEEE.","Alaska; Arctic; Barrow; United States; Ellipsometry; Interferometry; Photogrammetry; Polarimeters; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Surface topography; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Transportation; Transportation routes; Radar interferometry; Radar polarimetry; Roads; Rough surfaces; Sea surfaces; assessment method; photogrammetry; radar interferometry; remote sensing; sea ice; spatial variation; surface roughness; synthetic aperture radar; Ice","Radar interferometry; radar polarimetry; sea ice; surface roughness; surface topography; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039794456"

Previous studies have shown that under the influence of El Niño events, the upwelling would be weakened, charactering with high sea surface temperature (SST) and low Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a). However, a different pattern of upwelling appeared in summer 2016, a decaying period of a strong El Niño event. There was a high SST and low Chl-a in June and July, which were similar with that of 1998 and 2010, another two El Niño years. However, we found a strong upwelling together with a moderate phytoplankton bloom off the southeast of Vietnam in August 2016. The analysis of the wind data and SST data indicated that the southwesterly summer monsoon played an important role on this particular case. The abrupt intensification of the southwest wind in late July of 2016 resulted in the SST cooling with nearly one-week delay, which meant that the great significance of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) occurred. The continuous intensification of the southwest wind enhanced the upwelling associated with Ekman pumping and offshore Ekman transport. As a result, the high-nutrient water of the subsurface was brought into the upper layer, which induced the high Chl-a, and cold-water mass spreading northeastward offshore. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Climatology; Hydrophilicity; Offshore oil well production; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Ekman transport; High nutrients; Madden-Julian oscillation; Phytoplankton bloom; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer monsoon; Viet Nam; Oceanography","El Niño; Madden-Julian Oscillation; Vietnam upwelling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056448238"

We furthermore propose a new model for sea ice backscatter at the C-band in vertical polarization based on the sea ice GMFs derived from ERS and advanced scatterometer data. The model characterizes the dependence of sea ice backscatter on the incidence angle and the sea ice type, allowing a more precise incidence angle correction than afforded by the usual linear transformation. The resulting agreement between the ERS, QuikSCAT, and special sensor microwave imager sea ice extents during the year 2000 is high during the fall and winter seasons, with an estimated ice edge accuracy of about 20 km, but shows persistent biases between scatterometer and radiometer extents during the melting period, with scatterometers being more sensitive to summer (lower concentration and rotten) sea ice types. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Backscattering; Geodetic satellites; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Meteorological instruments; Microwave sensors; Remote sensing; Bayes procedure; European remote sensing satellites; Geophysical model function; Incidence angle correction; Microwave radiometry; Passive microwave data; Radar scattering; Special sensor microwave imagers; algorithm; backscatter; Bayesian analysis; detection method; ERS; geophysical method; microwave radiometer; numerical model; polarization; QuikSCAT; radar altimetry; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; scatterometer; sea ice; Sea ice","Bayes procedure; Microwave radiometry; Radar scattering; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039767668"

Therefore, ice thickness is important parameter of sea ice. In the previous studies, the authors have developed a thin ice area extraction algorithm using passive microwave radiometer AMSR2 for the Sea of Okhotsk. The basic idea of the algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR2 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 19GHz V polarization. However, when the authors have applied the algorithm to the Bering Sea, two problems have become clear. One was that some thin ice areas were not well extracted, and the other was some of the big ice floe were extracted as thin ice areas. In this study, the authors have improved the thin ice area extraction algorithm to solve these problems. By adjusting the parameters of the algorithm applied to the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR2 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 19GHz V polarization, most of the thin ice areas were also well extracted in the Bering Sea. The authors also introduced an equation using the brightness temperatures difference of 89GHz vertical and horizontal polarization to reject the thin ice area mis-extracted over big ice floe. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

Accelerated retreat during 2000-2010 was concentrated in the southeast and northwest sectors of the ice sheet; however, there was considerable spatial and temporal variability in the timing and magnitude of retreat both within and between these regions. This behaviour has yet to be quantified and compared for all glaciers in both regions. Furthermore, it is unclear whether retreat has continued after 2010 in the northwest, and whether the documented slowdown in the southeast post-2005 has been sustained. Here, we compare spatial and temporal patterns of frontal change in the northwest and southeast GrIS, for the period 2000-2015. Our results show near-ubiquitous retreat of outlet glaciers across both regions for the study period; however, the timing and magnitude of inter-annual frontal position change is largely asynchronous. We also find that since 2010, there is continued terminus retreat in the northwest, which contrasts with considerable inter-annual variability in the southeast. Analysis of the role of glacier-specific factors demonstrates that fjord and bed geometry are important controls on the timing and magnitude of glacier retreat. © The Author(s) 2018.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; arctic environment; fjord; glacier dynamics; glacier flow; glacier mass balance; glacier retreat; glaciology; ice sheet; remote sensing; sea ice; twenty first century","arctic glaciology; glacier fluctuations; glacier mapping; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047185033"

Large Siberian rivers and coastal erosion of up to meters per summer deliver large volumes of terrestrial matter into the Arctic shelf seas. In this chapter we investigate the applicability of Ocean Colour Remote Sensing during the ice-free summer season in the Siberian Laptev Sea region. We show that the early summer river peak discharge may be traced using remote sensing in years characterized by early sea-ice retreat. In the summer time after the peak discharge, the spreading of the main Lena River plume east and north-east of the Lena River Delta into the shelf system becomes hardly traceable using optical remote sensing methods. Measurements of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (cDOM) are of the same magnitude in the coastal waters of Buor Khaya Bay as in the Lena River. Match-up analyses of in situ chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) show that standard Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite-derived Chl-a is not a valid remote sensing product for the coastal waters and the inner shelf region of the Laptev Sea. All MERIS and MODIS-derived Chl-a products are overestimated by at least a factor of ten, probably due to absorption by the extraordinarily high amount of non-algal particles and cDOM in these coastal and inner-shelf waters. Instead, Ocean Colour remote sensing provides information on wide-spread resuspension over shallows and lateral advection visible in satellite-derived turbidity.

Specifically, we investigate the relationship between sea ice concentration, the timing of melt onset and open-water fraction surrounding Greenland with ice sheet surface melt using a combination of remote sensing observations, and outputs from a reanalysis model and a regional climate model for the period of 1979-2015. Statistical analysis points to covariability between Greenland ice sheet surface melt and sea ice within Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. While some of this covariance can be explained by simultaneous influence of atmospheric circulation anomalies on both the sea ice cover and Greenland melt, within Baffin Bay we find a modest correlation between detrended melt onset over sea ice and the adjacent ice sheet melt onset. This correlation appears to be related to increased transfer of sensible and latent heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere in early sea ice melt years, increasing temperatures and humidity over the ice sheet that in turn initiate ice sheet melt.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Davis Strait; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; air-sea interaction; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; ice cover; latent heat flux; remote sensing; sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032301781"

However, it is difficult to analyse the long-term time series acquired at high temporal frequencies and over extensive areas. This study performed temporal mixture analysis (TMA), which is algebraically similar to spectral mixture analysis (SMA), but occurs in the time domain instead of the spectral domain. TMA was used to investigate the temporal characteristics of Antarctic sea ice. Because endmember (EM) selection is critical to the success of both SMA and TMA, it is important to select proper EMs from large quantities of HTI. In this study, a machine learning (ML) technique is incorporated in identifying EMs without prior information to address the limitations of previous research. A fully linear mixing model was then implemented in an attempt to produce more robust and physically meaningful abundance estimates. Experiments that quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the proposed approaches were conducted. A TMA of high-temporal-dimensional data provides a unique summary of long-term Antarctic sea ice and noise-whitened reconstruction images via inverse processing.

Calving of ice shelves and glaciers contributes to major ice loss along the coast of Antarctica. In the present study the ice dynamics along the Eastern coast of Antarctica using iceberg calving as an indicator has been studied. Using moderate resolution satellite data of LANDSAT 4-5, 7 & 8, we monitored calving events that occurred in the past and icebergs likely to be calved in future, and identified potential zones where major calving could take place along the eastern Antarctica region. The present study focuses on 3 such events from Princess Astrid Coast. In this region, as on 4-12-1989 there was a crevasse of 45.15 km which had grown up to 77.84 km by 19-11-2001. Also, as on 16-03-2016, an iceberg of an area 29.88 sq.km which is about to calve can be observed. Here the rifts can be seen which are orthogonal in orientation relative to the calving front. In the third case, there is presence of 12 widening rifts and around 48 physical structures, as observed on 16-03-2016. The total length of the 12 rifts is around 215.68 km with minimum 1.24 km and maximum 40.55 km in length.

The timing of the sea ice retreat (TSR) also plays a crucial role in the seasonally ice-covered marine ecosystem, because it is tightly coupled with the timing of the spring bloom. Thus, it is important to monitor the temporal and spatial distributions of a phytoplankton community size structure. Prior to this study, an ocean colour algorithm was developed to derive phytoplankton size index L, which is defined as the ratio of chlorophyll/Emphasis (chl <Emphasis TypeCombining double low line""Italic""a/i) derived from cells larger than 5 to the total chl ia/i, using satellite remote sensing for the Chukchi and Bering shelves. Using this method, we analysed the pixel-by-pixel relationships between SubscriptL/Subscript during the marginal ice zone (MIZ) bloom period and TSR over the period of 1998-2013. The influences of the TSR on the sea surface temperature (SST) and changes in ocean heat content (Î""OHC) during the MIZ bloom period were also investigated. A significant negative relationship between L and the TSR was widely found in the shelf region during the MIZ bloom season. However, we found a significant positive (negative) relationship between the SST (OHC) and TSR. Specifically, an earlier sea ice retreat was associated with the dominance of larger phytoplankton during a colder and weakly stratified MIZ bloom season, suggesting that the duration of the nitrate supply, which is important for the growth of large-sized phytoplankton in this region (i.e. diatoms), can change according to the TSR. In addition, under-ice phytoplankton blooms are likely to occur in years with late ice retreat, because sufficient light for phytoplankton growth can pass through the ice and penetrate into the water columns as a result of an increase in solar radiation toward the summer solstice. Moreover, we found that both the length of the ice-free season and the annual median of L positively correlated with the annual net primary production (APP). Thus, both the phytoplankton community composition and growing season are important for the APP in the study area. Our findings showed a quantitative relationship between the interannual variability of L, the TSR, and the APP, which suggested that satellite remote sensing of the phytoplankton community size structure is suitable to document the impact of a recent rapid sea ice loss on the ecosystem of the study region. © 2016 Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; Bering Strait; Chukchi Sea; Bacillariophyta; algal bloom; biomass; body size; community composition; growth rate; marine ecosystem; net primary production; phytoplankton; predator-prey interaction; remote sensing; sea ice; sea surface temperature; size structure; spatiotemporal analysis; trophic level","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956597764"

A semianalytical algorithm for estimating PM concentration in sea ice was established. The algorithm was then applied to MODIS data over the Bohai Sea, China. Comparisons between MODIS derived and in situ measured PM concentration showed good agreement, with a mean absolute percentage difference of 31.2%. From 2005 to 2010, the MODIS-derived annual average PM concentration was approximately 0.025 g/L at the beginning of January. After a month of atmospheric dust deposition, it increased to 0.038 g/L.

Conversely, under-ice remote sensing techniques are increasingly viable due to improving operational capabilities of autonomous and remotely operated vehicles. To investigate the potential for under-ice detection of oil spills using active acoustics, laboratory measurements of high-frequency, broadband backscatter (75-590 kHz) from crude oil layers (0.7-8.1 cm) under and encapsulated within sea ice were performed at normal and 20° incidence angles. Discrete interfaces (water-oil, oil-ice, and ice-oil) are identifiable in observations following oil injections under the ice and during the subsequent encapsulation. A one-dimensional model for the total normal incidence backscatter from oil under ice, constrained by oil sound speed measurements from -10 °C to 20 °C and improved environmental measurements compared to previous studies, agrees well with pre-encapsulation observations. At 20° incidence angles echoes from the ice and oil under ice are more complex and spatially variable than normal incidence observations, most likely due to interface roughness and volume inhomogeneities. Encapsulated oil layers are only detected at normal incidence. The results suggest that high-frequency, broadband backscatter techniques may allow under-ice remote sensing for the detection and quantification of oil spills. © 2016 Acoustical Society of America.","Backscattering; Oil spills; Remote sensing; Remotely operated vehicles; Sea ice; Acoustic backscatter; Detection and quantifications; Environmental measurements; Interface roughness; Laboratory measurements; Oil spill detection; One-dimensional model; Operational capabilities; Crude oil","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989957092"

For freezing seas of the temperate climatic zone, in particular, Caspian Sea, this process is specific due to the bottom topography, bottom sediment composition and hydrometeorologic factors. In the last two decades, exploration of carbohydrate reserves was activated within the Northern Caspian Sea region. For the development of underwater pipelines and other objects of oil and gas infrastructure, reliable assessment of the intensity of the ice hummocky formations' impact on the bottom is necessary. The impact of ice formations on the bottom of the Northern Caspian is attributed to much shallower areas compared with the Arctic seas. Ice gouging forms are difficult to document by standard geophysical investigations for building purposes due to high hydraulic instability of the bottom grounds at the Northern Caspian. As a rule, all traces of the ice impact are eroded by waves by the time of the investigations, usually taking place in summer. Due to this, the factor of ice impact was often ignored during the development and construction of oil and gas transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, new opportunities of assessment of the ice formations' impact on the sea bottom have appeared due to the development of remote sensing methods. In this way, on satellite imagery of the exposed bottom of the Aral Sea, situated close to the Caspian Sea and experiencing considerable regression, we found numerous ice gouging forms. Studies of these forms will provide insights into the scales and mechanisms of sea ice impact on the bottom of the Caspian.","Gas industry; Ocean structures; Petroleum transportation; Pipelines; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Bottom sediments; Bottom topography; Carbohydrate reserves; Hydraulic instability; Mechanical destruction; Oil and gas infrastructures; Oil and gas transportation; Reliable assessment; Ice","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040445747"

The main problem here is poor knowledge of physical characteristics of oil films, in particular, emulsified oil layers (EOL). The latter are ranged up to 70% of all pollutants. Physical characteristics of EOL which are responsible for wave damping and respectively for possibilities of their remote sensing depend on conditions of emulsification processes, e.g., mixing due to wave breaking, on percentage of water in the oil, etc. and are not well studied by now. In this paper results of laboratory studies of damping of gravity-capillary waves due to EOL on water are presented and compared to oil layers (OL). A laboratory method used previously for monomolecular films and OL, and based on measuring the damping coefficient and wavelength of parametrically generated standing waves has been applied for determination of EOL characteristics. Investigations of characteristics of crude oil, oil emulsions and crude OL and EOL have been carried out in a wide range of surface wave frequencies (from 10 to 25 Hz) and OL and EOL film thickness (from hundredths of millimeter to a few millimeters. The selected frequency range corresponds to Bragg waves for microwave, X- to Ka-band radars typically used for ocean remote sensing. An effect of enhanced wave damping due to EOL compared to non emulsified crude OL is revealed. © 2017 SPIE.","Crude oil; Damping; Emulsification; Emulsions; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Pollution; Radar; Sea ice; Surface chemistry; Surface waves; Water waves; Damping coefficients; Emulsification process; Gravity capillary waves; Laboratory experiments; Laboratory studies; Ocean remote sensing; Oil emulsions; Physical characteristics; Remote sensing","Crude oil; Oil emulsion; Wave damping, laboratory experiment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038438547"

Its suite of instruments for measuring surface topography includes a Microwave Radiometer (MWR) and SRAL, the first delay-Doppler instrument to provide global coverage. SRAL promises fine spatial resolution and reduced noise levels that should together lead to improved performance over all Earth surfaces. The Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Centre (S3MPC) has been developing the methodology to evaluate the accuracy of retrievals, monitor any changes and develop solutions to known problems. The S3MPC monitors internal temperatures, path delays and the shape of the generated pulses to assess the instruments health. The MWR records over known reference surfaces are compared with those from other spaceborne instruments. Over the ocean the SRAL's return pulses are analysed to give range to the sea surface, wave height and signal strength (which can be interpreted as wind speed). The metocean data are regularly contrasted with records from in situ measurements and the output from meteorological models, which rapidly highlights the effects of any changes in processing. Range information is used to give surface elevation, which is assessed in three ways. First, flights over a dedicated radar transponder provide an estimate of path delay to within ∼10 mm (r.m.s.). Second, measurements are compared to GPS-levelled surfaces near Corsica and over Lake Issyk-kul. Third, there are consistency checks between ascending and descending passes and with other missions. Further waveform analysis techniques are being developed to improve the retrieval of information over sea-ice, land-ice and inland waters. © 2017 SPIE.","Aneroid altimeters; Hydrophilicity; In situ processing; Meteorological instruments; Microwave devices; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Space optics; Surface topography; Surface waters; Wind; Calibration/validation; Climate monitoring; Cryosphere; Inland waters; Ocean dynamics; Sea surface height; Sentinel; Ice","Altimeter; Calibration/validation; Climate monitoring; Cryosphere; Inland waters; Ocean dynamics; sea level; Sea surface height; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038439753"

It insulates the ice to retard the rate of thermodynamic ice thickening. At the same time, it contributes directly to sea-ice thickening through snow-ice formation, which can occur where the weight of the snow overburden leads to surface flooding. Snow has unique optical properties that reduce the amount of light penetrating to the underlying ice and ocean water, while raising the albedo of the ice in a way that retards melting. Seals also rely on snow drifts on the ice for denning purposes, and snow presence and quality affect human travel across the ice. Moreover, the snow significantly modifies the visual and microwave signals of sea ice in remote sensing. Here, we review the properties of sea ice snow cover and ramifications of that cover for the sea ice system. © 2003, 2010, 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

An empirical function has been derived from the data, which gives a possibility to access sea ice thickness information stored in the historic dataset of in situ imagery. A similar function has been applied to aerial imagery. The presented approach can be used (1) as fast, non-intrusive method to estimate sea ice thickness in situ; (2) for general circulation model input, validation, ice mass balance estimate; (3) for assessing summer sea ice thickness dynamics from historic data to be used in the context of Arctic change. © 2016 IEEE.","","Arctic; cryospheric change; Melt ponds; remote sensing; sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007439394"

An ice hazard may originate from any of the following features/types of ice: ice edge, thaw holes, rough ice, ice leads, and oil spill in sea ice. Microwave sensors are well suited for polar regions due to their all-weather capability. CryoSat-2 provides one of the best available datasets of ice thickness to assess the severity of ice hazard. Ice motion maps have been created by using synthetic aperture radar with good level of reliability in the retrieval. We have high confidence in EO technology for detecting ice leads by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer“EO System. Detection of ice roughness by using microwave EO techniques poses challenges due to complexity in microwave response from rough ice over time- and space-varying surface properties. TerraSAR-X and MODIS have proved to be very useful in estimating melt pond fraction. Ice edge detection algorithms have been developed by using QuikSCAT and special sensor microwave/imager. Studying oil spill in ice requires multisensor EO approach, combining optical (hyperspectral) and microwave, ultraviolet, acoustic, and underwater sensors, as we grow our understanding of physical basis of oil“ice interaction. The integrated use of various types of in situ and EO data assimilated into theoretical models is required to effectively mitigate the consequences of a sea ice hazard. © 2018 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057958140"

In this study, continuous observations in the Canada Basin from March through December 2014 were used to investigate spatial differences and temporal changes in under-ice roughness and momentum transfer as the ice cover evolved seasonally. Observations of wind, ice, and ocean properties from four clusters of drifting instrument systems were complemented by direct drill-hole measurements and instrumented overhead flights by NASA operation IceBridge in March, as well as satellite remote sensing imagery about the instrument clusters. Spatially, directly estimated ice-ocean drag coefficients varied by a factor of three with rougher ice associated with smaller multi-year ice floe sizes embedded within the first-year-ice/multi-year-ice conglomerate. Temporal differences in the ice-ocean drag coefficient of 20–30% were observed prior to the mixed layer shoaling in summer and were associated with ice concentrations falling below 100%. The ice-ocean drag coefficient parameterization was found to be invalid in September with low ice concentrations and small ice floe sizes. Maximum momentum transfer to the ice occurred for moderate ice concentrations, and transfer to the ocean for the lowest ice concentrations and shallowest stratification. Wind work and ocean work on the ice were the dominant terms in the kinetic energy budget of the ice throughout the melt season, consistent with free drift conditions. Overall, ice topography, ice concentration, and the shallow summer mixed layer all influenced mixed layer currents and the transfer of momentum within the air-ice-ocean system. The observed changes in momentum transfer show that care must be taken to determine appropriate parameterizations of momentum transfer, and imply that the future Arctic system could become increasingly seasonal. © 2017 The Author(s).

As a result, PolSAR images are complex multi-dimensional data which can be extensively applied in sea ice monitoring and classification. The discrimination capability of PolSAR data makes them a unique source of information with a significant contribution to make in tackling problems concerning environmental applications, especially in the Arctic regions. The increasing temperature of the Earth due to climate change, combined with the degradation of ice thickness in the Arctic region increases the navigation of shipping routes more than ever before. Thus, oil and gas resources at high latitudes are more accessible, which will increase economic activities in the Arctic. Therefore, sea ice monitoring is one of the most important applications of remote sensing tools, since it is time and cost efficient in comparison with extensive field campaigns. Speckle reduction is one of the most important pre-processing steps in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image processing. This paper demonstrated the importance of the de-speckling method for sea ice classification using PolSAR image. A novel contextual speckle reduction method was proposed based on the integration of a Markovian energy function as a contextual analysis, and the Gaussian model as a pixel-wise analysis which maintained the mean value of original data in the homogenous areas and preserved the edges of features in the heterogeneous regions. Our proposed method is applied to a full polarimetric L-band dataset, ALOS-1 PALSAR acquired from Baffin Bay. The efficiency of the proposed method was compared with other well-known de-speckling methods, such as the Kuan method, the enhanced Lee method, and the Nonlocal Means and Refined Lee method. Different de-speckling indices, including the Mean Square Error (MSE), the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), the Edge Saving Index (ESI), and Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL) were extracted for filtered images from different methods. Moreover, the capability of all de-speckled PolSAR images was compared in terms of overall sea ice classification results. The results demonstrated that the proposed method was outperformed by other well-known methods in terms of both de-speckled indices as well as classification results. © 2017, The Imaging and Geospatial Information Society.

The focus is on exploring the possibility to investigate hydrodynamic processes associated with river outflows, in particular internal waves (IWs). Submesoscale IWs having wavelengths less than 50 m and generated by unstable sharp front of a river plume were revealed and their parameters were assessed. A map of surface manifestation of IW trains in the Gulf of Lions was created based on MSI/S2 images. There are different mechanisms of IW generation in river outflow zones, they are determined by a number of parameters including river discharge, bottom topography and presence of tidal currents or inertial period IWs in the shelf zone. A new phenomenon manifested as a chain of quasi circles was discovered. Inertial water motions were suggested as its prime cause, however, this hypothesis is yet to be investigated. An analysis of OLI/L8 and MSI/S2 data enabled us to consider in detail river debouchment streams. For the first time a wave pattern of such stream in the eastern Black Sea was observed in conditions of foehn winds. Usually, foehn winds are distinctly manifested in radar images. A joint analysis of quasi simultaneous ocean color MSI/S2 and Sentinel-1A SAR images demonstrated how water stream wave-like signatures differ from those of foehn winds. © 2016 SPIE.","Discharge (fluid mechanics); Hydrophilicity; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Wind; Black sea; Inertial motions; Internal waves; LANDSAT; Mediterranean sea; River plume; Sentinel-2A MSI; Suspended matters; Rivers","Black Sea; Inertial motion; Internal waves; Landsat-8 OLI; Mediterranean Sea; River plume; Sentinel-2A MSI; Suspended matter","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011310956"

The survey was conducted by the Federal Institute of Hydrology, Germany, and the Fraunhofer Application Center for Multimodal and Airborne Sensors as well as by a contracted engineering company with the aim to acquire spatial thermal infrared (TIR) data of the Hahnöfer Nebenelbe, a branch of the Elbe estuary. Additionally, RGB and NIR data was captured to facilitate the identification of water surfaces and intertidal mudflats. The temperature distribution of the Elbe estuary affects all biological processes and in consequence the oxygen content, which is a key parameter in water quality. The oxygen levels vary in space between the main fairway and side channels. So far, only point measurements are available for monitoring and calibration/validation of water quality models. To better represent this highly dynamic system with a high spatial and temporal variability, tidal streams, heating and cooling, diffusion and mixing processes, spatially distributed data from several points of time within the tidal cycle are necessary. The data acquisition took place during two tidal cycles over two subsequent days in the summer of 2015. While the piloted gyrocopter covered the whole Hahnöfer Nebenelbe seven times, the unmanned hexacopter covered a smaller section of the branch and tidal mudflats with a higher spatial and temporal resolution (16 coverages of the subarea). The gyrocopter data was acquired with a thermal imaging system and processed and georeferenced using the structure from motion algorithm with GPS information from the gyrocopter and optional ground control points. The hexacopter data was referenced based on ground control points and the GPS and position information of the acquisition system. Both datasets from the gyrocopter and the hexacopter are corrected for the effects of the atmosphere and emissivity of the water surface and compared to in situ measurements, taken during the data acquisition. Of particular interest is the effect of the observation angle on the brightness temperature acquired by the wide angle lenses on the platforms, which is up to 40° at the margins of the imagery. Here, both datasets show deviating temperatures, which are probably not due to actual temperature differences. We will discuss the position accuracy achieved over the water areas, the adaptation of atmospheric and emissivity correction to the observation angle and subsequent improvement of the temperature data. With two datasets of the same research area at different resolutions we will investigate the effects of the acquisition platforms, acquisition system and resolutions on the accuracy of the remotely sensed temperatures as well as their ability to represent temperature patterns of tidal currents and mixing processes. © 2016 SPIE.","Data acquisition; Electromagnetic wave emission; Estuaries; Global positioning system; Hydrophilicity; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Mixing; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Sea ice; Skin effect; Space optics; Surveys; Thermal stratification; Water quality; Atmospheric corrections; Gyrocopter; Remotely sensed temperature; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial and temporal variability; Structure from motion algorithm; Thermal infrared; Unmanned aerial systems; Atmospheric temperature","Atmospheric correction; Emissivity correction; Gyrocopter; Remote sensing; Skin effect; Thermal infrared; Thermal stratification; Unmanned aerial system","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011277702"

An early warning system is desired to discriminate between thin ice of no risk and thick ice with significant challenge. The severity and variability of ice conditions will affect the feasibility of operating in such a region, with significant impact on the design and selection of resources to be used and the ice management requirements to support exploration and development. By measuring the ice thickness, operators can determine the operational risk for ice management operations. In addition, it can help map the areas of thin ice to aid shipping route selection. Despite its fundamental importance, sea ice thickness is one of the most difficult measurements to obtain via remote sensing. Passive remote sensing methods at the near infrared, thermal infrared and visible electromagnetic wavelengths, are restricted due to fog, precipitation, clouds, and Polar darkness. Thus active sensing techniques are deemed to be the only feasible method of measuring ice thickness, especially if they can be mounted in aircraft or satellites. Technical solutions are available to measure the thickness of sea ice, but they do not provide a physical measurement over a wide swath of ice. Thus, the authors are developing a wide swath ice thickness measurement system to fill this gap. The most practical solution for ice thickness measurement is an airborne radar. The authors have completed the preliminary design of a system that will combine an ice penetrating radar with a microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The penetrating radar will be used to glean physical measurements of ice thickness, to be fused with the wide swath SAR to produce an ice thickness map.

Estimating the sea ice thickness is currently the most important issue in the study of sea ice remote sensing. With the Bohai Sea as the study area, a semiempirical model of the sea ice thickness (SEMSIT) that can be used to estimate the thickness of first-year ice based on existing water depth estimation models and hyperspectral remote sensing data according to an optical radiative transfer process in sea ice is proposed. In the model, the absorption and scattering properties of sea ice in different bands (spectral dimension information) are utilized. An integrated attenuation coefficient at the pixel level is estimated using the height of the reflectance peak at 1 088 nm. In addition, the surface reflectance of sea ice at the pixel level is estimated using the 1 550–1 750 nm band reflectance. The model is used to estimate the sea ice thickness with Hyperion images. The first validation results suggest that the proposed model and parameterization scheme can effectively reduce the estimation error associated with the sea ice thickness that is caused by temporal and spatial heterogeneities in the integrated attenuation coefficient and sea ice surface. A practical semi-empirical model and parameterization scheme that may be feasible for the sea ice thickness estimation using hyperspectral remote sensing data are potentially provided. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Bohai Sea; hyperspectral remote sensing; sea ice thickness; semi-empirical model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008877641"

It is commonly believed that traditional sea ice models that employ elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) rheologies are not capable of properly simulating sea ice deformation, including lead formation, and thus, new formulations for sea ice rheologies have been suggested. Here we show that classical sea ice models have skill in simulating the spatial and temporal variation of lead area fraction in the Arctic when horizontal resolution is increased (here 4.5 km in the Arctic) and when numerical convergence in sea ice solvers is considered, which is frequently neglected. The model results are consistent with satellite remote sensing data and discussed in terms of variability and trends of Arctic sea ice leads.

Through this impact Arctic low clouds influence important aspects of the Arctic climate system, namely surface and atmospheric temperature, sea ice extent and thickness, and atmospheric circulation. Arctic clouds are in turn influenced by these elements of the Arctic climate system, and these interactions create the potential for Arctic cloud-climate feedbacks. To further our understanding of potential Arctic cloud-climate feedbacks, the goal of this paper is to quantify the influence of atmospheric state on the surface cloud radiative effect (CRE) and its covariation with sea ice concentration (SIC). We build on previous research using instantaneous, active remote sensing satellite footprint data from the NASA A-Train. First, the results indicate significant differences in the surface CRE when stratified by atmospheric state. Second, there is a weak covariation between CRE and SIC for most atmospheric conditions. Third, the results show statistically significant differences in the average surface CRE under different SIC values in fall indicating a 3-5 W m-2 larger LW CRE in 0% versus 100% SIC footprints. Because systematic changes on the order of 1 W m-2 are sufficient to explain the observed long-term reductions in sea ice extent, our results indicate a potentially significant amplifying sea ice-cloud feedback, under certain meteorological conditions, that could delay the fall freeze-up and influence the variability in sea ice extent and volume. Lastly, a small change in the frequency of occurrence of atmosphere states may yield a larger Arctic cloud feedback than any cloud response to sea ice. © 2017 U.S. Government.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015837085"

Many different satellite sensors and techniques exist, some are available since more than 40 years, some are currently still under development. The most important measurement techniques and methods to derive sea ice properties like sea ice area, thickness, and motion are introduced. Measurements at microwave frequencies from radiometers, scatterometers, and synthetic aperture radars (SAR) have the advantage to be independent of clouds and the polar night. Observations in the visual spectrum can have higher spatial resolution and be used during months with daylight to derive additional quantities like the coverage with melt ponds. Satellite altimeters measure the sea ice freeboard, which can be converted to ice thickness. These observations then can be used to gain a better understanding of the polar climate system and long-term changes in the sea ice cover can be monitored. © 2003, 2010, 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It is necessary to monitor these events, as they play a crucial role in the current dynamics of the Western Antarctic Ice Sheet. The data has been acquired from LANDSAT (4-5, 7 and 8). The description of these events has been categorized into three major categories: to be calved, calved-icebergs and the potential locations that are vulnerable of being calved. Three minor calving events have been discussed in this study. The first event has been reported near Dean Island. The calved off iceberg from the location is having a surface area of 2.98 sq. km. The second event took place near Fletcher Island, where the rate at which the rift is growing is observed to be 0.53 km/year (2002-2009). Visual analysis has played a vital role in predicting the shape (tabular) of the iceberg which is yet to calve. The third event, which is of global attention, has been reported at Larsen C of Antarctic Peninsula, and has calved a huge iceberg. The difference between the lengths is calculated as 39.65 km and 53.42 km for the image dated 15-03-2005 and 08-03-2012 and 08-03-2012 and 02-02-2016 respectively. The rate of growth of the rift is 5.66 km/year until 2012 and 3.11 km/year until 2016. The study mainly focuses on usage of optical moderate resolution satellite data for monitoring and tracking iceberg calving events that can be used as an indicator of climate change. © 2017 ACRS.

One of the algorithms that combine both observations to identify partial concentrations of ice types (including MYI) is the Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE). However, cycles of warm-cold air temperature trigger wet-dry cycles of the snow cover on MYI surface. Under wet snow conditions, anomalous brightness temperature and backscatter, similar to those of first-year ice (FYI), are observed. This leads to misidentification of MYI as being FYI, hence decreasing the estimated MYI concentration suddenly. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a correction scheme to restore the MYI concentration under this condition. The correction is based on air temperature records. It utilizes the fact that the warm spell in autumn lasts for a short period of time (a few days). The correction is applied to MYI concentration retrievals from ECICE using an input of combined QuikSCAT and AMSR-E data, acquired over the Arctic region in a series of autumn seasons from 2003 to 2008. The correction works well by replacing anomalous MYI concentrations with interpolated ones. For September of the six years, it introduces over 0.1× 106 km2 MYI area, except for 2005. Due to the regional effect of warm air spells, the correction could be important in the operational applications where ice concentrations are crucial on small scale and mesoscale. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Canada; Algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Remote sensing; Snow; Active microwave; Brightness temperatures; Concentration retrieval; Correction schemes; Ice concentration; Multiyear ice concentration; Operational applications; Regional effects; air temperature; algorithm; AMSR-E; atmospheric correction; brightness temperature; estimation method; ice cover; ice-ocean interaction; periglacial environment; QuikSCAT; remote sensing; seasonality; surface temperature; Ice","Arctic sea ice; Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE); ice concentration; microwave remote sensing; multiyear ice (MYI); surface air temperature","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951304522"

The first part of our analysis addresses the predictive value of different subsets of features for our classification process (by means of measuring mutual information).

The classification is based on and validated by in situ data acquired during the N-ICE2015 field campaign.

The results reveal that the daily mean SST of merged data has much lower bias and root mean square error as compared with that from microwave products. Therefore the results support the necessary of the merging infrared and drifter SST with a microwave satellite for improving the quality of the SST. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient between an SST error and meteorological parameters, which include a wind speed, an air temperature, a relative humidity, an air pressure, and a visibility. The results show that the wind speed has the largest correlation coefficient with the TMI SST error. However, the air temperature is the most important factor to the OSTIA SST error.

Compared with the achievements in land surface albedo studies, the global distributions of ocean water and sea ice albedo are seldom addressed. This study designed an operational global OWA algorithm based on the three-component reflectance model of the ocean water: sun glint, whitecaps, and water-leaving reflectance. The related achievements in these three areas are reviewed and integrated into the operational algorithm. After the sensitive analysis, the algorithm is compared with previous studies and validated with ground observations at COVE site located 25 km east of Virginia Beach (36.91° N, 75.71° W), and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm is generally consistent with previous parameterization scheme. As an example, the global OWAs in summer and winter 2011 are generated using the remote sensing reflectance data sets via the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications meteorological reanalysis data set. The generated product includes instantaneous (e.g., local noon) and daily mean OWAs under both clear-sky and white-sky conditions. Upon the examples, the local noon clear-sky OWA shows a significant latitude variation due to the dominance of the solar angle, whereas the white-sky OWA is sensitive to wind speeds and optical constituents. The global distribution of the daily mean OWA exhibits a similar trend to the local noon OWA. However, the daily mean clear-sky OWA is significantly larger than the local noon OWA; this finding should be noted when using OWA products for energy balance research. Additionally, all forms of OWA products exhibit increase in coastal areas with high input of terrestrial matters. © 2015 IEEE.","United States; Virginia; Virginia Beach; Algorithms; Balloons; Geographical distribution; Image reconstruction; Oceanography; Radiometers; Reflection; Sea ice; Solar radiation; Ground observations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Operational algorithms; Parameterization schemes; Remote-sensing reflectance; Research and application; Retrospective analysis; Water-leaving reflectance; albedo; algorithm; climate change; data assimilation; energy balance; estimation method; global climate; ground-based measurement; land surface; meteorology; MODIS; parameterization; reflectance; remote sensing; sea ice; seawater; Remote sensing","Ocean water albedo (OWA); sun glint; water-leaving reflectance; whitecaps","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940732889"

Firstly, the radiance recorded by an airborne sensor comes from several sources: the real radiance of the object, the atmospheric scattering, sky and sun glint and the dark current of the sensor. Secondly, the dispersive element inside the sensor (usually a diffraction grating or a prism) could move during the flight, thus shifting the observed spectra on the wavelengths axis. Thirdly, to compute the reflectance, it is necessary to estimate, for each band, what value of irradiance corresponds to a 100% reflectance. We present here our calibration method, relying on the absorption features of the atmosphere and the near-infrared properties of common materials. By choosing proper flight height and flight lines angle, we can ignore atmospheric and sun glint contributions. Autocorrelation plots allow to identify and reduce the noise in our signals. Then, we compute a signal that represents the high frequencies of the spectrum, to localize the atmospheric absorption peaks (mainly the dioxygen peak around 760 nm). Matching these peaks removes the shift induced by the moving dispersive element. Finally, we use the signal collected over a Lambertian, unit-reflectance surface to estimate the ratio of the system's transmittances to its near-infrared transmittance. This transmittance is computed assuming an average 50% reflectance of the vegetation and nearly 0% for water in the near-infrared. Results show great correlation between the output spectra and ground measurements from a TriOS Ramses and the water-insight WISP-3. © 2016 SPIE.","Absorption spectroscopy; Calibration; Dispersion (waves); Hydrophilicity; Radiometry; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Vegetation; Airborne; Airborne hyperspectral data; Atmospheric absorption; HyperSpectral; Near Infrared; Near-infrared transmittances; Self calibration; Water-leaving reflectance; Infrared devices","Airborne; Hyperspectral; Near-Infrared; Radiometry; Self-Calibration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011301786"

The system was installed on a Twin Otter and used to collect data to demonstrate the capability of fine-resolution measurements of snow thickness over both sea ice and land near Barrow, AK. Data collected over a relatively smooth water surface, a lead, were used to deconvolve system effects to reduce range sidelobes and obtain close-to-ideal range resolution.

The radar-derived snow thickness data are in a very good agreement with the in situ measured data with a correlation of 0.88. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Alaska; Barrow; United States; Continuous wave radar; Continuous wave radar; Frequency modulation; Frequency modulation; Ice; Ice; Radar; Radar; Radar systems; Radar systems; Sea ice; Sea ice; Snow; Snow; Snowfall measurement; Snowfall measurement; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Ultra-wideband (UWB); Airborne measurements; Airborne measurements; Fine resolution; Fine resolution; Frequency modulated continuous wave radars; Frequency modulated continuous wave radars; Frequency ranges; Frequency ranges; In-situ measured data; In-situ measured data; Range resolution; Range resolution; Range sidelobes; Range sidelobes; System effects; System effects; ice thickness; interface; land cover; microwave radiometer; radar; remote sensing; resolution; sea ice; snow; wave spectrum; Radar measurement; Radar measurement","Airborne radar; frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar; microwave; remote sensing; sea ice; snow; ultrawideband","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994259675"

These cloud-related processes are suspected to play a major role in the Arctic energy budget due to their persistence and peculiar microphysical properties. This chapter focuses on the characterization of MPC properties in the Arctic region from in situ and satellite observations. The frequency of MPC occurrence over the Arctic region is determined from the CALIPSO and CloudSat satellite active remote sensing observations. Results highlight that the spatial, vertical and seasonal variability of MPC can be in part linked to the influence of the North Atlantic Ocean and the melting of sea ice. The microphysical and optical properties of the ice crystals and liquid droplets within MPC and the associated formation and growth processes responsible for the cloud life cycle are evaluated based on in situ airborne observations. Finally, the coupling of in situ MPC airborne measurements with the satellite active remote sensing is presented through a validation study to evaluate remote sensing retrieval algorithms and products such as cloud detection or cloud phase. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In this framework, work has been done to characterize the spectral signature of hydrocarbons in lab in order to build a database of oil spectral signatures. The main objective of this database is to provide spectral libraries for data processing algorithms to be applied to airborne VNIRSWIR hyperspectral images. A campaign run by the NOFO institute (Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies) took place in 2015 to test anti-pollution equipment. During this campaign, several hydrocarbon products, including an oil emulsion, were released into the sea, off the Norwegian coast. The NOFO team allowed the NAOMI project to acquire data over the resulting oil slicks using the SETHI system, which is an airborne remote sensing imaging system developed by ONERA. SETHI integrates a new generation of optoelectronic and radar payloads and can operate over a wide range of frequency bands. SETHI is a pod-based system operating onboard a Falcon 20 Dassault aircraft, which is owned by AvDEF. For these experiments, imaging sensors were constituted by 2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), working at X and L bands in a full polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VH, VV) and 2 HySpex hyperspectral cameras working in the VNIR (0,4 to 1 μm) and SWIR (1 to 2,5 μm) spectral ranges. A sample of the oil emulsion that was used during the campaign was sent to our laboratory for analysis. Measurements of its transmission and of its reflectance in the VNIR and SWIR spectral domains have been performed at ONERA with a Perkin Elmer spectroradiometer and a spectrogoniometer. Several samples of the oil emulsion were prepared in order to measure spectral variations according to oil thickness, illumination angle and aging. These measurements have been used to build spectral libraries. Spectral matching techniques, relying on these libraries have been applied to the airborne hyperspectral acquisitions. These data processing approaches enable to characterize the oil emulsion by estimating the properties taken into account to build the spectral library, thus going further than unsupervised spectral indices that are able to detect the presence of oil. The paper will describe the airborne hyperspectral data, the measurements performed in the laboratory, and the processing of the optical images with spectral indices for oil detection and with spectral matching techniques for oil characterization. Furthermore, the issue of mixed oil-water pixels in the hyperspectral images due to limited spatial resolution will be addressed by estimating the areal fraction of each. © 2017 SPIE.","Binary alloys; Characterization; Data handling; Emulsification; Emulsions; Frequency bands; Geometrical optics; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Hyperspectral imaging; Image processing; Libraries; Oil spills; Pollution control equipment; Radar; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Airborne hyperspectral data; Airborne remote sensing; Data processing algorithms; Hyper-spectral cameras; Offshore hydrocarbons; Spectral matching techniques; Spectral matchings; Spectral signature; Remote sensing","hydrocarbon emulsion; Hydrocarbons detection; Hydrocarbons spectral signature; Offshore remote sensing; Spectral matching","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038424820"

Some living and manmade objects in water have surfaces which partially polarize the light, whose properties can be used to camouflage or, conversely, to detect such objects. The attenuation of light by the intervening water (so-called veiling light) changes both the intensity and polarization characteristics at each pixel of the image, but does not contain any information about the target and contributes to image degradation and blurring. Its properties need to be understood in order to isolate the true optical signature of the target. The main goal of this study is to retrieve the polarization characteristics of the target from the image in different water environmental and illumination conditions by taking into account coincidentally measured inherent water optical properties (IOPs) during recent field campaigns outside the Chesapeake Bay and in New York Bight. Data, in the form of images and videos, were acquired using a green-band full-Stokes polarimetric video camera. Analysis of the acquired images show reasonable agreement in Stokes vector components with the measurements by the underwater polarimeter and modeled polarized signals. In addition, Stokes vector components of the veiling light were also estimated and compared with the models. Finally, retrieval of the attenuation coefficient for the light from the target is attempted from the measurements and compared with the results of the independent measurements of IOPs. © 2017 SPIE.","Cameras; Hydrophilicity; Object detection; Optical properties; Polarimeters; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Underwater acoustics; Video cameras; Water absorption; Absorption and scatterings; Attenuation coefficient; Illumination conditions; Independent measurement; Polarization characteristics; Stokes vector; Underwater environments; Water optical properties; Underwater imaging","Polarimeter; Polarization; Stokes vector; Underwater imaging; Video camera; Water optical properties","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038418708"

The occurrence of the unusual phytoplankton bloom in December 2005 (called Bloom 1 in this study) has been reported in the literature to be triggered by multiple forcings, including strong cyclonic eddy, frequent typhoons, and strong wind-induced mixing. Interestingly, the other unusual phytoplankton bloom (called Bloom 2 in this study) was identified in almost the same location in December 2013. Further, it is the strongest bloom during our study period with large area of high Chl-a > 1.0 mg/m3 and shared some similar features with Bloom 1, such as wide coverage and long duration. At the same time, there were also frequent typhoons and a cyclonic eddy. The possible causes of Bloom 2 were examined using time series of multi-satellite datasets, including sea surface height anomalies (SSHA), sea surface temperature (SST), together with Argo profile data. We found that the cyclonic eddy might be not yet the dominant factor for Bloom 2 as the eddy was much weaker than that of Bloom 1. Specially, SST in December 2013 was lowest among all the December from 2003 to 2015. That is, the stratification is weakest. Therefore, the weak stratification can be broken easily by mixing induced by typhoons and cyclonic eddies and finally result in the strong bloom. This comparative studies could provide us some insight in understanding the role of eddies and tropical cyclones in phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay of Bengal. © 2017 SPIE.","Hurricanes; Hydrophilicity; Mixing; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Storms; Surface waters; Thermal stratification; Bay of Bengal; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Eddy; Phytoplankton bloom; Phytoplankton dynamics; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sea-surface height anomalies; Weak stratification; Oceanography","Bay of Bengal; Eddy; Phytoplankton bloom; Stratification; Typhoon","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038428064"

However, measurements of true water inventories stored in sea, lake and land ice have been significantly hindered by uncertainties introduced by snow cover for the last 40 years of satellite missions. Current estimations of hydrological and climate models, Earth's energy balance (albedo) calculations and flood predictions suffer from inaccuracies due to an inability to accurately determine the water content of snow cover. The Snow Water Equivalent Altimetry mission concept has been developed to address this fundamental issue, enabling direct measurement of surface Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) on sea ice and land at latitudes above 60 degrees and below -60 degrees. In order to achieve this, the proposed mission will implement a novel combination of Ka- and Ku-band radar altimeters (active microwave sensors), capable of penetrating into the snow microstructure. The Ka-band altimeter (wavelength 0.8 cm) provides a low maximum snow pack penetration depth of up to 20 cm for dry snow, since the volume scattering of snow dominates over the scattering caused by the underlying ice or land surface. In contrast, the Ku-band altimeter (wavelength 2 cm) provides a high maximum snowpack penetration depth of up to 15 m in high latitudes regions with dry snow, as volume scattering is decreased by more than one order of magnitude compared to Ka-band. The combined difference in Ka- and Ku-band signal penetration results will provide a direct and more accurate determination of SWE. As a result, global SWE estimations interpreted from passive microwave products and the reliability of numerical snow and climate models will be advanced. © 2018 International Astronautical Federation IAF.

We used the quasi-analytic algorithm (Lee et al 2002 Appl. Opti. 41, 5755-5772. (doi:10.1364/AO.41.005755)) that separates absorption by phytoplankton from absorption by CDOM and detrital matter. We merged satellite data from multiple satellite sensors and created a 19 year time series (1997-2015) of NPP. During this period, both the estimated annual total and the summer monthly maximum pan-Arctic NPP increased by about 47%. Positive monthly anomalies in NPP are highly correlated with positive anomalies in open water area during the summer months. Following the earlier ice retreat, the start of the high-productivity season has become earlier, e.g. at a mean rate of -3.0 d yr-1 in the northern Barents Sea, and the length of the high-productivity period has increased from 15 days in 1998 to 62 days in 2015. While in some areas, the termination of the productive season has been extended, owing to delayed ice formation, the termination has also become earlier in other areas, likely owing to limited nutrients. © 2016 The Author(s).","Algorithms; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Ice Cover; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Seawater; sea water; algorithm; Arctic; climate change; growth, development and aging; ice cover; phytoplankton; remote sensing; sea; season","global change; ocean colour; primary production; sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018063483"

However, the magnitude of the CO2 sink is uncertain because of the scarcity of in-situ observations due to its remote and rough waters. Empirical relationships were deduced based on the in-situ partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in surface seawater and its main controls including Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) obtained during the 26th CHINARE cruise in late spring (November) and early summer (December) 2009. An extrapolation method based on multiple linear regressions was set up for combining the empirical relationship with satellite data to compute the sea-air carbon fluxes and carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean (south of 50°S). The empirical relationships are validated with independent measurements from SOCATv2 database. The mean standard deviation differences (Std) between extrapolated and measured pCO2 from SOCATv2 database (13.8 to 18.1 μatm) are consistent with the precision of our regressions (13.6 to 21.3 μatm). Including the effects of sea ice, we estimate a Southern Ocean CO2 source to the atmosphere in November 2009 about 1.65Tg C with an uncertainty of ±0.73 Tg C by uncertainty propagation formula. While in December 2009, we estimated a CO2 sink of -2.34 Tg C with an uncertainty of ±1.03 Tg C. The carbon source and sink of the South Atlantic Ocean, the South Indian Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean were estimated. For the austral summer, the South Atlantic Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean are still strong carbon sink. When compared to the climatological monthly results of Takahashi et al.

Surf zone imagery, images of shallow bays, lagoons and coastal waters are processed to produce bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) signatures corrected for changing viewing angles. Angular changes as a function of pixel location within a scene are used to estimate changes in pixel size and ground sampling areas. Diffuse calibration targets collected simultaneously from within the image scene provides the necessary information for calculating BRF signatures of the water surface and shorelines. Automated scanning using a pushbroom hyperspectral sensor allows imagery to be collected on the order of one minute or less for different regions of interest. Imagery is then rectified and georeferenced using ground control points within nadir viewing multispectral imagery via image to image registration techniques. This paper demonstrates the above as well as presenting how spectra can be extracted along different directions in the imagery. The extraction of BRF spectra along track lines allows the application of derivative reflectance spectroscopy for estimating chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic matter and suspended matter concentrations at or near the water surface.

In the proposed approach, instead of relying entirely on the SAR intensity values, the posterior sampling is performed based on a number of quantitative factors, such as intensity, label field, and the prior class probability of sampling candidates, constituting a complete probabilistic framework that addresses key aspects in the synthesis of SAR imagery from heterogeneous sources. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can better address the difficulties caused by the heterogeneity in the source images compared with the existing state-of-the-art ice synthesis method, and it will improve the consistency, comprehensiveness, and fairness of the evaluation of the remote sensing classification and segmentation algorithms. © 2016 IEEE.","Ice; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mapping; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Class probabilities; Evaluating algorithms; Heterogeneous sources; Probabilistic framework; Quantitative factors; Remote sensing classification; Segmentation algorithms; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging","Image synthesis; oil spills; sea ice; Statistical texture modeling","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007110623"

Non-destructive in situ monitoring of sea-ice microstructure is of value for sea-ice research and operations but remains elusive to date. We examine the potential for the electric properties of sea ice, which is highly sensitive to the brine distribution within the ice, to serve as a proxy for microstructure and, hence, other ice transport properties. Throughout spring of 2013 and 2014, we measured complex dielectric permittivity in the range of 10 to 95ĝ€kHz in landfast ice off the coast of Barrow (Utqiagvik), Alaska. Temperature and salinity measurements and ice samples provide data to characterize ice microstructure in relation to these permittivity measurements. The results reveal a significant correlation between complex dielectric permittivity, brine volume fraction, and microstructural characteristics including pore volume and connectivity, derived from X-ray microtomography of core samples. The influence of temperature and salinity variations as well as the relationships between ice properties, microstructural characteristics, and dielectric behavior emerge from multivariate analysis of the combined data set. Our findings suggest some promise for low-frequency permittivity measurements to track seasonal evolution of a combination of mean pore volume, fractional connectivity, and pore surface area-to-volume ratio, which in turn may serve as proxies for key sea-ice transport properties. © Author(s) 2016.","Alaska; Barrow; United States; air-sea interaction; dielectric property; field method; ice cover; in situ measurement; microstructure; permittivity; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; temperature profile; temporal evolution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999751695"

Remote sensing supported the determination of the sampling strategy and helped positioning each sampling station. Total alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton pigments and composition were investigated in combination with measurements of temperature, salinity and current speed. Total inorganic carbon, sea water CO2 partial pressure and the saturation state (Ω) for calcite and aragonite were calculated from the measured total alkalinity and pH. In addition, continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentration were completed. LADCP measurements revealed the presence of a significant change in current speed and direction that corresponded to a clearly defined front characterized by gradients in both temperature and salinity. Phytoplankton biomass was relatively high at all stations and the highest values of chlorophyll-a were found between 20 to 50 m, with the dominant taxonomic group being haptophyceae. The carbonate system properties in surface waters exhibited mesoscale variability with a horizontal length scale of about 10 km. Sea-ice melt, through the input of low salinity water, results in a dilution of the total alkalinity and inorganic carbon, but our observations suggest that phytoplankton activity was the major forcing of the distribution of the carbonate system variables. Higher CO3−, Ω and pH in the surface layer were found where the highest values of chlorophyll-a were observed. The calculated ΔpCO2 pattern follows both MODIS data and in situ chlorophyll-a measurements, and the estimated CO2 fluxes ranged from –0.5 ± 0.4 to –31.0 ± 6.4 mmol m− 2 d− 1. The large range observed in the fluxes is due to both the spatial variability of sea water pCO2 and to the episodic winds experienced. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Antarctica; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Haptophyceae; Alkalinity; Bioactivity; Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon; Carbonation; Chlorophyll; Dissolved oxygen; pH; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Seawater; Air flux; Carbonate system; Mesoscale; Phytoplankton pigments; Ross Sea; air-sea interaction; bioactivity; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbonate system; chlorophyll a; inorganic carbon; mesoscale eddy; phytoplankton; pigment; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; summer; total organic carbon; Carbon dioxide","Biological activity; Carbonate system; CO<sub>2</sub> sea–air flux; Mesoscale; Phytoplankton pigments; Ross Sea","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947547438"

This paper uses stochastic models and geostatistic metrics to characterize the spatial structures of sea ice based on stochastic geometry and spatial statistics. We propose a geostatistic metric first-order variogram based on the second-order variogram, and prove its efficiency to describe the sea ice spatial structures. The sea ice spatial structures are characterized by the weighted linear combination of two stochastic models. One is a multi-Gamma model, which characterizes continuous variations corresponding to water or the background of sea ice. Another is a Poisson line mosaic model, which characterizes the regional variations of different types of sea ice. The linear combination of the two models defines the mixture model to represent spatial structures of sea ice within SAR intensity imagery. To estimate the parameters of the mixture model, experimental first-and second-order variograms are calculated from the SAR intensity imagery, and then fit them with the theoretical variograms for the purpose of estimating the mixture model parameters. The proposed approach is applied to Radarsat-1 images from April to June to identify the change of sea ice. The results of the experiments show that the proposed approach can estimate the sea ice density accurately and stably. © 2016, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

To understand the influence of rainfall on the sea surface salinity (SSS) in the waters adjacent to Taiwan, satellite remote sensing data from the year of 2012 to 2014 are employed in this study. The daily rain rate data obtained from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's Microwave Imager (TRMM/TMI), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR), and WindSat Polarimetric Radiometer. The SSS data was derived from the measurements of radiometer instruments onboard the Aquarius satellite. The results show the average values of SSS in east of Taiwan, east of Luzon and South China Sea are 33.83 psu, 34.05 psu, and 32.84 psu, respectively, in the condition of daily rain rate higher than 1 mm/hr. In contrast to the rainfall condition, the average values of SSS are 34.07 psu, 34.26 psu, and 33.09 psu in the three areas, respectively at no rain condition (rain rate less than 1 mm/hr). During the cases of heavy rainfall caused by spiral rain bands of typhoon, the SSS is diluted with an average value of -0.78 psu when the average rain rate is higher than 4 mm/hr. However, the SSS was increased after temporarily decreased during the typhoon cases. A possible reason to explain this phenomenon is that the heavy rainfall caused by the spiral rain bands of typhoon may dilute the sea surface water, but the strong winds can uplift the higher salinity of subsurface water to the sea surface. © 2017 SPIE.","Hurricanes; Hydrophilicity; Lutetium compounds; Microwave sensors; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiometers; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface waters; Advanced microwave scanning radiometer; AQUARIUS; Polarimetric radiometer; Satellite remote sensing data; Sea surface salinity; Special sensor microwave imagers; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Water cycle; Rain","Aquarius satellite; Rainfall; Sea surface salinity; Water cycle","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038440660"

The Sentinels of the European Space Agency (ESA), together with other satellite missions, provide a variety of data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, at different spatial scales, and with different temporal resolutions. In a case study we demonstrate the advantage of merging data from different spaceborne instruments for analysing ice conditions and ice dynamics in and around the frequently occurring Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) in the Ross Sea in the Antarctic. Starting with a list of polynya parameters that are typically retrieved from satellite images, we assess the usefulness of different sensor types. On regional scales (several 100 km), passive microwave radiometers provide a view on the mutual influence of the three Ross Sea polynyas on sea ice drift and deformation patterns. Optical sensors with meter-scale resolution, on the other hand, allow very localized analyses of different polynya zones. The combination of different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum is essential for recognition and classification of ice types and structures. Radar images together with data from thermal infrared sensors, operated at tens to hundreds of meters resolution, improve the separation of the outlet zone of the polynya from the adjacent pack ice. The direct comparison of radar and passive microwave images reveals the visibility of deformed ice zone in the latter. A sequence of radar images was employed to retrieve ice drift around the TNB, which allows analysing the temporal changes of the polynya area and the extension and structure of the outlet zone as well as ice movements and deformation that are influenced by the katabatic winds. © 2016 The Authors","Antarctica; East Antarctica; Ross Sea; Southern Ocean; Terra Nova Bay; Deformation; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Infrared detectors; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Ocean currents; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Ice drift; Ice type; Multi sensor; Optical image; Polynya; Terra nova bays; Thermal IR; ice drift; image analysis; katabatic flow; microwave imagery; optical method; polynya; radar imagery; remote sensing; satellite imagery; satellite mission; sea ice; Sentinel; Thermal Infrared Multispectral Scanner; Sea ice","Ice drift retrieval; Ice type classification; Microwaves; Multi-sensor satellite observations; Optical images; Polynya; Sea ice; Terra Nova Bay; Thermal IR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991465825"

It starts with the formation of crevasses and rifts. In Antarctica, various ice shelves are witnessing major and minor iceberg calving at the coast. Calving is the major cause of ice mass loss in Antarctic ice shelves. These calving events give us an idea about what is going on in ice shelves and what could be the factors triggering the increasing rate of rifts. Remote Sensing technique has been playing a significant role in tracking these calving events. In this study, three calving events have been studied. Two of them have already been calved and one event is about to calve in future. The first event is reported in the Leopoid and Astrid Coast and calved an iceberg of area 6.09 km2. The second event took place along Sabrina Coast which calved a total area of 33.06 km2. The third event is along Luitpoid Coast where various rifts are going to calve an iceberg. This study tracks calving events through optical remote sensing along the coast of Antarctica. © 2017 ACRS.

Processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is extensively used for control and monitoring of the ocean surface. Image data can be acquired from Earth observation satellites, such as TerraSAR-X, ERS, and COSMO-SkyMed. Thus, SAR image processing can be used to solve many problems arising in this field of research. This paper discusses some of them including ship detection, oil pollution control and ocean currents mapping. Due to complexity of the problem several specialized algorithm are necessary to develop. The oil spill detection algorithm consists of the following main steps: image preprocessing, detection of dark areas, parameter extraction and classification. The ship detection algorithm consists of the following main steps: prescreening, land masking, image segmentation combined with parameter measurement, ship orientation estimation and object discrimination. The proposed approach to ocean currents mapping is based on Doppler's law. The results of computer modeling on real SAR images are presented. Based on these results it is concluded that the proposed approaches can be used in maritime applications. © 2017 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Image processing; Image segmentation; Mapping; Marine pollution; Object detection; Ocean currents; Oceanography; Oil spills; Parameter estimation; Parameter extraction; Pollution control; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Ships; Signal detection; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Control and monitoring; Earth observation satellites; Oil spill detection; Orientation estimation; Results of computer modeling; SAR Images; Ship detection; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","Image processing; Maritime applications; Ocean currents mapping; Oil spill detection; Remote sensing; SAR image; Ship detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038445430"

The South China Sea (SCS) is almost an enclosed marginal sea and is part of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Both of them are tropical marginal seas, and have similar hydrological properties, such as high surface temperature, stable thermocline, deep euphotic zone, etc. Moreover, they are all greatly affected by East Asian monsoon and typhoons. However, there are also several significant differences between them. The current circulation structures in the South China Sea are more complex with significant season variations. A large amount of fresh water through river inputs is one of the remarkable hydrological characteristics in the Bay of Bengal. In addition, the Bay of Bengal has a large volume of precipitation. Therefore, it is naturally interesting to investigate the different response of the marine ecological properties represented by chlorophyll concentration to climate change. The Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) mission have provided a successive, long-term observations of global ocean color from space. In this study, we investigate the Chl-a trends in the BOB and SCS during the SeaWiFS and MODIS observation periods (1998-2010 and 2003-2016), respectively. In 1998-2010, Chl-a increased in the western central basin of BOB, while it decreased in almost all other parts. During 2003-2016, Chl-a significantly increased in the western part of BOB, and reduced in the southern part. In the SCS, Chl-a in almost the whole region increased during the SeaWiFS observation period. In 2003-2016, the major rising trends appeared in China and Vietnam coast, the Beibu Gulf, and the Gulf of Thailand. The Chl-a of the Straits of Malacca and the Karimata Straits showed downward trends. The rise in temperature might be the main cause of the Chl-a decrease in the BOB. The deepened MLD and/or decreasing SST may contribute to the increasing Chl-a of the BOB and SCS. Remarkably, coastal Chl-a has continued to rise over the past 19 years. The freshwater input might have significant effect on it. © 2017 SPIE.","Band structure; Barium compounds; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Hydrophilicity; Imaging techniques; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space optics; Water; Bay of Bengal; Chlorophyll concentration; Hydrological characteristics; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensors; SeaWiFs; South China sea; Oceanography","Chlorophyll; MODIS; SeaWiFS; The Bay of Bengal; The South China Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038413608"

The air-borne surveys provide near-coincident snow plus ice thickness, surface roughness data, and photographs. This unique data set allows us to investigate how the different frequencies can complement one another for sea ice studies, but also to raise awareness of limitations. X-band and L-band satellite scenes were shown to be a useful complement to the standard SAR frequency for sea ice monitoring (C-band) for lead ice and newly formed sea ice identification. This may be in part be due to the frequency but also the high spatial resolution of these sensors. We found a relatively low correlation between snow plus ice thickness and surface roughness. Therefore, in our dataset ice thickness cannot directly be observed by SAR which has important implications for operational ice charting based on automatic segmentation. © 2016.

Key oceanographical variables in this region are the seasonal development of sea-ice and the location and strength of physico-chemical gradients in the surface and subsurface water layers induced by the convergence of Arctic- and Atlantic-derived water masses. Remote sensing imagery have highlighted the increasing success of calcifying haptophytes (coccolithophores) in the summer phytoplankton production of the Barents Sea over the last 20 years, as a response to an overall larger contribution of Atlantic waters to surface and sub-surface waters, as well as to enhanced sea-ice melt-induced summer stratification of the photic layer. The present study provides a first thorough description of coccolithophore standing stocks and diversity over the shelf and slope of the western Barents Sea from two sets of surface and water column samples collected during August-September 2014 from northern Norway to southern Svalbard. The abundance and composition of coccolithophore cells and skeletal remains (coccoliths) are discussed in view of the physical-chemical-biological status of the surface waters and water column based on in-situ (temperature, salinity, fluorescence) and shore-based (microscope enumerations, chemotaxonomy) measurements, as well as satellite-derived data (Chl a and particulate inorganic carbon contents). The coccolithophore population is characterized by a low species diversity and the overwhelming dominance of Emiliania huxleyi. Coccolithophores are abundant both within the well stratified, Norwegian coastal water - influenced shallow mixed layer off northern Norway, as well as within well-mixed cool Atlantic water in close vicinity of the Polar Front. Bloom concentrations with standing stocks larger than 4 million cells/l are recorded in the latter area north of 75°N. Our limited set of chemotaxonomic data suggests that coccolithophores contribute substantially (ca. 20% of the total Chl a) to the summer phytoplankton community which is made essentially of small-sized algal groups. Excluding the bloom area, coccolith calcite accounts for an average of 20% to the bulk particulate inorganic carbon content in the surface waters, and explains to some extent the satellite-derived spatial distribution of this parameter. Deep water living coccolithophore species thriving below the pycnocline as well as populations present in well-mixed cool Atlantic water are rapidly transferred to depth in the form of intact coccospheres down to at least 200 m. High amplitude internal waves which, according to our observations, affect a wide range of water depth up to the lower photic zone, might strengthen the vertical transfer of this sinking population. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Norway; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; algae; Emiliania huxleyi; Haptophyceae; Biochemistry; Calcite; Carbon; Climate change; Mooring; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Barents sea; Coccolithophores; Physico-chemical gradients; Phytoplankton community; Phytoplankton productions; Polar amplifications; Remote sensing imagery; Subsurface waters; algal bloom; calcite; coccolith; community structure; photic zone; phytoplankton; satellite imagery; sea ice; spatial distribution; species diversity; summer; surface water; water column; water mass; Surface waters","Coccolith calcite; Coccolithophores; Summer phytoplankton community; Western Barents Sea","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960085447"

Good agreement was found between the seasonal turbulent heat fluxes calculated from satellite data and those from the direct measurements (eddy covariance method) with correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.95 for sensible heat and latent heat, respectively. There were temporal, spatial heterogeneities, and strong seasonal pattern for all of the four components, which were very high in summer and low in winter for net radiation and heat storage.

One of the options is the use of sensor networks based on fixed installations and moving platforms (coastal boats, supply-, cargo-, and passenger vessels). Such network allows to gather environmental data in time and space with direct links to operational activities in the controlled area for further environmental risk assessment. Among many remote sensing techniques the LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) based on Light Induced Fluorescence (LIF) is the tool of direct assessment of water quality variations caused by chemical pollution, colored dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton composition. The Hyperspectral LIF (HLIF) LiDAR acquires comprehensive LIF spectra and analyses them by spectral pattern recognition technique to detect and classify the substances in water remotely. Combined use of HLIF LiDARs with Real-Time Data Management System (RTDMS) provides the economically effective solution for the regular monitoring in the controlled area.

Because highly reflective snow and ice are the main components of the cryosphere, it plays an important role in the global energy balance. Thus, any qualitative or quantitative change in the physical properties and extents of the cryosphere affects global air circulation, ocean and air temperatures, sea level, and ocean current patterns. Due to the hardships involved in collecting ground control points and field data for high alpine glaciers or vast polar ice sheets, several researchers are currently using remote sensing. Satellites provide an effective space-borne platform for remotely sensing frozen areas at the global and regional scales. However, satellite remote sensing has several constraints, such as limited spatial and temporal resolutions and expensive data acquisition. Therefore, aerial and terrestrial remote sensing platforms and sensors are needed to cover temporal and spatial gaps for comprehensive cryospheric research. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) antennas form a group of active remote sensors that can easily be deployed on all three platforms, i.e., satellite, aerial, and terrestrial. The generation of elevation data for glacial and snow-covered terrain from photogrammetry requires high contrast amongst various reflective surfaces (ice, snow, firn, and slush). Conventional passive optical remote sensors do not provide the necessary accuracy, especially due to the unavailability of reliable ground control points. However, active LiDAR sensors can fill this research gap and provide high-resolution and accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Due to the obvious advantages of LiDAR over conventional passive remote sensors, the number of LiDAR-based cryospheric studies has increased in recent years. In this review, we highlight studies that have utilised LiDAR sensors for the cryospheric research of various features, such as snow cover, polar ice sheets and their atmospheres, alpine glaciers, and permafrost. Because this technology shows immense promise for applications in future cryospheric research, we also emphasise the prospects of utilising LiDAR sensors.

They described their findings in the frame of shallow-water solitary waves governed by the K-dV equation, which occur because of a balance between nonlinear cohesive and linear dispersive forces in a fluid. It was concluded that the internal waves in the Andaman Sea were solitons and that they evolved either from an initial waveform (over approximately constant water depth) or by a fission process (over variable water depth). Since then, there has been a great deal of progress in our understanding of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs), or solitons in the ocean, particularly making use of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems. While two layer models such as those used by Osborne and Burch[1] allow for propagation of fundamental mode (i.e. mode-1) ISWs, continuous stratification permits the existence of higher mode internal waves. It happens that the Andaman Sea stratification is characterized by two (or more) maxima in the vertical profile of the buoyancy frequency N(z), i.e. a double pycnocline, hence prone to the existence of mode-2 (or higher) internal waves. In this paper we report solitary-like internal waves with mode-2 vertical structure co-existing with the large well know mode-1 solitons. The mode-2 waves are identified in satellite SAR images (e.g. TerraSAR-X, Envisat, etc.) because of their distinct surface signature. While the SAR image intensity of mode-1 waves is characterized by bright, enhanced backscatter preceding dark reduced backscatter along the nonlinear internal wave propagation direction (in agreement with Alpers, 1985[2]), for mode-2 solitary wave structures, the polarity of the SAR signature is reversed and thus a dark reduced backscatter crest precedes a bright, enhanced backscatter feature in the propagation direction of the wave. The polarity of these mode-2 signatures changes because the location of the surface convergent and divergent zones is reversed in relation to mode-1 ISWs. Mode-2 ISWs are identified in many locations of the Andaman Sea, but here we focus on ISWs along the Ten Degree Channel which occur along-side large mode-1 ISWs. We discuss possible generation locations and mechanisms for both mode-1 and mode-2 ISWs along this stretch of the Andaman Sea, recurring to modeling of the ray pathways of internal tidal energy propagation, and the P. G. Baines[3] barotropic body force, which drives the generation of internal tides near the shallow water areas between the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. We consider three possible explanations for mode-2 solitary wave generation in the Andaman Sea: (1) impingement of an internal tidal beam on the pycnocline, itself emanating from critical bathymetry; (2) nonlinear disintegration of internal tide modes; (3) the lee wave forming mechanism to the west of a ridge during westward tidal flow out of the Andaman Sea (as originally proposed by Osborne and Burch for mode-1 ISWs). SAR evidence is of critical importance for examining those generation mechanisms. © 2016 SPIE.","Backscattering; Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Location; Nonlinear equations; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Solitons; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tidal power; Tides; Water waves; Wave propagation; Andaman; Generation mechanism; Internal solitary waves; Internal waves; Nonlinear internal wave; Propagation direction; Solitary-wave structure; Variable water depth; Oceanography","Andaman; Internal Waves; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011304400"

There are uniqueness problems associated with radiometric remote sensing measurements (like MERIS/MODIS) that ignore polarization effects, and rely on measuring only the radiance. Use of polarization measurements is particularly important for absorbing aerosols over coastal waters as well as over bright targets such as snow-covered and bare sea ice, where it has proved difficult to retrieve aerosol single-scattering albedo from radiance-only spectrometers such as MERIS and MODIS. We use a vector radiative transfer model for the coupled atmosphere-surface system (C-VRTM) in conjunction with an Optimal Estimation/Levenberg-Marquardt (OE/LM) method to quantify how polarization measurements can be used to overcome the uniqueness problems associated with radiance-only retrieval of aerosol parameters. However, this study also indicates that even for existing radiance-only instruments like MERIS and MODIS and future instrument like OLCI, use of a C-VRTM as a forward model in the inversion can lead to significant enhancement of retrieval capabilities, and facilitate simultaneous retrieval of absorbing aerosols and marine parameters in turbid coastal environments. © 2017 U.S. Government.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015867244"

The semi-analytical or empirical algorithms that work well in Case 1 waters encounter many problems in offshore areas where the water is often optically complex and presents difficulties for atmospheric correction. Zhejiang is one of the most developed provinces in eastern China, and its adjacent seas have been greatly affected by recent rapid economic development. Various islands and semi-closed bays along the Zhejiang coast promote the formation of muddy tidal flats. Moreover, large quantities of terrestrial substances coming down with the Yangtze River and other local rivers also have a great impact on the coastal waters of the province. MODIS, VIIRS and GOCI are three commonly used ocean color sensors covering the East China Sea. Several ocean color products such as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) of the above three sensors on the Zhejiang coast have been evaluated. Cloud-free satellite images with synchronous field measurements taken between 2012 and 2015 were used for comparison. It is shown that there is a good correlation between the MODIS and GOCI spectral data, while some outliers were found in the VIIRS images. The low signal-to-noise ratio at short wavelengths in highly turbid waters also reduced the correlation between different sensors. In addition, it was possible to obtain more valid data with GOCI in shallow waters because of the use of an appropriate atmospheric correction algorithm. The standard Chl-a and TSM products of the three satellites were also evaluated, and it was found that the Chl-a and TSM concentrations calculated by the OC3G and Case 2 algorithms, respectively, were more suitable for use in the study area. Moreover, GOCI has been proved to be effective for monitoring the diurnal dynamics in coastal waters, and the concentration of TSM had a good negative correlation with water level. Overall, compared with MODIS and VIIRS, GOCI is more effective for monitoring the fine changes and diurnal dynamics in the seas adjacent to Zhejiang Province. © 2017 SPIE.","Color; Dynamics; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Signal to noise ratio; Water levels; Atmospheric correction algorithm; Diurnal dynamics; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Ocean color; Ocean color remote sensing; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite validation; Zhejiang; Remote sensing","Diurnal dynamics; Inter-satellite validation; Ocean color; Remote sensing; Zhejiang coast","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038440408"

Stratification is also understood to affect the surface aggregation of pelagic fish and hence the foraging behaviour and distribution of their predators such as seabirds and cetaceans. Hence it would be prudent to monitor the stratification of the global ocean, though this is currently only possible using in situ sampling, profiling buoys or underwater autonomous vehicles. Earth observation (EO) sensors cannot directly detect stratification, but can observe surface features related to the presence of stratification, for example shelf-sea fronts that separate tidally-mixed water from seasonally stratified water. This paper describes a novel algorithm that accumulates evidence for stratification from a sequence of oceanic front maps, and discusses preliminary results in comparison with in situ data and simulations from 3D hydrodynamic models. In certain regions, this method can reveal the timing of the seasonal onset and breakdown of stratification. © 2017 SPIE.","Climate change; Hydrophilicity; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Thermal stratification; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timing circuits; Earth observations; Foraging behaviours; Ocean stratification; Ocean-colour; Oceanic fronts; Sea surface temperature (SST); Surface aggregation; Underwater Autonomous vehicles; Oceanography","Ocean colour; Oceanic fronts; Remote sensing; Sea-surface temperature; Stratification","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038414161"

Using genetic fingerprinting, we contrasted extant connectivity in island-dwelling Peary caribou in northern Canada with continental-migratory caribou. We next examined if sea-ice contractions in the last decades modulated population connectivity and explored the possible impact of future climate change on long-term connectivity among island caribou. We found a strong correlation between genetic and geodesic distances for both continental and Peary caribou, even after accounting for the possible effect of sea surface. Sea ice has thus been an effective corridor for Peary caribou, promoting inter-island connectivity and population mixing. Using a time series of remote sensing sea-ice data, we show that landscape resistance in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has increased by approximately 15% since 1979 and may further increase by 20- 77% by 2086 under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5).

The suggested approach for evaluating whether climate models over- or underestimate the effects of ozone depletion is to diagnose simulated historical trends in lower-stratospheric temperature and compare these to observational estimates. With regard to more regional changes over Antarctica, such as West Antarctic warming, the simulation of teleconnection patterns to the tropical Pacific was highlighted. To improve the evaluation of low-frequency variability and trends in climate models, the use and development of approaches to emulate ice-core proxies in models was recommended. It is recommended that effort be put into improving datasets of ice thickness, motion, and composition to allow for a more complete evaluation of sea ice in climate models. One process that was highlighted in particular is the representation of Antarctic clouds and resulting precipitation. It is recommended that increased effort be put into observations of clouds over Antarctica, such as the use of instruments that can detect cloud-base height or the use of remote sensing resources.","Climate change; Ice; Ozone layer; Precipitation (meteorology); Remote sensing; Sea ice; Antarctic climate; Cloud-base height; Historical trends; Low frequency variability; Lower stratospheric temperature; Model evaluation; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Teleconnection patterns; Climate models","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962129736"

In this paper, we present a new technique for dielectric measurements of artificially grown sea ice in the frequency range between 0.3 and 12 GHz using an open-ended coaxial probe. To provide a solid contact between the probe and ice, we slightly submerge and then freeze the probe's flange in sea water in a cold laboratory with a preset temperature. Once the ice is formed, we conduct a measurement of the complex reflection coefficient in the cold room using a vector network analyzer. To calibrate the system, we propose a set of measurements from air, shorting block (short), and pure methanol to be conducted immediately after. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant as functions of frequency are then derived using a coaxial probe inverse model fed by these data. X-ray microtomography analysis of our samples revealed that the ice formed under the described conditions has completely isotropic microstructure typical for the frazil layer of natural first-year sea ice. To evaluate the experimental system's accuracy, we conducted extensive test measurements of standard materials (saline water, methanol, butanol, and pure ice). We also demonstrate that our sea ice dielectric measurements are close to corresponding values previously reported in the literature. The proposed measurement technique is valuable for developing a sea ice dielectric mixture model at microwave frequencies for different temperatures and salinities. © 2016 IEEE.","Complex networks; Dielectric properties; Dielectric spectroscopy; Electric network analyzers; Methanol; Microwave measurement; Probes; Remote sensing; Seawater; Tomography; X rays; Complex dielectric constant; Complex reflection coefficient; Dielectric measurements; Isotropic microstructures; Measurement techniques; Open-ended coaxial probe; Vector network analyzers; X ray microtomography; calibration; dielectric property; measurement method; microstructure; microtopography; remote sensing; salinity; sea ice; seawater; technological development; Sea ice","Complex dielectric constant (CDC); dielectric spectroscopy; microwave measurements; open-ended coaxial probe; sea ice; X-Ray microtomography","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84968911216"

A modern data set composed of 35 dated surface sediment samples collected along the West Greenland coast accompanied by remote sensing data was used to develop a diatom transfer function to reconstruct April sea ice concentration (SIC) supported by July sea surface temperature (SST) in the area. Our quantitative reconstruction shows that oceanographic changes recorded throughout the last ~11,000 years reflect seasonal interplay between spring (April SIC) and summer (July SST) conditions. Our records show clear correlation with climate patterns identified from ice core data from GISP2 and Agassiz-Renland for the early to middle Holocene. The early Holocene deglaciation of western Greenland Ice Sheet was characterized in Disko Bay by initial strong centennial-scale fluctuations in April SIC with amplitude of over 40%, followed by high April SIC and July SST. These conditions correspond to a general warming of the climate in the Northern Hemisphere. A decrease in April SIC and July SST was recorded during the Holocene Thermal Optimum reflecting more stable spring-summer conditions in Disko Bay. During the late Holocene, high April SIC characterized the Medieval Climate Anomaly, while high July SST prevailed during the Little Ice Age, supporting previously identified antiphase relationship between surface waters in West Greenland and climate in NW Europe. This antiphase pattern might reflect seasonal variations in regional oceanographic conditions and large-scale fluctuations within the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. ©2016.

In Geographical Information System (GIS), DEM provides a terrain model to facilitate drainage network analysis, watershed demarcation, soil erosion mapping, contour generation and for other area and volume calculations. In this study Open Source DEMs namely ASTER, SRTM and CartoDEM are analyzed with ICESat footprints. The selection of DEM is very much dependent on geographical features of earth affecting its quality in the area. The accuracy assessment was carried out for the Open source DEMs with the help of ICESat land altimetry data. ICESat carried a single instrument, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the travel time of laser returns from the earth surface along profiles, with a spatial resolution of approximately 70 m and an along-track sampling of 172 m (Herring, 1997). It is used to measure ice sheet elevations, change in elevation through time, height profiles of clouds and aerosols, land elevation and vegetation cover and can approximate the sea ice thickness. Total 400 footprints of ICESat data are considered for analysis of elevation derived from Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data. The elevation derived using ASTER, SRTM and CartoDEM are compared with these footprints. These footprints are passing through two districts i.e. Kanpur and Unnao of Uttar Pradesh. All 400 footprints of ICESat /GLAS are divided into six classes for statistical analysis. The result shows that the accuracy is highest in CartoDEM followed by SRTM. The elevation profile of CartoDEM has a better linear correlation as compare to other DEMs. The RMSE value of CartoDEM is varying for different classes from 2.40m (fallow land) to 3.71 m (Built-up area). © 2017 ACRS.

Comparison of results between the jet boat mounted dual-frequency Garmin fish-finder with an Odom Echotrac DF3200 MKII with 200/38 kHz dual-frequency transducer, showed that after a sound velocity adjustment, the remote survey obtained depth data within ± 1 m of the higher grade survey equipment.

Although there were some literatures on the Bohai drift ice from satellite remote sensing, numerical modelling and some coastal observations, the drift ice characteristic floe area and concentration near structures were reported rarely. Recent years, the satellite productions with high-resolution increased fast and give choice to collect information from satellite images.

Satellite-based estimates can provide comprehensive spatiotemporal coverage, but the accuracy and comparability of the existing data sets must be ascertained to facilitate their use. Here we compare radiative flux estimates from Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Synoptic 1-degree (SYN1deg)/Energy Balanced and Filled, Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) surface energy budget, and our own experimental FluxNet/ Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring cLoud, Albedo and RAdiation (CLARA) data against in situ observations over Arctic sea ice and the Greenland Ice Sheet during summer of 2007. In general, CERES SYN1deg flux estimates agree best with in situ measurements, although with two particular limitations: (1) over sea ice the upwelling shortwave flux in CERES SYN1deg appears to be underestimated because of an underestimated surface albedo and (2) the CERES SYN1deg upwelling longwave flux over sea ice saturates during midsummer. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-based GEWEX and FluxNet-CLARA flux estimates generally show a larger range in retrieval errors relative to CERES, with contrasting tendencies relative to each other. The largest source of retrieval error in the FluxNet-CLARA downwelling shortwave flux is shown to be an overestimated cloud optical thickness. The results illustrate that satellite-based flux estimates over the Arctic are not yet homogeneous and that further efforts are necessary to investigate the differences in the surface and cloud properties which lead to disagreements in flux retrievals. Plain Language Summary The amounts of solar and thermal radiative energies toward and away from the Earth’s surface over the Arctic are the main driver of, e.g., the annual melt and freezing cycle of ice and snow. In this paper, we investigate how state-of-the-art satellite-based data sets of these radiative energy fluxes agree, or disagree, with each other and reference measurements made in the Arctic Ocean and on the Greenland Ice Sheet. We found that different data sets have not only individual strengths but also individual weaknesses which should be improved upon to enable a cohesive investigation of the radiative energy balance at annual and decadal time scales. © 2017.

MSA was determined in PM10 samples collected over the period 2010-2012 at two Arctic sites, Ny Ålesund (78.9°N, 11.9°E), Svalbard islands, and Thule Air Base (76.5°N, 68.8°W), Greenland. PP is calculated by means of a bio-optical, physiologically based, semi-analytical model in the potential source areas located in the surrounding oceanic regions (Barents and Greenland Seas for Ny Ålesund, and Baffin Bay for Thule). Chl-a peaks in May in the Barents sea and in the Baffin Bay, and has maxima in June in the Greenland sea; PP follows the same seasonal pattern of Chl-a, although the differences in absolute values of PP in the three seas during the blooms are less marked than for Chl-a. MSA shows a better correlation with PP than with Chl-a, besides, the source intensity (expressed by PP) is able to explain more than 30% of the MSA variability at the two sites; the other factors explaining the MSA variability are taxonomic differences in the phytoplanktonic assemblages, and transport processes from the DMS source areas to the sampling sites. The taxonomic differences are also evident from the slopes of the correlation plots between MSA and PP: similar slopes (in the range 34.2-36.2 ng m-3of MSA/(gC m-2 d-1)) are found for the correlation between MSA at Ny Ålesund and PP in Barents Sea, and between MSA at Thule and PP in the Baffin Bay; conversely, the slope of the correlation between MSA at Ny Ålesund and PP in the Greenland Sea in summer is smaller (16.7 ng m-3of MSA/(gC m-2 d-1)). This is due to the fact that DMS emission from the Barents Sea and Baffin Bay is mainly related to the MIZ diatoms, which are prolific DMS producers, whereas in the Greenland Sea the DMS peak is related to an offshore pelagic bloom where low-DMS producer species are present. The sea ice dynamic plays a key role in determining MSA concentration in the Arctic, and a good correlation between MSA and SIM (slope = 39 ng m-3 of MSA/106 km2 SIM) and between MSA and IF-MIZ (slope = 56 ng m-3 of MSA/106 km2 IF-MIZ) is found for the cases attributable to bloomings of diatoms in the MIZ. Such relationships are calculated by combining the data sets from the two sites and suggest that PP is related to sea ice melting and to the extension of marginal sea ice areas, and that these factors are the main drivers for MSA concentrations at the considered Arctic sites. © 2016 The Authors.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Baffin Bay [Arctic Ocean]; Barents Sea; Greenland; Greenland Sea; Norwegian Sea; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Thule Air Base; Bacillariophyta; Atmospheric aerosols; Blooms (metal); Chlorophyll; Physiological models; Phytoplankton; Sea ice; mesylic acid; Arctic; Atmospheric oxidation; Marginal seas; Methane sulfonic acid; Primary production; Sea ice melting; Seasonal patterns; Semi-analytical model; aerosol; algal bloom; arctic environment; biogeochemical cycle; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); diatom; marginal ice zone; melting; particulate matter; primary production; sea ice; aerosol; algal bloom; algal community; algal growth; altitude; Arctic; Article; atmosphere; bay; biodiversity; biogenic aerosol; biomass; boundary layer; diatom; exhaust gas; freezing; Greenland; Haptophyta; ice free area in the marginal ice zone; latitude; melting point; oceanic regions; optics; particulate matter; photochemistry; phytoplankton; priority journal; remote sensing; sea; sea ice; sea ice melting; sea level; sea surface temperature; solar radiation; spring; summer; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; taxonomy; troposphere; warming; wind; Barium compounds","Arctic; Chlorophyll; Marginal sea ice; MSA; Primary production; Sea ice melting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963650319"

The spectral characteristic of riverbed is influenced not only by the type but also the roughness of substrates. Motivated by this assumption, potential of optical imagery for mapping grain size of shallow rivers (< 1 m deep) is examined in this research. The previous studies concerned with grain size mapping are all built upon the texture analysis of exposed bed material using very high resolution (i.e. cm resolution) imagery. However, the application of texturebased techniques is limited to very low altitude sensors (e.g. UAVs) to ensure the sufficient spatial resolution. Moreover, these techniques are applicable only in the presence of exposed substrates along the river channel. To address these drawbacks, this study examines the effectiveness of spectral information to make distinction among grain sizes for submerged substrates. Spectroscopic experiments are performed in controlled condition of a hydraulic lab. The spectra are collected over a water flume in a range of water depths and bottoms with several grain sizes. A spectral convolution is performed to match the spectra to WorldView-2 spectral bands. The material type of substrates is considered the same for all the experiments with only variable roughness/size of grains. The spectra observed over dry beds revealed that the brightness/reflectance increases with the grain size across all the spectral bands. Based on this finding, the above-water spectra over a river channel are simulated considering different grain sizes in the bottom. A water column correction method is then used to retrieve the bottom reflectances. Then the inferred bottom reflectances are clustered to segregate among grain sizes. The results indicate high potential of the spectral approach for clustering grain sizes (overall accuracy of 92%) which opens up some horizons for mapping this valuable attribute of rivers using remotely sensed data. © 2017 SPIE.","Grain size and shape; Hydrophilicity; Mapping; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sea ice; Controlled conditions; Grain size; Roughness of substrates; Spectral characteristics; Spectral convolution; Spectral information; Spectroradiometry; Water column correction; Photomapping","Bottom reflectance; Grain size; Hydraulic flume; River; Spectral information; Spectroradiometry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038418079"

This loss of sea ice has resulted in a 30% increase in annual net primary production (NPP) by Arctic Ocean phytoplankton between 1998 and 2012 (Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015). To quantify NPP, many algorithms require input of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, which serves as a biomass proxy for phytoplankton. While satellites provide temporally and spatially extensive data, including Chl a, the standard global ocean color algorithms are prone to errors in Arctic Ocean waters due to higher than average phytoplankton pigment-packaging and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentrations. Here, we evaluate retrievals of Chl a using existing ocean color algorithms, test and develop a new empirical ocean color algorithm for use in the Chukchi Sea, and evaluate the effect of using different satellite Chl a products as input to an NPP algorithm. Our results show that in the Chukchi Sea, Chl a was overestimated by the global algorithm (MODIS OC3Mv6) at concentrations lower than 0.9 mg m−3 because of contamination by CDOM absorption, but underestimated at higher concentrations because of pigment packaging. Only within the in situ Chl a range of 0.6–2 mg a m−3 was the satellite retrieval error by the OC3Mv6 algorithm below the ocean color community goal of <35%. Using coincident in situ Chl a concentrations and optical data, a new linear empirical algorithm is developed (OC3L) that yields the lowest statistical error when estimating Chl a in the Chukchi Sea, compared to existing ocean color algorithms (OC3Mv6, OC4L, OC4P). When we estimated regional NPP using different Chl a satellite products as input, three distinct bio-optical provinces within the Arctic Ocean emerged. These provinces correspond to the inflow shelves, interior shelves, and outflow shelves+deep basin as defined by Carmack et al. (2006). Eleven sub-regions within the Arctic Ocean were grouped into each of these three provinces based on their mean value for R, the ratio of blue to green remote sensing reflectance (RRS). Our results suggest that three algorithms tuned to each of the three bio-optical provinces may be sufficient to capture the bio-optical heterogeneity within the Arctic Ocean. Currently, only within the inflow shelf province do we feel confident that Chl a and NPP can be accurately estimated by satellite using the OC3L algorithm. The interior and outflow shelf+basin provinces require development of ocean color algorithms specific to their respective bio-optical conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Biological materials; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Color; Errors; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Arctic ocean; Case 2 water; CDOM; Chukchi Sea; Ocean color algorithm; Primary production; algorithm; anthropogenic effect; biomass; chlorophyll a; climate change; concentration (composition); dissolved organic matter; error analysis; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; MODIS; net primary production; ocean color; pigment; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; Algorithms","Arctic Ocean; Case 2 water; CDOM; Chukchi Sea; Ocean color algorithm; Phytoplankton; Pigment packaging; Primary production; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971657269"

In this thesis, we used the sea ice concentration products from the National Snow and Ice Center and sea surface temperature data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to analyze the variability of open water area and the length of the open water season from 1982 to 2016. We further analyzed the sea surface temperature's influence on the spatio-temporal variability of open water. The results indicated that the open water area of the North Pole increased at a rate of 55.89×103 km2/a, sea ice retreat time in advance at a rate of 0.77 days per year on average, sea ice advance time delayed at a rate of 0.82 days per year on average, causing the length of the open water season increased at a rate of 1.59 days per year. In 2016, open water and the length of open water season reached maximum since there were remote sensing observation data, the value were 13.52×106 km2 and 182 days respectively. Nine partitions have different change about the variability of open water, it was found that the seas which affected the open water most were Arctic Ocean core region, Kara and Barents seas. Sea surface temperature has an important influence on the change of open water, its influence extent has a close relationship with the degree of latitude. For high latitude, sea surface temperature's influence for open water was larger than low latitude. © 2017, Editorial Office of Haiyang Xuebao.

In order to minimize the damage, it is important to fast cleanup it after predicting how the oil will spread. In order to predict the spread of oil spill, remote sensing technique, especially radar satellite image is widely used. In previous studies, only the back-scattering value is generally used for the detection of oil spill. However, in this study, oil spill was detected by applying ANN (Artificial Neural Network) as input data from the back-scattering value of the radar image as well as the phase information extracted from the dual polarization. In order to maximize the efficiency of oil spill detection using a back-scattering value, the speckle noise acting as an error factor should be removed first. NL-means filter was applied to multi-look image to remove it without smoothing of spatial resolution. In the coherence image, the sea has a high value and the oil spill area has a low value due to the scattering characteristics of the pulse. In order to using the characteristics of radar image, training sample was set up from NL-means filtered images(HH, VV) and coherence image, and ANN was applied to produce probability map of oil spill. In general, the value was 0.4 or less in the case of the sea, and the value was mainly in the range of 0.7 to 0.9 in the oil spill area. Using coherence images generated from different polarizations showed better detection results for relatively thin oil spill areas such as oil slick or oil sheen than using back-scattering information alone. It is expected that if the information about the look-alike of oil spill such as algae, internal wave and rainfall area is provided, the probability map can be produced with higher accuracy. © 2017 SPIE.","Backscattering; Coherent scattering; Hydrophilicity; Neural networks; Oil spills; Polarization; Probability; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; ANN (artificial neural network); Co-polarized phase difference; Nonlocal; Oil spill detection; Probability maps; Remote sensing techniques; Scattering char-acteristics; Spatial resolution; Marine pollution","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Dual polarization, coherence, co-polarized phase difference; NL-means (Non Local) filter; Oil spill; Probability map","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038442954"

In contrast to Arctic, Antarctic sea ice extent shows an increasing trend, with large inter-annual variability, since 1979. This study explores the trends and variability of Antarctic sea-ice in different sectors following literature: Weddell Sea (60°W-20°E), Indian Ocean (20°-90°E), Western Pacific Ocean (90°-160°E), Ross Sea (160°E-130°W) and the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea (130°-60°W). Using passive microwave sea ice concentrations derived from SMMR and SSM/I-SSMIS sensors for 1979-2015, we studied decadal and regional trends pre- and post-2000. The results indicated that Weddell Sea, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean sectors are exhibiting an increasing sea ice trend at a higher rate post-2000, whereas, Ross Sea sector experiences a slight decline. Sea ice in Bellingshausen-Amundsen sector has been decreasing since 1979; however post-2000 there is an increasing trend which contributes to an overall sea-ice increase. On a seasonal time scale opposite anomaly is being observed pre- and post-2000. Post-2000, Weddell Sea and Pacific sectors (Indian Ocean and Ross Sea sectors) experience a decreasing (increasing) trend. Monthly anomaly of Bellingshausen-Amundsen sector shows an increasing sea ice trend from a negative anomaly to a positive anomaly post-2000; January (November) months are contributing the most in decrease(increase) of total Antarctic sea-ice, respectively. Prior to 2000, the monthly sea ice anomalies were negative with slight positive slope, which switched to positive post-2000. Of the many contributing factors (remote forcing such as ENSO, Indian Ocean Dipole, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode; regional forcing like winds, air/sea surface temperature warming, Antarctic Circumpolar wave, etc) for sea ice variability we discuss ozone hole-Amundsen Sea Low interaction for the changes post-2000. © 2017 ACRS.

Because their migration and distribution is likely affected by changes in global climate, we aimed to examine the migration timing of fin whales, and the relationship with prey availability within the oceanographic environment of the Arctic Sea, using passive and active acoustic monitoring methods. Automatic Underwater Sound Monitoring Systems were deployed in the southern Chukchi Sea from July 2012 to 2014 to determine the acoustic presence of fin whales. Furthermore, water temperature and salinity were recorded by a fixed data logger. An Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler was additionally deployed to estimate prey abundance through backscattering strength. Sea ice concentrations were obtained by remote sensing data. Fin whale calls were automatically detected using a custom-made software, and the per cent of half-hours containing calls were counted. Fin whale calls were detected from 4 August to 20 October 2012 (78 d) and 25 July to 1 November 2013 (100 d). The extended period of acoustic presence of fin whales during 2013 when compared with 2012 is likely related to a longer ice-free period during 2013. Furthermore, generalized linear model analyses showed that half-hour periods containing calls increased with a rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance during the initial call presence period, while they decreased with a decrease in water temperature and salinity during the end of the call presence period. Our results suggest that the rise in water temperature and zooplankton abundance affect the timing of migration of fin whales in a way that is consistent with the expansion of their suitable habitats and the extension of their presence in the Arctic Sea. © 2016 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Balaenoptera physalus; abundance; bioacoustics; global climate; home range; migration; monitoring; prey availability; range expansion; remote sensing; sea ice; spatial distribution; water temperature; whale; zooplankton","Chukchi Sea; fin whale; migration; passive acoustic monitoring","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990888163"

It consists of streamlined landforms and striations indicative of a major ice flow toward 130° oriented at right angle to another toward 220°. Both are late glacial flows but long-lasting disagreement exists regarding their relative age. The analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images in conjunction with a detailed survey of bedrock cross-striated surfaces over an area of about 30 000 km2 within and around Area A clearly indicate that the 130° flow preceded the 220° flow. The earlier conflicting interpretations within Area A are attributed mainly to the sporadic occurrence of relict striated surfaces formed by older southwestward (220°–240°) Wisconsinan ice flows that have locally escaped destruction by late glacial flows, with the result that the southwestward flows are older (Wisconsinan) at some sites and younger (late glacial 220°) at others relative to the 130° flow. When considered with other factors such as the maximum elevation reached by the youngest late glacial flow, these ice-flow relationships indicate that Area A is the outcropping southern part of a much larger ESE ice-flow system, which is probably related to a large fluted belt located to the north and that was identified as the Winisk Ice Stream. The distal part of the ice stream, except for Area A, escaped detection by remote sensing mapping methods because depositional and erosional features associated with it are masked by deposits laid down by the younger (220°, Cochrane) ice flow and/or by postglacial marine and organic deposits (or were destroyed by the younger ice flow). The only reliable indicators of the passage of the ice stream in this “buried” section are ESE relict striations crossed by SW striations. The advancing ice stream toward the ESE not only preceded the late Cochrane 220° flow but probably outlasted it, as suggested by the mapping of several thousand iceberg furrows in Quebec and Ontario, also directed toward the ESE and overprinted on flutes formed by the last glacial flow. If this interpretation is correct, this makes the Winisk Ice stream the largest terrestrial ice stream in the Hudson Bay basin. An alternative interpretation associates this fluted belt to the exposed western fringe of streamlined bedforms from a late Hudson lobe buried by younger sediments. © 2016","Deposits; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Continental record of glaciations; Cross-striations; Deglaciations; Glacial surge; Ice streams; Laurentide ice sheets; Ontario; Relict striations; Ice","Continental record of glaciations; Cross-striations; Deglaciation; Glacial surge; Ice stream; Lake Ojibway; Laurentide Ice Sheet; Ontario; Relict striations; Satellite imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84999040316"

Yet, glacier calving sensitivity to climate parameters is not well understood. In this study, the front area changes of 42 marine terminating Greenland outlet glaciers were measured annually from 1999 to 2013 using optical satellite imagery. Thirty-five glaciers retreated, while seven remained stable. The average front position change was -240 m a-1 and the total rate of front area change was -114 km2 a-1. The yearly average area changes of all measured glaciers are compared with interannual variations in sea surface temperature (SST), sea-ice concentration (SIC), surface melt, Northern Hemisphere (NH) surface air temperatures and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. We find: (1) northwestern glaciers area change have a significant correlation with surface melt and NH land temperature variations; (2) southeastern glaciers have a significant correlation with local SST, SIC and NH temperatures; and (3) southwestern glaciers area change correlate significantly with local SST and NAO index. We conclude that a climate sensitivity signal emerges considering a population of glaciers. Further, we find a significant correlation between the date of minimum extent and glacier latitude.

The wind-induced backscatter was estimated by the Ku-band low incidence backscatter model (KuLMOD) and possible bias due to different wind speed inputs was considered. The rain effect was analysed by comparing the TRMM PR-measured surface backscatter for the rain-affected sea surface with the collocated wind-induced backscatter. We found that the surface backscatter decreases with increases in the averaged rain rate. The rain-induced backscatter was clearly dependent of the wind speed and was slightly dependent of the incidence angle.

We report discharge weighed values of stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) of -14.0‰ in Northern Dvina river for the period 10 May-12 October 2012. We found a significant linear relationship between salinity (S) and δ18O (δ18O=-17.66±0.58+0.52±0.02×S; R2=0.96, N=162), which indicates a dominant contribution of river water to the freshwater budget and little influence of sea ice formation or melt. No apparent brine additions from sea-ice formation is evident in the White Sea deep waters as seen from a joint analysis of temperature (T), S, δ18O and aCDOM(350) data, confirming previous suggestions about strong tidal induced vertical mixing in winter being the likely source of the deep waters. We investigated properties and distribution of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the White Sea basin and coastal areas in summer. We found contrasting DOM properties in the inflowing Barents Sea waters and White Sea waters influenced by terrestrial runoff. Values of absorption by CDOM at 350 nm (aCDOM(350)) and DOC (exceeding 10 m-1 and 550 μmol l-1, respectively) in surface waters of the White Sea basin are higher compared to other river-influenced coastal Arctic domains. Linear relationship between S and CDOM absorption, and S and DOC (DOC=959.21±52.99-25.80±1.79×S; R2=0.85; N=154) concentrations suggests conservative mixing of DOM in the White Sea. The strongest linear correlation between CDOM absorption and DOC was found in the ultraviolet (DOC=56.31±2.76+9.13±0.15×aCDOM(254); R2=0.99; N=155), which provides an easy and robust tool to trace DOC using CDOM absorption measurements as well as remote sensing algorithms. Deviations from this linear relationship in surface waters likely indicate contribution from different rivers along the coast of the White Sea. Characteristics of CDOM further indicate that there is limited removal or change in the DOM pool before it exits to the Barents Sea. © 2016 The Authors.","Arctic Ocean; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Northern Dvina River; Russian Federation; White Sea; algorithm; brine; circulation; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; land-sea interaction; ocean color; oxygen isotope; runoff; salinity; spatial distribution; stable isotope","Arctic Ocean; Colored dissolved organic matter; Dissolved organic carbon; Terrestrial runoff; White Sea","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960109642"

Missions under sea ice, particularly over large distances (up to 100 km) away from the immediate vicinity of a ship or base, require accurate acoustic communication for monitoring, emergency response and some navigation systems. We investigate the propagation of acoustic signals in the Antarctic seasonal ice zone using the BELLHOP model, examining the influence of ocean and sea ice properties. We processed available observations from around Antarctica to generate input variables such as sound speed, surface reflection coefficient (R) and roughness parameters. The results show that changes in the sound speed profile make the most significant difference to the propagation of the direct path signal. The inclusion of the surface reflected signals from a flat ice surface was found to greatly decrease the transmission loss with range. When ice roughness was added, the transmission loss increased with roughness, in a manner similar to the direct path transmission loss results. The conclusions of this work are that: (1) the accuracy of acoustic modelling in this environment is greatly increased by using realistic sound speed data; (2) a risk averse ranging model would use only the direct path signal transmission; and (3) in a flat ice scenario, much greater ranges can be achieved if the surface reflected transmission paths are included. As autonomous missions under sea ice increase in scale and complexity, it will be increasingly important for operational procedures to include effective modelling of acoustic propagation with representative environmental data. © 2016","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Climate models; Navigation systems; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sea ice; Ultrasonic velocity measurement; Underwater acoustics; Wave transmission; Acoustic communications; Antarctica; BELLHOP; Environmental parameter; In-situ observations; Operational procedures; Satellite remote sensing; Surface reflected signals; accuracy assessment; acoustics; autonomous underwater vehicle; climate modeling; complexity; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; signal processing; wave propagation; Ice","Antarctica; Autonomous underwater vehicles; BELLHOP; Underwater acoustics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981724819"

However, these studies have been barely carried in the Bohai Sea. The sea-ice microwave scattering mechanism was first developed for the thin sea ice with slight roughness in the Bohai Sea in the winter of 2012, and included the backscattering coefficients which were measured on the different conditions of three bands (L, C and X), two polarizations (HH and VV), and incident angles of 20° to 60°, using a ground-based scatterometer and the synchronous physical parameters of the sea-ice temperature, density, thickness, salinity, and so on. The theoretical model of the sea-ice electromagnetic scattering is obtained based on these physical parameters. The research regarding the sea-ice microwave scattering mechanism is carried out through two means, which includes the comparison between the field microwave scattering data and the simulation results of the theoretical model, as well as the feature analysis of the four components of the sea-ice electromagnetic scattering. It is revealed that the sea-ice microwave scattering data and the theoretical simulation results vary in the same trend with the incident angles. Also, there is a visible variant in the sensitivity of every component to the different bands. For example, the C and X bands are sensitive to the top surface, the X band is sensitive to the scatterers, and the L and C bands are sensitive to the bottom surface, and so on. It is suggested that the features of the sea-ice surfaces and scatterers can be retrieved by the further research in the future. This experiment can provide an experimental and theoretical foundation for research regarding the sea-ice microwave scattering characteristics in the Bohai Sea. © 2016, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","sea-ice electromagnetic scattering theory; sea-ice field experiment; sea-ice microwave scattering characteristics; sea-ice physical parameters","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969705919"

The interest lies not only in exploration but also in the monitoring of the maritime environment. Occurrence of natural seeps on the sea surface is a key indicator of the presence of mature source rock in the subsurface. These natural seeps, as well as the oil slicks, are commonly detected using radar sensors but the addition of optical imagery can deliver extra information such as the oil real fraction, which is critical for both exploration purposes and efficient cleanup operations. Today state-of-the-art approaches combine multiple data collected by optical and radar sensors embedded on-board different airborne and spaceborne platforms, to ensure wide spatial coverage and high frequency revisit time. Multi-wavelength imaging system may create a breakthrough in remote sensing applications, but it requires adapted processing techniques that need to be developed. To explore performances offered by multi-wavelength radar and optical sensors for oil slick monitoring, remote sensing data have been collected by SETHI, the airborne system developed by ONERA, during an oil spill cleanup exercise carried out in 2015 in the North Sea, Europe. The uniqueness of this data set lies in its high spatial resolution, low noise level and quasi-simultaneous acquisitions of different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Specific processing techniques have been developed in order to extract meaningful information associated with oil-covered sea surface. Analysis of this unique and rich dataset demonstrates that remote sensing imagery, collected in both optical and microwave domains, allows to estimate slick surface properties such as the spatial abundance of oil and the relative concentration of hydrocarbons on the sea surface. © 2017 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Offshore oil wells; Oil spills; Optical sensors; Pollution; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Hyper-spectral imageries; Maritime pollution; Multi frequency; Multi-wavelengths; Oil slicks; Radar sensors; SAR imagery; Seeps; Remote sensing","Hyperspectral imagery; Maritime pollution; Multi-frequency; Multi-wavelength; Oil slick; Oil spill; Optical sensor; Radar sensor; SAR imagery; Seeps","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038421020"

The ocean remote sensing systems with complementary vantages offer significant economic and social benefits. HY-1A/B data have been widely used in sea surface temperature forecasting, sea ice operational monitoring in winter, red tide and green tide monitoring in summer, dynamic monitoring of coastal zones, coastal water quality monitoring, and fishery remote sensing. The HY-2A satellite fills the gaps of ocean dynamic environment satellite remote sensing and is the world's only in-orbit comprehensive ocean dynamic environment satellite that carries active and passive microwave remote sensors. HY-2A can simultaneously obtain data on sea-surface wind field, significant wave height, sea surface height, and sea surface temperature. The effectiveness of ocean environment monitoring and catastrophic sea condition forecasting has been improved with the use of satellite data. Ocean satellites provide reliable remote sensing data to the national economy and defense construction, marine scientific research, and global change research. They also play an important role in the international Earth observation system and are highly recognized by domestic and foreign users.HY-1 and HY-2 series satellites lay a solid foundation for the establishment of a sound ocean environment stereo monitoring system in China. With national development and the implementation of ""the Belt and Road"" strategy in China, the construction of maritime power, the safeguarding of marine rights and interests, and the development of marine economy demand high requirements and emphasize the urgent need for ocean remote sensing. Therefore, the ""Long-term Development Plan of Civil Space Infrastructure (2015-2025)"" is focused on the national maritime power strategy and establishes the plan for the ocean satellite series. This development plan is aimed at supporting the areas of marine resource survey, environment protection, disaster prevention and reduction, rights and interests safeguarding, management of sea areas, island and coastal zone investigation, and the polar ocean expedition of China. Moreover, the requirements of land and atmosphere observations are taken into account. On the basis of the development experience and application achievement of HY-1A/B, HY-2A, GF-3, and CFOSAT, multiple optical and microwave remote sensing techniques are developed, a new generation of ocean color and ocean dynamic environment satellites is built for marine networking observation, and ocean monitoring satellites are improved to construct an integrated marine satellite monitoring system. Ocean remote sensing satellites will inevitably play an import role in the process of building maritime power through the construction of space infrastructure. © 2016, Science Press.

While stability can sometimes be inferred from field measurements, current methods are lacking robustness and the ability to be automated and applied over large areas and long time scales to ensure safety and document change in the context of transportation, indigenous ice uses and industrial development. This paper introduces an inverse model capable of reconstructing three-dimensional deformation fields from one-dimensional interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) phase patterns. We apply this method at three landfast ice locations on the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast near Barrow and Prudhoe Bay. We find the small-scale displacements estimated from the model consistent with regional patterns of ice motion. Our study suggests that interferometry can provide planning and decision-support information for ice road development and structures operating within ice. Moreover, InSAR can potentially increase our understanding of sea ice on a fundamental level in terms of large-scale stability and long-term changes in ice dynamics. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Alaska; Arctic Ocean; Barrow; Beaufort Sea; Prudhoe Bay; United States; Accident prevention; Decision support systems; Deformation; Interferometry; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Stability; Synthetic aperture radar; Three dimensional computer graphics; ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Land-fast; Surface deformation; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Trafficability; ALOS; deformation; environmental change; hydrological modeling; ice movement; industrial development; inverse analysis; long-term change; PALSAR; radar interferometry; remote sensing; road construction; sea ice; seasonal variation; timescale; Ice","ALOS PALSAR; Arctic; Ice dynamics; Ice stability; Ice trafficability; Landfast ice; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface deformation; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994531587"

However, concomitant with the accelerated development of nuclear power stations, the environmental effects of thermal discharge will become a problem that cannot be avoided. Real-time monitoring of water temperature needs to be installed following station construction in order to measure its variation with time and to ensure that the operation of the nuclear plant does not result in adverse environmental damage. Landsat is the world's oldest, continuously acquired collection of space-based, moderate-resolution, land remote sensing data. On May 30, 2013, data from the Landsat 8 satellite became available, and the data quality and radiometric quantization of the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) are significantly greater than those of previous Landsat instruments. The analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) obtained from Landsat 8's TIRS data was used to enhance information about the plume shape, dimensions, and direction of dispersion of the thermal discharge from the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Hangzhou Bay on the East China Sea coast. Both single-channel and split-window algorithms were used and focused. The detection of temperature increases through split-window algorithms is considered a preferable method for warm discharge monitoring.

Satellite radar and laser altimetry are currently the most promising tools for sea-ice thickness retrieval. We present qualitative inter-comparisons of winter and spring circum-Antarctic sea-ice thickness computed with different approaches from Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard estimates. We find that approach A, which assumes total freeboard equals snow depth, and approach B, which uses empirical linear relationships between freeboard and thickness, provide the lowest sea-ice thickness and the smallest winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness: A: 0.0 m and 0.04 m, B: 0.17 and 0.16 m, respectively. Approach C uses contemporary snow depth from satellite microwave radiometry, and we derive comparably large sea-ice thickness. Here we observe an unrealistically large winter-to-spring increase in seasonal average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0.68 m and 0.65 m, respectively, which we attribute to biases in the snow depth. We present a conceptually new approach D. It assumes that the two-layer system (sea ice, snow) can be represented by one layer. This layer has a modified density, which takes into account the influence of the snow on sea-ice buoyancy. With approach D we obtain thickness values and a winter-to-spring increase in average modal and mean sea-ice thickness of 0.17 m and 0.23 m, respectively, which lay between those of approaches B and C. We discuss retrieval uncertainty, systematic uncertainty sources, and the impact of grid resolution. We find that sea-ice thickness obtained with approaches C and D agrees best with independent sea-ice thickness information-if we take into account the potential bias of in situ and ship-based observations. © 2016 by the authors.","Aneroid altimeters; Microwaves; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Antarctic; Intercomparisons; Laser altimetry; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Ice","Antarctic; Inter-comparison; Laser altimetry; Microwave radiometry; Sea ice; Snow satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992482343"

Imaging of the polarization in a scene can lead to enhanced understanding, particularly when materials in a scene are at thermal equilibrium. Polaris Sensor Technologies has measured the polarization signatures of oil on water in a number of different scenarios and has shown significant improvement in detection through the contrast improvement offered by polarimetry. The sensing improvement offers the promise of automated detection of oil spills and leaks for routine monitoring and accidents with the added benefit of being able to continue monitoring at night. In this paper, we describe the instrumentation, and the results of several measurement exercises in both controlled and uncontrolled conditions. © 2016 SPIE.","Ellipsometry; Hydrophilicity; Infrared imaging; Light polarization; Oil spills; Polarimeters; Polarization; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Contrast improvements; Environmental Monitoring; Infrared polarimetry; Polarimetric imagery; Polarimetric sensing; Polarization signatures; Sensor technologies; Thermal equilibriums; Remote sensing","Environmental monitoring; Infrared polarimetry; Oil on water; Oil spill; Polarization; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011309699"

Natural variability alone cannot explain the recent observed decrease. There is a direct physical argument that climate change causes a decrease of sea ice: an increase of atmospheric CO2 leads to an increase in long-wave radiation resulting in an increase of ice melt. Climate model studies allow us to discriminate between the impact of natural variability and the impact of climate change on the observed sea ice decline. Current models indicate that both impacts are of similar magnitude. While the precise ratio is uncertain due the dependency on the level of sophistication of the model and how well key processes are included, there is evidence that the Arctic sea ice decrease is at least to some extent caused by climate warming. Due to its fast response to external drivers, the Arctic sea ice is a prominent indicator of climate change. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Quad-pol SAR has unique capabilities which play a key role in geophysical remote sensing, able to measure the scattering matrix, providing both intensity and phase information that can lead to classification of the scattering mechanisms of the sea ice. However, there is a cost to quad-pol SAR in terms of doubled average transmitted power, swath width and limited range of admissible incidence angles; for example, the quad-pol images are about 25 km width, which limits the monitoring of ice. © 2016 IEEE.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007414025"

The radar was developed for operation on a Twin Otter aircraft with a nominal survey altitude of 500 m. The radar is designed to operate in frequency modulated continuous wave (FM-CW) mode from 2 to 18 GHz. The radar has a total transmit power is of 1.5 W and a vertical resolution of 1.6 cm as demonstrated experimentally. The radar has two modes of operation: snow sounding mode for snow thickness measurements and accumulation mapping, and side-looking mode for snow backscatter measurements and imaging. The radar system was flown from Barrow, Alaska in spring 2015 and 2016 as a part of the Naval Research Laboratory sea ice survey campaign to characterize sea ice and snow on sea ice. Between February and March 2016, we also took advantage of radar test flights in Colorado to conduct terrestrial snow measurements over the alpine areas.

However, they are currently poorly represented in circulation models. One of the reasons is the lack of reliable large-scale observations. A challenge encountered during melt pond retrieval from optical satellite observations is the filtering of cloud which in the visible range of spectrum look similarly bright as the sea ice surface. Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR. The AATSR swath only covers the central half of the MERIS swath but the masking procedure extends the filtering scheme to the outer parts of the MERIS swath so that the full swath can be used for melt pond retrieval. © 2016 IEEE.","","AATSR; cloud filtering; Melt ponds; MERIS; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel-3","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007413734"

Additionally, they are known to absorb solar radiation rather than reflect it as the surrounding sea ice does. However, the size and distribution of melt ponds are highly variable, and thus, the contribution of melt ponds to sea ice melting should differ based on the maturity of the melt pond. Because of the harsh conditions of the Arctic, estimating the actual surface changes via in situ measurements and/or optical remote sensing data is difficult. In this study, we present a high-resolution time-series analysis of the short-term variation of sea ice and melt ponds over the Beaufort Sea using space-borne multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A KOMPSAT-3 (Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3) optical image was used for an initial classification of the surface types, and 15 TerraSAR-X SAR images covering 46 days in the 2014 Arctic summer were used to perform a dense time-series analysis. The surface of the target sea ice was classified into six categories based on spectral characteristics. The temporal variation of the radar backscattering coefficient in each class exhibited a distinct pattern, which was closely related to surface changes. Overall, changes in the radar backscattering coefficient indicated dynamic surface changes, except over pressure ridges. All ice classes showed a two-step decrease in radar backscattering, whereas snow-covered ice surfaces exhibited far fewer changes compared to bare ice surfaces. The surfaces adjacent to ponds showed stronger negative decreases than other classes. The changes in dark melt pond classes presented a complex non-linear decrease, which differed from the stepwise decrease of blue melt ponds. These observations can be used for important modelling studies of surface melting/freezing rates and to infer the variation over large areas using remote sensing data. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Korea; Backscattering; Geometrical optics; Harmonic analysis; Image analysis; Lakes; Ponds; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Korea multi-purpose satellites; Optical remote sensing data; Radar backscattering; Radar backscattering coefficient; Remote sensing data; Short-term variations; Spectral characteristics; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; backscatter; ice; in situ measurement; melting; polarization; pond; radar; remote sensing; resolution; solar radiation; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; TerraSAR-X; time series analysis; Ice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964687164"

This project focuses on the essential climate variables proposed by the global climate observing system. It aims to improve surface-air-space observing systems; produce long-term, highly accurate, and highly spatiotemporal consistent satellite products (i.e., climate data records, CDRs) of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surfaces; and monitor the key variables and processes of climate change dynamically. This project will produce the first CDR suite in China. This research project is divided into four. The first three sub-projects focus on the satellite product generation of the atmosphere, ocean, and land surfaces. Each of these three sub-project includes ground observation, inversion and fusion methods of remote sensing data, and production and application demonstration of climate dataset. Ground observation is mainly used for algorithm development, product validation, and application demonstration. Sub-project 4 will comprehensively assess these satellite products and use them for climate change studies. Sub-project 1 on the atmosphere will mainly focus on the variables that are essential for climate change studies, such as aerosol optical thickness, cloudiness, precipitation, CO2, ozone, solar incident radiation, reflected solar radiation, outgoing long wave radiation, and energy imbalance. Nine CDRs will be generated at the end. The application demonstration will be based on the long-term atmospheric climate dataset; it will be combined with foreign satellite-related products to study the global climate effects of aerosol, dynamic monitoring of polar ozone concentrations, energy balance of the Earth, and other applications. Sub-project 2 on the ocean will mainly focus on methods and techniques for producing a total of 21 products, including the balance components of ocean energy (i.e., shortwave incident solar radiation, shortwave broadband albedo, longwave downward radiation, emissivity, and net radiation), dynamic environmental parameters and processes of the ocean (i.e., sea surface wind, ocean wave, surface flow, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, and oceanic ice color (reflectance, chlorophyll concentration, particulate organic carbon, and primary productivity)), and sea ice (i.e., concentration, thickness, and drift).At the end, 17 of these will be generated as ocean CDRs. Their applications to the global ocean matter and energy transport will be demonstrated based on the global ocean climate data set for the major estuarine water changes of the world in response to global climate change. Sub-project 3 for land surfaces will mainly focus on 20 variables that characterize the key processes of climate change, including the global energy balance of land surfaces (i.e., shortwave incident radiation, shortwave broadband albedo, longwave downward radiation, land surface emissivity, land surface temperature, and net radiation), water cycle (i.e., evapotranspiration, water surface dynamics, and wetland), carbon cycle (i.e., leaf area index, fractional photo synthetically active radiation absorbed by green vegetation, vegetation coverage, forest biomass, gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, residential area, land cover, and fire burned area), and polar and cryosphere (i.e., elevation and area of ice surfaces, snow cover, snow water equivalent, and freezing and thawing of permafrost). At the end, 15 of these products will be generated as land CDRs. The application demonstration component will include assimilating these data products into land surface process models; analyzing the effect of these products on the diagnostic ability of temporal and spatial characteristics of climate change; and quantifying the scientific values of these products in characterizing regional carbon cycle, water cycle, and energy balance. The atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial CDRs will be analyzed in Sub-project 4 by using the key process of global change as the constraint. They will be tested based on their spatiotemporal and logical consistency. Basic global change indicators will be proposed based on the entire process of acquisition and analysis of information data of global change. We will also determine the states and trends of the key processes, evaluate their causes and effects comprehensively, and investigate direct evidence of the roles played by key processes and elements in global climate change. © 2016, Science Press.

Inter-comparisons are done for the periods of overlap from 2003 to 2013. Results show that ICESat sea ice is thicker than APP-x and PIOMAS overall, particularly along the north coast of Greenland and Canadian Archipelago. The relative differences of APP-x and PIOMAS with ICESat are -0.48 m and -0.31 m, respectively. APP-x underestimates thickness relative to CryoSat-2, with a mean difference of -0.19 m. The biases for APP-x, PIOMAS, and CryoSat-2 relative to IceBridge thicknesses are 0.18 m, 0.18 m, and 0.29 m.

This is especially the case in the Patagonian coast, with a littoral more than 5000 km long and a surface above a million and half square km. In addition, furtive Ïshery activities in Argentine waters are depleting the food supplies of several species, altering the ecological equilibrium. For this reason, early oil spills and vessel detection is an imperative surveillance task for environmental and governmental authorities. However, given the huge geographical extension, human assisted monitoring is unfeasible, and therefore real time remote sensing technologies are the only operative and economically feasible solution. In this work we describe the theoretical foundations and implementation details of a system speciÏcally designed to take advantage of the SAR imagery delivered by two satellite constellations (the SAOCOM mission, developed by the Argentine Space Agency, and the COSMO mission, developed by the Italian Space Agency), to provide real-time detection of vessels and oil spills. The core of the system is based on pattern recognition over a statistical characterization of the texture patterns arising in the positive and negative conditions (i.e., vessel, oil, or plain sea surfaces). Training patterns were collected from a large number of previously reported contacts tagged by experts in the National Commission on Space Activities (CONAE).

The scientific objectives of the SMOS mission directly respond to the need for global observations of soil moisture and ocean salinity, two key variables used in predictive hydrological, oceanographic and atmospheric models. SMOS observations also provide information on vegetation, in particular plant available water and water content in a canopy, drought index and flood risks, surface ocean winds in storms, freeze/thaw state and sea ice and its effect on ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes and dynamics affecting large-scale processes of the Earth's climate system.Significant progress has been made over the course of the now 6-year life time of the SMOS mission in improving the ESA provided level 1 brightness temperature and level 2 soil moisture and sea surface salinity data products. The main emphasis of this paper is to review the status of the mission and provide an overview and performance assessment of SMOS data products, in particular with a view towards operational applications, and using SMOS products in data assimilation.SMOS is in excellent technical condition with no limiting factors for operations beyond 2017. The instrument performance fulfils the requirements. The radio-frequency interference (RFI) contamination originates from man-made emitters on ground, operating in the protected L-band and adding signal to the natural radiation emitted by the Earth. RFI has been detected worldwide and has been significantly reduced in Europe and the Americas but remains a constraint in Asia and the Middle East. The mission's scientific objectives have been reached over land and are approaching the mission objectives over ocean.This review paper aims to provide an introduction and synthesis to the papers published in this RSE special issue on SMOS. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Central America; Europe; Middle East; North America; South America; Curricula; Earth (planet); Earth atmosphere; Floods; Moisture; Oceanography; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Soil surveys; Soils; Surface waters; Tracking (position); Vegetation; Water content; Water resources; Data assimilation; Hydrological forecasting; L-band radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surface salinity; Sea-ice thickness; Soil moisture and ocean salinity missions; Vegetation optical depth; Wind tracking; brightness temperature; data assimilation; environmental modeling; heat flux; ice thickness; observational method; optical depth; performance assessment; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; sea surface salinity; SMOS; vegetation; water content; Soil moisture","Data assimilation; Freeze and thaw; Hydrological forecasting; L-band radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice thickness; Sea surface salinity; Severe wind tracking; Soil moisture; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission; Vegetation optical depth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955085999"

Understanding how ice-edges and ice concentrations influence the distribution of the endangered ivory gulls is a prerequisite to the implementation of adequate conservation strategies. From 2007 to 2013, we used satellite transmitters to monitor the movements of 104 ivory gulls originating from Canada, Greenland, Svalbard-Norway and Russia. Although half of the positions were within 41 km of the ice-edge (75% within 100 km), approximately 80% were on relatively highly concentrated sea ice. Ivory gulls used more concentrated sea ice in summer, when close to their high-Arctic breeding ground, than in winter. The best model to explain the distance of the birds from the ice-edge included the ice concentration within approximately 10 km, the month and the distance to the colony. Given the strong links between ivory gull, ice-edge and ice concentration, its conservation status is unlikely to improve in the current context of sea-ice decline which, in turn, will allow anthropogenic activities to develop in regions that are particularly important for the species. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this study, a method exclusively using multiple satellite observations is used to calculate sea-ice volume flux across the eastern boundary (EB) and northern boundary (NB) of the Laptev Sea during the October-November and February-March or March-April periods (corresponding to the ICESat autumn and winter campaigns) between 2003 and 2008. Seasonally, the mean total ice volume flux (i.e., NB+EB) over the investigated autumn period (1.96 km3/day) is less than that over the winter period (2.57 km3/day). On the other hand, the large standard deviations of the total volume flux, 3.45 and 0.91 km3/day for the autumn and winter campaigns, indicate significant interannual fluctuations in the calculated quantities. A statistically significant (P > 0.99) positive correlation, R=0.88 (or 0.81), is obtained between volume flux across the EB (or NB) and mean ice-drift speed over the boundary for the considered 11 ICESat campaigns. In addition, statistics show that a large fraction of the variability in volume flux across the NB over the 11 investigated campaigns, roughly 40%, is likely explained by ice thickness variability. On average, flux through the Laptev Sea amounts to approximately one-third of that across Fram Strait during the autumn and winter campaigns. These large contributions of sea ice from the Laptev Sea demonstrate its importance as an ice source, affecting the entire sea-ice mass balance in the Arctic Ocean. © 2016 H.

Lyzenga's model and optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) are main bathymetric models which both provide linear relations with water depths. The former model is sensitive and the latter is quite robust to substrate variability. The simple regression is the widely used approach for calibration of bathymetric models either Lyzenga's model or OBRA model. In this research, a multiple regression is examined for empirical calibration of the models in order to take the advantage of all spectral channels of the imagery. This method is applied on both Lyzenga's model and OBRA model for the bathymetry of a shallow Alpine river in Italy, using WorldView-2 (WV-2) and GeoEye images. Insitu depths are recorded using RTK GPS in two reaches. One-half of the data is used for calibration of models and the remaining half as independent check-points for accuracy assessment. In addition, radiative transfer model is used to simulate a set of spectra in a range of depths, substrate types, and water column properties. The simulated spectra are convolved to the sensors' spectral bands for further bathymetric analysis. Investigating the simulated spectra, it is concluded that the multiple regression improves the robustness of the Lyzenga's model with respect to the substrate variability. The improvements of multiple regression approach are much more pronounced for the Lyzenga's model rather than the OBRA model. This is in line with findings from real imagery; for instance, the multiple regression applied for calibration of Lyzenga's and OBRA models demonstrated, respectively, 22% and 9% higher determination coefficients (R2) as well as 3 cm and 1 cm better RMSEs compared to the simple regression using the WV-2 image. © 2016 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrophilicity; Radiative transfer; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Band ratios; Bathymetric information; Determination coefficients; HRSI; Independent check points; Multiple regression approach; Multiple regressions; Radiative transfer model; Calibration","Bathymetry; HRSI; Lyzenga's model; Multiple-regression; Optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011301029"

Microwave radar backscattering at moderate and large incidence angles according to conventional models is determined by resonance (Bragg) surface waves typically of cm-scale wavelength range. Some recent experiments have indicated, however, that an additional, non Bragg component (NBC) contributes to the radar return. The latter is considered to occur due to wave breaking. At present our understanding of the nature of different components of radar return is still poor. This paper presents results of field experiment using an X-/C-/S-band Doppler radar operating at HH- and VVpolarizations. The intensity and radar Doppler shifts for Bragg and non Bragg components are retrieved from measurements of VV and HH radar returns. Analysis of a ratio of VV and HH radar backscatter - polarization ratio (PR) has demonstrated a significant role of a non Bragg component. NBC contributes significantly to the total radar backscatter, in particular, at moderate incidence angles (about 50-70 deg.) it is 2-3 times smaller than VV Bragg component and several times larger that HH Bragg component. Both NBC and BC depend on azimuth angle, being minimal for cross wind direction, but NBC is more isotropic than BC. It is obtained that velocities of scatterers retrieved from radar Doppler shifts are different for Bragg waves and for non Bragg component; NBC structures are ""faster"" than Bragg waves particularly for upwind radar observations. Bragg components propagate approximately with phase velocities of linear gravity-capillary waves (when accounting for wind drift). Velocities of NBC scatterers depend on radar band, being the largest for S-band and the smallest at X-band, this means that different structures on the water surface are responsible for non Bragg scattering in a given radar band. © 2017 SPIE.","Backscattering; Doppler effect; Doppler radar; Hydrophilicity; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface scattering; Surface waters; Surface waves; Wind; Conventional models; Gravity capillary waves; Microwave radars; Ocean remote sensing; Polarization ratios; Radar scattering; Sea surfaces; Wind wave; Radar measurement","3-band microwave radar; Bragg and non Bragg radar scattering; Radar Doppler shifts; Sea surface; Wind waves","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038413309"

Tight relationships between surface water salinity and in situ aCDOM were found during the cruises in the Yangtze River estuary on April 2013 and Hangzhou Bay in May 2014, distributions of aCDOM revealed gradual downward trends of magnitudes, as water flowed down the Yangtze River estuary into the ECS coast. A dilution process was detected as water flowed down the Yangtze River and into the ECS coast. Thus, a salinity inversion model from the negative relationship between salinity and aCDOM was developed firstly.

In this paper, an improved profiling system and processing method are proposed. Firstly, a convenient buoyancy device is designed and mounted on the Satlantic Profiler II to allow the profiler to loiter close to the sea surface, thereby significantly improving the vertical sampling resolution to 1cm/s in near-surface waters, particularly in the depth between 0 and 1 meter. In addition, customized processing software CProSoft is developed to subjectively select the depths for various wavelengths that meet their different requirement for regression analysis. Comparison with original system results shows that our novel method can significantly improve the accuracy of Kd(λ) measurements especially in the short blue and red spectral range, and can even effectively derive near-surface Kd values in the extremely turbid waters with attenuation coefficients greater than 30 m-1, which dramatically enlarge the Kd(λ) measuring range. © 2016 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Processing; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Attenuation coefficient; Diffuse attenuation; Diffuse attenuation coefficients; Improved method; Processing method; Processing software; Profiling systems; Turbid water; Surface waters","Hyperspectral diffuse attenuation coefficients; Improved method; Turbid waters","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011301161"

Shorter period Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs), whose periods are an order of magnitude smaller than tidal internal waves, are however generally assumed too small to be detected with standard altimeters (at low sampling rates, i.e. 1 Hz). This is because the Radar Altimeter (RA) footprint is somewhat larger, or of similar size at best, than the ISWs typical wavelengths. Here it will be demonstrated that new generation high sampling rate satellite altimetry data (i.e. ∼20 Hz) hold a variety of short-period signatures that are consistent with surface manifestations of ISWs in the ocean. Our observational method is based on satellite synergy with imaging sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and other high-resolution optical sensors (e.g. 250m resolution MODIS images) with which ISWs are unambiguously recognized. A first order commonly accepted ISW radar imaging mechanism is based on hydrodynamic modulation models [2] [3] in which the straining of surface waves due to ISW orbital currents is known to cause modulation of decimeter-scale surface waves, which have group velocities close to the IW phase velocity. This effect can be readily demonstrated by measurements of wind wave slope variances associated with short-period ISWs, as accomplished in the pioneer work of Hughes and Grant [4]. Mean square slope can be estimated from nadir looking RAs using a geometric optics (specular) scattering model [5][6][7], and directly obtained from normalized backscatter (sigma0) along-track records. We use differential scattering from the dual-band (Ku-and C-bands) microwave pulses of the Jason-2 high-rate RA to isolate the contribution of small-scale surface waves to mean square slope. The differenced altimeter mean square slope estimate, derived for the nominal wave number range 40-100 rad/m, is then used to detect ISWs in records of along-track high sampling rate RAs. The RA signatures of these ISWs are also apparent in radar backscattered pulse waveforms from the original Sensor Geophysical Data Records (SGDR), in high resolution (20-Hz) data. The shape of these waveforms is modified by the ISWs with respect to waveforms unperturbed by short-period internal waves. Hence, a new method for identification of ISWs in high-rate RA records that combines along-track differenced mean square slopes across ISW crests and waveform shape variation is put forward in this paper. Validation of the method is warranted with quasi-coincident (in time and space) SAR images of ISWs in various deep ocean regions, such as the Andaman Sea, the Mascarene Ridge of the Indian Ocean and the North Atlantic tropical ocean. The practical significance of this new method is related to the anticipated SWOT wide-swath altimeter mission as well as the recently launched Sentinel-3A SARAL, for which removal of internal wave signals may be of critical importance for observing other high-frequency sub-mesoscale dynamics. © 2016 SPIE.","Aneroid altimeters; Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Meteorological instruments; Modulation; Orbits; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Satellites; Sea ice; Solitons; Space optics; Space-based radar; Surface waves; Synthetic aperture radar; Tides; Water waves; Differential scattering; High sampling rates; Hydrodynamic modulation; Internal solitary waves; Observational method; Satellite altimetry data; Sigma0 blooms; Surface manifestations; Oceanography","Internal Solitary Waves; Radar Altimeter; Sigma0 blooms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011298920"

Because the depth of shallow water is changeable by the sediment deposition and the ocean waves, the periodic monitoring at shoe area is needed. Utilization of satellite images are well matched for widely and repeatedly monitoring at sea area. Sea bottom terrain model using by remote sensing data have been developed and these methods based on the radiative transfer model of the sun irradiance which is affected by the atmosphere, water, and sea bottom. We adopted that general method of the sea depth extraction to the satellite imagery, WorldView-2; which has very fine spatial resolution (50cm/pix) and eight bands at visible to near-infrared wavelengths. From high-spatial resolution satellite images, there is possibility to know the coral reefs and the rock area's detail terrain model which offers important information for the amphibious landing. In addition, the WorldView-2 satellite sensor has the band at near the ultraviolet wavelength that is transmitted through the water. On the other hand, the previous study showed that the estimation error by the satellite imagery was related to the sea bottom materials such as sand, coral reef, sea alga, and rocks. Therefore, in this study, we focused on sea bottom materials, and tried to improve the depth estimation accuracy. First, we classified the sea bottom materials by the SVM method, which used the depth data acquired by multi-beam sonar as supervised data. Then correction values in the depth estimation equation were calculated applying the classification results. As a result, the classification accuracy of sea bottom materials was 93%, and the depth estimation error using the correction by the classification result was within 1.2m. © 2017 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrophilicity; Image classification; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Ocean structures; Radiative transfer; Reefs; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Underwater acoustics; Water waves; Classification accuracy; Environmental Monitoring; High spatial resolution; Mixed modeling; Multispectral satellite imagery; Near-infrared wavelength; Radiative transfer model; Shallow water bathymetry; Satellite imagery","Bathymetry; Mixed model; SVM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038436998"

By converting inorganic carbon into organic carbon, the photosynthesis process of phytoplankton affords an important way for carbon sequestration in the ocean. According to previous researches, primary production (NPP) and the structure of phytoplankton community are important in regulate the efficiency of biological carbon pump. This study examined the spatiotemporal variability of satellite remote sensing derived chlorophyll a concentration (Chla), phytoplankton carbon biomass (Carbon), composition ratio of micro-, nano- and pico- phytoplankton, NPP and integrated particulate organic carbon (IPOC) during 1998-2007 in the South China Sea (SCS). Micro-, nano-phytoplankton and NPP showed similar seasonal variation with highest values in winter (January) (especially in the western ocean of Luzon Strait) and lowest values in summer (July) in SCS. Chla, phytoplankton carbon biomass, and IPOC showed different seasonal trends with one peak values occurred in winter and lowest in spring. Two sampling areas (A, N:17-21°, E:117.5-120° and B, N:12.5-15°, E:112-119°) in SCS were selected based on spatial distribution of the standard deviation of research parameters mentioned above. Compared to Chla, phytoplankton carbon biomass, NPP and IPOC, the interannual changes of phytoplankton community structure were remarkable in the two areas. The fraction of micro- and nano- phytoplankton in SCS tend to rise when La Nina events occur. Our results contribute to an understanding of the response of phytoplankton to climate change in the marginal sea. To quantify the efficiency of biological carbon pump in this area, more attention should be paid to the development of remote sensing algorithms of export NPP (or POC export flux) as well as the regulate mechanism of export NPP. © 2017 SPIE.","Bioinformatics; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Efficiency; Forestry; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Particle size; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Scandium; Sea ice; Chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Ocean color remote sensing; Particulate organic carbon; Phytoplankton carbon biomass; Primary production; Remote sensing algorithms; Spatiotemporal variability; Organic carbon","Chlorophyll a; Ocean color remote sensing; Phytoplankton particle size; POC; Primary production; SCS","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038435669"

While matchups are usually good in open ocean waters, significant discrepancies are observed in coastal areas which are primarily due to the more complex atmospheres near the coast and therefore less accurate atmospheric correction. Satellite-derived water leaving radiances are determined by applying atmospheric correction procedures which include assumptions about the characteristics of atmospheric aerosols. At sea level, SeaPRISM makes direct measurements of nLw from the ocean, as well as observations of sky from which aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness, single scattering albedo, fraction of fine and coarse aerosols, and others are determined.

Here we provide a critical review of how satellite sensors are being used to study physical oceanography processes at the ocean surface and its borders with the atmosphere and sea ice. The paper begins by describing the main sensor types that are used to observe the oceans (visible, thermal infrared and microwave) and the specific observations that each of these sensor types can provide. We then present a critical review of how these sensors and observations are being used to study: (i) ocean surface currents, (ii) storm surges, (iii) sea ice, (iv) atmosphere–ocean gas exchange and (v) surface heat fluxes via phytoplankton. Exciting advances include the use of multiple sensors in synergy to observe temporally varying Arctic sea ice volume, atmosphere–ocean gas fluxes, and the potential for four-dimensional water circulation observations. For each of these applications we explain their relevance to society, review recent advances and capability, and provide a forward look at future prospects and opportunities. We then more generally discuss future opportunities for oceanography-focused remote sensing, which includes the unique European Union Copernicus programme, the potential of the International Space Station and commercial miniature satellites.

It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms that drive snowmelt, both at different times of the year and in different regions around Antarctica. In this study, we combine diurnal brightness temperature differences (dTB(37 GHz)) and ratios (TB(19 GHz)/TB(37 GHz)) to detect and classify snowmelt processes. We distinguish temporary snowmelt from continuous snowmelt to characterize dominant melt patterns for different Antarctic sea-ice regions from 1988/1989 to 2014/2015. Our results indicate four characteristic melt types. On average, 38.9 ± 6.0% of all detected melt events are diurnal freeze-thaw cycles in the surface snow layer, characteristic of temporary melt (Type A). Less than 2% reveal immediate continuous snowmelt throughout the snowpack, i.e., strong melt over a period of several days (Type B). In 11.7 ± 4.0%, Type A and B take place consecutively (Type C), and for 47.8 ± 6.8% no surface melt is observed at all (Type D). Continuous snowmelt is primarily observed in the outflow of the Weddell Gyre and in the northern Ross Sea, usually 17 days after the onset of temporary melt. Comparisons with Snow Buoy data suggest that also the onset of continuous snowmelt does not translate into changes in snow depth for a longer period but might rather affect the internal stratigraphy and density structure of the snowpack. Considering the entire data set, the timing of snowmelt processes does not show significant temporal trends. © 2016.

Sea ice trajectory tracking with satellite scatterometer data in 2008 shows that ice around Antarctica is pushed offshore by katabatic winds influenced by the continental topography. The ice trajectories reveal that sea ice, grown earlier in the ice season, drifts northward away from the Antarctic continent forming a circumpolar frontal ice zone (FIZ) behind the ice edge. The FIZ thereby consists of sea ice that becomes rougher due to a longer exposure to wind and wave actions, and thicker over time by more ice growth and greater snow accumulation.In the Antarctic circumpolar sea ice zone adjacent to the sea ice edge, satellite data in 1999-2009 exhibit a band of strong radar backscatter, which is consistent with the signature of older, thicker, and rougher sea ice with more snow in the FIZ. This sea ice band, as wide as 1000 km, serves as a 'Great Shield,' encapsulating and protecting younger and thinner ice in the internal ice pack. In the young and thin ice region behind the FIZ, ice can grow rapidly as winds continue opening interior areas thereby creating effective ""ice factories."" In addition, ridging can enhance ice thickness by convergence toward the circumpolar FIZ that is recirculated by westerly winds and currents. During the ice growth season, the FIZ advances until reaching lower-latitude warm waters at a boundary determined by the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front that is constrained by seafloor features. These persistent topographical and bathymetric geological factors help sustain the Antarctic sea ice cover. As such, the behavior of Antarctic sea ice is not a paradox as some have suggested, but instead is consistent with the geophysical characteristics in the southern polar region that starkly contrast to those in the Arctic. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Arctic Ocean; Bathymetry; Geophysics; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Tracking (position); Wind; Active microwave; Antarctic Circumpolar Currents; Antarctic sea ice; Ice zones; Wind patterns; bathymetry; circumpolar current; geophysics; ice cover; ice thickness; katabatic flow; oceanic front; radar; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; snow accumulation; westerly; wind profile; Ice","Antarctic Circumpolar Current front; Antarctic sea ice; Frontal ice zone; GEBCO bathymetry; Passive and active microwave remote sensing; Wind patterns","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965106621"

This kind of data can also be used as a supplement for missing data and for reducing the uncertainty of data interpolation. The aerial photos are analyzed near the North Pole collected during the Chinese national arctic research expedition in the summer of 2010 (CHINARE2010). The result shows that the average fraction of open water increases from the ice camp at approximately 87°N to the North Pole, resulting in the decrease in the sea ice. The average sea ice concentration is only 62.0% for the two flights (16 and 19 August 2010). The average albedo (0.42) estimated from the area ratios among snow-covered ice, melt pond and water is slightly lower than the 0.49 of HOTRAX 2005. The data on 19 August 2010 shows that the albedo decreases from the ice camp at approximately 87°N to the North Pole, primarily due to the decrease in the fraction of snow-covered ice and the increase in fractions of melt-pond and open-water. The ice concentration from the aerial photos and AMSR-E (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System) images at 87.0°–87.5°N exhibits similar spatial patterns, although the AMSR-E concentration is approximately 18.0% (on average) higher than aerial photos. This can be attributed to the 6.25 km resolution of AMSR-E, which cannot separate melt ponds/submerged ice from ice and cannot detect the small leads between floes. Thus, the aerial photos would play an important role in providing high-resolution independent estimates of the ice concentration and the fraction of melt pond cover to validate and/or supplement space-borne remote sensing products near the North Pole. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","aerial observation; albedo; concentration; melt pond; North Pole; sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008932529"

The approach includes cloud-free image compositing as well as image classification using spectral criteria. The algorithm uses an alternative snow index to the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). The GOES-13 imager does not have a 1.6 μm band, a requirement for NDSI; however, the newly proposed Mid-Infrared Sea and Lake Ice Index (MISI) incorporates the reflective component of the 3.9 μm or mid-infrared (MIR) band, which the GOES-13 imager does operate. Incorporating MISI into a sea or lake ice mapping algorithm allows for mapping of thin or broken ice with no snow cover (nilas, frazil ice) and thicker ice with snow cover to a degree of confidence that is comparable to other ice mapping products. The proposed index has been applied over the Great Lakes region and qualitatively compared to the Interactive Multi-sensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), the National Ice Center ice concentration maps and MODIS snow cover products.

After more than a decade of research, it has been observed that spatial information can very significantly improve the accuracy of land use/land cover maps. In this context, the goal of this paper is to propose a few insights on how spatial information can benefit to (passive) microwave remote sensing. To do so, we focus here on mathematical morphology and provide some illustrative examples where morphological operators can improve the processing and analysis of microwave radiometric information.

Two instruments, a radar scatterometer and a radiometer, observe the same surface footprint almost simultaneously. The radiometer is the primary instrument for sensing sea surface salinity (SSS), while the scatterometer is included to provide a correction for sea surface roughness, which is a primary source of error in the salinity retrieval. Although the primary objective is the measurement of SSS, the instrument combination operates continuously, acquiring data over land and sea ice as well. An important feature of the data processing includes detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), which is done separately for both active and passive instruments. Correcting for RFI is particularly critical over ocean because of the high accuracy required in the brightness temperature measurements for SSS retrieval. It is also necessary for applications of the Aquarius data over land, where man-made interference is widespread, even though less accuracy is required in this case.

The spatial-temporal variability of TSM directly contributes to the transport of carbon, nutrients, pollutants, and other materials. Therefore, it is essential to maintain and monitor sedimentary environment in coastal waters. Traditional field sampling methods limit observation capability for insufficient spatial-temporal resolution. Thus, it is difficult to synoptically monitor high diurnal dynamics of TSM. However, the in-orbit operation of the world's first geostationary satellite ocean color sensor, GOCI, thoroughly changes this situation with hourly observations of covered area. Taking advantage of GOCI high spatial-temporal resolution, we generated TSM maps from GOCI Level-1B data after atmospheric correction based on six TSM empirical algorithms. Validation of GOCI-retrieved normalized water-leaving radiances and TSM concentration was presented in comparison with matched-up in-situ measurements.

A numerical sea ice model was implemented with a data assimilation scheme on a high performance computer. The model input includes atmospheric reanalysis and ocean climatological data. The assimilation of data acquired from satellite microwave radiometer improves model accuracy. The advantage of the model is the possibility to forecast ice parameters such as concentration, thickness, draft, ridging etc. on a high resolution scale. The modeled ice parameters can be used for risk analysis for offshore infrastructure and ship navigation in the ice covered regions. The results can also be used in regional climate studies by coupling with ocean-atmospheric models. The model was extensively tested and evaluated with satellite data and field measurements. The simulated ice draft results demonstrated a good agreement with the measurements from upward looking sonar (ULS) deployed on the Makkovik Bank (in the Labrador Sea). For example, the standard deviation (STD) of level ice draft is less than 5.0 cm and the bias is less than 0.2 cm for March- April of 2009.

Investigations of kerosene films were carried out in a wide range values of film thicknesses (from some hundreds millimetres to a few millimetres) and in a wide range of surface wave frequencies (from 10 to 27 Hz). The selected frequency range corresponds to the operating wavelengths of microwave, Crossed D sign1-to Ka-band radars typically used for the ocean remote sensing. The studied range of film thickness covers typical thicknesses of routine spills in the ocean. It is obtained that characteristics of waves, measured in the presence of oil derivatives films differ from those for crude oil films, in particular, because the volume viscosity of oil derivatives and crude oil is strongly different. To retrieve parameters of kerosene films from the experimental data the surface wave damping was analyzed theoretically in the frame of a model of two-layer fluid. The films are assumed to be soluble, so the elasticity on the upper and lower boundaries is considered as a function of wave frequency. Physical parameters of oil derivative films were estimated when tuning the film parameters to fit theory and experiment. Comparison between wave damping due to crude oil, kerosene and diesel fuel films have shown some capabilities of distinguishing of oil films from remote sensing of short surface waves. © 2016 SPIE.","Crude oil; Damping; Diesel fuels; Elasticity; Film thickness; Fluids; Fuels; Gravity waves; Hydrophilicity; Lubricating oils; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waves; Water waves; Complex films; Frequency ranges; Gravity capillary waves; Laboratory studies; Ocean remote sensing; Operating wavelength; Physical parameters; Volume viscosity; Kerosene","Complex film elasticity; Crude oil; Damping of gravity capillary waves; Diesel fuel; Films of Kerosene","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011317562"

The issue gained importance in view of the ongoing construction of the Crimean Bridge across the strait. Our monitoring has been based on the whole variety of available satellite data including visible and radar data over the past 17 years. Every year the Azov Sea becomes fully or partially covered by ice during the cold season. In severe winters, ice often is carried to the Kerch Strait and even the Black Sea. An analysis of ice drift hydrometeorological conditions is presented. The ice conditions of 2017 are under special consideration. Everyday satellite monitoring of the Kerch Strait, including the construction area of the Crimean Bridge, revealed ice formation and drift features on the way from the Azov Sea through the Kerch Strait as well as ice interaction with the piers of the main and technological bridges under construction. It was found that, even under strong northeast winds, ice can pass neither through the piers, nor via the widest shipway. At present, it is hard to discern the impacts of the two bridges on floating ice, nevertheless when the construction is over and the technological bridge is gone, by all appearances the main bridge will strongly affect ice conditions in the Kerch Strait. This perspective calls for continuous satellite monitoring of the area that is enabled by cutting-edge systems and technologies. © 2017 SPIE.","Bridges; Electric currents; Hydrophilicity; Monitoring; Piers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Wind; Azov Sea; Black sea; Ice conditions; Infrared data; Long term monitoring; SAR data; Satellite data; Visible data; Ice","Azov Sea; Black Sea; Crimean Bridge; Current; Ice conditions; Infrared data; Long-term monitoring, Kerch Strait; SAR data; Satellite data; Visible data; Wind","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038431447"

With continuous coastline detection results from satellite image time series, the actual shoreline, the sea level, and environmental parameters can be observed to support coastal management and disaster warning. Established coastline detection methods are often based on SAR images and wellknown image processing approaches. These methods involve a lot of complicated data processing, which is a big challenge for remote sensing time series. Additionally, a number of SAR satellites operating with polarimetric capabilities have been launched in recent years, and many investigations of target characteristics in radar polarization have been performed. In this paper, a fast and efficient coastline detection method is proposed which comprises three steps. First, we calculate a modified correlation coefficient of two SAR images of different polarization. This coefficient differs from the traditional computation where normalization is needed. Through this modified approach, the separation between sea and land becomes more prominent. Second, we set a histogram-based threshold to distinguish between sea and land within the given image. The histogram is derived from the statistical distribution of the polarized SAR image pixel amplitudes. Third, we extract continuous coastlines using a Canny image edge detector that is rather immune to speckle noise. Finally, the individual coastlines derived from time series of.SAR images can be checked for changes. © 2017 SPIE.","Data handling; Graphic methods; Hydrophilicity; Image processing; Landforms; Polarimeters; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Coastline detections; Correlation coefficient; Environmental parameter; Maritime remote sensing; Polarimetric capabilities; SAR Images; SAR polarimetry; Statistical distribution; Radar imaging","Coastline detection; SAR images; SAR polarimetry; Time series images","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038424570"

Some studies suggest that the variability of SIP in Antarctic coastal polynyas is driven by the influence of atmospheric forcing, i.e., surface winds and air temperature. Our previous mapping of SIP in 13 major Antarctic coastal polynyas from 1992 to 2007, using a heat flux calculation with ice thickness data derived from satellite data, is extended here to examine the interannual and seasonal variability of SIP from 1992 to 2013. The interannual variability of total ice production correlates more strongly with polynya extent than with atmospheric forcing, with the exception of the Shackleton Polynya, which correlates well with wind. There is no coherent signal in the interannual variability between the major Antarctic coastal polynyas. We find that stochastic changes to the coastal “icescape,” i.e., ice shelves, floating glaciers, fast ice, together with offshore first-year ice, are also important factors driving SIP variability on multiyear time scales. Both the Ross Ice Shelf Polynya and Mertz Glacier Polynya experienced a significant reduction in SIP due to calving events and the repositioning of icebergs and fast ice. Our results also show opposing trends between polynya-based SIP and sea ice extent in key regions of Antarctic sea ice change. Close monitoring of coastal icescape dynamics and change is essential to better understand the long-term impact of coastal polynya variability and its influence on regional AABW production. © 2016.

Especially, annual change of sea ice shows different trend in Antarctica and Arctic. This different variation need to continuously observe the Polar Regions. Sea Ice Albedo (SIA) and Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) are an indicator of variation on sea ice. In addition, albedo is key parameter to understand the energy budget in Antarctica. This being so, it is important to analyze long-term variation of the two factors for observing of change of Antarctic environment. In this study, we analyzed long-term variability of SIC and SIA to understand the changes of sea ice over Antarctic and researched the relationship with two factors. We used the SIA data at The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and the SIC data provided by Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) from 1982 to 2009. The study period was selected to Antarctic summer season due to polar nights.

We analyzed the correlation between SIA and SIC. As a results, two variables have a strong positive correlation (each correlation coefficients are 0.91 in Nov-Dec and 0.90 in Jan-Feb). We performed time series analysis using linear regression to understand the spatial and temporal tendency of SIA and SIC. As a results, SIA and SIC have a same spatial trend such as Weddle sea and Ross sea sections show the positive trend and Bellingshausen Amundsen sea shows the negative trend of two factors.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the annual sea ice cycle has experienced earlier melt and later freeze up, leading to a significant reduction in minimum sea ice extents and the lengthening of the melting season. The Arctic is being transformed into a regime of widespread seasonal ice with a large loss of old and thick multiyear ice in recent years. However, the sea ice change exhibits considerable interannual and regional variability at different spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we present a new method for hypertemporal sea ice data change detection based on the annual sea ice concentration (SIC) profile for the melt months of each year. A decision tree-based classification is adopted to group pixels with similar annual SIC profiles, and a phenology map of each year is generated for visualization. The phenoregion map visualizes the spatial and temporal configurations of ice melt process for a year. The change detection objective is achieved by comparing the phenoregion number of the same pixel in different years. The algorithm further leads to interpretation of anomalies to obtain change maps at the pixel level. Compared to previous sea ice studies that mainly focused on a particular spatial region and commonly use time period averages, the proposed pixel-based approach has the potential to map sea ice data change both temporally and spatially. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.","air-ice interaction; algorithm; ice-ocean interaction; melting; phenology; remote sensing; sea ice; seasonal variation; temporal variation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930170475"

In addition to the influence that tidewater glaciers have on physical and chemical oceanography, floating icebergs serve as habitat for marine animals such as harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardii). The availability and spatial distribution of glacier ice in the fjords is likely a key environmental variable that influences the abundance and distribution of selected marine mammals; however, the amount of ice and the fine-scale characteristics of ice in fjords have not been systematically quantified. Given the predicted changes in glacier habitat, there is a need for the development of methods that could be broadly applied to quantify changes in available ice habitat in tidewater glacier fjords. We present a case study to describe a novel method that uses object-based image analysis (OBIA) to classify floating glacier ice in a tidewater glacier fjord from high-resolution aerial digital imagery. Our objectives were to (i) develop workflows and rule sets to classify high spatial resolution airborne imagery of floating glacier ice; (ii) quantify the amount and fine-scale characteristics of floating glacier ice; (iii) and develop processes for automating the object-based analysis of floating glacier ice for large number of images from a representative survey day during June 2007 in Johns Hopkins Inlet (JHI), a tidewater glacier fjord in Glacier Bay National Park, southeastern Alaska. On 18 June 2007, JHI was comprised of brash ice (x̄ = 45.2%, SD = 41.5%), water (x̄ = 52.7%, SD = 42.3%), and icebergs (x̄ = 2.1%, SD = 1.4%). Average iceberg size per scene was 5.7 m2 (SD = 2.6 m2). We estimate the total area (± uncertainty) of iceberg habitat in the fjord to be 455,400 ± 123,000 m2. The method works well for classifying icebergs across scenes (classification accuracy of 75.6%); the largest classification errors occur in areas with densely-packed ice, low contrast between neighboring ice cover, or dark or sediment-covered ice, where icebergs may be misclassified as brash ice about 20% of the time. OBIA is a powerful image classification tool, and the method we present could be adapted and applied to other ice habitats, such as sea ice, to assess changes in ice characteristics and availability. © 2016, Public Library of Science.

SMOS is an Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission from the European Space Agency(ESA). It was launched at a sun-synchronous orbit in 2009 and one of the payloads is called MIRAS(Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis), which is the first interferometric microwave radiometer designed for observing SSS at L-band(1.41 GHz).The foundation of the salinity retrieval by microwave radiometer is that the sea surface radiance at L-band has the most suitable sensitivity with the variation of the salinity. It is well known that the sensitivity of brightness temperatures(TB) to SSS depends on the sea surface temperature (SST), but the quantitative impact of the SST on the satellite retrieval of the SSS is still poorly known. In this study, we investigate the impact of the SST on the accuracy of salinity retrieval from the SMOS. First of all, The dielectric constant model proposed by Klein and Swift has been used to estimate the vertically and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures(TV and TH) of a smooth sea water surface at L-band and derive the derivatives of TV and TH as a function of SSS to show the relative sensitivity at 45° incident angle. Then, we use the GAM(generalized additive model) method to evaluate the association between the satellite-measured brightness temperature and in-situ SSS at different SST. Moreover, the satellite-derived SSS from the SMOS is validated using the ARGO data to assess the RMSE(root mean squared error). We compare the SMOS SSS and ARGO SSS over two regions of Pacific ocean far from land and ice under different SST. The RMSE of retrieved SSS at different SST have been estimated. Our results showed that SST is one of the most significant factors affecting the accuracy of SSS retrieval. The satellite-measured brightness temperature has a higher sensitivity with SSS variation and better accuracy of SSS retrieval at higher SST. For the most open oceans where surface salinity is typically greater than 32 psu, the sensitivity is around 0.2-0.25 K/psu for both vertical polarization and horizontal polarization when SST is 5°C,and the TB is more sensitive to the SSS for vertical polarization than horizontal polarization with the increase of SST. When SST increases to 30°C, the sensitivity is around 0.8 K/psu for vertical polarization which is about 40% larger than it of the horizontal polarization. In addition, the result of GAM model indicates that satellite-measured brightness temperature has better correlation with in-situ SSS at higher SST. The mean absolute error of the SMOS-derived SSS is around 0.9 psu when SST is 15°C, and decreases to 0.4 psu when the SST is 30°C. © 2016 SPIE.","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Earth (planet); Hydrophilicity; Ice; Luminance; Mean square error; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Microwaves; Orbits; Polarization; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Satellites; Sea ice; Seawater; Sensitivity analysis; Soil moisture; Space optics; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Temperature; Generalized additive model; Microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis; Microwave radiometry; Satellite microwave radiometers; Sea salinity; Sea surface temperature (SST); SMOS; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Oceanography","Microwave radiometry; Sea salinity retrieval; Sea surface temperature; SMOS","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011299110"

Since current satellite and field observations for sea ice thickness are limited in time and space, the use of PIOMAS is expected to fill the gap by providing temporally continued ice thickness fields. Calculated monthly volume flux exhibits a prominent annual cycle with the peak record in March (roughly 145 km3/month) and the trough in August (10 km3/month). Annual ice volume flux (1 132 km3) is primarily attributable to winter (October through May) outflow (approximately 92%). Uncertainty in annual ice volume export is estimated to be 55 km3 (or 5.7%). Our results also verified the extremely large volume flux appearing between late 1980s and mid- 1990s. Nevertheless, no clear trend was found in our volume flux results. Ice motion is the primary factor in the determination of behavior of volume flux. Ice thickness presented a general decline trend may partly enhance or weaken the volume flux trend. Ice concentration exerted the least influences on modulating trends and variability in volume flux. Moreover, the linkage between winter ice volume flux and three established Arctic atmospheric schemes were examined. Compared to NAO, the DA and EOF3 mechanism explains a larger part of variations of ice volume flux across the strait. © 2017, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","Fram Strait; PIOMAS; remote sensing; sea ice volume flux","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008895453"

We estimated the ice production for the winter season 2007/2008 (November&ndash;April) based on simulations with the regional climate model COSMO-CLM at a horizontal resolution of 5km and compared it to remote sensing estimates. A reference and five sensitivity simulations were performed with different assumptions on grid-scale and subgrid-scale ice thickness considered within polynyas, using a tile approach for fractional sea ice. In addition, the impact of heat loss on the atmospheric boundary layer was investigated. About 29.1km3 of total winter ice production was estimated for the reference simulation, which varies by up to +124% depending on the thin-ice assumptions. For the most realistic assumptions based on remote sensing of ice thickness the ice production increases by +39%. The use of the tile approach enlarges the area and enhances the magnitude of the heat loss from polynyas up to +110% if subgrid-scale open water is assumed and by +20% for realistic assumptions. This enhanced heat loss causes in turn higher ice production rates and stronger impact on the atmospheric boundary layer structure over the polynyas. The study shows that ice production is highly sensitive to the thin-ice parameterizations for fractional sea-ice cover. In summary, realistic ice production estimates could be retrieved from our simulations. Neglecting subgrid-scale energy fluxes might considerably underestimate the ice production in coastal polynyas, such as in the Laptev Sea, with possible consequences on the Arctic sea-ice budget. © Author(s) 2016.","Arctic Ocean; Laptev Sea; boundary layer; climate modeling; energy flux; heat transfer; ice thickness; open water; parameterization; quantitative analysis; regional climate; remote sensing; sea ice; simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85004109092"

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of hybrid dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure.

The sea state is complex at Low grazing angle (LGA), and it is difficult with its large irradiation area and a great deal simulation facets. A practical and efficient model to obtain radar clutter of dynamic sea in different sea condition is proposed, basing on the physical mechanism of interaction between electromagnetic wave and sea wave. The classical analysis method for sea clutter is basing on amplitude and spectrum distribution, taking the clutter as random processing model, which is equivocal in its physical mechanism. To achieve electromagnetic field from sea surface, a modified phase from facets is considered, and the backscattering coefficient is calculated by Wu's improved two-scale model, which can solve the statistical sea backscattering problem less than 5 degree, considering the effects of the surface slopes joint probability density, the shadowing function, the skewness of sea waves and the curvature of the surface on the backscattering from the ocean surface. We make the assumption that the scattering contribution of each facet is independent, the total field is the superposition of each facet in the receiving direction. Such data characters are very suitable to compute on GPU threads. So we can make the best of GPU resource.

Specifically, we examine scenarios involving subsurface layers exhibiting electrical response given by deviated anisotropic tensors exhibiting low loss and high inter-layer dielectric contrast (i.e., strong subsurface wave guidance), as well as predominantly cross-pol specular interface scatter (XSIS)-based subsurface backscatter.

Underwater bottom topography can be retrieved indirectly by measuring variations of the sea surface roughness in the SAR images, although the microwaves cannot penetrate into the water.

These results are then used for water depth inversions based on the Alpers-Hennings (AH) model, supported by a few true depth data points (sounding data or chart data). This method is used to bathymetric mapping of two areas in the Subei shoal. The study results of the two cases show that the trend of the inversion and true depths match well. The retrieval accuracy depends on the true depth data points. In a case, the true depth data is the sounding data, the relative errors between the inversion and true depths is less than 20%. In the other case, the true depth data is the chart data. And the result is worse, because the measure time of the chart is 1979, and the time of SAR images are 2000s.

Those representative values are crucial indicator of sensor performance so that small changes of ocean properties (e.g., remote sensed reflectance (Rrs), surface chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a), and so on) can be quantified and directly related with those values. MTF is affected from a performance of instrument itself and environmental conditions, and its variation leads to change the final products. The goal of this study is to simulate and to analyze the relationship between MTF parameter and ocean product variations, and then to provide a reference for the design of future ocean color sensors. In this study, we used the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data to generate the simulated atmospheric correction band image. And then Rrs data and ocean products were generated with imagery from two different locations and acquisition times, and we analyzed and compared the statistical results with study area having different characteristics. For ocean products relationships, we notify the linear variation of the absolute percentage difference (APD) according to the changeable MTF value. Especially, Case-II water (turbid water) area shows more sensitive variation than Case-I water (clear water) area. Even though the same area was applied in the simulation, it was 1-2 times higher sensitivity of variation when a specific ocean phenomena such as red tide. The suggested simulation can be confirmed the relationship between blurred NIR band image and ocean products. And statistical results with MTF values were able to help estimating ocean product precision and designing a future mission such as the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II) mission currently being progressed. © 2016 SPIE.","Color; Geostationary satellites; Hydrophilicity; Infrared devices; Modulation; Optical transfer function; Product design; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Transfer functions; Atmospheric corrections; Environmental conditions; GOCI; Ocean-color satellites; Operational planning; Radiometric performance; Representative values; Surface chlorophyll; Oceanography","GOCI; Modulation transfer function; Point spread function; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011295576"

The CMEMS OSR draws on expert analysis and provides a 3-D view (through reanalysis systems), a view from above (through remote-sensing data) and a direct view of the interior (through in situ measurements) of the global ocean and the European regional seas. The report is based on the unique CMEMS monitoring capabilities of the blue (hydrography, currents), white (sea ice) and green (e.g. Chlorophyll) marine environment. This first issue of the CMEMS OSR provides guidance on Essential Variables, large-scale changes and specific events related to the physical ocean state over the period 1993–2015. Principal findings of this first CMEMS OSR show a significant increase in global and regional sea levels, thermosteric expansion, ocean heat content, sea surface temperature and Antarctic sea ice extent and conversely a decrease in Arctic sea ice extent during the 1993–2015 period. During the year 2015 exceptionally strong large-scale changes were monitored such as, for example, a strong El Niño Southern Oscillation, a high frequency of extreme storms and sea level events in specific regions in addition to areas of high sea level and harmful algae blooms. At the same time, some areas in the Arctic Ocean experienced exceptionally low sea ice extent and temperatures below average were observed in the North Atlantic Ocean. © 2017 The Author(s).

The spatial influence of an observation as well as its weight are determined by the error covariance matrices used in the data assimilation.The background error covariance parameters for an SST analysis have been estimated using observation-minus-background difference data from a long term SST reanalysis. Geographically varying estimates were obtained of both the error variance and the associated length scale of the background error which were decomposed into small-scale and large-scale errors. Both components of the background error variances were found to be seasonally variable. Minimal seasonality was observed in the error correlation length scales but they were found to be anisotropic. Observational errors were also estimated for the observation types used in the observation-minus-background calculations.The impact of updating the background error parameters in the Operational Sea surface Temperature and sea-Ice Analysis (OSTIA) was assessed. The updates improved the analysis accuracy compared to assimilated and independent reference observations. The covariance updates also improved the ability of the SST analysis to represent small-scale ocean features without introducing spurious noise. As OSTIA is used as boundary conditions in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) system at the Met Office the impact on the NWP forecasts was also assessed.

In this paper, the wind speed retrieved from the HY-2 Scatterometer and significant wave height con-observed from the HY-2 radar altimeter are used to analyze the wind-wave relationship over the western north Pacific and China seas on July 2015. The significant wave height, which is measured from altimeter, is defined as the average height of the highest one-third waves in a wave spectrum, which is the mixture of swells and wind-waves. In order to deeply understand the wind-wave relationship, we use the criteria that is the total amount of energy contained in the wave field is less than or equal to the wave energy for a fully developed sea in terms of wind speed U10. Some the wind speed and significant wave height data eliminated the effect of swell are selected to study the wind-wave relationship, a second-degree polynomial wind-wave relationship is presented. It reveals a nonlinear relationship with the standard error is 0.59m, and it has an approximate linear relationship above 10 m s-1. Those make it possible to get the wind-generated wave information from the satellite-based wind fields. This relationship is coincident with the other two wind-wave models from in situ observations and significant wave height of wind-generated wave is also predicted from the HY2-SCAT wind speed based on this wind-wave model. However, it is still required to be validated by more observations for the wind-wave model, and it is possible to better or operationally apply for wave forecasting based on satellite-retrieved wind speed. © 2016 SPIE.","Aneroid altimeters; Hydrophilicity; Meteorological instruments; Radar; Radar equipment; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Speed; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Wind; Wind effects; HY-2; Non-linear relationships; Satellite observations; Second degree polynomials; Significant wave height; Wave heights; Wind generated waves; Wind speed; Flow visualization","HY-2; Signification wave height; Wind speed; Wind-generated wave","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011296307"

The alarming rate at which the process is taking place needs a special attention. In this study there were quite a few events that have already taken place and at the same time many that are yet to happen. This paper discusses 3 such calving events in Antarctica using Google Earth imageries and Landsat imageries. The first event is observed in the vicinity of Caird Coast in West Antarctica where a rift is growing wide and long within a very short span of time. Based on Google Earth imageries, the rift has grown from a 22 km stretch in 1984 to 55 km in 2017. The second event is reported in West Antarctica along the Luitpold Coast that shows a rift formed in the year 2013 and has since then showed a steady increase both in terms of length and width. The width has been increasing at the rate of half a km per year. Another rift runs somewhat parallel to the former rift and is around 8 km from away. The third event is reported close to Princess Astrid Coast in East Antarctica that took place in the year 2016 which was the result of an ongoing process that started in 2009. The calved portion covers an area of around 1 km2. This study highlights the effective usage of Google Earth imageries and Landsat satellite imageries for monitoring iceberg calving events in Antarctica. © 2017 ACRS.

HFR range is affected by sea ice, which dampens surface gravity waves and limits wind fetch for adjacent open waters. HFR range sensitivity to sea ice concentration was empirically determined for two types of HFR-Coastal Ocean Dynamics Applications Radar (CODAR) and Wellen Radar (WERA)-installed on the shores of the lower St. Lawrence estuary, Canada, during winter 2013. One CODAR was operating at 13.5 MHz on the southern shore, and one WERA was operating at 16.15 MHz on the northern shore. Ranges were determined using a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 6 dB for first-order Bragg scattering measured by the receive antenna elements. Ranges were normalized for expected ranges in ice-free conditions, using empirical relationships determined during summer 2013 between the range and surface gravity wave energy at the Bragg frequencies. Normalized ranges Γ decrease approximately linearly with increasing sea ice concentration C (averaged over the ice-free observational domain) with a slope close to -1 for both HFR types, that is, Γ = 1 - C.

In the past decade, many researches on the aquatic pCO2 and air-sea CO2 flux mainly in the north SCS were carried out based on the underway measurement of the pCO2, and the results revealed that the SCS is a source of the CO2 as a whole in the annual scale. However, the air-sea CO2 flux is high spatial variability in the SCS, for example, the north shelf of the SCS is a CO2 sink while the basin is a source. To monitor the spatial and temporal variations of the air-sea CO2 flux in the SCS, few satellite remote sensing algorithms have been developed to estimate the aquatic pCO2 in the north SCS. However, these algorithms are all the empirical models which depend on the training dataset from the in situ measurement. In this study, we apply the semi-analytical algorithm MeSAA to retrieve the aquatic pCO2 in the SCS basin. The MeSAA algorithm was proposed by the Bai et al. (2016) and was evidenced to be widely applicable to the different marginal seas including the East China Sea and Bering Sea. Based on the underway measured aquatic pCO2 and water temperature, we found that the variation of the pCO2 in the SCS basin is mainly controlled by the temperature. In addition, the increase of the atmosphere pCO2 can also contribute the systematical increase of the aquatic pCO2. Therefore, we established a semi-analytical algorithm for the aquatic pCO2 retrieval in the SCS basin, which considers the thermodynamic effect and air-sea CO2 fluxes. The results showed that the thermodynamic effect in the SCS basin was consistent with the theoretical result with the aquatic pCO2 increasing 4.23% for the 1°C rising of the water temperature. Moreover, the satellite-retrieved aquatic pCO2 match well with the in situ pCO2. Based on the established algorithm, the monthly time-series of the aquatic pCO2 in the SCS basins from 2003 to 2016 were generated from the MODIS datasets from both the Aqua and Terra satellite, and the long-term trends of the aquatic pCO2 in the different parts of the SCS basin were analyzed. © 2017 SPIE.","Carbon dioxide; Hydrophilicity; Satellites; Sea ice; Temperature; Thermodynamics; Aquatic pCO2; CO2 fluxes; Long-term trend; Monthly variation; South China Sea basin; Thermodynamic effect; Upwelling; Remote sensing","Air-sea CO2 fluxes; Aquatic pCO2; Long-term trend; Monthly variation; The South China Sea basin; Thermodynamic effect; Upwelling","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038419679"

Mean monthly area flux exhibits a prominent cycle with the peak in March (78 × 103 km2/month) and the trough in August (5 × 103 km2/month). Mean net annual ice area flux (644.1 × 103 km2 km 2) is primarily/slightly attributable to winter (October-May)/summer (June-September) outflow of {598.7 × 103 km2 (or 93.0%)/45.4 × 103 km2 (or 7%). However, these quantities need to be considered with great prudence since comparisons with preceding studies indicate distinct difference may exist between calculated Fram Strait sea ice outflow based on varied ice motion datasets. In particular, major bias emerged during winter rather than summer. Trends are also affected due to this bias. Despite the clear disparity in magnitude, we found a good agreement with preceding estimates in terms of temporal variability. The linkage between ice area flux via the Fram Strait and various atmospheric circulation indices, such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a west-east dipole anomaly pattern (DA), as well as a seesaw structure between Beaufort and Barents Sea (BBO), was examined. Results show that atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the DA and BBO possess a relatively stronger influence on Fram Strait ice export over the 25-year period. By contrast, the AO- and NAO-related atmospheric circulation pattern exhibit weaker connections with ice outflow through the strait. In addition, correlation analysis further justify the robust connection with a cross-strait surface level pressure gradient index. Depending on months, it is suggested that a manifold of aforementioned atmospheric indices may jointly or alone impose a significant influence on sea ice export through the Fram Strait. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Beaufort Sea; Fram Strait; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric structure; Climatology; Meteorology; Sea ice; Anomaly patterns; Arctic oscillations; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Concentration fields; Correlation analysis; North Atlantic oscillations; Temporal variability; Arctic Oscillation; North Atlantic Oscillation; outflow; pressure gradient; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; temporal variation; Ice","Fram Strait; remote sensing; sea ice area flux","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978791357"

Passive microwave sensors have been the most effective and consistent tool for characterizing daily sea ice cover at global scale. However, it is typically challenging to study temporally successive data acquired at high time frequencies, referred to as hypertemporal data. To address this issue, among various RS analysis techniques, temporal mixture analysis (TMA) approaches are often investigated for characterizing seasonal characteristics of environmental factors including sea ice concentration (SIC) in this study. The goal of the present study is to predict daily Antarctic SICs for 1 year through a combination of TMA results and time series analysis (TSA) without incorporation of environmental factors. First, temporally most significant sea ice signals, referred to as temporal endmembers (EMs), were found using signal processing algorithms, and then corresponding fractional abundances (FAs) associated with each EM were calculated using least squares solution. Using these FAs, subsequently, a single autoregressive (AR) model that typically fits all Antarctic SIC data for the period 1979–2013 was applied to predict SIC values for 2014. Daily SIC data reconstructed using the proposed method were qualitatively and quantitatively compared to those of using real FAs derived from a spectral unmixing method. It was found that AR model trained by the proposed method successfully predicts new FAs for 2014 and the FAs should be used to reconstruct resulting 2014 daily SIC images. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Antarctica; Climate change; Factor analysis; Forecasting; Global warming; Microwave sensors; Mixtures; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Signal processing; Time series analysis; Auto regressive models; Environmental factors; Least squares solutions; Passive microwave sensors; Remote sensing sensors; Sea ice concentration; Seasonal characteristics; Signal processing algorithms; algorithm; climate change; concentration (composition); estimation method; global warming; ice cover; prediction; remote sensing; sea ice; sensor; signal processing; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; vector autoregression; Ice","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994639342"

Information about the backscatter variations obtained from single band/one polarization radar seems to be insufficient for film characterization, so, new capabilities of multi-polarization radar for monitoring of film slicks have been actively discussed in the literature. In this paper results of new field experiments on remote sensing of film slicks using dual co-polarized radars: a satellite X-band TerraSAR-X and recently designed at IAP RAS a Multifrequency Radar Complex-three-band scatterometer operating in X-/C-/S-bands and mounted onboard a ship are presented. Along with backscattering depression the variations of polarized (Bragg) and non polarized radar backscatter components in slicks were analyzed. It is obtained that VV-to-HH backscatter ratio is smaller than the ratio predicted by a Bragg (two-scale) model thus indicating that additional, non polarized (NP), component also contributes to the total radar backscatter. Assuming the radar backscatter to be a sum of polarized (Bragg) and NP components the latter was eliminated from the total radar backscatter, and contrasts for the Bragg and NP components were obtained. The contrasts for the polarized component allowed us to estimate damping of gravity-capillary wind waves at Bragg wavelengths in slick and to give more accurate comparison with models of wave damping due to elastic film. © 2016 SPIE.","Backscattering; Damping; Hydrophilicity; Meteorological instruments; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface active agents; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Gravity capillary waves; Marine slicks; Microwave backscattering; Microwave radars; Sea surfaces; Surfactant films; Marine radar","Dual co-polarized microwave radar; Gravity-capillary waves; Marine slicks; Microwave backscattering; Sea surface; Surfactant films","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011304341"

An airborne electromagnetic survey that passed over a moored Ice Profiling Sonar (IPS) provided coincident independent measurements of total ice and snow thickness and ice draft at a scale of 10 km. Once differences in sampling footprint size are accounted for, we reconcile the respective probability distributions and estimate the thickness of level sea ice at 1.48 ± 0.1 m, with a snow depth of 0.12 ± 0.07 m. We also complete what we believe is the first independent validation of radar-derived ice velocities by comparing measurements from a coastal radar with those from an under-ice acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). After applying a median filter to reduce high-frequency scatter in the radar-derived data, we find good agreement with the ADCP bottom-tracked ice velocities. With increasing regulatory and operational needs for sea-ice data, including the number and thickness of pressure ridges, coordinated observing networks such as SIZONet can provide the means of reducing uncertainties inherent in individual datasets.","Alaska; Barrow; United States; Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler; airborne survey; electromagnetic survey; glaciology; ice drift; ice thickness; radar; remote sensing; sea ice; snow; sonar","Aerogeophysical measurements; Arctic glaciology; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea-ice dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932614818"

Our study covers a 16 year time period (1997-2013) and incorporates both the shelf and off-shelf regions of the Ross Sea. We observed significant secular changes in NPP from 1997 to 2013 in the off-shelf region, with NPP increasing on the eastern side and decreasing on the western side of our study area. The changes we observed in NPP are consistent with the changes we observed in sea surface temperature (SST) and open water days (OWDs), decreasing (increasing) on the western (eastern) side of our study area. Finally, we examined the influence of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Ninõ Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on SST, OWDs, Chl a, and NPP in the Ross Sea and observed a significant relationship between the state of the SAM and ENSO and SST, OWDs, and NPP across the study region. The response of OWDs, SST, and NPP to atmospheric forcing by SAM and ENSO was opposite for the shelf and off-shelf regions, such that during a positive phase of SAM or negative phase of ENSO (La Ninã), SST, OWDs, and NPP increased on the shelf and decreased in the off-shelf region.

First, all the data are classified into eight SST datasets at 3 hour intervals and then remapped to 0.05°resolution grids. A series of critical quality control is done to remove the outliers.Then bias adjustment is applied to the polar satellite observations with reference to the MTSAT data. Finally, the six satellites SST data are blended by using the optimal interpolated algorithm. The 3-hourly blended SST is compared against buoy measurements. It shows a good agreement that the biases do not exceed 0.2 °C and root mean square errors range from 0.5 to 0.65 °C. A typical diurnal cycle similar to sine wave is observed. The minimum SST occurs at around 0600h and warming peak occurring between 1300h and 1500h local solar time and then decrease in the late afternoon, tapering off at night on March 13, 2008 for example. The frequency of diurnal warming events derived from four years of the blended SST provides solid statistics to investigate the seasonal and spatial distributions of the diurnal warming in the SCS. The sea surface diurnal warming tends to appear more easily in spring, especially in the coastal regions than other seasons and the central regions. © 2015 SPIE.","Atmospheric temperature; Geostationary satellites; Hydrophilicity; Mean square error; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; bias adjustment; Diurnal variability; MTSAT; optimal interpolated; Sea surface temperature (SST); South China sea; Oceanography","bias adjustment; diurnal variability; MTSAT; optimal interpolated; quality control; sea surface temperature; the South China Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961822883"

A straightforward and cost-efficient bathymetry mapping of the Indonesian coral reef is urgently needed. To address this problem, we present a generalized multispectral bathymetry estimation formula that requires few field measurement data to adjust coefficients. The simulation dataset corresponding to the Indonesian coral reef and Worldview-2 Imagery spectral response was built to extract the coefficient. Then, the formula was validated using real Worldview-2 images from three shallow coral reef sites: the Gili Mantra islands, Menjangan Island, and Gondol Beach in Indonesia. During the evaluation of the dataset simulation, the formulated equation was tested; it achieved an adjusted R2 of 0.93 and an RMSR (Root Mean Square Residual) of 0.9 m. Such results show the good quality of our generalized bathymetry formula. Moreover, we tested the described formula using the imagery. The Gili islands shows that the best estimations of the depth corresponded to 0.62 and 1.5 m for R2 and RMSR, respectively. In the shallow areas, the depth estimation was accurate, but the error gradually increased with depth. The depth estimation for the Menjangan and Gondol sites failed (R2 ≤ 0.1), mostly because of a high image noise. In conclusion, the formula was able to estimate the depth accurately in a shallow water area using the least noisy image, but its error increased with depth. © 2016 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrophilicity; Quality control; Reefs; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Coral reef; Indonesia; Lyzenga; Multi-spectral; Simulation data; Worldview-2; Hydrographic surveys","Coral Reef; Indonesia; Lyzenga; Multispectral Bathymetry; Simulation data; Worldview-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011271390"

The segmentation is performed by an unsupervised mixture-of-Gaussian segmentation algorithm utilizing six features extracted from the polarimetric data. After segmentation, the segments are contextually smoothed. One segmented image is manually labelled based on in situ data and expert knowledge. Using this scene as reference, we consider two strategies for class labelling of the other scenes. The first manually labels the classes based on visual inspection of the reference; the second utilizes various statistical distance measures to automatically assign each unknown class to the statistically nearest reference class. These two scenes are also classified pixel-wise by a supervised classification algorithm based on the reference data. Poor classification results are obtained when the incidence angle is very different from the reference scene. Similar viewing geometries reveal good classification and labelling results, the latter regardless of the distance measure used.","Arctic Ocean; algorithm; image classification; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; segmentation; smoothing; synthetic aperture radar","Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932631150"

L-band radiometry has been shown to provide information on the thickness of thin sea ice. Here, we apply a new emission model that has previously been used to investigate the impact of snow on thick Arctic sea ice. The model has not yet been used to retrieve ice thickness. In contrast to previous SMOS ice thickness retrievals, the new model allows us to include a snow layer in the brightness temperature simulations. Using ice thickness estimations from satellite thermal imagery, we simulate brightness temperatures during the ice growth season 2011 in the northern Baltic Sea. In both the simulations and the SMOS observations, brightness temperatures increase by more than 20 K, most likely due to an increase of ice thickness. Only if we include the snow in the model, the absolute values of the simulations and the observations agree well (mean deviations below 3.5 K). In a second comparison, we use high-resolution measurements of total ice thickness (sum of ice and snow thickness) from an electromagnetic (EM) sounding system to simulate brightness temperatures for 12 circular areas. While the SMOS observations and the simulations that use the EM modal ice thickness are highly correlated (r2=0.95), the simulated brightness temperatures are on average 12 K higher than observed by SMOS. This would correspond to an 8-cm overestimation of the modal ice thickness by the SMOS retrieval. In contrast, if the simulations take into account the shape of the EM ice thickness distributions (r2=0.87), the mean deviation between simulated and observed brightness temperatures is below 0.1 K. © 2015 N.

Ice thickness is one of the most important parameters of sea ice. In thin ice areas, the heat flux of ice is strongly affected by the ice thickness difference. Thus, the extraction of thin ice area is quite important from global warming monitoring point of view. In 2014, the authors have developed an algorithm to detect thin ice area in the Sea of Okhotsk using the brightness temperature data derived from the passive microwave radiometer AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 satellite. The basic algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR2 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 19GHz V polarization. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of applying the thin ice algorithm to the Bering Sea. Since the Bering Sea is located in higher latitude than the Okhotsk Sea, some parameter tuning of the algorithm was expected. The authors have examined the parameter of the algorithm and have verified the result by overlaying the extracted thin ice area on simultaneously observed MODIS images taken under the cloudless weather condition.

Our work produced data on a spatial and temporal variability of internal waves of non-tidal origin via their surface manifestations. By using high-resolution satellite data, we were able to get a clear picture of generation, propagation and interaction of internal wave packets and significantly broadened our insights on the physics and geography of internal waves in the World Ocean. The large amount of the data available allowed us to make some generalizations and obtain statistically significant results on a spatial and temporal variability of various internal wave surface manifestations in satellite images. We discovered numerous diverse instances of internal wave manifestations in satellite images of the Caspian Sea. We further demonstrated that this observed diversity of internal wave behavior is due to a diversity of their generation mechanisms and indicates the complexity of the dynamic environment in the region. We put together a detailed map of spatial distribution of surface manifestations of the internal waves in the Caspian Sea. We revealed a seasonal and inter-annual variability of wave activity, identified main regions of the internal wave localization for each season and revealed causes of a spatial inhomogenity of internal wave packet manifestations. Possible factors leading to the generation of non-tidal internal waves are determined on the basis of joint analysis of available satellite remote sensing data of the sea surface in microwave, visible (VIS) and infra-red (IR) ranges complemented by contact measurements. © 2016 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Wave packets; Caspian sea; High resolution satellite data; Interannual variability; Internal waves; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite remote sensing data; Sea surfaces; Spatial and temporal variability; Oceanography","Internal waves; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surface; Synthetic aperture radar; The Caspian Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011256312"

The autumn season (September-November) was chosen for investigating as the period of intensification of mesoscale cyclogenesis in EEA. Mesocyclones were identified in the fields of surface wind vector from NCEP-CFSR high resolution reanalysis data and in cloud signatures in visible and infrared images of Terra/Aqua MODIS. The conditions of their formation and development were assessed by surface analysis and baric topography synoptic maps of NOAA National Climatic Data Center and ERA Interim reanalysis. Quantitative estimates of oceanic and atmospheric parameters were obtained from satellite microwave measurements using original algorithms. Comprehensive analysis of multisensory satellite data and the reanalysis revealed that the dependence of mesocyclonic activity on changes in ice cover area was clearly expressed for the Laptev and East Siberian Seas and virtually non-existent for the Kara and Chukchi Seas. Unlike other regions, the peak of mesoscale cyclogenesis is shifted from the winter months to October. Mesocyclones over the EEA occur despite lower convective instability of the atmosphere as compared to other regions of mesoscale cyclogenesis. It can be assumed that the contribution of baroclinic instability of the atmospheric boundary layer during their formation prevails over the contribution of convection.","","Cloud liquid water; Eastern Arctic; Mesocyclones; Multisensory; Reanalysis; Remote sensing; Satellite; Sea surface wind; Water vapor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997419159"

This is compared with an empirical record based on the generalized observations of the summer albedo progression along with melt onset dates determined from remote sensing. Only the contributions to albedo from ice, snow, and ponds are analyzed; fractional ice area is not considered in this assessment. Key factors dictating summer albedo evolution are the timing and extent of ponding and accumulation of snow. The CCSM4 summer sea ice albedo decline was found, on average, to be less pronounced than either the empirical record or the CLARA-SAL satellite record. The modeled ice albedo does not go as low as the empirical record, nor does the low summer albedo last as long. In the model, certain summers were found to retain snow on sea ice, thus inhibiting ice surface melt and the formation or retention of melt ponds. These ""frozen"" summers were generally not the summers with the largest spring snow accumulation, but were instead summers that received at least trace snowfall in June or July. When these frozen summers are omitted from the comparison, the model and empirical records are in much better agreement. This suggests that the representation of summer Arctic snowfall events and/or their influence on the sea ice conditions are not well represented in CCSM4 integrations, providing a target for future model development work. © 2014.

This provides the first systematic validation of CS-2 in the coastal Antarctic and offers insight into the assumptions currently used to process CS-2 data. European Space Agency Level 2 (ESAL2) data are compared with results of a Waveform Fitting (WfF) procedure and a Threshold-First-Maximum-Retracker-Algorithm employed at 40%(TFMRA40). A supervised freeboard retrieval procedure is used to reduce errors associated with sea surface height identification and radar velocity in snow. We find ESAL2 freeboards located between the ice and snow freeboard rather than the frequently assumed snow/ice interface. WfF is within 0.04m of the ice freeboard but is influenced by variable snow conditions causing increased radar backscatter from the air/snow interface. Given such snow conditions and additional uncertainties in sea surface height identification, a positive bias of 0.14 m away from the ice freeboard is observed. TFMRA40 freeboards are within 0.03 m of the snow freeboard. The separation of freeboard estimates is primarily driven by the different assumptions of each retracker, although waveform alteration by variations in snow properties and surface roughness is evident. Techniques are amended where necessary, and automatic freeboard retrieval procedures for ESAL2, WfF and TFMRA40 are presented. CS-2 detects annual fastice freeboard trends using all three automatic procedures that are in line with known sea-ice growth rates in the region. © 2015, International Glaciology Society.

Its monitoring has become a routine task for the maritime sector. Remote sensing, which depends mainly on SAR and optical sensors, has become the primary means for sea-ice research. Optical images contain abundant sea-ice multi-spectral information, whereas SAR images contain rich sea-ice texture information. If the characteristic advantages of SAR and optical images could be combined for sea-ice study, the ability of sea-ice monitoring would be improved. In this study, in accordance with the characteristics of sea-ice SAR and optical images, the transformation and fusion methods for these images were chosen. Also, a fusion method of optical and SAR images was proposed in order to improve sea-ice identification. Texture information can play an important role in sea-ice classification. Haar wavelet transformation was found to be suitable for the sea-ice SAR images, and the texture information of the sea-ice SAR image from Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) loaded on ENVISAT was documented. The results of our studies showed that, the optical images in the hue-intensity-saturation (HIS) space could reflect the spectral characteristics of the sea-ice types more efficiently than in the red-green-blue (RGB) space, and the optical image from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-02B) was transferred from the RGB space to the HIS space. The principal component analysis (PCA) method could potentially contain the maximum information of the sea-ice images by fusing the HIS and texture images. The fusion image was obtained by a PCA method, which included the advantages of both the sea-ice SAR image and the optical image. To validate the fusion method, three methods were used to evaluate the fused image, i.e., objective, subjective, and comprehensive evaluations. It was concluded that the fusion method proposed could improve the ability of image interpretation and sea-ice identification. © 2015, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","HIS transform; optical remote sensing image; PCA method; SAR remote sensing image; sea ice; wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924975294"

One of the algorithms that combines both observations is the Environmental Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE). However, factors such as ridging, snow wetness and metamorphism can cause significant changes in brightness temperature and backscatter, leading to misidentification of FYI as MYI, hence increasing the estimated MYI concentrations suddenly. This study introduces a correction scheme to restore the MYI concentrations under these conditions. The correction utilizes ice drift records to constrain the MYI changes and uses two thresholds of passive microwave radiometric parameters to account for snow wetness and metamorphism. The correction is applied to MYI concentration retrievals from ECICE with inputs from QuikSCAT and AMSR-E observations, acquired over the Arctic region in a series of winter seasons (October to May) from 2002 to 2009. Qualitative comparison with the Radarsat-1 SAR images and quantitative comparison against results from previous studies show that the correction works well by removing the anomalous high MYI concentrations. On average, the correction reduces the estimated MYI area by 5.2 × 105 km2 (14.3%) except for the April-May time frame, when the reduction is larger as the warmer weather prompts the condition of the anomalous snow radiometric signature. Due to the long-lasting (i.e., from one to several weeks) effect of the warm spells on FYI, the correction could be important in climatological research and operational applications. © 2016 by the authors.","Ocean currents; Radiometry; Sea ice; Snow; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic sea ice; ECICE; Ice concentration; Ice drift; Microwave remote sensing; Multi-year ices; Remote sensing","Arctic sea ice; ECICE; Ice concentration; Ice drift; Microwave remote sensing; Multiyear ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971473482"

In situ observations needed for validation of remote sensing data and sea-ice models are limited; most have been restricted to a few point measurements on selected ice floes, or to visual shipboard estimates. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) floe-scale maps of sea-ice draft for ten floes, compiled from two springtime expeditions by an autonomous underwater vehicle to the near-coastal regions of the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Wilkes Land sectors of Antarctica. Mean drafts range from 1.4 to 5.5 m, with maxima up to 16 m. We also find that, on average, 76% of the ice volume is deformed ice. Our surveys indicate that the floes are much thicker and more deformed than reported by most drilling and ship-based measurements of Antarctic sea ice. We suggest that thick ice in the near-coastal and interior pack may be under-represented in existing in situ assessments of Antarctic sea ice and hence, on average, Antarctic sea ice may be thicker than previously thought. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Predicting the cumulative impact of these stressors requires an improved understanding of the factors affecting ecological resilience. In September of 1999, a severe storm surge in the Mackenzie Delta flooded alluvial surfaces up to 30 km inland from the coast with saline waters, driving environmental impacts unprecedented in the last millennium. In this study we combined field monitoring of permanent sampling plots with an analysis of the Landsat archive (1986-2011) to explore the factors affecting the recovery of ecosystems to this disturbance. Soil salinization following the 1999 storm caused the abrupt dieback of more than 30 000 ha of tundra vegetation. Vegetation cover and soil chemistry show that recovery is occurring, but the rate and spatial extent are strongly dependent on vegetation type, with graminoid- and upright shrub-dominated areas showing recovery after a decade, but dwarf shrub tundra exhibiting little to no recovery over this period. Our analyses suggest that recovery from salinization has been strongly influenced by vegetation type and the frequency of freshwater flooding following the storm. With increased ocean storm activity, rising sea levels, and reduced sea ice cover, Arctic coastal ecosystems will be more likely to experience similar disturbances in the future, highlighting the importance of combining field sampling with regional-scale remote sensing in efforts to detect, understand, and anticipate environmental change. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America","Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Plants; Rivers; Seawater; Soil; Spacecraft; Time Factors; Water Movements; Arctic Bay; Baffin Island; Canada; Nunavut; Seawater; Soil; alluvial plain; anthropogenic effect; climate change; delta; environmental assessment; environmental change; Landsat; salinization; soil chemistry; vegetation type; arctic regions; chemistry; classification; climate change; environment; environmental monitoring; Plants; Rivers; Soil; Spacecraft; Time Factors; Water Movements","Climate change; Disturbance; Ecosystem recovery; Mackenzie delta; Resilience; Saline incursion; Storm surge","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922017722"

Varying the percentage (P) of elevations used to approximate the instantaneous sea-surface height can cause widespread changes of a few to >10 cm in the total freeboard obtained. Other input parameters have a smaller influence on the overall mean total freeboard but can cause large regional differences. These results, together with published ICESat elevation precision and accuracy, suggest that three times the mean per gridcell single-laser-shot error budget can be used as an estimate for freeboard uncertainty. Theoretical relative ice thickness uncertainty ranges between 20% and 80% for typical freeboard and snow properties. Ice thickness is computed from total freeboard using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) snow depth data.

Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset. ©2016. American Geophysical Union.

This anomalous air mass resulted in a large and positive flux of energy into the surface via the residual of the surface energy balance (SEB), compared to the weakly negative SEB from the surface to the atmosphere expected for that time of year. The magnitude of the downwelling longwave radiation during the event was unprecedented compared to all other events detected by AIRS in December/January since 2003.

Freezing of the melange-covered fjord surface during winter is indicated by a decrease in fjord surface temperatures and is associated with (1) a decrease in ice melange mobility and (2) a drastic reduction in iceberg production. Vigorous calving resumes in spring, typically abruptly, following the steady up-fjord retreat of the sea-ice/ice-melange margin. An analysis of pixel displacement from time-lapse imagery demonstrates that melange motion increases prior to calving and subsequently decreases following several events. We find that secular changes in ice melange extent, character and persistence can influence iceberg calving, and therefore glacier dynamics over daily-to-monthly timescales, which, if sustained, will influence the mass balance of an ice sheet. © 2015, International Glaciology Society.

Recent studies have highlighted the need to develop new in situ technology for monitoring ocean acidification, but the potential capabilities of space-based measurements remain largely untapped. Routine measurements from space can provide quasi-synoptic, reproducible data for investigating processes on global scales; they may also be the most efficient way to monitor the ocean surface.

Suspended matter concentration and integral water turbidity were estimated based on data from MODIS, MERIS, ETM+, TM and OLI sensors. The study was performed for two regions with very different characteristics: the semi-enclosed Gulf of GdaÅ.,sk of the Baltic Sea and eastern part of the Black Sea. It is shown that the plume fraction with highest suspended matter concentration of the lowland River Vistula spreads primarily under the impact of wind. Low concentration plume fraction is driven by the longshore current. In case of extraordinary floods, turbid Vistula waters spread in the upper sea layer almost all over the Gulf. The situation in the eastern part of the Black Sea with its narrow shoal and abrupt shelf edge wherein flow highly turbid mountain rivers is quite different. Here, the dominating role is played by runoff. Its intensity determines both plume shape and dimensions. A strong easterly wind can change plume configuration, cause formation of jet-like plumes. © 2015 SPIE.","Coastal zones; Fighter aircraft; Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Baltic sea; Black sea; ENVISAT; LANDSAT; River plume; Satellite observations; Suspended matters; Remote sensing","Baltic Sea; Black Sea; coastal zone; Envisat; Landsat; river plume; satellite observations; suspended matter","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961773439"

The current potential of available remote sensing products is far from being exploited due to limited usability for non-experts. Main usability aspects are data unification, automated processing and ordering, early availability, smaller data packages and improved visualization functions. The OSSI (=On Site Sea-ice Information) data stream was developed to address these issues. OSSI is characterized by 100% automation, a modular structure designed for implementation of any data product, data compression and a ""with one order many data"" principle. Improvement of the availability of information needed for navigation or other activities in ice covered areas can be achieved for some remote sensing data by the usage of single swath data in comparison to daily composites. For instance, swath sea-ice concentration data is capable of visualizing sub-daily variations in the sea-ice cover, such as tidal effects or changes in ice concentration in highly variable ice-edge zones. Furthermore, swath data is made available within 2 hours of acquisition; whereas daily composites are sent on board with a more than 24 hour delay. © 2015, Offshore Technology Conference.","Decision making; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Automated processing; Current potential; Daily variations; Ice concentration; Modular structures; Remote sensing data; Sea ice concentration; Visualization functions; Data visualization","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051521752"

Many types of cloud-free, high-spatial, and temporal coverage merged SST products have been generated by the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature. These products provide important data sources that can be used in a wide variety of operational and scientific applications. However, differences are existed among these products, due to their specific research requirements, different blending algorithms, different satellite SST sources for blending, and quality control methods. Therefore, monitoring the quality of these products is necessary, particularly at shelf and coastal seas around China, which are characterized by complex atmospheric conditions and hydrodynamics. This study compares four types of merged SST products in the South China Sea and adjacent waters in the years 2008 and 2009. Four multi-satellite merged SST products-the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA), microwave/infrared optimally interpolated SST, microwave optimally interpolated SST, and new generation SST (NGSST)-are validated with the Argo SST in the shelf sea and Argos SST in the shallow coast. The match-up data are collected on the same day and location. The Root Mean Square (RMS), bias, and correlation coefficients are calculated and used to quantify the errors. These products are projected into the same grid of NGSST using the nearest-neighbor sampling method for comparison. OSTIA is selected as the basis, and the relative differences between OSTIA and the other three products are computed and visualized using maps, box-plot, and time series plots. The statistical results show that the RMS between the merged SSTs and Argo temperature ranged between 0.3 ℃ and 1.0 ℃, whereas the bias ranged between -0.1 ℃ and 0.6 ℃ in the shelf sea (water depth >80 m). The other three merged SSTs were consistent with the in situ data in the coastal area, except for NGSST, which had a significantly warm bias (-1 ℃)and the largest RMS (-1.5 ℃). The bias and RMS of OSTIA were the smallest. An inter-comparison indicates no significant differences among the four merged SST products in the shelf sea. Their biases were within ±0.3 ℃. However, the deviation increases in shallow water. The largest bias was found in winter because of the poor weather conditions, whereas the smallest bias was found in summer. In summary, the four merged SST products were consistent with in situ data in the study region, except for the NGSST in the shallow coastal sea and the OSTIA product exhibited the best performance. This study has provided a reliable basis for the effective application of these merged SSTs with high spatial and temporal coverage in the South China Sea and its adjacent waters. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Unfortunately, VIIRS, unlike MODIS, does not have a 678 nm channel to detect Chlorophyll fluorescence, which is used with MODIS in the normalized fluorescence height (nFLH) algorithm which has been shown to help in effectively detecting and tracking KB HABs. We present here the use of neural network (NN) algorithms for KB HABS retrievals in the WFS. These NNs, previously reported by us, were trained, using a wide range of suitably parametrized synthetic data typical of coastal waters, to form a multiband inversion algorithm which models the relationship between Rrs values at the 486, 551 and 671nm VIIRS bands against the values of phytoplankton absorption (aph), CDOM absorption (ag), non-algal particles (NAP) absorption (aNAP) and the particulate backscattering bbp coefficients, all at 443nm, and permits retrievals of these parameters. We use the NN to retrieve aph443 in the WFS. The retrieved aph443 values are then filtered by applying known limiting conditions on minimum Chlorophyll concentration [Chla] and low backscatter properties associated with KB HABS in the WFS, thereby identifying, delineating and quantifying the aph443 values, and hence [Chl] concentrations representing KB HABS. Comparisons with in-situ measurements and other techniques including MODIS nFLH confirm the viability of both the NN retrievals and the filtering approaches devised. © 2015 SPIE.","Algae control; Algorithms; Backscattering; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Hydrophilicity; Infrared imaging; Neural networks; Oceanography; Phytoplankton; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Thermography (imaging); CDOM; Florida; Harmful algal blooms; Karenia brevis; Ocean color; Remote sensing","CDOM; Chlorophyll retrieval; harmful algal blooms; Karenia brevis (KB); neural networks; ocean color; phytoplankton; West Florida Shelf","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961773036"

In situ measured albedo plays an essential role by providing ground truth reference for remote sensing monitoring of albedo at large scale. Such measurements with portable and fixed-location spectroradiometers were conducted in one 12-day (long-term) and several short-term (3-4 hours) ice stations over the Pacific Arctic sector during the summer 2010 Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE). Results show that the wavelength-integrated albedo across 350 to 2200 nm of bare ice was ∼0.56 to 0.68 in the lower latitudes and marginal ice zone, while albedo of snow-covered ice reduced from 0.75-0.86 to 0.42-0.61 during the mid-August period of the 12-day ice station (86°48′N to 87°20′N). The albedo variation and evolution of melt ponds were examined with details during the 12-day ice station.

Such rapid decreasing of snow and sea ice albedo and evident difference between the pack ice zone and marginal ice zone may contribute to the surface albedo feedback and rapidly shrinking summer sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean. © 2015 Regents of the University of Colorado.","Arctic Ocean; China; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); albedo; arctic environment; cruise report; ice retreat; monitoring system; remote sensing; research program; sea ice; snow cover; snowmelt; snowpack; spectrometer","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946020727"

Sea ice contains pores and channels forming a network of effective porosity. During the growth season (October-March) oil becomes entrained and encapsulated in the ice quickly and remains trapped in the ice as a relatively static and discrete layer. With increasing ice temperature in spring, the interconnectivity of the pores increases and gives rise to movement of oil to the surface. To enhance understanding of oil distribution in sea ice, laboratory experiments of oil in ice were conducted. The ice was imaged with 3-D synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography (SRμCT), a non-destructive method ideally to obtain accurate measurements. An understanding of these processes is a prerequisite for optimal timing of oil spill clean-up as well as the interpretation of remote sensing data.

ATM and LVIS lidar waveforms were fitted with Gaussian curves to calculate pulsewidth, peak location, pulse amplitude, and signal baseline. For each waveform, the centroid, skewness, kurtosis, and pulse area were also calculated. Received waveform parameters, such as pulsewidth, pulse amplitude, pulse area, skewness, and kurtosis, show coherent response to variations of geophysical features along an ATM or LVIS profile. These parameters, combined with elevation, were used to identify leads in sea-ice freeboard calculation. The relationship between these parameters and sea-ice freeboard and surface features were studied by comparing the parameters with ATM and LVIS-derived freeboard and coincident Digital Mapping System images which have been used to classify sea-ice surface types such as leads, thin ice, gray ice, and thick ice. An elevation bias of more than 16 cm (peak-to-peak) as a function of laser scanner azimuth was found in the ATM data, and an empirical correction was applied; this correction will improve the ATM shot-to-shot freeboard significantly. The newly derived ATM freeboard was compared with the current IceBridge IDCSI2 freeboard product at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the freeboard derived from LVIS data.

This study is based upon both in situ (2003, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and satellite (2002-2010) data, during the austral summer. A thermohaline front was predominately observed between the colder and saltier waters under the influence of transitional water with Weddell Sea influence (TWW) in the southeastern BS, and the fresher and warmer waters associated with the presence of transitional water with Bellingshausen Sea influence (TBW) in the northwestern BS. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the dominance of microplanktonic diatoms was associated with higher Chl-. a within shallow upper mixed layers, with relatively strong pycnocline in the TBW, particularly close to the South Shetland Islands (SSI). Conversely, the TWW was primarily characterized by lower Chl-. a within deeper mixed layers or a well-mixed water column and dominated by nanoplanktonic flagellates (including haptophytes and cryptophytes). Spatial variability based on both in situ and satellite data suggests that the Bransfield Strait acts as a typical Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ) and the phytoplankton community there is governed by a combination of processes acting synergistically: the sea ice retreat, allowing for a penetration of light into the water column, and a relatively shallow upper mixed layer with strong pycnocline, primarily in the TBW, retaining organisms near the surface when light conditions are adequate. Interannual variability in Chl-. a and species composition indicate an alternation between diatom-dominated and flagellate-dominated assemblages. These shifts are potentially related to the different stages of phytoplankton succession, as a result of varying water column physical features, principally influenced by the dynamic occupation of the TBW and TWW, that appear to modulate phytoplankton dynamics within the BS. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Antarctica; Bransfield Strait; South Shetland Islands; Chlorophyll; Oceanography; Satellites; Sea ice; Antarctic Peninsula; Chlorophyll a; Dissolved macronutrients; Satellite remote sensing; Water columns; annual variation; biomass; chlorophyll a; diatom; phytoplankton; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial variation; thermohaline structure; water column; Phytoplankton","Antarctic Peninsula; Chlorophyll-a; Dissolved macronutrients; Phytoplankton; Satellite remote sensing; Water column structure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908093809"

Thin-ice thicknesses were calculated from MODIS ice-surface temperatures combined with ECMWF ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis data in an energy-balance model. Associated quantities like polynya area and total ice production were derived and compared to previous remote sensing and modeling studies. A basic coverage-correction scheme was applied to account for cloud gaps in the daily composites. On average, both polynya area and ice production are thereby increased by about 30%. The sea ice in the Storfjorden area experiences a late fall freeze-up in several years over the 12-winter period, which becomes most apparent through an increasing frequency of large thin-ice areas until the end of December. In the course of an average winter season, ice thicknesses below 10 cm are dominating within the Storfjorden basin. During the regarded period, the mean polynya area is 4555.7 ± 1542.9 km2. Maximum daily ice production rates can reach as high as 26 cm d-1, while the average ice production is estimated at 28.3 ± 8.5 km3 per winter and therefore lower than in previous studies. Despite this comparatively short record of 12 winter seasons, a significant positive trend of 20.2 km3 per decade could be detected, which originates primarily from a delayed freeze-up in November and December in recent winter seasons. This contrasts earlier reports of a slightly negative trend in accumulated ice production prior to 2002. Although featuring more pronounced interannual variations between 2004/2005 and 2011/2012, our estimates underline the importance of this relatively small coastal polynya system considering its contribution to the cold halocline layer through salt release during ice-formation processes. In addition, calculated quasi-daily thin-ice thickness charts represent a valuable data set for atmosphere and ocean modeling applications. © Author(s) 2015.","Arctic; Barentsoya; Edgeoya; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; energy balance; ice thickness; MODIS; polynya; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea ice; seasonality; spatiotemporal analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930200341"

We analyse the quality of sea-ice motion fields derived from SAR data, using an example dataset from the Weddell Sea region. We apply a quality indicator for sea-ice motion fields which is independent of field data and evaluate it with reference data obtained from visual analysis of the SAR images. Together with the motion field, sea-ice deformation can also be retrieved from SAR data. Similarly to ice motion, it is very difficult to obtain field data to evaluate the quality of the results. Based on a manually derived reference dataset, we introduce a method to validate the retrieved deformation rates. This procedure requires no additional field data.

We identified frazil ice-like signals in the IPS data down to 5-15 m depth, associated with large heat loss and windy, turbulent conditions in an active polynya. This likely represents the first IPS observation of frazil ice in the marine environment. On the day of the maximum signal of frazil ice, spaceborne synthetic aperture radar shows streaks of high backscatter within the polynya, indicating active frazil ice formation just downwind of the mooring sites. In addition, the longerterm potential supercooling that persisted for 1-3 weeks occurred twice despite the absence of polynya activity at the mooring sites. These events occurred during periods dominated by the northeastward current. A series of coastal polynyas had formed southwest of the mooring sites prior to these events.

The Ross seal is the least studied of the Antarctic seal species and nothing was previously known about their behaviour in the Amundsen Sea. During almost 1 year, their movements, haul out behaviour and time spent at different temperatures were logged. By comparing their movements with daily ice maps, distances to the ice edge were calculated, and seals dependence on sea ice for resting, breeding and moulting was analysed. The tagged seals spent on average 70.8 % (range 66.8–77.8 %) of their time in the water and hauled out mainly during the moult in December–January, and in late October–mid-November during breeding. During the pelagic period, they were on average 837.5 km (range 587–1,282 km) from the ice edge indicating a fully pelagic life during several months. Their pelagic behaviour suggests that Ross seals, although being an ice obligate species, may adapt comparatively easy to climate change involving ice melting and recession and thereby potentially being less sensitive to the reduction of sea ice than other Antarctic seal species. Although nothing is known about their mating behaviour, they appear to be relatively stationary during moulting and breeding, hence requiring a small ice surface. Although previous studies in other parts of Antarctica have found similar results, still many questions remain about this peculiar species. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Amundsen Sea; Antarctica; Southern Ocean; Ommatophoca rossii; Argo; biotelemetry; climate change; data set; haulout behaviour; pinniped; remote sensing; sea ice","Amundsen Sea; Argos satellite telemetry; Climate change; Haul out pattern; Ice edge; Remote sensing; Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii); Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924759897"

Reduced sea ice coverage may open up the Arctic to further exploration of maritime activities, particularly during the summer months. Given such changes, it is important to investigate differences between available sea ice drift products. Products based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radar scatterometer, and radiometer are compared for both motion speed and direction within this study. Two C-band SAR and one L-band SAR product are used in the comparison. Differences in temporal and spatial resolutions of the drift estimates spanning from July 2010 until June 2011 are investigated. High temporal and spatial resolution was proven useful to fully capture the sea ice drift in the Fram Strait. For summer coverage, SAR data are a prerequisite and L-band is desirable. The two C-band SAR products have a mean speed correlation of 0.90 and exhibit high conformity, despite being generated by separate processing methods. The L-band SAR product and the scatterometer and radiometer products are to a lower degree in agreement with each other and the C-band SAR products, which may be attributed to the products' dependency on the temporal baseline. Depending on the choice of sensor or combination of sensors, the resulting 12-month mean drift varies between 0.09 and 0.12 m/s excluding L-band SAR. The latter shows a particularly low drift of 0.05 m/s, which we attribute to an over-representation of slow ice. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Radar; Radiometers; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic sea ice; Drift estimates; Maritime activities; Processing method; Scatterometers; Sea-ice drift; Summer months; Temporal and spatial; comparative study; ice cover; ice drift; radiometer; sea ice; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Ice","Radiometry; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84970910115"

The observed spatial extent, shape and orientation of the plume are indicative of the respective river discharge. A new method of reconstructing the volume of river discharge using satellite imagery and numerical modelling is presented in this article. At the first step of the procedure, we use a high resolution satellite image of the coastal area adjacent to the examined river estuary to identify the buoyant plume. Then a number of required river, atmospheric and sea parameters (including river discharge) are prescribed for the hydrological model to simulate the spread of river discharge under this configuration.

The sea-ice statistics given by the floe size distribution, being an important parameter for climate and wave- and structure-ice analysis, is challenging to calculate due to difficulties in ice floe identification, particularly the separation of seemingly connected ice floes. In this paper, the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake algorithm is applied to solve this problem. To evolve the GVF snake algorithm automatically, an initialization based on the distance transform is proposed to detect individual ice floes, and the morphological cleaning is afterward applied to smoothen the shape of each identified ice floe. Based on the identification result, the image is separated into four different layers: ice floes, brash pieces, slush, and water. This makes it further possible to present a color map of the ice floes and brash pieces based on sizes, and the corresponding ice floe size distribution histogram. The proposed algorithm yields an acceptable identification result, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in a case study.

The results show that the relative emissivity of smooth sea ice decreases along with increasing viewing zenith angle, and the shape of the relative emissivity curve is similar to that of an ideal plane. Affected by parameters such as roughness and surface temperature distribution, the anisotropy of relative emissivity of sea ice with a high degree of roughness is stronger relative to the cosine emitter.

We find that (i) floe size follows a distribution that can be characterized with good approximation by a single length scale δl, which we discuss in the framework of stochastic fragmentation models, and (ii) the deviation of their shape from circularity is reproduced with remarkable precision by a geometric model of coalescence by freezing, based on random Voronoi tessellations, with a single free parameter expressing the shape disorder.

Although several studies have investigated Arctic inversion characteristics such as height, depth, and frequency, there are significant challenges for long-term climate monitoring mainly due to limited sampling over the ocean and/or poor resolution of available observations. This study investigates the Arctic temperature inversion during the cold season using the high-resolution refractivity profiles from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) radio occultation (RO). For the coldest and driest months in the Arctic, a reliable retrieval technique for boundary layer properties, such as inversion height and surface-based inversion (SBI) frequency, is developed. We find that these variables have a strong negative relationship over the Arctic Ocean and are well correlated in the time and space domain. The spatial patterns show a minimum inversion height (maximum SBI frequency) over the ice-covered Pacific sector of the ocean similar to that observed in past studies. Seasonal evolution of the inversion characteristics suggests a surface temperature control over the sea ice region, with the peak in SBI frequency occurring during the transition period from winter to spring. There is little diurnal variability in the mean inversion height during the cold season. Despite its limitations, the RO refractivity profile is found quite useful for monitoring the Arctic boundary layer, including interannual variability of inversion characteristics. © 2015.

They can influence energy and heat exchange between the ocean, ice, and atmosphere, as well as human activities. In this paper, the LINE module of Geomatics 2015 software was used to automatically extract tidal cracks in fast ice regions near the Chinese Zhongshan Station in East Antarctica from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data with resolutions of 15 m (panchromatic band 8) and 30 m (multispectral bands 1-7). The detected tidal cracks were determined based on matching between the output from the LINE module and manually-interpreted tidal cracks in OLI images. The ratio of the length of detected tidal cracks to the total length of interpreted cracks was used to evaluate the automated detection method. Results show that the vertical direction gradient is a better input to the LINE module than the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance input for estimating the presence of cracks, regardless of the examined resolution. Data with a resolution of 15 m also gives better results in crack detection than data with a resolution of 30 m. The statistics also show that, in the results from the 15-m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 8 performed best with values of the above-mentioned ratio of 50.92 and 31.38 percent using the vertical gradient and the TOA reflectance methods, respectively. On the other hand, in the results from the 30-m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 5 performed best with ratios of 47.43 and 17.8 percent using the same methods, respectively. This implies that Band 8 was better for tidal crack detection than the multispectral fusion data (Bands 1-7), and Band 5 with a resolution of 30 m was best among the multispectral data. The semi-automatic mapping of tidal cracks will improve the safety of vehicles travel in fast ice regimes. © 2016 by the authors.","Automation; Cracks; Ice; Mapping; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Automated detection; LANDSAT; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral fusion; Operational land imager; Safety of vehicles; Sea-level oscillations; Vertical direction; Crack detection","Fast ice; Landsat-8 OLI; Remote sensing; Tidal cracks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962508827"

It is not easy to extract sea ice thickness information from satellite data. In 2012, the authors have developed a method to detect thin ice area using the brightness temperature data derived from the passive microwave sensor AMSR-E onboard Aqua satellite. The basic algorithm is to use the brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR-E 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 37GHz V polarization. In May 2012, AMSR2, the successor of AMSR-E, were successfully launched by JAXA on board GCOM-W1 satellite. Recently, the authors have developed a new method to detect thin ice area using brightness temperature scatter plots of AMSR2 19GHz polarization difference (V-H) vs 19GHz V polarization. It worked quite well in the Sea of Okhotsk with both AMSR2 and AMSR-E data. The authors have calculated the thin ice distribution in the Sea of Okhotsk from 2003 to 2015 using the new method. The result suggested the reduction trend of total sea ice extent from 2003 to 2015 and the increasing trend of thin ice extent from 2009 to 2015.","Luminance; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Microwave sensors; Polarization; Radiometers; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Temperature; Aqua; Brightness temperatures; GCOM-W1; MODIS; Passive microwave sensors; Passive microwaves; Polarization difference; Sea ice distribution; Ice","Aqua; GCOM-W1; MODIS; Passive microwave radiometer; Sea ice","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964047977"

In the present study, multisource remote sensing data for 1979-2012 were analyzed to quantify seasonal, interannual, and spatial changes in sea ice conditions along the NEP. Data for October-November showed that spatially averaged ice thickness in the NEP decreased from 1.2-1.3. m in 2003-2006 to 0.2-0.6 m in 2011-2012. From 1979 to 2012, the fastest decreasing trend in monthly ice concentration occurred in October (-1.76% per year, P< 0.001), when the ice cover starts to increase. As a result of decreasing multiyear sea ice, thinning ice and delayed freeze-up, the spatially averaged length of open period (ice concentration < 50%) increased from 84. days in the 1980s to 114. days in the 2000s and reached 146 days in 2012. The Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian sectors were relatively inaccessible, especially the sector of 90-110°E around the Vilkitsky Strait. However, because of the thinning sea ice prior to the melt season and the enhanced positive polarity of the summer Arctic Dipole Anomaly, these sectors have become more accessible in recent years. The summer sea ice along the high-latitude sea route (HSR) north of the eastern Arctic islands, with a route distance comparable to the NEP, has also decreased during the last decade with the ice-free period reaching 42. days in 2012. The HSR avoids shallow waters along the coast, improving access to the Arctic sea route for deeper-draft vessels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Concentration (process); Freight transportation; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Arctic; Ice concentration; Multisource remote sensing data; Northeast Passage; Positive polarity; Sea ice conditions; Spatial changes; Thickness; concentration (composition); ice cover; ice thickness; remote sensing; sea ice; shipping; Ice","Arctic; Concentration; Northeast Passage; Sea ice; Shipping; Thickness","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940103937"

Physical roughness measurements using ship- and helicopter-based laser systems combined with ship-based active microwave backscattering (C-band polarimetric coherences) and dual-polarized passive microwave emission (polarization ratio, PR and spectral gradient ratios, GR at 37 and 89 GHz) are presented to study diverse sea ice types found in the MIZ. Autocorrelation functions are investigated for different sea ice roughness types. Small-scale roughness classes were discriminated using data from a ship-based laser profiler. The polarimetric coherence parameter ρHHVH, is not found to exhibit any observable sensitivity to the surface roughness for all incidence angles. Rubble-ridges, pancake ice, snow-covered frost flowers, and dense frost flowers exhibit separable signatures using GR-H and GR-V at >70° incidence angles. This paper diagnosed changes in sea ice roughness on a spatial scale of ~0.1-4000 m and on a temporal scale of ~1-240 days (ice freeze-up to summer melt). The coupling of MIZ wave roughness and aerodynamic roughness in conjunction with microwave emission and backscattering are future avenues of research.

The signals, recorded in April-December 2012, came from sources near the edge of the ice shelves, at distances of 230-500km from TROLL. The sources, which moved westward with time, could be associated with four large, tabular icebergs, drifting between 15° E and 8° W. Combining the seismological data with information from satellite remote sensing, we find that one-third of the signals can be attributed to individual icebergs. The trajectories of three of the associated icebergs are known through iceberg-tracking databases, whereas the fourth, a fragment of one of the other three, is untracked, and only scarce information is available from satellite imagery. The observed seismic signals exhibit a wide variety of frequency characteristics, from unstructured episodes to occurrences of iceberg harmonic tremor. Although we are not able to determine the exact cause of the signals, we classify them into five classes on a phenomenological basis.

Two empirical models were developed, one to describe the relationship between the reflectance of visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) imagery and level ice thickness and one to describe the relationship between the backscattering coefficient of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and rough ice thickness. The results showed that the VIS/NIR images were more suitable for distinguishing sea ice from sea water, and the active microwave remote sensing images were suitable for determining the difference between level and rough sea ice. The thickness of the level sea ice was logarithmically related to the VIS/NIR reflectance, and the R2 value of the fitted curve was 0.99 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0 cm. In contrast, the thickness of the rough sea ice was exponentially related to the SAR backscattering coefficient, and the R2 value of the fitted curve was 0.90 with an RMSE of 2.3 cm.

The primary objectives of ICESat-2 will be to measure ice-sheet elevations, sea-ice thickness, and global biomass. However, the 6-beam, green-wavelength photon-counting lidar, combined with the 91-day repeat period and near-polar orbit, may provide unique opportunities to measure coastal bathymetry in remote, poorly-mapped areas of the globe. The study focuses on high-probability bottom returns in Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior, acquired during the ""Transit to KPMD"" MABEL mission in August, 2012 at an AGL altitude of 20,000 m. Water-surface and bottom returns were identified and manually classified using MABEL Viewer, an in-house prototype data-explorer web application. Water-surface returns were observed in 12 green channels, and bottom returns were observed in 10 channels. Comparing each channel's mean water-surface elevation to a regional NOAA Nowcast water-level estimate revealed channel-specific elevation biases that were corrected for in our bathymetry estimation procedure. Additionally, a first-order refraction correction was applied to each bottom return. Agreement between the refraction-corrected depth profile and NOAA data acquired two years earlier by Fugro LADS with the LADS Mk II airborne system indicates that MABEL reliably detected bathymetry in depths up to 8 m, with an RMS difference of 0.7 m. In addition to feeding coastal bathymetry models, MABEL (and potentially ICESat-2 ATLAS) has the potential to seed algorithms for bathymetry retrieval from passive, multispectral satellite imagery by providing reference depths. © 2016 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Ice; Lakes; NASA; Optical radar; Orbits; Photons; Refraction; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Search engines; Water levels; ATLAS; Bathymetric lidars; ICESat-2; Keweenah Bay; MABEL; Photon counting; Bathymetry","ATLAS; Bathymetric lidar; ICESat-2; Keweenah Bay; Lake Superio; MABEL; Photon counting lidar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011265349"

The shape of oil slicks is their important characteristic that can be used to identify the nature of slick signatures in radar or optical images of the sea surface and possibly to describe them quantitatively. Nowadays, however, there is a lack of systematic experiments with slicks, and the very physical mechanisms of slick spreading are still not well understood. This paper presents results of controlled experiments with spills of surfactants, and a possible physical mechanism of slick asymmetry is discussed. Experiments with artificial film slicks were carried out in different environmental conditions: from an Oceanographic Platform on the Black Sea, and from a vessel on the Gorky Water Reservoir. Slick shape and its evolution were studied using photographic methods, and satellite radar imagery. In the satellite experiments surfactants were poured on the surface at certain time intervals before the satellite overpass. It is obtained that film spreading is not axial symmetric, and the spills are stretched along the wind, a long-to-short slick axis ratio weakly depends on spreading time and grows with wind speed. A physical mechanism of slick deformation due to mean surface currents induced by wind waves is proposed. Namely, drift currents induced by oblique propagating surface waves increase in film slicks due to enhanced wave damping and these currents result in reduced spreading rate in the cross wind direction. Theoretical analysis of slick spreading accounting for the effect of surface waves is presented, and theoretical estimates are shown to be consistent with experiment. © 2015 SPIE.","Geometrical optics; Hydrophilicity; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Surface active agents; Surface waters; Surface waves; Tracking radar; Wind; Common features; Controlled experiment; Environmental conditions; Physical mechanism; Satellite radar; Sea surfaces; Surface current; Systematic experiment; Water waves","film spreading; oil slicks on the sea surface; radar/optical observations","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961825389"

The spectral characteristics of each oil are analyzed using the results from these measures. In conjunction with estimated noise thresholds of the sensor environment, the theoretical potential to identify oil is assessed for the hyperspectral Hyperion. The hyperspectral sensor is more sensitive to the crude oil than to diesel under all conditions. The visible and infrared bands, from 468 nm to 933 nm, are more suitable to identify the crude oil. In addition, when the background is pack ice, the infrared region from 1134 nm to 1326 nm is another potential useful zone. Through the visible-to-infrared bands, the sensitivity to the existence of diesel is inferior to that of crude oil. Relatively, the bands greater than 1134 nm have the potential to separate diesel from the water or sea ice. These characteristics and sensitivity of oil film in terms of ice and oil type can be effectively used to select suitable bands to distinguish oils from sea water and sea ice. © 2016 Bingxin Liu et al.","Crude oil; Sea ice; Seawater; diesel fuel; petroleum; sea water; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral sensors; Infrared bands; Infrared regions; Noise thresholds; Oil films; Spectral characteristics; Water surface; Article; hyperspectral sensor; oil spill; pack ice; reflectometry; remote sensing; sea ice; sensitivity analysis; sensor; water sampling; Ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965115201"

The uncertainties in temperature measurement on snow-covered land and sea ice surfaces were examined using in situ data and temperature measurements that were derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and are part of the Terra and Aqua ice-surface temperature and land-surface temperature (LST) standard data products. Following an ~24-h cross-calibration study, two Thermochrons (small temperature-sensing devices) were deployed at each of three field sites: a sea ice site in the Chukchi Sea, a mixed-cover site, and a homogeneous tundra site. At each site, one Thermochron was shielded from direct sunlight and one was left unshielded, and they were placed on top of the snow or ice. The best agreement between the Thermochron- and MODIS-derived temperatures was found between the shielded Thermochrons and the Aqua MODIS LSTs, with an average agreement of 0.6° ± 2.0°C (sample size of 84) at the homogeneous tundra site. The results highlight some uncertainties associated with obtaining consistent air and surface temperature measurements in the harsh Arctic environment, using both in situ and satellite sensors.

The Persian Gulf is a semi-enclosed subtropical sea with high water temperature, extremely high salinity, and an average depth of 50 meters. By the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf is connected to the Gulf of Oman which is significantly affected by the monsoonal winds and by water exchange between the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. Algal blooms occurred frequently in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and some of them are harmful algal blooms which may lead to massive fish death and thereby serious economic loss. Due to the widely spatial coverage and temporal variation, it is difficult to monitoring the dynamic of the algal bloom based on in situ measurement. In this study, we used the remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite to investigate a massive algal bloom event in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman during 2008-2009. The time series of MODIS-derived chlorophyll concentration (Chl-a) indicated that the bloom event with high Chl-a concentration (∼60 percent higher than corresponding climatological data) appeared to lasting more than 8 months from autumn of 2008 to spring of 2009. In addition, the bloom was widespread from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and neighboring open ocean. The MODIS-derived net primary production (NPP) collected from MODIS showed the same trend with Chl-a. Multiple forces including upwelling, dust deposition was taken into account to elucidate the mechanisms for the long-lasting algal bloom. The time series chlorophyll concentration of the Persian Gulf emerges a significant seasonal pattern with maximum concentrations seen during the winter time and lowest during the summer. It also indicated slight disturbances occurred in June (May/July) and December (November/January) in some years. The sea surface temperature and water transparency in the Persian Gulf increased with the rates of 0.3% (<0.01) and 3.02% (p<0.01) during 2003-2014, respectively.

Remote sensed SST imagery has proven to be an effective technique in oceanic eddy detection, because of its high temporal and spatial resolution. Various techniques have been used to identify eddies from SST images. However, mainly owing to the strong morphological variation of oceanic eddies, there is arguably no uniquely correct eddy detection method. A scheme of algorithm based on quasi-contour tracing and clustering of eddy detection from SST dataset is presented. The method does not impose fixed restrictions or limitations during the course of “suspected” eddy detection, and any eddy-like structures can be detected as “suspected” eddies. Then, “true” eddies can be identified based on the combination of intensity and spatial/temporal scale criteria. This approach has been applied to detect eddies in the East China Sea by using Operational SST & Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) dataset. Experiments proved that oceanic eddies ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds of kilometers can be detected. Through investigation of the 2007–2011 OSTIA daily SST dataset from the Kuroshio region in the East China Sea, we found that the most active regions for oceanic eddies are those along the Kuroshio path, northeast of Taiwan Island, the Yangtze Estuary and the Ryukyu Islands. About 86% of the cyclonic eddies and 87% of the anticyclonic eddies have the size of 50–100 km in diameter. Only 25% of the anticyclonic eddy and 26% of the cyclonic eddy have the strength more than 0.4°C in the sea surface layer. © 2015, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","East China Sea; Kuroshio Region; Pacific Ocean; Atmospheric temperature; Error detection; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Anticyclonic eddies; Contour tracing; Morphological variation; Oceanic eddies; quasi-contour clustering; Remote sensing images; Sea surface temperature (SST); Temporal and spatial; detection method; eddy; oceanic circulation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; Oceanography","detection; oceanic eddy; quasi-contour clustering; quasi-contour tracing; sea surface temperature (SST)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949086045"

Some of them drift more southwards up to Newfoundland, where they frequently cross shipping routes. Furthermore, the Arctic summer sea ice coverage significantly decreased over the last three decades. This has attracted numerous attentions from maritime end-users. To keep Arctic shipping routes safe, the monitoring of sea ice and icebergs is crucial. For this purpose, satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is well suited. Equipped with an active radar antenna, SAR satellites provide image data of the ocean and frozen waters independent of weather conditions, cloud cover or absence of daylight. In this paper, we present a processor for sea ice classification and (subsequent) iceberg detection based on TerraSAR-X imagery. In the classification step, texture features are extracted from the images and fed into a neural network, indicating areas of low sea ice concentration. Then, an adapted Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detector is executed in order to detect icebergs. In the end, sea ice boundary and iceberg positions are output. Our experiments deal with HH polarized TerraSAR-X images taken in spring season in the Baffin Bay off the western Greenland coast, where both, sea ice and icebergs are present. Our results exemplify how a comprehensive ice processor with complementary information can be set up for near real time (NRT) service in ice infested waters.","Image classification; Neural networks; Radar antennas; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Remote sensing; Ships; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Weather satellites; CFAR detector; Constant false alarm rate detectors; GLCM feature; Ice-infested waters; Northern latitudes; Sea ice classification; Sea ice concentration; TerraSAR-X; Sea ice","CFAR detector; GLCM features; Iceberg monitoring; Neural network; Sea ice classification; TerraSAR-X","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930391240"

At local scales, deep troughs (or canyons) bisect the continental shelf and act as conduits for warm Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, with reduced seasonal sea ice coverage, and provide a reservoir of macro- and micronutrients. Shoreward of many canyon heads are Adélie penguin breeding colonies; it is hypothesized that these locations reflect improved or more predictable access to higher biological productivity overlying the canyons. To synoptically assess the potential impacts of regional bathymetry on the marine ecosystem, 4 major canyons were identified along a latitudinal gradient west of the Antarctic Peninsula using a highresolution bathymetric database. Biological-physical dynamics above and adjacent to canyons were compared using in situ pigments and satellite-derived sea surface temperature, sea ice and ocean color variables, including chlorophyll a (chl a) and fucoxanthin derived semi-empirically from remote sensing reflectance. Canyons exhibited higher sea surface temperature and reduced sea ice coverage relative to adjacent shelf areas. In situ and satellite-derived pigment patterns indicated increased total phytoplankton and diatom biomass over the canyons (by up to 22 and 35%, respectively), as well as increases in diatom relative abundance (fucoxanthin:chl a). While regional heterogeneity is apparent, canyons appear to support a phytoplankton community that is conducive to both grazing by krill and enhanced vertical export, although it cannot compensate for decreased biomass and diatom relative abundance during low sea ice conditions. © The authors 2015.

These observations are confirmed in this study through analyses of a more robust data set that has been enhanced for better consistency and updated for improved statistics. With reports of anthropogenic global warming such phenomenon appears physically counter intuitive but trend studies of surface temperature over the same time period show the occurrence of a similar asymmetry. Satellite surface temperature data show that while global warming is strong and dominant in the Arctic, it is relatively minor in the Antarctic with the trends in sea ice covered areas and surrounding ice free regions observed to be even negative. A strong correlation of ice extent with surface temperature is observed, especially during the growth season, and the observed trends in the sea ice cover are coherent with the trends in surface temperature. The trend of global averages of the ice cover is negative but modest and is consistent and compatible with the positive but modest trend in global surface temperature. A continuation of the trend would mean the disappearance of summer ice by the end of the century but modelling projections indicate that the summer ice could be salvaged if anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are kept constant at the current level.","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface properties; Anthropogenic global warming; Global; Global surface temperature; Ice-free regions; Strong correlation; Surface temperature changes; Surface temperatures; Trends; Ice","Climate change; Global; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface temperature; Trends","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979620073"

Under the assumption that the topography can be accurately represented by a truncated Fourier series, and given a moving window of measurements along the topography, an observer design is proposed to estimate the parameters of the model. The chosen method ensures an online cutoff of higher wave numbers in the spectrum representing the topography such that sufficient data compression is achieved for transmitting the model parameters through a limited hydroacoustic communication channel. This allows online reconstruction of the underwater drifting ice topography at a remote operation center. The observer is shown to be uniformly globally exponentially stable under a persistency of excitation condition. For comparison, a design based on B-spline basis functions is also presented.

Both strategic and tactical decisions related to drilling and production operations are significantly influenced by the ice detection capabilities. Common ship borne remote sensing systems today include marine radars, optical and thermal infrared sensors. However, a range of adverse environmental factors can dramatically reduce the performance of these systems. Fog, haze, strong wind, snow and rain, waves, along with the Arctic winter nights can create challenging operating conditions. Particularly the detection of relatively small icebergs (namely growlers and bergy bits) in harsh weather conditions often arises as a hazard for marine operations. Remote sensing technology is developing continuously. Several techniques aimed at enhancing sensor performance under poor visibility or in darkness do exist today. Active illumination for example, can be used to compensate for lacking of sufficient external light. This paper presents a review of the current and emerging remote sensing technologies that can be applied for growlers and bergy bits detection under harsh Arctic weather conditions. The frequency range of the ice sensors studied covers parts of the electro-magnetic (EM) spectrum, which include visible light (0.38 to 0.7 μm) and infrared (IR) (0.75 μm to 15μm). Sensing technologies such as LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), hyperspectral imaging, and thermal IR image are evaluated.

We apply and evaluate different lead segmentation techniques based on sea-ice surface temperatures as measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Daily lead composite maps indicate the presence of cloud artifacts that arise from ambiguities in the segmentation process and shortcomings in the MODIS cloud mask. A fuzzy cloud artifact filter is hence implemented to mitigate these effects and the associated potential misclassification of leads. The filter is adjusted with reference data from thermal infrared image sequences, and applied to daily MODIS data from January to April 2008. The daily lead product can be used to deduct the structure and dynamics of wintertime sea-ice leads and to assess seasonal divergence patterns of the Arctic Ocean.","Arctic Ocean; ice cover; infrared imagery; MODIS; polynya; remote sensing; sea ice; seasonal variation; surface temperature","Remote sensing; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932613317"

In our analysis, we found spurious spikes in the snow depth distributions of both the multi-year and seasonal ice covers. These spikes are artifacts that stem from the incorrect identification of side lobes and main lobes of the impulse response of the snow radar as returns from the air-snow interface. The current OIB snow depth retrieval algorithm does not explicitly account for the presence of these side lobes and main lobes. As a result, overall accuracy of snow depth returns and related statistics is negatively affected. Although the range locations of these side lobes are predictable for each radar installation, they vary with individual airborne campaigns. Comparisons with limited in situ snow surveys show significant differences of >20cm between OIB and in situ snow surveys. These artifacts affect OIB ice thickness estimates because they rely on estimates of sea-ice freeboard, which are calculated as the differences between coincident snow freeboard from lidar elevations and the retrieved snow depth estimates discussed here. Since these products are widely distributed to the scientific community, our results suggest that earlier geophysical studies based on these products may need to be re-examined.","Arctic; algorithm; ice cover; ice thickness; radar; remote sensing; sea ice; snow cover","Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Snow/ice surface processes © 2015 California institute of technology. government sponsorship acknowledged","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940389539"

The sea ice in the arctic and the Antarctic has been identified as one of the main proxies to study the climate changes. The rapid sea-ice melting in the Arctic and disappearance of multi-year sea ice has become a matter of concern. The earth system models couple the ocean, atmosphere and sea-ice in order to bring out the possible inter connections between these three very important components and their role in the changing climate. The Indian monsoon is seen to be subjected to nonlinear changes in the recent years. The rapid ice melt in the Arctic sea ice is apparently linked to the changes in the weather and climate of the Indian subcontinent. The recent findings reveal the relation between the high events occurs in the Indian subcontinent and the Arctic sea ice melt episodes. The coupled models are being used in order to study the depth of these relations. However, the models have to be validated extensively by using measured parameters. The satellite measurements of sea-ice starts from way back in 1979. There have been many data sets available since then. Here in this study, an evaluation of the existing data sets is conducted. There are some uncertainties in these data sets. It could be associated with the absence of a single sensor for a long period of time and also the absence of accurate in-situ measurements in order to validate the satellite measurements. © 2016 SPIE.","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Climate models; Earth (planet); Earth atmosphere; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface measurement; Arctic; Coupled modeling; HadISST; Model validation; Monsoon; ReAanlysis; Satellite measurements; Sea ice concentration; Ice","Arctic; Coupled model; HadISST; Model validation; Monsoon; Observation of sea ice; ReAanlysis; Satellite measurements; Sea ice; Sea Ice concentration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006894296"

We studied zooplankton-feeding little auks (Alle alle), a key sentinel species of the Arctic, at their northernmost breeding site in Franz-Josef Land (80°N), Russian Arctic. We tested the hypothesis that little auks still benefit from pristine arctic environmental conditions in this remote area. To this end, we analysed remote sensing data on sea-ice and coastal glacier dynamics collected in our study area across 1979-2013. Further, we recorded little auk foraging behaviour using miniature electronic tags attached to the birds in the summer of 2013, and compared it with similar data collected at three localities across the Atlantic Arctic. We also compared current and historical data on Franz-Josef Land little auk diet, morphometrics and chick growth curves. Our analyses reveal that summer sea-ice retreated markedly during the last decade, leaving the Franz-Josef Land archipelago virtually sea-ice free each summer since 2005. This had a profound impact on little auk foraging, which lost their sea-ice-associated prey. Concomitantly, large coastal glaciers retreated rapidly, releasing large volumes of melt water. Zooplankton is stunned by cold and osmotic shock at the boundary between glacier melt and coastal waters, creating new foraging hotspots for little auks. Birds therefore switched from foraging at distant ice-edge localities, to highly profitable feeding at glacier melt-water fronts within <5 km of their breeding site. Through this behavioural plasticity, little auks maintained their chick growth rates, but showed a 4% decrease in adult body mass. Our study demonstrates that arctic cryosphere changes may have antagonistic ecological consequences on coastal trophic flow. Such nonlinear responses complicate modelling exercises of current and future polar ecosystem dynamics. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Animals; Arctic Regions; Charadriiformes; Climate Change; Feeding Behavior; Ice Cover; Models, Biological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Remote Sensing Technology; Russia; Arkhangelsk [Russian Federation]; Franz Josef Land; Russian Federation; Alle alle; Aves; Pinguinus; arctic environment; climate effect; cryosphere; environmental conditions; foraging behavior; glacier dynamics; sea ice; seabird; warming; anatomy and histology; animal; Arctic; biological model; Charadriiformes; climate change; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; ice cover; nonlinear system; physiology; remote sensing; Russian Federation","Arctic climate change; Arctic marine fauna; Behavioural plasticity; Cryosphere; Historical data; Little auk","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923106694"

The advantage of the model is its ability to include oceanographic parameters (e.g., currents) to provide accurate results. The sea ice simulation was performed over Baffin Bay and the Labrador Sea to retrieve important parameters such as ice concentration, thickness, ridging, and drift. Two different forcing models, one with low resolution and another with a high resolution, were used for the estimation of sensitivity of model results. Sea ice behavior over 7 years was simulated to analyze ice formation, melting, and conditions in the region. Validation was based on comparing model results with remote sensing data. The simulated ice concentration correlated well with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) and Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) data.

Identification and separation analysis of wave components of the wind sea and swell provide a more realistic depiction of the sea state and is important for understanding of the mechanisms of climate variability in the wave field. Spectral separating is one of the most important methods in partitioning waves. Two separating methods including the initial wave steepness method (STPN) and modified wave steepness method (MSTPN) that proposed by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) are described in this paper. And the NDBC buoy observations are applied in this study to investigate STPN and MSTPN. Although MSTPN method is improved from the STPN method, it is still not fit for the swell effect. Considering limitations mentioned above, we use spectral energy proportion (SEP) to describe the swell effect and abstract the valid data according to this index. Finally, we give a description of correlation between significant wave height (SWH) and wind speed under the wind sea condition. From results, it is shown that SWH and wind speed of wind sea have a quasiquadratic fitting relationship. In addition, it shows that MSTPN is a better performance in application as expected. Our work for spectral partitioning algorithms could provide a reference for the future work in satellite spectral data. And a practical method for deriving the SWHs from wind speed of scatterometer will be realized on the basis of the empirical wind and sea relationship. © 2015 SPIE.","Buoys; Hydrophilicity; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Separation; Surface waves; Wind; Wind effects; Climate variability; National data buoy centers; Separation analysis; Significant wave height; Spectral partitioning; Spectral separation; Wind sea; Wind wave; Water waves","spectral separation; SWH; wind sea; wind-wave relationship","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961839687"

Ice dynamics here affect the movement of ice in the East Greenland Current, the transpolar drift and ice extent in the Arctic Ocean. In contrast to other times of the year, when the Fram Strait wind field is characterized by strong, persistent northerlies, we show that the weaker, more variable winds typical during late summer for the Fram Strait can slow movement of ice floes out of the area, thus slowing the export of ice from the Arctic Ocean at the end of summer, a time crucial for ice export. The Arctic Ocean could lose even more of the ice that survives the summer if this was not the case. This would leave the Arctic Ocean in an even more vulnerable position with regard to the amount of multi-year ice remaining the following summer. © 2015, International Glaciology Society.

The objective of this paper is to compare model output and data analysis, toward addressing a key problem in sea-ice modeling, the correct representation of ridges and other spatial features that result from deformation. Morphologically complex, ridged ice exists in Fram Strait. High-resolution airborne remote sensing data, including image data and altimeter data showing ridging, collected from unmanned aircraft over Fram Strait during the Characterization of Arctic Sea Ice Experiment (CASIE) in 2009, are analyzed using geostatistical classification. This approach results in parameters that capture deformation characteristics and facilitates comparison to model results. Ridging and other forms of deformation are implemented in the Los Alamos sea-ice model CICE. The main parameters that are compared are freeboard as a proxy of ice thickness and percentages of level versus ridged ice from modeling and laser altimeter data analysis. Results from freeboard analysis indicate that except for the elevation class 0.1. m-0.2. m, models and observations match very well. For concentration of deformed ice, results from CICE using the standard parameter configuration are within 20% of deformed ice area concentration compared to results from altimeter data analysis. Variation of several physical parameters indicates the sensitivity of model results to ridging parameters and provides results that are within 7% of data analysis results in each grid cell, with the parameter that yields the best match depending on geographic location and morphologic province. In general our approach demonstrates an avenue for parameterization on both the data analysis side and the modeling side that allows a direct comparison of results from sea-ice models and data analysis and hence an evaluation of numerical sea-ice models. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Aneroid altimeters; Classification (of information); Data handling; Deformation; Information analysis; Meteorological instruments; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sensitivity analysis; Surface topography; Airborne remote sensing; Arctic sea ice; Deformation Characteristics; Laser altimeter datum; Model-data comparisons; Physical parameters; Sea ice classification; Sea ice deformations; Ice","Arctic sea ice; Laser altimetry, sea-ice classification; Model-data comparison; Sea-ice complexity; Sensitivity experiments","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930653512"

Here we consider brightness temperature simulations for 2.5-4.5 m thick Arctic multi-year ice and compare the results of the relatively simple emission model (M2013) used previously for the retrieval with simulations from a more complex model (T20T1) that combines a sea-ice version of the Microwave Emission Model for Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) with a thermodynamic model. We find that L-band brightness temperature is mainly determined by ice temperature. In the M2013 model, ice temperature in turn is mainly determined by surface temperature and snow thickness, and this dependence has been used previously to explain the potential for a snow thickness retrieval. Our comparisons suggest that the M2013 retrieval model may benefit from a more sophisticated thermodynamic calculation of the ice temperature or from using independent temperature data (e.g. from 6 GHz channels). In both models, horizontally polarized brightness temperatures increase with snow thickness while holding surface temperature, ice thickness and snow density near constant. The increase in the T2011 model is steeper than in M2013, suggesting a higher sensitivity to snow thickness than found earlier.","brightness temperature; ice thickness; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; SMOS; snow; surface temperature; thermodynamics","Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930638890"

Given the high albedo and low thermal conductivity, snow is regarded as one of the key reasons for the amplification of the warming in polar regions. The distributions of sea ice and snow depth are essential to the whole thermal conduction in the Arctic. This study focused on the retrieval of snow depth on sea ice from brightness temperatures of the MicroWave Radiometer Imager (MWRI) onboard the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite during the period from December 1, 2010 to April 30, 2011. After cross calibrated to the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) Level 2A data, the MWRI brightness temperatures were applied to calculate the sea ice concentrations based on the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm. According to the proportional relationship between the snow depth and the surface scattering in 18.7 and 36.5 GHz, the snow depths were derived. In order to eliminate the influence of uncertainties in grain sizes of snow as well as sporadic weather effects, the seven-day averaged snow depths were calculated. Then the results were compared with the snow depths from the AMSR-E Level 3 Sea Ice products. The bias of differences between the MWRI and the AMSR-E Level 3 products are ranged between -1.09 and -0.32 cm,while the standard deviations and the correlation coefficients are ranged from 2.47 to 2.88 cm and from 0.78 to 0.90 for different months. As a result, it could be summarized that FY3B/MWRI showed a promising prospect in retrieving snow depth on sea ice.","Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Luminance; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Snow melting systems; Surface scattering; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Brightness temperatures; FY3B; MWRI; Sea ice concentration; Snow depths; Ice","Brightness temperature; FY3B; MWRI; Radiometer; Sea ice concentration; Snow depth","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979530502"

Their precise detection is crucial for altimetric estimations of sea ice thickness and volume. This study evaluates the performance of the SARAL/AltiKa (Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa) altimeter to detect leads and to monitor their spatio-temporal dynamics. We show that a pulse peakiness parameter (PP) used to detect leads by Envisat RA-2 and ERS-1,-2 altimeters is not suitable because of saturation of AltiKa return echoes over the leads. The signal saturation results in loss of 6–10% of PP data over sea ice. We propose a different parameter—maximal power of waveform—and define the threshold to discriminate the leads. Our algorithm can be applied from December until May. It detects well the leads of small and medium size from 200 m to 3–4 km.

A cloud removal approach from ocean color satellite images based on numerical modeling is introduced. The approach removes cloud-contaminated portions and then reconstructs the missing data utilizing model simulated values. The basic idea is to create the relationship between cloud-free patches and cloud-contaminated patches under the assumption that both of them are influenced by the same marine hydrodynamic conditions. Firstly, we find cloud-free GOCI (the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) retrieved suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the East China Sea before and after the time of cloudy images, which are set as initial field and validation data for numerical model, respectively. Secondly, a sediment transport model based on COHERENS, a coupled hydrodynamic-ecological ocean model for regional and shelf seas, is configured. The comparison between simulated results and validation images show that the sediment transport model can be used to simulate actual sediment distribution and transport in the East China Sea. Then, the simulated SSCs corresponding to the cloudy portions are used to remove the cloud and replace the missing values. Finally, the accuracy assessments of the results are carried out by visual and statistical analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively remove cloud from GOCI images and reconstruct the missing data, which is a new way to enhance the effectiveness and availability of ocean color data, and is of great practical significance. © 2015 SPIE.","Color; Fluid dynamics; Geostationary satellites; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophilicity; Marine applications; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Sediments; Suspended sediments; Cloud removal; Coherens; East China Sea; GOCI; Ocean color; Numerical models","cloud removal; COHERENS; East China Sea; GOCI; numerical modeling; ocean color images; SSC","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961842202"

In contrast to other algorithms this algorithm does not use a priori values of the spectral albedo of the sea-ice constituents (such as melt ponds, white ice etc.). Instead, it is based on an analytical solution for the reflection from sea ice surface. The algorithm includes the correction of the sought-for ice and ponds characteristics with the iterative procedure based on the Newton-Raphson method. Also, it accounts for the bi-directional reflection from the ice/snow surface, which is particularly important for Arctic regions where the sun is low. The algorithm includes an original procedure for the atmospheric correction, as well. This algorithm is implemented as computer code called Melt Pond Detector (MPD). The input to the current version of the MPD algorithm is the MERIS Level 1B data, including the radiance coefficients at ten wavelengths and the solar and observation angles (zenith and azimuth). Also, specific parameters describing surface and atmospheric state can be set in a configuration input file. The software output is the map of the melt ponds area fraction and the spectral albedo of sea-ice in HDF5 format. The numerical verification shows that the MPD algorithm provides more accurate results for the light ponds than for the dark ones. The spectral albedo is retrieved with high accuracy for any type of ice and ponds. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithms; Iterative methods; Lakes; Newton-Raphson method; Ponds; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Solar radiation; Albedo; Arctic; Atmospheric corrections; Melt ponds; Numerical verification; Observation angle; Optical satellites; Radiance coefficients; Ice","Albedo; Arctic; Melt ponds; Remote sensing; Sea-ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937761760"

Based on in-situ samples from four seasonal cruises, we discussed spatial-temporal distribution and remote sensing monitoring of POC concentration in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Being affected by larger discharge from the Pearl River, surface POC concentrations in summer were usually higher than those in other three seasons, similar, in the PRE. However, because of sediment resuspension, POC concentrations at the bottom layer were higher than those at the surface layer. Taking the PRE as an example, remote sensing monitoring of POC concentration in case II water around estuary was also discussed. On the one hand, on the basis of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentrations inversed by published algorithms, we can estimate surface POC concentration through multiple linear regression equation: POC=0.042∗Chl-a+0.014∗TSM+0.1595, R=0.9156.

Operational analyses combine a variety of remote-sensing inputs and other sources via manual integration to create high-resolution, accurate charts of ice conditions in support of navigation and operational forecast models. One such product is the daily Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent (MASIE). The higher spatial resolution along with multiple input data and manual analysis potentially provide more precise mapping of the ice edge than passive microwave estimates. However, since MASIE is based on an operational product, estimates may be inconsistent over time due to variations in input data quality and availability. Comparisons indicate that MASIE shows higher Arcticwide extent values throughout most of the year, largely because of the limitations of passive microwave sensors in some conditions (e.g. surface melt). However, during some parts of the year, MASIE tends to indicate less ice than estimated by passive microwave sensors. These comparisons yield a better understanding of operational and research sea-ice data products; this in turn has important implications for their use in climate and weather models.","concentration (composition); data quality; forecasting method; mapping; navigation; remote sensing; satellite sensor; sea ice; spatial resolution","Remote sensing; Sea Ice; Sea-ice modelling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932649058"

Such missions (e.g., ERS, Envisat, ICESat, CryoSat-2) are based on the conversion of freeboard into thickness by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Freeboard, the height of the ice above the water level, is therefore a crucial parameter. Freeboard is a relative quantity, computed by subtracting the instantaneous sea surface height from the sea-ice surface elevations. Hence, the impact of geophysical range corrections depends on the performance of the interpolation between subsequent leads to retrieve the sea surface height, and the magnitude of the correction. In this study, we investigate this impact by considering CryoSat-2 sea-ice freeboard retrievals in autumn and spring. Our findings show that major parts of the Arctic are not noticeably affected by the corrections. However, we find areas with very low lead density like the multiyear ice north of Canada, and landfast ice zones, where the impact can be substantial. In March 2015, 7.17% and 2.69% of all valid CryoSat-2 freeboard grid cells are affected by the ocean tides and the inverse barometric correction by more than 1 cm.

It is assumed that the composite consists of many identical anisotropic crystals, each with a unique orientation. The key step in obtaining the bounds involves deriving an integral representation for ε∗, which separates parameter information from geometrical information. Forward bounds are then found using knowledge of the single crystal permittivity tensor and mean crystal orientation. Inverse bounds are also developed, which recover information about the mean crystal orientation from ε∗. We apply the polycrystalline bounds to sea ice, a critical component of the climate system. Different ice types, which result from different growth conditions, have different crystal orientation and size statistics. These characteristics significantly influence the fluid transport properties of sea ice, which control many geophysical and biogeochemical processes important to the climate and polar ecosystems. Using a two-scale homogenization scheme, where the single crystal tensor is numerically computed, forward bounds for sea ice are obtained and are in excellent agreement with columnar sea ice data. Furthermore, the inverse bounds are also applied to sea ice, helping to lay the groundwork for determining ice type using remote sensing techniques. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

For northern communities, it is a central part of culture, community, and livelihood. Recent changes in Arctic climate have led to greater unpredictability in sea ice conditions, making travel and hunting more hazardous, particularly during the dynamic freeze-up and break-up periods. If the recent trend of warmer Arctic winters is an indication of future climatic conditions, sea ice will become increasingly more dangerous for travel, especially for inexperienced travellers, and traditional knowledge of safe routes based on past climatic conditions will become less reliable. For northern resource industries (e.g., mining) and maritime shipping, the presence of sea ice represents added operational risk, particularly where shipping routes overlap with community on-ice travel routes, making route planning in these coastal areas less predictable and increasing the potential for delay and additional costs. Furthermore, northern resource extractive industries are expected to grow significantly in the future, leading to increased year-round shipping and greater potential for conflicting sea-ice use. The key to decreasing conflicts and ensuring safe and efficient winter travel for both local communities and industry is the timely availability of information describing sea ice conditions, at the relevant spatial scales, presented in a format that is appropriate for each user group. SmartICE represents a community-government-university-industry collaboration that integrates adapted technology, remote sensing, and Inuit Knowledge to promote safe travel for all stakeholders in northern coastal environments. The main elements of the SmartICE information system are: (i) A network of automated in situ sensors that measure sea-ice thickness and other characteristics; (ii) Repeat satellite imagery from which sea-ice surface conditions (e.g., concentration, roughness, water content) are mapped following user-defined classification systems; and (iii) Information technology that integrates the in situ and remotely sensed sea-ice data to generate raw and processed digital products that match the needs of user groups, from ice navigation managers to Inuit ice experts to recreational ice users. While community participation in SmartICE is key to addressing local needs and conditions, the program is intended to augment and integrate Inuit sea-ice knowledge, not replace it. Development and validation of the SmartICE technology and information system involve a multi-stage approach with simultaneous development of the ice monitoring technology and the Inuit-based ice type classification and remote sensing. The Nunatsiavut Government is a principal partner in SmartICE and our first phase of community sea-ice workshops, sea-ice classification and field truthing, sensor deployment and system validation is taking place in the Nunatsiavut communities of Nain and Rigolet. Nain is located to the north of Vale NL's Voisey's Bay mine site where winter ore shipping cuts a regular track through the coastal sea ice. Rigolet and a third study community, North West River, are located at the mouth and head of Lake Melville, respectively, an 150-km-long estuary that drains major rivers, including the Churchill River, to the Labrador Sea. Lake Melville sea ice is regularly used for subsistence harvesting and travel during winter and spring months. During the 2013/14 sea-ice season, workshops with sea-ice specialists were held in Nain and North West River. Sea-ice types deemed locally important for making decisions about on-ice travel were identified. Categories common to both communities included: rough ice (either due to ice or hard pack snow), smooth ice (again, due to a surface of ice or snow), open water, and water on-ice. Pack ice and the shear zone with landfast ice were only identified in Nain. The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) and C-CORE (through Polarview) provided high-resolution imagery for sea-ice classification. In addition, CIS have given full access to coarse resolution operational images. The sea-ice specialists in Nain and North West River have collected on-ice observations concurrent with image acquisition. Development of the sea-ice classification process is ongoing. SmartICE is developing two in situ sea-ice monitoring device types. Type 1, based on thermistor technology, will be deployed in the ocean prior to freeze-up and left in place until after breakup. Device prototypes were environmentally tested during the 2013-14 sea-ice season. Non-destructive ultrasonic sensor technologies are currently being explored for Type 2 devices, which will be deployed onto the ice surface. © 2014 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Coastal zones; Information systems; Information use; Knowledge management; Lakes; Marine radar; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Ships; Snow; Stream flow; Ultrasonic testing; Canadian subarctic; Coastal sea ices; Ice remote sensing; Industry-government collaboration; Inuit Knowledge; Labrador; Nunatsiavut; Radar remote sensing; safe winter ice travel; Sea ice classification; Sea-ice thickness; Sea ice","Canadian subarctic; coastal sea ice; community sea ice; in situ sea ice thickness; Inuit Knowledge; Labrador; marine shipping; Nunatsiavut; radar remote sensing; safe winter ice travel; sea ice classification; sea ice information system; sea ice remote sensing; university community industry government collaboration","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921725035"

In order to improve the segmentation accuracy, this paper proposes a multiple features based texture image segmentation method that combines tessellation. Firstly, multiple texture features are defined according to the spatial correlation of the pixel greyscale. Then, the image region is divided into sub-regions with tessellation, and the homogeneous regions to be segmented are obtained from fitting these sub-regions. Furthermore, the global potential energy function is defined through defining the heterogenous potential energy function among the homogeneous regions of multiple feature images and the potential energy function describing the neighborhood relationship of the sub-regions. The non-constrained Gibbs probability distribution is built to construct a posterior distribution from which a texture segmentation model is established. Finally, the M-H (metropolis-hastings) algorithm is used to sample the posterior probability distribution, and the optimal image segmentation result is achieved based on the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation. The segmentation experiments on the simulated texture images, remote sensing images, natural texture images as well as SAR (synthetic aperture radar, SAR) sea ice images were conducted, and the segmentation results were analyzed and compared with those obtained using the single feature method; the qualitative and quantitative test results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015, Science Press.

Previously, single polarimetric imagery were employed in supervised and unsupervised classification schemes for sea ice investigation, which was preceded by image processing techniques such as segmentation and textural features. Recently, through the advent of polarimetric SAR sensors, investigation of polarimetric features in sea ice has attracted increased attention. While dual-polarimetric data has already been investigated in a number of works, full-polarimetric data has so far not been a major scientific focus. To explore the possibilities of full-polarimetric data and compare the differences in C-and X-bands, we endeavor to analyze in detail an array of datasets, simultaneously acquired, in C-band (RADARSAT-2) and X-band (TerraSAR-X) over ice infested areas. First, we propose an array of polarimetric features (Pauli and lexicographic based). Ancillary data from national ice services, SMOS data and expert judgement were utilized to identify the governing ice regimes. Based on these observations, we then extracted mentioned features. The subsequent supervised classification approach was based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). To gain quantitative insight into the quality of the features themselves (and reduce a possible impact of the Hughes phenomenon), we employed mutual information to unearth the relevance and redundancy of features. The results of this information theoretic analysis guided a pruning process regarding the optimal subset of features. In the last step we compared the classified results of all sensors and images, stated respective accuracies and discussed output discrepancies in the cases of simultaneous acquisitions. © 2016 SPIE.","Image processing; Image segmentation; Information theory; Neural networks; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Feature evaluation; Image processing technique; Information-theoretic analysis; Pol-SAR; Radarsat-2; Relevance and redundancies; Supervised and unsupervised classification; TerraSAR-X; Ice","Artificial neural network; Feature evaluation; Pol-SAR; RADARSAT-2; Sea ice; TerraSAR-X","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006900406"

The physical changes in the seasonal snow cover during that time are reflected in the evolution of TerraSAR-X backscatter. We are able to explain 76-93% of the spatio-temporal variability of the TerraSAR-X backscatter signal with up to four snowpack parameters with a root-mean-squared error of 0.87-1.62 dB, using a simple multiple linear model. Over the complete study, and especially after the onset of early-melt processes and freeze/thaw cycles, the majority of variability in the backscatter is influenced by changes in snow/ice interface temperature, snow depth and top-layer grain size. This suggests it may be possible to retrieve snow physical properties over Antarctic sea ice from X-band SAR backscatter.","Antarctica; Atka Bay; West Antarctica; backscatter; ice mechanics; remote sensing; sea ice; snow cover; snowpack","Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Snow metamorphosis; Snow physics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927757406"

Precise surface feature maps derived from remotely sensed imageries are the major requirement for many geoscientific applications in polar regions. The present study explores the capabilities of C-band dual polarimetric (HH & HV) SAR imagery from Indian Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT-1) for land cryospheric surface feature mapping. The study areas selected for the present task were Larsemann Hills and Schirmacher Oasis, East Antarctica. RISAT-1 Fine Resolution STRIPMAP (FRS-1) mode data with 3-m spatial resolution was used in the present research attempt. In order to provide additional context to the amount of information in dual polarized RISAT-1 SAR data, a band HH+HV was introduced to make use of the original two polarizations. In addition to the data calibration, transformed divergence (TD) procedure was performed for class separability analysis to evaluate the quality of the statistics before image classification. For most of the class pairs the TD values were comparable, which indicated that the classes have good separability. Fuzzy and Artificial Neural Network classifiers were implemented and accuracy was checked. Nonparametric classifier Support Vector Machine (SVM) was also used to classify RISAT-1 data with an optimized polarization combination into three land-cover classes consisting of sea ice/snow/ice, rocks/landmass, and lakes/waterbodies. This study demonstrates that C-band FRS1 image mode data from the RISAT-1 mission can be exploited to identify, map and monitor land cover features in the polar regions, even during dark winter period. For better landcover classification and analysis, hybrid polarimetric data (cFRS-1 mode) from RISAT-1, which incorporates phase information, unlike the dual-pol linear (HH, HV) can be used for obtaining better polarization signatures.

In order to understand aerosol optical properties and potential causes for the high aerosol loading there, a Cimel sunphotometer station (BH) was established on an offshore platform over the Bay for the first time in June 2012. The aerosol optical properties between July 2012 and July 2013 were employed to validate the satellite retrievals and to characterize temporal variability of aerosol optical properties. In particular, aerosol optical properties at BH were compared with those at Beijing (BJ), an urban station of the North China Plain (NCP), to discuss their potential difference during the same months of the same years. Mean aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD) retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements over the Bohai Bay was 0.79 ± 0.68 during 2004-2013, that even exceeded value over the NCP (0.50 ± 0.57). This fact was supported by the comparison of ground-based remote sensing AODs at BH and BJ. The annual mean Cimel AOD at BH was 0.76 ± 0.62, which was larger than that at BJ (0.64 ± 0.52). The MODIS AOD difference between the Bohai Bay and the NCP was 0.29, being more than two times larger than the Cimel AOD difference between BH and BJ (0.12). This strongly implied that the MODIS retrievals had significant biases over the Bohai Bay that was likely due to sediment in the water and also sea ice in winter. A distinct seasonal variation of AOD was revealed over ocean. The maxima Cimel AOD was observed in summer (1.02 ± 0.75), which was followed by spring (0.86 ± 0.61), autumn (0.54 ± 0.41), and winter (0.39 ± 0.24); this was in good agreement with that over the NCP. High AOD over the Bohai Bay was associated with the heavy exhaust emissions from the ships across the Bay and transport of aerosols from the NCP. Furthermore, a much strong hygroscopic growth of fine mode aerosols over the Sea as a result of humid environment also should contributed to high AOD.

Of the various advanced remote sensing techniques that address this issue, temporal mixture analysis (TMA) methods are often used to investigate the temporal characteristics of environmental factors, including SICs in the case of the present study. This study aims to forecast daily SICs for one year using a combination of TMA and time series modeling in two stages. First, we identify temporally meaningful sea ice signatures, referred to as temporal endmembers, using machine learning algorithms, and then we decompose each pixel into a linear combination of temporal endmembers. Using these corresponding fractional abundances of endmembers, we apply a autoregressive model that generally fits all Antarctic SIC data for 1979 to 2013 to forecast SIC values for 2014. We compare our results using the proposed approach based on daily SIC data reconstructed from real fractional abundances derived from a pixel unmixing method and temporal endmember signatures. The proposed method successfully forecasts new fractional abundance values, and the resulting images are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the reference data.","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Microwave sensors; Mixtures; Pixels; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Time series; AR models; Mixture analysis; Passive microwave sensors; Remote sensing techniques; Sea ice concentration; Seasonal characteristics; Temporal characteristics; Times series models; Ice","AR model; Sea ice concentration; Temporal mixture analysis; Times series model","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979497821"

Observations show that the Arctic sea ice has reduced by an average of 5% per decade from November 1978 to the present day. It is noted that, since 2007, the highest sea ice area variability has been observed, which increases the uncertainty of the forecast of the ice coverage in the Arctic seas and thus increases risk for ships in ice-covered waters of northern seas. It is demonstrated that the decrease in summer sea ice area, observed at the end of the melt season, is much more intense than the total decrease in the Arctic sea ice area. On average it is 13% for September for the Arctic as a whole and from 24 to 40% per decade for the seas of the Russian Arctic. The study of changes in the ice conditions in the Northern Sea Route has been carried out for one of the optimal sailing routes. The results indicate a decrease in the ice concentration on the route in the summer months and almost complete route opening in September for the period from 2008 and 2012. It is shown that data from microwave radiometers can be used in the study of ice conditions in the Kara Gates and Vilkitsky Strait.

ACNFS is designed to provide short term, 1-7 day forecasts of Arctic sea ice and ocean conditions. Many quantities are forecast by ACNFS; the most commonly used include ice concentration, ice thickness, ice velocity, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and sea surface velocities. Ice concentration forecast skill is compared to a persistent ice state and historical sea ice climatology. Skill scores are focused on areas where ice concentration changes by ±5% or more, and are therefore limited to primarily the marginal ice zone. We demonstrate that ACNFS forecasts are skilful compared to assuming a persistent ice state, especially beyond 24 h. ACNFS is also shown to be particularly skilful compared to a climatologic state for forecasts up to 102 h. Modeled ice drift velocity is compared to observed buoy data from the International Arctic Buoy Programme. A seasonal bias is shown where ACNFS is slower than IABP velocity in the summer months and faster in the winter months. In February 2015, ACNFS began to assimilate a blended ice concentration derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). Preliminary results show that assimilating AMSR2 blended with IMS improves the short-term forecast skill and ice edge location compared to the independently derived National Ice Center Ice Edge product. © Published 2015.

Imagery data are classified using automatic techniques to produce maps entering the water bodies' analysis chain in several and different points. Very commonly, medium or coarse spatial resolution imagery is used in studies of large water bodies. Data of this kind is affected by the presence of mixed pixels leading to very outstanding problems, in particular when dealing with boundary pixels. A considerable amount of uncertainty inescapably occurs when conventional hard classifiers (e.g., maximum likelihood) are applied on mixed pixels. In this study, Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) is used to estimate the proportion of water in boundary pixels. Firstly by applying an unsupervised clustering, the water body is identified approximately and a buffer area considered ensuring the selection of entire boundary pixels. Then LSMM is applied on this buffer region to estimate the fractional maps. However, resultant output of LSMM does not provide a sub-pixel map corresponding to water abundances. To tackle with this problem, Pixel Swapping (PS) algorithm is used to allocate sub-pixels within mixed pixels in such a way to maximize the spatial proximity of sub-pixels and pixels in the neighborhood. The water area of two segments of Tagliamento River (Italy) are mapped in sub-pixel resolution (10m) using a 30m Landsat image. To evaluate the proficiency of the proposed approach for sub-pixel boundary mapping, the image is also classified using a conventional hard classifier. A high resolution image of the same area is also classified and used as a reference for accuracy assessment. According to the results, sub-pixel map shows in average about 8 percent higher overall accuracy than hard classification and fits very well in the boundaries with the reference map. © 2015 SPIE.","Algorithms; Hydrophilicity; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sea ice; Water resources; High resolution image; Linear spectral mixture model; Management and conservations; Pixel-swapping; Spatial resolution imagery; Sub pixels; Unmixing; Unsupervised clustering; Pixels","Pixel Swapping; River Boundaries; Sub-pixel; Unmixing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961802014"

Of particular concern is that winter-season snowpack has shown a net decline across the western United States over the past 50 years, resulting in major uncertainty in water-resource management heading into the next century. Cutting-edge tools are available to help navigate and preemptively plan for these uncertainties. This paper uses a next-generation modeling technique-variable-resolution global climate modeling within the Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM)-at horizontal resolutions of 0.125° (14 km) and 0.25° (28 km). VR-CESM provides the means to include dynamically large-scale atmosphere-ocean drivers, to limit model bias, and to provide more accurate representations of regional topography while doing so in a more computationally efficient manner than can be achieved with conventional general circulation models. This paper validates VR-CESM at climatological and seasonal time scales for Sierra Nevada snowpack metrics by comparing them with the ""Daymet,"" ""Cal-Adapt,"" NARR, NCEP, and North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) reanalysis datasets, the MODIS remote sensing dataset, the SNOTEL observational dataset, a standard-practice global climate model (CESM), and a regional climate model (WRF Model) dataset. Overall, given California's complex terrain and intermittent precipitation and that both of the VR-CESM simulations were only constrained by prescribed sea surface temperatures and data on sea ice extent, a 0.68 centered Pearson product-moment correlation, a negative mean SWE bias of < 7 mm, an interquartile range well within the values exhibited in the reanalysis datasets, and a mean December-February extent of snow cover that is within 7% of the expected MODIS value together make apparent the efficacy of the VR-CESM framework. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","California; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Atmospheric temperature; Cutting tools; Earth (planet); Oceanography; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Surface waters; Water management; Water resources; General circulation model; Land surface modeling; Model evaluation/performance; Multi-grid model; North american land data assimilation systems; Product-moment correlation; Regional climate modeling; Sea surface temperature (SST); accuracy assessment; climate modeling; MODIS; remote sensing; resolution; snow accumulation; snowpack; topographic effect; winter; Climate models","Climate models; Land surface model; Model evaluation/performance; Multigrid models","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956869935"

It causes serious problems to passive and active microwave sensing observations and to corresponding retrieval products. Detecting RFI signals is an important step before data can be used. The Microwave Radiation Image (MWRI) on board the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite can provide the brightness temperature data at 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz, and 89 GHz, each having dual channels at horizontal and vertical polarization states. RFI signals are present in MWRI data over land and ocean. RFI signals from data over ocean are more difficult to detect than those over land because of the low microwave emissivity of the sea surface. In general, RFI signals are detectable by using a multichannel regression method and retrieval chi-square probability. However, the two methods need auxiliary brightness temperature data within a certain period of time under conditions without ice and RFI, and located away from the coast. In this study, we use multichannel regression and Double Principal Component Analysis (DPCA) to identify the RFI signals from MWRI data over ocean. DPCA takes advantage of the decorrelation for RFI signals and the correlation characteristics of radiation data in different channels for nature surface, including snow cover and synoptic process. This method does not need auxiliary brightness temperature data, and it can been used to offer a real-time RFI detection method before data are provided. Compared with the results of multichannel regression, the results of DPCA can be considered effective in detecting RFI signals from MWRI ocean brightness temperatures. Moreover, the results obtained from the water near North America in winter indicate that multichannel regression produces false results over sea ice. The false signals could be avoided effectively in DPCA. The consistent results from different methods show that the RFI signals detected are credible. The RFI signals of MWRI at 10.65 GHz horizontal polarization over ocean are distributed widely over the ocean of Europe, and these signals are present at the offshore marine areas of East Asia and North America. ©, 2015, Science Press.

An analysis of trends over the Arctic for the past decade (2000–09) shows that reanalysis solutions have large spreads, particularly for downwelling shortwave radiation. In many cases, the differences in significant trends between the five reanalysis products are comparable to the estimated trend within a particular product. These discrepancies make it difficult to establish a consensus on likely changes occurring in the Arctic solely based on results from reanalyses fields. Regarding the 2007 ice retreat event, comparisons with remotely sensed estimates of downwelling radiation observations against these reanalysis products present an ambiguity. Remotely sensed observations from a study cited herewith suggest a large increase in downwelling summertime shortwave radiation and decrease in downwelling summertime longwave radiation from 2006 and 2007. On the contrary, the reanalysis products show only small gains in summertime shortwave radiation, if any; however, all the products show increases in downwelling longwave radiation.

Moreover, the algorithms for estimating surface broadband albedo from satellite observations, including narrow-to-broadband conversions, bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) angular modeling, direct-estimation algorithm and the algorithms for estimating albedo from geostationary satellite data, are developed and improved.

The Chukchi Sea is the only gateway of the warm and nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water flowing into the North Pole, and the high productivity-water had great impact on the CO2 uptake by the Arctic Ocean. We used the in situ underway data of aquatic partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), temperature and salinity, as well as the remote sensing data of sea ice concentration, chlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperature in August in 2008, 2011 and 2012 to analyze the major controlling factors of aquatic pCO2 in the Western Arctic Ocean. We analyzed the pCO2 variation under the effects of thermodynamic process (temperature), mixing of water mass (salinity), biological drawdown (chlorophyll), and sea ice concentration. The aquatic pCO2 was generally unsaturation relative to the atmospheric CO2 in most of the Western Arctic Ocean. According to different controlling mechanisms, the study area was divided into three parts: the area affected by the Pacific Ocean water (mainly in the Chukchi Sea), the area where sea ice mostly melted with weak biological production (the southern Canada Basin and the Western Beaufort Sea), and the area mostly covered by sea ice (the Northern Canada Basin). The aquatic pCO2 was low in the Chukchi Sea with the influence of the Pacific Ocean water. While, pCO2 in the area where sea ice melted was up to 360-380 μatm because of warming, CO2 invasion from the atmosphere, and a low biological production. For the Canada Basin, it was controlled by temperature change and sea ice cover. The remote sensing data in large spatial-temporal scale can help to understand the pCO2 variation and its response to global change; and it needs to develop satellite algorithm of pCO2 based on the quantification of controlling processes. © 2015 SPIE.","Atmospheric temperature; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chlorophyll; Global warming; Hydrophilicity; Oceanography; Process control; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface waters; Temperature; Water levels; Arctic ocean; Controlling factors; Ice concentration; Partial pressure of co; Satellite data; Ice","aquatic partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>; controlling factor; ice concentration; satellite data; Western Arctic Ocean","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961784146"

The models were provided with two sources each of surface chlorophyll-a concentration (chlorophyll), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), sea surface temperature (SST), and mixed-layer depth (MLD). The models were most sensitive to uncertainties in surface chlorophyll, generally performing better with in situ chlorophyll than with satellite-derived values. They were much less sensitive to uncertainties in PAR, SST, and MLD, possibly due to relatively narrow ranges of input data and/or relatively little difference between input data sources. Regardless of type or complexity, most of the models were not able to fully reproduce the variability of in situ NPP, whereas some of them exhibited almost no bias (i.e., reproduced the mean of in situ NPP). The models performed relatively well in low-productivity seasons as well as in sea ice-covered/deep-water regions. Depth-resolved models correlated more with in situ NPP than other model types, but had a greater tendency to overestimate mean NPP whereas absorption-based models exhibited the lowest bias associated with weaker correlation. The models performed better when a subsurface chlorophyll-a maximum (SCM) was absent. As a group, the models overestimated mean NPP, however this was partly offset by some models underestimating NPP when a SCM was present. Our study suggests that NPP models need to be carefully tuned for the Arctic Ocean because most of the models performing relatively well were those that used Arctic-relevant parameters. © 2015.

Here, we investigated how sea ice has changed in the Amundsen Sea over the period of 1979 to 2014, focusing on spatio-temporal changes in ice edge advance/retreat and percent sea ice cover in relation to changes in winds. In contrast to the widespread sea ice decreases to the east and increases to the west of the Amundsen Sea, sea ice changes in the Amundsen Sea were confined to three areas: (i) offshore of the shelf break, (ii) the southern Pine Island Polynya, and (iii) the eastern Amundsen Sea Polynya. Offshore, a 2-month decrease in ice season duration coincided with seasonal shifts in wind speed and direction from March to May (relating to later ice advance) and from September to August (relating to earlier retreat), consistent with reported changes in the depth/location of the Amundsen Sea Low. In contrast, sea ice decreases in the polynya areas corresponded to episodic or step changes in spring ice retreat (earlier by 1-2 months) and were coincident with changes to Thwaites Iceberg Tongue (located between the two polynyas) and increased southeasterly winds. Temporal correlations among these three areas were weak, indicating different local forcing and/or differential response to large-scale forcing. Although our analysis has shown that part of the variability can be explained by changes in winds or to the coastal icescape, an additional but unknown factor is how sea ice has responded to changes in ocean heat and freshwater inputs. Unraveling cause and effect, critical for predicting changes to this rapidly evolving ocean-ice shelf-sea ice system, will require in situ observations, along with improved remote sensing capabilities and ocean modeling. ©2015 Stammerjohn et al.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977639475"

A satellite radar altimeter can measure the range between the satellite platform where it is aboard and the averaged sea surface with centimeter level accuracy. The rising slope of the received waveform by altimeter contains important information about the sea surface, e.g. the larger the slope of the waveform, means the smoother the sea surface. Besides, the half-power point of the slope refers to the range information. For satellite altimeter, due to the rising slope just occupies fewer range bins compared with the whole range bins illuminated by the long pulse signal, i.e. the signal is sparse in this sense, thus compressive sensing technique is applicable. Altimeter echoes are simulated and the waveforms are constructed by using the traditional method as well as by compressive sensing (CS) method, they are very well agreed with each other. The advantage of using CS is that we can increase the sampling time window without increasing the data, thus the tracking capability can be enhanced without sacrificing the resolution. © 2015 SPIE.","Aneroid altimeters; Bins; Hydrophilicity; Interferometry; Meteorological instruments; Radar; Radar equipment; Radar signal processing; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Signal reconstruction; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Tracking (position); Compressive sensing; Downsampling; Echo waveforms; Interferometric phase; Interferometric radars; Sampling time; Compressed sensing","compressive sensing (CS); downsampling; echo waveform; interferometric phase; Interferometric radar altimeter; sampling time window (STW)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961768062"

There have been many research works in developing remote sensing technologies, as it can be used as an earth observation technique to monitor the polar region [11, 15]. In previous studies, remote sensing forward model has been developed to study and understand scattering mechanisms and sensitivity of physical parameters of snow and sea ice. This paper is an extended work from previous studies [16-19], where an improved theoretical model to study polar region was developed. Multiple-surface scattering, based on an existing integral equation model (IEM) that calculates surface scattering and additional second-order surface-volume scattering, were added in the model from prior research works [7] for improvement in the backscattering calculation. We present herein the application of this model on a snow layer above ground which is modeled as a volume of ice particles that are closely packed and bounded by irregular boundaries above a homogenous half space. The effect of including multiple surface scattering and additional surface-volume scattering up to second order in the backscattering coefficient calculation of snow layer is studied for co-polarized and cross-polarized returns. Comparisons with satellite data are also done for validation. Results show improvement in the total backscattering coefficient for cross-polarized return in the studied range, suggesting that multiple-surface scattering and surface-volume scattering up to second order are important scattering mechanisms in the snow layer and should not be ignored in polar research. © 2016, Electromagnetics Academy.

We then quantified movement rates, area use, habitat selection, and distribution and phenology of maternity denning using data from adult female polar bears tracked with satellite transmitters between 2007 and 2010 (n = 7). We compared results to historical data collected from adult females in the 1990s (n = 4). Adult females in the 2000s used areas with significantly lower sea ice concentrations (10–15 % lower) than bears in the 1990s during winter, a pattern influenced by delayed freeze-up in October–December. Adult females in the 2000s were located significantly closer (100–150 km) to open water in all seasons and spent approximately 2 months longer in areas with <60 % sea ice concentration than bears in the 1990s. Multivariate resource selection models contrasting preference between decades showed that there was a statistically significant and stronger winter preference in the 2000s for adult females to select for higher sea ice concentrations. Timing of maternity denning did not significantly differ between decades.

The antenna diameter of AMSR2 is 2.0m which provide highest spatial resolution as a passive microwave radiometer in space. This paper describes about the outline of sea ice monitoring with AMSR2 and introduces some of the initial result acquired from AMSR2 observation. The sea ice concentration derived from AMSR2 data allow us to see more detailed sea ice distributions compared with that of SSM/I. The sea ice concentration estimated from AMSR2 data were evaluated using the data of optical sensor MODIS onboard Aqua satellite. The procedures of the evaluation are as follows. Firstly, MODIS Band 2 data were binarized to discriminate sea ice from open water, and sea ice concentration of each pixel size of AMSR2 were calculated using the binarized MODIS data. Then the AMSR2 sea ice concentration of each pixel was compared with the sea ice concentration calculated from MODIS data. The result suggested the possibility of estimating sea ice concentration from AMSR2 data with less than 10% error under good weather condition. On 16 September 2012, the minimum sea ice extent in Northern Hemisphere was recorded by AMSR2 in the history of passive microwave sensor observation from space. The minimum sea ice extent comparison in the Arctic between 1982 and 2012 was obvious. The importance of sea ice monitoring from space with passive microwave radiometers such as AMSR2 is increasing.","Bins; Global warming; Microwave devices; Microwave measurement; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Pixels; Radiometers; Rain; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space optics; GCOM-W1; Ice concentration; Northern Hemispheres; Passive microwave sensors; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration; Sea ice distribution; Spatial resolution; Ice","GCOM-W1; Global warming; Ice concentration; Passive microwave sensor","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964031527"

In this study, the vertical distribution of the particulate beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm (cp(660)) and its correlation to the particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the north South China Sea (NSCS), was investigated based on the in situ data from two cruises covering the summer and autumn seasons during 2009-2010year. The results showed that in summer, the profiles of cp(660) at the near shore stations were generally well vertical mixed, except at the bottom layer where cp(660) sharply increased due to sediment resuspension. However, in the slope and basin, the profiles of cp(660) had the peak value in the subsurface layer, and the depth of maximum increased with the increasing of the water depth. The subsurface maximum of the cp(660) was corresponding to the subsurface maximum Chl-a in the shelf and basin in the NSCS in summer. In autumn, the depth profile of cp(660) was also well mixed in the near shore, similar as it in summer. In the basin, unlike the subsurface maximum in summer, cp(660) had the decreasing trend with the increasing of depth in most stations in autumn. The spatial distribution pattern of the surface cp(660) was similar in the two seasons, with high values in near shore and low values in the shelf and basin. This was mainly attributed to the river and terrigenous organic materials. There were good correlations between cp(660) and POC in both seasons, except some near shore stations with high sediment resuspension. That made the possibility of estimating the POC profile using the cp(660), and further calculating the vertical structure with satellite-derived surface POC. © 2016 SPIE.","Coastal engineering; Hydrophilicity; Optical properties; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Beam attenuation coefficient; Inherent optical properties; Particulate organic carbon; Sediment re suspensions; South China sea; Spatial distribution patterns; Vertical distributions; Vertical structures; Organic carbon","North South China Sea; Particulate beam attenuation coefficient; POC concentration; Vertical distribution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011262970"

Due to its large spatial extent, it is of high importance for a variety of physical and biological processes, especially in wintertime. Here, we present a long-term remote sensing study for the winter seasons 1978/1979 to 2014/2015. Polynya characteristics are inferred from (1) sea ice concentrations and brightness temperatures from passive microwave satellite sensors (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E and AMSR2), Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSM/I-SSMIS)) and (2) thin-ice thickness distributions, which are calculated using MODIS ice-surface temperatures and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis data in a 1D thermodynamic energy-balance model. Daily ice production rates are retrieved for each winter season from 2002/2003 to 2014/2015, assuming that all heat loss at the ice surface is balanced by ice growth. Two different cloud-cover correction schemes are applied on daily polynya area and ice production values to account for cloud gaps in the MODIS composites. Our results indicate that the NOW polynya experienced significant seasonal changes over the last three decades considering the overall frequency of polynya occurrences, as well as their spatial extent. In the 1980s, there were prolonged periods of a more or less closed ice cover in northern Baffin Bay in winter. This changed towards an average opening on more than 85% of the days between November and March during the last decade. Noticeably, the sea ice cover in the NOW polynya region shows signs of a later-appearing fall freeze-up, starting in the late 1990s. Different methods to obtain daily polynya area using passive microwave AMSR-E/AMSR2 data and SSM/I-SSMIS data were applied. A comparison with MODIS data (thin-ice thickness ≤ 20 cm) shows that the wintertime polynya area estimates derived by MODIS are about 30 to 40% higher than those derived using the polynya signature simulation method (PSSM) with AMSR-E data. In turn, the difference in polynya area between PSSM and a sea ice concentration (SIC) threshold of 70% is fairly low (approximately 10%) when applied to AMSR-E data. For the coarse-resolution SSM/I-SSMIS data, this difference is much larger, particularly in November and December. Instead of a sea ice concentration threshold, the PSSM method should be used for SSM/I-SSMIS data. Depending on the type of cloud-cover correction, the calculated ice production based on MODIS data reaches an average value of 264.4 ± 65.1 km3 to 275.7 ± 67.4 km3 (2002/2003 to 2014/2015) and shows a high interannual variability. Our achieved long-term results underline the major importance of the NOW polynya considering its influence on Arctic ice production and associated atmosphere/ocean processes. © 2015 by the authors.","Atmospheric temperature; Microwave devices; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Weather forecasting; Baffin bay; MODIS; Nares strait; Passive microwaves; Polynya; Ice","Baffin bay; Ice bridge; MODIS; Nares strait; Passive microwave; Polynya; Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014672248"

The seasonal maximum decreases from 57.5 to 23.2 % in Isfjorden and from 52.6 to 35.2 % in Hornsund. A new index, called ""days of fast ice"" (DFI), is introduced for quantification of the interannual variation of fast ice cover, allowing for comparison between different fjords and winter seasons. Considering the time period from 1 March until end of the sea ice season, the mean DFI values for 2000-2014 are 33.1 ± 18.2 DFI (Isfjorden) and 42.9 ± 18.2 DFI (Hornsund). A distinct shift to lower DFI values is observed in 2006. Calculating a mean before and after 2006 yields a decrease from 50 to 22 DFI for Isfjorden and from 56 to 34 DFI for Hornsund. Fast ice coverage generally correlates well with remote-sensing sea surface temperature and in situ air temperature. An increase of autumn ocean heat content is observed during the last few years when the DFI values decrease. The presented sea ice time series can be utilized for various climate effect studies linked to, e.g. glacier dynamics, ocean chemistry, and marine biology. © 2016 Author(s).","Arctic; Hornsund; Isfjorden; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; air temperature; heat budget; ice cover; in situ measurement; index method; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; time series","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009400033"

To this end, a cost function representing the discrepancy between the true radar cross-section data and the calculated radar cross-section data due to a predicted dielectric profile is formed. This cost function is iteratively minimized using the differential evolution algorithm so as to reconstruct the unknown dielectric profile. Herein, four different formulations for this cost function are considered. These formulations are distinguished by their utilized weighting factors for each data point within the bistatic radar cross-section data set. Although these cost functions use the same simulated bistatic normalized radar cross-section data set, it will be shown that the reconstruction accuracy achievable from each of them will be different. Finally, an appropriate weighting scheme for bistatic data sets, which emphasizes the scattering data points collected at the vicinity of the specular angle, is presented. It will be shown that the use of this weighting scheme results in enhanced reconstruction accuracy as compared to the other formulations. It is speculated that the proposed weighting scheme balances the individual data points more properly, thus, resulting in enhanced accuracy. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Boreholes; Cost functions; Evolutionary algorithms; Iterative methods; Optimization; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Snow; Bistatic radar cross section; Dielectric profiles; Differential evolution algorithms; Normalized radar cross section; Reconstruction accuracy; Remote sensing of snow; Weighting factors; Weighting scheme; accuracy assessment; algorithm; data set; dielectric property; radar; reconstruction; remote sensing; sea ice; simulation; snow cover; Radar cross section","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929465624"

Current methods of snow depth retrieval are based on satellite microwave radiometry, which perform best for dry, homogeneous snow packs on level sea ice. We introduce an alternative approach based on in-situ measurements of total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard and snow depth, which we use to compute snow depth on sea ice from Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) total freeboard observations. We compare ICESat snow depth for early winter and spring of the years 2004 through 2006 with the Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer aboard EOS (AMSR-E) snow depth product. We find ICESat snow depths agree more closely with ship-based visual and air-borne snow radar observations than AMSR-E snow depths. We obtain average modal and mean ICESat snow depths, which exceed AMSR-E snow depths by 5-10 cm in winter and 10-15 cm in spring. We observe an increase in ICESat snow depth from winter to spring for most Antarctic regions in accordance with ground-based observations, in contrast to AMSR-E snow depths, which we find to stay constant or to decrease. We suggest satellite laser altimetry as an alternative method to derive snow depth on Antarctic sea ice, which is independent of snow physical properties.","Aneroid altimeters; Microwave devices; Microwaves; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Snow melting systems; Antarctic; Ground-based observations; Land elevation satellites; Laser altimetry; Microwave radiometers; Microwave radiometry; Satellite remote sensing; Snow depths; Snow","Antarctic; Satellite laser altimetry; Satellite microwave radiometry; Snow depth on sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974792653"

An important research topic to be studied during dredging operations in harbors and navigable waterways is the movement of fluidized muds before, during and after dredging operations. The fluid movement of the surficial sediments in the form of flocs, muck and mud is important to estimate in order to model the transport of solids material during dredging operations. Movement of highly turbid bottom material creates a lutocline or near bottom nephelometric layers, reduces the penetration of light reaching the water bottom.

Airborne imaging of dredge site provide wide area surveillance during these activities. Passive sondes, optical imaging and acoustical sensors are used to understand horizontal and vertical mass flux processes. The passive sondes can be directionally oriented and are deployed during optical particle velocimetry system (OPVS) imaging of the flocs, particles and colloidal material motion.

Analysis of MODIS and SAR imagery provides a detailed description of the regional sea-ice conditions which led to the 6 day long besetment of RV Xuelong. The remotely sensed imagery revealed four stages of sea-ice characteristics during the entrapment: the gathering, compaction, dispersion and calving stages. Four factors characterizing the local sea-ice conditions during late December 2013 and early January 2014 were identified: surface component of the coastal current; near-surface wind; ocean tides; and surface air temperature. This study demonstrates that shipping activity in ice-invested waters should be underpinned by general knowledge of the ice situation. In addition, during such activity high spatiotemporal resolution remotely sensed data should be acquired regularly to monitor local and regional sea-ice changes with a view to avoiding the besetment of vessels.","Antarctica; glacier dynamics; ice breaker; MODIS; radar imagery; remote sensing; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar","Remote sensing; Sea-ice dynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932622175"

In these applications, SST is necessary under both fine and cloudy conditions, which can be made by passive microwave radiometers in particular under cloudy condition. To measure SST by microwave radiometers, frequencies below 10GHz are necessary, but measuring SST colder below around 10C becomes difficult using 10GHz. The frequency 6GHz is necessary for measuring SST in global oceans. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer -2 (AMSR2) aboard the Global Change Observation Mission - W (GCOM-W) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is one of such sensors, and began SST observation since July 2012. AMSR-2 is a successor sensor of AMSR-E aboard the NASA AQUA satellite, whose SST observation was made from July 2002 to October 2011. Algorithms retrieving SST from AMSRs should be developed by keeping minds of several points: (1) wind effect corrections on brightness temperature for both wind speed and direction, (2) removal of radio frequency interference from several sources, (3) accurate calibration of brightness temperature of AMSRs, (4) removal of sea ice area, and (5) removal of land contamination.

One of the alternative approaches is based on the two- or three band ratio algorithms in the red/NIR part of the spectrum, which require 665, 708, 753 nm bands (or similar) and which work well in various waters all over the world. The critical 708 nm band for these algorithms is not available on MODIS and VIIRS sensors, which limits applications of this approach. We report on another approach where a combination of the 745nm band with blue-green-red bands was the basis for the new algorithms. A multi-band algorithm which includes ratios Rrs(488)/Rrs(551)and Rrs(671)/Rrs(745) and two band algorithm based on Rrs671/Rrs745 ratio were developed with the main focus on the Chesapeake Bay (USA) waters.

Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination can be as high as R2 > 0.90 for the new algorithms in comparison with R2 = 0.6 for the standard OC3V algorithm on the same field dataset.

Satellite remote-sensing data provide important information about remote ice areas, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have the advantages of penetration of the omnipresent cloud cover and of high spatial resolution. A challenge addressed in this paper is how to extract information on sea-ice types and sea-ice processes from SAR data. We introduce, validate and apply geostatistical and statistical approaches to automated classification of sea ice from SAR data, to be used as individual tools for mapping sea-ice properties and provinces or in combination. A key concept of the geostatistical classification method is the analysis of spatial surface structures and their anisotropies, more generally, of spatial surface roughness, at variable, intermediate-sized scales. The geostatistical approach utilizes vario parameters extracted from directional vario functions, the parameters can be mapped or combined into feature vectors for classification. The method is flexible with respect to window sizes and parameter types and detects anisotropies. In two applications to RADARSAT and ERS-2 SAR data from the area near Point Barrow, Alaska, it is demonstrated that vario-parameter maps may be utilized to distinguish regions of different sea-ice characteristics in the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea and in Elson Lagoon. In a third and a fourth case study the analysis is taken further by utilizing multi-parameter feature vectors as inputs for unsupervised and supervised statistical classification. Field measurements and high-resolution aerial observations serve as basis for validation of the geostatistical-statistical classification methods. A combination of supervised classification and vario-parameter mapping yields best results, correctly identifying several sea-ice provinces in the shore-fast ice and the pack ice. Notably, sea ice does not have to be static to be classifiable with respect to spatial structures. In consequence, the geostatistical-statistical classification may be applied to detect changes in ice dynamics, kinematics or environmental changes, such as increased melt ponding, increased snowfall or changes in the equilibrium line. © 2016 by the authors.","Anisotropy; Antennas; Geodetic satellites; Mapping; Particles (particulate matter); Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Statistics; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Beaufort sea; Chukchi Sea; Feature vectors; Point Barrow/Alaska; Satellite data; Statistical classification; Classification (of information)","Beaufort Sea; Chukchi Sea; Feature vector; Geostatistical and statistical classification; Point Barrow/Alaska; Satellite data; Vario function","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983785806"

Here new field experiments carried out from a Platform on the Black Sea with a coherent X-band scatterometer, and a Doppler multifrequency (X-/C-/S-band) dual-polarized radar recently designed at IAP RAS are discussed. It is shown that the radar return contains both Bragg (polarized) and non polarized scattering components, presumably giving different contributions to radar Doppler shifts. Radar Doppler shifts were estimated using two different definitions as a) a frequency of the ""centre of gravity"" of an instantaneous radar return spectrum (ASIS) averaged over periods of dominant wind waves and b) the ""centre of gravity"" of the averaged over dominant wave periods spectrum (SAS). The ASIS and SAS values for both VV and HH-polarizations are shown to be different due to effects of radar backscatter modulation by dominant (long) wind waves. The radar Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) has been analyzed from experimental data and difference between SAS-and ASIS-values has been satisfactory explained using the measured MTF-values. It is obtained that experimental values of ASIS can be satisfactory described by the Bragg model despite the significant contribution of NP component to the radar backscatter.

In this study, under-ice PP was assessed based on three coupled ice-ocean-ecosystem models participating in the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS) project. All models showed good agreement with under-ice measurements of surface chlorophyll-a concentration and vertically integrated PP rates during the main under-ice production period, from mid-May to September. Further, modeled 30-year (1980-2009) mean values and spatial patterns of sea ice concentration compared well with remote sensing data. Under-ice PP was higher in the Arctic shelf seas than in the Arctic Basin, but ratios of under-ice PP over total PP were spatially correlated with annual mean sea ice concentration, with higher ratios in higher ice concentration regions. Decreases in sea ice from 1980 to 2009 were correlated significantly with increases in total PP and decreases in the under-ice PP/total PP ratio for most of the Arctic, but nonsignificantly related to under-ice PP, especially in marginal ice zones. Total PP within the Arctic Circle increased at an annual rate of between 3.2 and 8.0 Tg C/yr from 1980 to 2009. This increase in total PP was due mainly to a PP increase in open water, including increases in both open water area and PP rate per unit area, and therefore much stronger than the changes in under-ice PP. All models suggested that, on a pan-Arctic scale, the fraction of under-ice PP declined with declining sea ice cover over the last three decades. © 2015. American Geophysical Union.

Leads promote the flux of sensible and latent heat from the ocean to the cold winter atmosphere and are thereby crucial for air-sea-ice-ocean interactions. We here apply a binary segmentation procedure to identify leads from MODIS thermal infrared imagery on a daily time scale. The method separates identified leads into two uncertainty categories, with the high uncertainty being attributed to artifacts that arise from warm signatures of unrecognized clouds. Based on the obtained lead detections, we compute quasi-daily pan-Arctic lead maps for the months of January to April, 2003-2015. Our results highlight the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea as the primary region for lead activity. The spatial distribution of the average pan-Arctic lead frequencies reveals, moreover, distinct patterns of predominant fracture zones in the Beaufort Sea and along the shelf-breaks, mainly in the Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean as well as the well-known polynya and fast-ice locations.

They result from a change in both the political and economic situation, as well as technological development. These changes occurred at all stages of mapping pro-cess, from the determination of the position of objects on the ground, through the devel-opment of new coordinate systems, the application of new data, up to new methods of map compilation and reproduction. In Poland, the abolition of censorship had significant influence on changes in cartography. The article presents coordinate systems used in Poland since the end of World War 2. In the civil service incorrect maps have been used for many years. Only since the beginning of present century maps are compiled and published without falsifying the position of points, angles and distances between them. Aerial photographs taken in visible and in nonvisible part of the spectrum, and above all satellite images have been used as new valuable data sources. Aerial and satellite remote sensing provided a great deal of new data. They have given the opportunity to compile many new thematic maps, which were impossible to develop on the basis of existing sources of information. These maps include, among others, maps of : forest degradation, thermal pollution of rivers and reservoirs, air pollution, ozone depletion in the atmos-phere, relief of surface water in the oceans, distribution of wind speeds and their direc-Tions over the oceans, relief of seabed, as well as compilation of uniform and accurate DTM of most of land surface of the Earth. Microwave satellite imagery also enabled mapping the areas around the poles. Compilation of maps of these areas at high frequen-cies helped to define the dynamics and concentration of the sea ice as well as changes in Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. One of the satellites of new generation collects the data in various part of spectrum and on the basis of this data it compiles directly on its board the summary information in the form of thematic maps that are transmitted to ground receiving stations. A new process of compiling and printing maps is also a positive proof of changes that occurred in cartography. Digital technology is being used instead of the traditional one. All the process of map compilation is done in the display screen using data collected in spatial and relational databases. Printing a few copies of maps is done using ink-jet or laser printers, but in a case of large edition the traditional method of lithography is used. New technology of map compiling has led to the emergence of new forms of presenta-Tion, among others, multimedia web maps, and maps in mobile navigation systems. It also allowed the map recipients a compilation of maps according to their own requirements. The problem of map confidentiality has also been presented in the paper. The topograph-ic maps were largely inaccessible to the public in Poland for almost half a century. A new accurate topographic, thematic and other maps dedicated to the public use have been compiled only after the lifting of restrictions imposed by the political authorities on car-Tographic production. Today's availability of topographic and thematic maps has been described in the paper. The author also states that the availability of a computer-Assisted methods of map compi-lation and easy access to data sources does not always positively affect the correctness of the mapping. There are a lot of new maps on the market developed not by cartographers. The maps have not been compiled according to the rules developed over decades by cartographers and that is why they are often difficult to read, or even unintelligible to the average map user.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Poland [Central Europe]; cartography; civil service; microwave imagery; satellite data; satellite imagery; technological development; thematic mapping","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979752571"

Clouds and in particular mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) remain one of the greatest sources of uncertainties in the modelling of the Arctic response to climate change due to an inaccurate representation of their variability and their quantification. In this study, we present a characterisation of the vertical, spatial and seasonal variability of Arctic clouds and MPCs over the entire Arctic region based on satellite active remote sensing observations. MPC properties in the region of the Svalbard archipelago (78° N, 15° E) are also investigated. The occurrence frequency of clouds and MPCs are determined from CALIPSO/CLOUDSAT measurements processed with the DARDAR retrieval algorithm, which allow for a reliable cloud thermodynamic phase classification (warm liquid, supercooled liquid, ice, mixing of ice and supercooled liquid). Significant differences are observed between MPC properties over the entire Arctic region and over the Svalbard region. Results show that MPCs are encountered all year long, with a minimum occurrence of 30% in winter and 50% during the rest of the year on average over the entire Arctic. Over the Svalbard region, MPC occurrence is more constant with time with larger values (55%) compared to the average observed in the Arctic. MPCs are especially located at low altitudes, below 3000 m, where their frequency of occurrence reaches 90%, particularly during winter, spring and autumn. Moreover, results highlight that MPCs are statistically more frequent above open sea than land or sea ice. The temporal and spatial distribution of MPCs over the Svalbard region seems to be linked to the supply of moister air and warmer water from the North Atlantic Ocean, which contribute to the initiation of the liquid water phase. Over the whole Arctic, and particularly in western regions, the increase of MPC occurrence from spring to autumn could be connected to the sea ice melting. During this period, the open water transports some of the warm water from the North Atlantic Ocean to the rest of the Arctic region. This facilitates the vertical transfer of moisture and thus the persistence of the liquid phase. Particular attention is also paid to the measurement uncertainties and how they could affect our conclusions. © Author(s) 2015.","Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; algorithm; CALIPSO; climate change; cloud cover; cloud microphysics; CloudSat; moisture transfer; remote sensing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924199028"

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based ice thickness charts were used as reference data. Thin ice detection was studied using polarization and spectral gradient ratios (PR and GR) calculated from the 36/37 and 89/91 GHz radiometer data. Thresholds for thin ice detection and maximum thicknesses for the detected thin ice (hT) were determined, as were error rates for misdetections. The results for different 1-D PR and GR parameters led to the conclusion that the AMSR-E PR36 and H-polarized GR8936 would be the best parameters for a 2-D classifier. We adopted the linear discrimination analysis (LDA) as a statistical tool. Thin ice areas with hT of 30 cm could be separated from thicker ice fields with approximately 20% error level. In our large data set, the estimation of thin ice thickness was not possible with reasonable accuracy due to the large scatter between ice thickness and the PR and GR signatures. This is likely due to a large data set, besides thin ice in polynyas also thin ice in the marginal ice zone and thin ice from freeze-up period. The optimal LDA parameters in the classifier and hT depended on the daily mean air temperature ((Tam)). We could not yet parameterize the classifier optimally according to (Tam), but the constructed classifier worked rather robustly as indicated by the relative small error rate variation between the three analyzed winters. © 2015 IEEE.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Kara Sea; Errors; Image reconstruction; Microwave sensors; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Statistical mechanics; Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E); Arctic; Linear discrimination analysis; Mean air temperatures; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Passive microwave remote sensing; polynya; Special sensor microwave imagers; air temperature; AMSR-E; data set; detection method; error analysis; ice thickness; image classification; microwave imagery; MODIS; polarization; polynya; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite data; sea ice; threshold; two-dimensional modeling; Ice","Arctic; passive microwave remote sensing; polynya; thin sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027949803"

Previous work has primarily addressed this problem from the interannual variability perspective. This paper provides a refined perspective of sea ice-cloud relationship in the Arctic using a satellite footprint-level quantification of the covariance between sea ice and Arctic low cloud properties from NASA A-Train active remote sensing data. The covariances between Arctic low cloud properties and sea ice concentration are quantified by first partitioning each footprint into four atmospheric regimes defined using thresholds of lower tropospheric stability and midtropospheric vertical velocity. Significant regional variability in the cloud properties is found within the atmospheric regimes indicating that the regimes do not completely account for the influence of meteorology. Regional anomalies are used to account for the remaining meteorological influence on clouds. After accounting for meteorological regime and regional influences, a statistically significant but weak covariance between cloud properties and sea ice is found in each season for at least one atmospheric regime. Smaller average cloud fraction and liquid water are found within footprints with more sea ice. The largest-magnitude cloud-sea ice covariance occurs between 500 m and 1.2 km when the lower tropospheric stability is between 16 and 24 K. The covariance between low cloud properties and sea ice is found to be largest in fall and is accompanied by significant changes in boundary layer temperature structure where larger average near-surface static stability is found at larger sea ice concentrations. © 2015.

As fast ice plays an important role in the environmental and biological systems of the Antarctic, it is crucial to accurately monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of fast ice. Previous studies on fast ice using satellite remote sensing were mostly focused on the Arctic and near-Arctic areas, whereas few studies were conducted over the Antarctic, especially the West Antarctic region. This research mapped fast ice using multisensor data from 2003 to 2008 based on machine learning approaches - decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF). A total of seven satellite-derived products, including Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system brightness temperatures and sea ice concentration, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice surface temperature (IST) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager ice velocity, were used as input variables for identifying fast ice. RF resulted in better performance than that of DT for fast ice classification. Visual comparison of the fast ice classification results with 250-m MODIS images for selected areas also revealed that RF outperformed DT. Ice velocity and IST were identified as the most contributing variables to classify fast ice. Spatiotemporal variations of fast ice in the East and West Antarctic were also examined using the time series of the fast ice maps produced by RF. The residence time of fast ice was much shorter in the West Antarctic than in the East. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Antarctica; East Antarctica; West Antarctica; classification; concentration (composition); EOS; MODIS; monitoring system; remote sensing; sea ice; shoreline; spatiotemporal analysis; SSM-I","Antarctic; decision trees; landfast sea ice; random forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926504608"

ERS-1, ERS-2, ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B are C-band fan-beam radar scatterometers covering a range of common incidence angles. During these C-band scatterometry missions, different calibration campaigns have been carried out mainly relying on active ground transponders and natural distributed targets such as the rainforest. Additionally, these missions differ in time with some overlapping periods. Therefore, an assessment of the agreement between ERS and ASCAT measurements is an important and challenging task. This assessment is usually performed over the rainforest but only considering the common incidence angles. In order to perform the comparison over the whole incidence angle range of both radars, a Geophysical Model Function (GMF) is needed. An empirical correction of the CMOD5.n GMF has been suggested recently by KNMI resulting in a new GMF called CMOD6. This correction was derived from the comparison of the ASCAT backscatter measurements and the CMOD5.n model. Taking ASCAT's measurements as reference, the differences between the CMOD5.n and ASCAT measurements were attributed to GMF errors. Additionally, an overview of the existing C-band models is given. The comparison of these models shows relatively large differences. The aim of this paper is the assessment of the CMOD6 GMF using ERS-1 and ERS-2 ocean backscatter measurements and the validation of the applicability of the corrected GMF to the whole C-band scatterometry dataset. Finally, a method is suggested to calibrate the residual bias of all the C-band scatterometers w.r.t CMOD6. It is shown that after calibration a consistent scatterometer data model is obtained. © 2015 SPIE.","Backscattering; Calibration; Hydrophilicity; Radar; Remote sensing; Sea ice; C-Band scatterometers; Distributed target; Geophysical model function; Incidence angles; RADAR scatterometers; Scatterometer data; Scatterometers; Scatterometry; Meteorological instruments","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961842191"
