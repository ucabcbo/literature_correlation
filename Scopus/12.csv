Sea ice also presents one of the major natural disasters in the world. The automatic and accurate extraction of sea ice extent is of great significance for the study of climate change and disaster prevention. The accuracy of sea ice extraction in the Yellow River Estuary is low due to the large dynamic changes in the suspended particulate matter (SPM). In this study, a set of sea ice automatic extraction method systems combining image spectral information and textural information is developed. First, a sea ice spectral information index that can adapt to sea areas with different turbidity levels is developed to mine the spectral information of different types of sea ice. In addition, the image’s textural feature parameters and edge point density map are extracted to mine the spatial information concerning the sea ice. Then, multi-scale segmentation is performed on the image. Finally, the OTSU algorithm is used to determine the threshold to achieve automatic sea ice extraction. The method was successfully applied to Gaofen-1 (GF1), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 images, where the extraction accuracy of sea ice was over 93%, which was more than 5% higher than that of SVM and K-Means. At the same time, the method was applied to the Liaodong Bay area, and the extraction accuracy reached 99%. These findings reveal that the method exhibits good reliability and robustness. © 2022 by the authors.

This evaluation aims to confirm that the innovative design of the mission’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) meets the expectations of intended users. In this study, we provide an overview of initial results obtained for three high-priority applications; flood mapping, sea ice analysis, and wetland classification. In our study, the focus is on results obtained using not only linear polarization, but also the adopted Compact Polarimetric (CP) architecture in RCM. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba, suggesting smooth continuity between the two satellite missions for operational flood mapping. Visual analysis of coincident RCM CP and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. A statistical analysis using selected sea ice samples confirmed the increased contrast between thin and both rough and deformed ice in CP SAR. This finding is expected to enhance Canadian Ice Service’s (CIS) operational visual analysis of sea ice in RCM SAR imagery for ice chart production. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87.

With greater numbers of walruses hauling out in large aggregations, new opportunities are presented for monitoring the population. Here we evaluate different types of satellite imagery for detecting and delineating the peripheries of walrus aggregations at a commonly used haulout near Point Lay, Alaska, in 2018–2020. We evaluated optical and radar imagery ranging in pixel resolutions from 40 m to ~1 m: specifically, optical imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, Planet Labs, and DigitalGlobe, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. Three observers independently examined satellite images to detect walrus aggregations and digitized their peripheries using visual interpretation. We compared interpretations between observers and to high-resolution (~2 cm) ortho-corrected imagery collected by a small unoccupied aerial system (UAS). Roughly two-thirds of the time, clouds precluded clear optical views of the study area from satellite. SAR was unaffected by clouds (and darkness) and provided unambiguous signatures of walrus aggregations at the Point Lay haulout. Among imagery types with 4–10 m resolution, observers unanimously agreed on all detections of walruses, and attained an average 65% overlap (sd 12.0, n 100) in their delineations of aggregation boundaries. For imagery with ~1 m resolution, overlap agreement was higher (mean 85%, sd 3.0, n 11). We found that optical satellite sensors with moderate resolution and high revisitation rates, such as PlanetScope and Sentinel-2, demonstrated robust and repeatable qualities for monitoring walrus haulouts, but temporal gaps between observations due to clouds were common. SAR imagery also demonstrated robust capabilities for monitoring the Point Lay haulout, but more research is needed to evaluate SAR at haulouts with more complex local terrain and beach substrates. © 2021 by the authors.

These changes are most noticeable on small Arctic islands, once surrounded by thick ice fields but increasingly exposed to open water, thus making them of special interest. During the unique complex expedition ""Open Ocean: Archipelagoes of the Arctic. Severnaya Zemlya-2019"" on the Professor Molchanov research vessel in August-September 2019 full-scale field surveys of the islands and unmanned surveys from quadcopters were conducted. Subsequent surveys based on remote sensing data are intended to combine detailed field surveys with an overview coverage of these islands. Different nature of the islands requires applying different methods of studying their dynamics with remote sensing data. Changes in the islands' coastline are traced using a set of different time sources, i. e. the 1957 topographic map (1:200 000) and space images from Landsat 5, 7 satellites. The current situation is described according to cloud-free images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellites. Multiple interferometric images of Sentinel-IB (IW - Interferometric Wide Swath) radar system processing level SLC - Single Look Complex for 2019 supported a study of the seasonal dynamics of the Vize Island surface. The multiyear dynamics of ice edge retreat was revealed for the Ushakov Island. The retreat rate analysis proved the accelerated decrease of the ice cap area since the 2010-s. We accessed the influence of changing climatic conditions on the coastline dynamics of the Vize and Ushakov islands with due account of the wind speed and direction and the air temperature. Uneven coastal erosion is characteristic of the Vize Island, and the areas with the highest rate of coastline retreat were identified, as well as new accumulative forms, e. g. bars. Multitemporal composites with coherence obtained from the radar data made it possible to characterize the seasonal dynamics of the state of the Vize island surface and its dependence on variable weather conditions. The results of research show an obvious response of the small islands' coastlines to the climate changes of the 20th - 21st centuries. © 2022 Moskovskij Universitet.

However, a clear understanding of shorter-Term ice mélange dynamics is still lacking, mainly due to the high complexity and variability of the processes at play at the ice-ocean boundary. In this study, we use a combination of Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery to investigate in detail intra-seasonal ice mélange dynamics and its link to calving activity at three major outlet glaciers: Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, Helheim Glacier and Sermeq Kujalleq in Kangia (Jakobshavn Isbræ). In those fjords, we identified recurrent ice mélange weakening (IMW) episodes consisting of the up-fjord propagation of a discontinuity between jam-packed and weaker ice mélange towards the glacier terminus. At a late stage, i.e., when the IMW front approaches the glacier terminus, these episodes were often correlated with the occurrence of large-scale calving events. The IMW process is particularly visible at the front of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier and presents a cyclic behavior, such that we further analyzed IMW dynamics during the June-November period from 2018 to 2021 at this location. Throughout this period, we detected 30 IMW episodes with a recurrence time of 24gd, propagating over a median distance of 5.9gkm and for 17gd, resulting in a median propagation speed of 400gmgd-1. We found that 87g% of the IMW episodes occurred prior to a calving event visible in spaceborne observations and that g% of all detected calving events were preceded by an IMW episode. These results therefore present the IMW process as a clear control on the calving activity of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier. Finally, using a simple numerical model for ice mélange motion, we showed that a slightly biased random motion of ice floes without fluctuating external forcing can reproduce IMW events and their cyclic influence and explain observed propagation speeds. These results further support our observations in characterizing the IMW process as self-sustained through the existence of an IMW-calving feedback. This study therefore highlights the importance of short-Term ice mélange dynamics in the longer-Term evolution of Greenland outlet glaciers.  © 2023 Adrien Wehrlé et al.","Arctic; Greenland; Helheim Glacier; Kangerlussuaq Fjord; Kangiata Nunaata Sermia; Sermeq Avannarleq; atmospheric forcing; discontinuity; episodic event; fjord; ice-ocean interaction; iceberg calving; satellite imagery; Sentinel; tidewater glacier","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147899187"

Leads regulate the heat, gas and moisture fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere and are areas of high ice growth rates during periods of freezing conditions. Here, an algorithm providing an automatic lead detection based on synthetic aperture radar images is described that can be applied to a wide range of Sentinel-1 scenes. By using both the HH and the HV channels instead of single co-polarised observations the algorithm is able to classify more leads correctly. The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision-recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification. The algorithm is able to produce a lead classification with more that 90% precision with 60% of all leads classified. The precision can be increased by the cost of the amount of leads detected.

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

Due to the intense reflection and scattering of incident light, whitecaps can be effectively recognized and distinguished in in-situ photos or videos. Whitecap coverage (W), defined as the proportion of ocean surface covered by whitecaps, is an important parameter for the quantification of whitecaps. Of course, oceanic whitecaps can also be discriminated in high spatial resolution optical remote sensing images, such as Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data. This can provide a new research direction in marine environment observation, and may be further used for wind speed monitoring. However, how to estimate oceanic whitecap coverage from these optical remote sensing images is still a challenge. In this study, the formula of whitecap coverage is obtained by converting the form of radiative equation related with the constant and image reflectance of Sentinel-2 MSI data under some assumptions. The background signal of seawater and atmosphere was eliminated by data optimization, and the signal of whitecaps can be distinguished using regional filtering method. Then, whitecap coverage can be estimated. The identification and estimation results indicate that whitecap coverage derived from Sentinel-2 MSI images are consistent with previous studies using in situ observations in the order of magnitude, and can invert sea surface wind speed using a statistical model. Coarse spatial resolution wind speed images converted from MSI inversion were validated by ERA5 wind speed products from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In addition, whitecap coverage can imply the modulation of other marine environmental dynamic factors (e.g., water mass, ocean fronts, ocean eddies and internal waves). Moreover, it should be noted that sunglint reflection is a non-negligible issue for optical remote sensing of oceanic whitecaps whose signal should be effectively eliminated. Examining the MSI-derived results to HY1-C/D CZI, it indicates that whitecaps can be identified in CZI images when wind speed is greater than 9 m/s, and the reflectance difference between whitecaps and background seawater is 5.8%—8.3%. We hope the above results can be used to improve the accuracy of atmospheric correction, and provide new reference for using high spatial resolution optical remote sensing in sea surface wind speed estimation and marine environmental dynamic factors monitoring. This will hopefully expand the research and application fields of ocean color remote sensing. © 2023 Science Press.

This was done by comparing data from bio-optical models applied to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery with field samples from 12 campaigns ranging from 2016 to 2019 at the Jupia Reservoir (Brazil), along with analyzing the spectra of different atmospheric correction algorithms, in the search of possible natural effects that hampered the quality of the satellite-derived data. Compared water quality parameters were: Turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and Secchi disk depth. Results showed that, the data presented very low, if not inexistent, correlation. However, the error values estimated reflected that the data were not too far apart, despite having no correlation. The effects that may have caused the low correlation and the errors were analyzed through the retrieval of the spectra in the field sampling points. The compared spectra showed that, effects of haze caused by aerosols, bottom reflectance from optical depth and the presence of submerged plants were the most critical reflectance altering phenomena, which reflected in the extracted water quality data. Inelastic scattering, fluorescence and ozone layer influence were undetected, while the adjacency effect and Sun glint presented little to no effect on the data. Further focused analysis of these specific effects is a promising field of study in order to improve atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Inelastic scattering; Ozone layer; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Reservoirs (water); Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Water quality; Atmospheric corrections; Bio-optical models; Data quality; Sentinel-2; Water color; Remote sensing","Atmospheric correction; Bio-optical models; Data quality; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Water color; Water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077802609"

For sea ice applications, successfully discriminating returns between sea ice and open water is key for accurately determining freeboard (the extension of sea ice above local sea level) and new information regarding the geometry of sea ice floes and leads. We take advantage of near-coincident optical imagery obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite over the Western Weddell Sea of the Southern Ocean in March 2019 and the Lincoln Sea of the Arctic Ocean in May 2019 to evaluate the surface classification scheme in the ICESat-2 ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice products. We find a high level of agreement between the ATL07 (specular) lead classification and visible leads in the S-2 imagery in these two coincident images across all six ICESat-2 beams, increasing our confidence in the freeboard products and deriving new estimates of the sea ice state. The S-2 overlays provide additional, albeit limited, evidence of the misclassification of dark leads due to clouds. Dark leads are no longer used to derive sea surface and thus freeboard as of the third release (r003) of the ICESat-2 sea ice products. We show estimates of lead fraction and more preliminary estimates of chord length (a proxy for floe size) using two metrics for classifying sea surface (lead) segments across both the Arctic and Southern Ocean for the first winter season of data collection. © 2021.

Studies of sea ice ponds have predominantly focused on Arctic ponds formed by in situ melting/ponding. Our study documents another mechanism for the formation of sea ice ponds. Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images from the 2015-16 to 2018-19 austral summers, we analyze the evolution of sea ice ponds that form adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We find that each summer, meltwater flows from the ice shelf onto the sea ice and forms large (up to 9 km2) ponds. These ponds decrease the sea ice's albedo, thinning it. We suggest the added mass of runoff causes the ice to flex, potentially promoting sea-ice instability by the ice-shelf front. As surface melting on ice shelves increases, we suggest that ice-shelf surface hydrology will have a greater effect on sea-ice stability.

With the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, and the low sensitivity to atmospheric influences of Sentinel-1, a considerable quantity of ice floes is identified using a mathematical morphology method. Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity of segmented ice floes. It is tolerant to perturbations and deficiencies of floe shapes, which enhances the density of retrieved sea ice motion vectors. The PHD algorithm can be applied to sequential images from different sensors, and was tested on two combined image mosaics consisting of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data acquired over the Fram Strait; the PHD algorithm successfully produced pairs of matched ice floes. The matching result has been verified using shape and surface texture similarity of the ice floes. Moreover, the present method can naturally be extended to the problem of multi-source sea ice image registration. © 2021 by the authors.

A typical example of a river confluence is the merging of the Volga and Oka rivers (Russia). This paper presents some new results on the Volga/Oka rivers confluence based on both 'in situ' measurements of hydrological characteristics in the MZ and on satellite observations. During the 'in situ' measurements a large set of data regarding velocity fields, chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature, turbidity, parameters of organic surface films etc. was obtained. It is found that significant differences between the hydrological characteristics of the Volga and Oka flows are observed at sufficiently large distances downstream the junction apex (about 10 river widths or more); and the mixing zone remains quite narrow. Film sampling and further analysis of the surfactant films in the MZ were carried out. It is shown that the surface tension decreases and the film elasticity grows in the foam/slick bands separating the Volga and Oka flows thus indicating the increased concentration of surfactants in the bands. Satellite images of the Volga-Oka MZ are collected indicating that the confluence area is clearly seen in satellite optical imagery (MSI Sentinel-2 satellite) due to strong difference in color between the flows. The radar imagery shows the mixing zone in the form of a slick/foam band (SAR Sentinel-1) which manifests on the water surface due to enhanced damping of short wind waves. © 2019 SPIE.","Hydrophilicity; Image enhancement; Mixing; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; River pollution; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Surface active agents; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Velocity; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Hydrological characteristics; Mixing zones; Radar imagery; River confluence; Satellite observations; Satellite optical imagery; Slicks; Rivers","Mixing zone; River confluence; Satellite optical and radar imagery; Slicks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077796874"

The fraction and distribution of melt ponds have considerable impacts on Arctic climate and ecosystem by reducing the albedo. There is an urgency to obtain improved accuracy and a wider coverage of melt pond fraction (MPF) data for studying these processes. MPF information has generally been acquired from optical imagery. Conventional MPF algorithms based on high-resolution optical sensors have treated melt ponds as features with constant reflectance; however, the spectral reflectance of ponds can vary greatly, even at a local scale. Here we use Sentinel-2 imagery to demonstrate those previous algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance greatly underestimate MPF. We propose a new algorithm (“LinearPolar”) based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance features and calculates MPF across the vector between melt pond and bare ice axes. The angular coordinate θ of the polar coordinate system, which is only associated with pond fraction rather than reflectance, is used to determinate MPF. By comparing the new algorithm and previous methods with IceBridge optical imagery data, across a variety of Sentinel-2 images with melt ponds at various stages of development, we show that the RMSE value of the LinearPolar algorithm is about 30% lower than for the previous algorithms. Moreover, based on a sensitivity test, the new algorithm is also less sensitive to the subjective threshold for melt pond reflectance than previous algorithms. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

In this paper we used Ocean Color Data for two periods: 1999-2006 and 2007-2013, plus 2 recent years (2019 and 2020). Results of these periods were comparing between each other. About 50% of the scenes from the obtained data are covered by clouds due to difficult weather conditions over the Caspian Sea - a frequent changes of air masses in all seasons of the year. Among cloudless scenes, on average, vortex structures occur on 20-30% of scenes. According to the results of the analysis of the data obtained, a predominance of submesoscale cyclones and anticyclones is noted. It was noted that vortex structures were mainly found in the shelf zone of the Caspian Sea. More intense vortex formation is observed in the South Caspian. The main reasons for their formation: the flow of river runoff, complex bottom and coastal topography, the vorticity of the wind field, shear instability at the periphery of the main circulation elements.

Multiple procedures to calibrate and modelling SDB calculation were tested. Regarding to these procedures, the following approaches were studied: i) Based on TOA and WL reflectance, a linear regression, as proposed by Stumpf et al.[3], and a quadratic regression to modelling the SDB algorithm were tested; (ii) several in situ data sets acquired at different epochs were used in order to investigate the dependency of the temporal and the spatial density of the calibration sample; (iii) The tidal level was considered in order to provide a tide height at the time of image acquisition to depth models calibration. Numerous SDB models from Sentinel-2 imagery were derived and compared with a reference hydrographic survey data. The results show that SDB models present a good level of reliability regardless of the acquisition date or source of the in situ datasets. Coefficients of determination (R2) higher than 50% were obtained for the majority of the tested procedures. The quadratic modelling approach also appear to retrieve SDB models in agreement with hydrographic surveys data. In addition, the results demonstrate that the SDB information is influenced by the spatial density variation of the calibration datasets. Furthermore, the operational capabilities of the synergy of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to derive SDB information in shallow waters will be briefly discussed. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Calibration; Hydrographic surveys; Hydrophilicity; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Calibration samples; Earth observations; Empirical algorithms; High resolution remote sensing; Operational capabilities; Quadratic regression; SAR imagery; Sentinel data; Remote sensing","Earth Observation; Optical and SAR imagery; Satellite-Derived Bathymetry; Sentinel data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056464443"

Climate change due to anthropogenic activities is inducing global warming that, for example, has resulted in glacier melting. This has had a significant impact on sea levels and ocean circulation. In this study, the temporal trend of the marine-terminated d’Iberville glacier (Ellesmere Island, Canada) is analysed using C-band synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery collected by the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 missions. The data set consists of a time series of 10 synthetic aperture radar data collected from 2010 to 2022 in dual-polarimetric imaging mode, where a horizontally polarised electromagnetic wave was transmitted. An automatic approach based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate method is applied to the single- and dual-polarisation features, namely the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section and a combination of the HH- and HV-polarised scattering amplitudes, with the aim of extracting the ice front of the glacier and, therefore, estimating its behaviour over time. Independent collocated satellite optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument is also considered, where available, to support the experimental outcomes. The experimental results show that (1) the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section achieved better performance with respect to the dual-polarised feature, especially under the most challenging case of a sea-ice infested sea surface; (2) when the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section was considered, the ice front extraction methodology provided a satisfactory accuracy, i.e., a root mean square error spanning from about 1.1 pixels to 3.4 pixels, depending on the sea-surface conditions; and (3) the d’Iberville glacier exhibited, during the study period, a significant retreat whose average surface velocity was 160 m per year, resulting in a net ice area loss of 2.2 km2 (0.18 km2 per year). These outcomes demonstrate that the d’Iberville glacier is behaving as most of the marine-terminated glaciers in the study area while experiencing a larger ice loss. © 2022 by the authors.","Electromagnetic waves; Extraction; Global warming; Mean square error; Pixels; Polarization; Radar cross section; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Sea level; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Anthropogenic activity; C-band SAR; C-bands; Canada; D’iberville glacier; Ice front extraction; Multi-polarization; Normalized radar cross section; Polar Regions; SAR imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","C-band SAR; Canada; d’Iberville glacier; ice front extraction; polarisation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144421612"

In this study, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 by developing sea ice information indexes using 300 m resolution Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images. We assessed and validated the index performance using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images with higher spatial resolution. The results indicate that the proposed Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (NDSIIIOLCI), which is based on OLCI Bands 20 and 21, can be used to rapidly and effectively detect sea ice but is somewhat affected by the turbidity of the seawater in the southern Bohai Sea. The novel Enhanced Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (ENDSIIIOLCI), which builds on NDSIIIOLCI by also considering OLCI Bands 12 and 16, can monitor sea ice more accurately and effectively than NDSIIIOLCI and suffers less from interference from turbidity. The spatiotemporal evolution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 was successfully monitored by ENDSIIIOLCI.

Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which is the NASA's latest altimeter satellite based on the green laser (532 nm), observes the global surface elevation. When compared to the CryoSat-2 altimetry satellite whose along-track resolution is 250 m, ICESat-2 is highly expected to provide much more detailed information about Arctic melt ponds thanks to its high alongtrack resolution of 70 cm. The basic products of ICESat-2 are the surface height and the number of reflected photons. To aggregate the neighboring information of a specific ICESat-2 photon, the segments of photons with 10 m length were used. The standard deviation of the height and the total number of photons were calculated for each segment. As the melt ponds have the smoother surface than the sea ice, the lower variation of the height over melt ponds can make the melt ponds distinguished from the sea ice. When the melt ponds were extracted, the number of photons per segment was used to classify the melt ponds covered with open-water and specular ice. As photons are much more absorbed in the water-covered melt ponds than the melt ponds with the specular ice, the number of photons per segment can distinguish the water- and ice-covered ponds. As a result, the suggested melt pond detection method was able to classify the sea ice, water-covered melt ponds, and ice-covered melt ponds. A qualitative analysis was conducted using the Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The suggested method successfully classified the water- and ice-covered ponds which were difficult to distinguish with Sentinel-2 optical images. Lastly, the pros and cons of the melt pond detection using satellite altimetry and optical images were discussed. © 2021 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.","","Altimetry; ICESat-2; Melt pond; Photon count; Photon height; Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119160076"

It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel-3 and GIS.

However, detailed dynamic precursors and drivers prior to a fast-calving process remain unclear due to sparse remote sensing observations. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation on hydrological and kinematic precursors before the calving event on 26 July 2017 of Petermann Glacier in northern Greenland, by jointly using remote sensing observations at high-temporal resolution and an ice-flow model. Time series of ice-flow velocity fields during July 2017 were retrieved with Sentinel-2 observations with a sub-weekly sampling interval. The ice-flow speed quickly reached 30 m/d on 26 July (the day before the calving), which is roughly 10 times quicker than the mean glacier velocity. Additionally, a significant decrease in the radar backscatter coefficient of Sentinel-1 images suggests a rapid transformation from landfast sea ice into open water, associated with a decrease in sea ice extent. Additionally, the area of melt ponds on the floating ice tongue began to increase in mid-May, quickly reached a peak at the end of June and lasted for nearly one month until the calving occurred. We used the ice sheet system model to model the spatial-temporal damage and stress on the floating ice, thereby finding an abnormal stress distribution in a cracked region. It is inferred that this calving event may relate to a weakening of the sea ice, shearing of the tributary glacier, and meltwater infiltrating crevasses. © 2021 by the authors.

This water area in the period of intense chromaticity of cyanobacteria is distinguished by their completely heterogeneous spatial-temporal distribution with scales of patchiness from several tens of meters and high temporal variability. For this reason, direct methods of ""spot"" measurements in place on water samples in a small part of the reservoir for 3 hours relative to the satellite's span do not provide us with reliable and statistically proved data. In this regard, the work proposed an original method of high-performance sub-satellite synchronous measurements of the brightness of the water column, concentrations of Chl-a and TSM with a fluorescent lidar onboard a high-speed vessel. This technique is provided with a spatial (8 m) and a temporary (1 s) resolution. Based on this, 4 independent regional models for the recovery of Chl-a concentrations, as well as TSM were developed based on in-situ measurements of the brightness of the water surface, or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images. To ensure the possibility of using satellite images, the analysis of atmospheric correction algorithms was performed and the best one was determined. The proposed models can be used for regular environmental monitoring of the Gorky Reservoir according to the in-situ ship measurements of the brightness of the water surface or from Sentinel-2 / MSI images.

An important part of our work was accumulation of remote sensing data as the first step in evaluation of circulation patterns and vortex structures presented on the sea surface. An analyzed remote sensing data include color composite images from MSI Sentinel-2, OLI Landsat-8 and ETM+ Landsat-7 as well as radar images from Sentinel-1 and Radardsat-2 that also provide a powerful tool for an identification of circulation processes on the sea surface. Continuous monitoring of the Southeastern Baltic Sea with an analysis of satellite visual and radar images show that the Gulf of Gdańsk is the most frequent area with mesoscale and submesoscale eddies. They appear in this area mostly in summer and mainly under the atmospheric influence. Some eddies remain stable for at least of 8 days and could be easily tracked on color composite images. The other area of the vortex structure was determined to the north of the Cape Taran.

We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions.

Monitoring and mitigation efforts along remote Arctic rivers are possible but logistically complex. In recent years, Earth observation programs have emerged based on spaceborne sensors that record large parts of the Earth's surface at a regular interval and with fast downlink. Most optical satellites have a similar sun-synchronous orbit, and have thus an akin ground track. When different sun-synchronous missions are combined this results in near-simultaneous acquisitions, which make it possible to monitor fast displacements that occur at or near the Earth's surface over large scales. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a new monitoring system; one of observing river ice movement. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-satellite monitoring system by combining data from freely available medium- and coarse-resolution satellites, in this study that is Sentinel-2 and PROBA-V. Velocities of floating river ice during the spring of 2016 are estimated over a more than 700 km long reach of the Lena River in Russia. In order to achieve automatic velocity estimates at such scales, efficient and river-ice specific processing steps are included. Entropy filters are used to detect regions of high contrast and neglects open water or an intact ice cover, and also help the image matching. Post-processing is done through filtering on the general flow direction, stemming from a global river mask dataset. In all, this study shows the potential of extracting river ice movement from a combination of low and medium resolution satellite sensors in sun-synchronous orbit. © 2021 The Author(s)","Lena River; Russian Federation; Satellites; Varanidae; ice breakup; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sentinel; spatial resolution","Mini-satellite; Multi-sensor; PROBA-V; River-ice movement monitoring; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120716404"

Accurate extraction of sea ice types is of great significance on sea ice conditions assessment, smooth navigation and safty marine operations. Sentinel-2 is an optical satellite launched by the European Space Agency. High spatial resolution and wide range imaging provide powerful support for sea ice monitoring. However, traditional supervised classification method is difficult to achieve fine results for small sample features. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposed a sea ice extraction method based on deep learning and it was applied to Liaodong Bay in Bohai Sea, China. The convolutional neural network was used to extract and classify the feature of the image from Sentinel-2. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the algorithm was 85.79% which presented a significant improvement compared with the tranditional algorithms, such as minimum distance method, maximum likelihood method, Mahalanobis distance method, and support vector machine method.

Despite an exponential increase in the amount of data on plastic in the five existing ocean gyres, trends in the Arctic Ocean remain scarce, requiring innovative solutions to monitor the growing situation. The cost of ocean plastic pollution on land and in the ocean is estimated in the trillions impacting fisheries, marine mammals, businesses, and air quality, to name a few. Although satellites have evolved immensely, there continue to be difficulties with optical resolution, ocean surface penetration and underwater communication. For the Arctic, the geophysical characteristics and presence of sea ice and cloud formations add a degree of complexity for researchers to detect and track microplastic calling for innovative solutions. This interdisciplinary team project paper investigates the use of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-6, Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, high altitude balloons, and autonomous underwater vehicles to provide an integrated strategy for tracking marine plastic pollution while recognizing that it is necessary to also prevent plastics from entering the ocean in the first place. After replicating Biermann et al. study [1], a correlation was observed between the clustering of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Floating Debris Index allowing the potential to locate possible plastic debris accumulations in the Arctic Ocean faster than with the original study. Following our experiment, it was found that through the combined efforts of marine, air, and space technologies we can provide year-round monitoring of marine plastic pollution. The general cost of the operations was considered in tandem with an overview of the financial loss and societal burden of ocean plastic. Included in the paper are recommendations for future research to close identified knowledge gaps in marine plastic research and satellite technology.

It is therefore of great importance to estimate the annual iceberg encounter frequencies to select robust concepts for offshore field development, to design offshore structures and possibly to plan ice management operations. These encounter frequencies are often estimated using numerical models. Regardless of the model, considerable uncertainties often exist in the input data of icebergs at the sources, i.e., the annual number of icebergs released at the source and their size characteristics. The aim of this work is to reduce these uncertainties by utilizing state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing data and a complementary numerical model of iceberg drift and deterioration. Iceberg length and width distributions derived using Sentinel-2 optical imagery are presented at the major iceberg sources in the Barents Sea, which are Franz Josef Land, the eastern side of Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya. Over 22,000 icebergs were manually identified, with the largest observed iceberg being approximately 1 km long, originating from Franz Josef Land. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to estimate the annual number of icebergs released into the Barents Sea by comparing the model results against Copernicus iceberg density data derived from the satellite synthetic aperture radar system onboard Sentinel-1. The importance of satellite remote sensing data cannot be understated because it is undoubtedly the best way to calibrate and validate the results of numerical iceberg drift models. Finally, with the calibrated model and the derived iceberg size, a map of the Barents Sea with updated annual iceberg encounter frequencies is presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Deterioration; Glacial geology; Numerical models; Offshore oil well production; Offshore structures; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea level; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Calibrated model; Ice management; Iceberg drifts; Offshore field development; Offshore installations; Optical imagery; Satellite remote sensing data; State of the art; complementarity; drift (glacial deposit); iceberg; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; uncertainty analysis; Sea ice","Barents Sea; Iceberg drift model; Iceberg production; Iceberg size characteristics; Sentinel satellites","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089223992"

In this paper, the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea in China were monitored using Sentinel-2 remote sensing data during the freezing period from January to March in 2018. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the spectral characteristics of seawater and sea ice in visible bands, supplemented by the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we proposed a new method based on decision tree classification for extracting sea ice types in Liaodong Bay of Bohai Sea. Using the remote sensing data of eight satellite overpasses acquired from Sentinel-2A/B satellites, the distribution and area of the different sea ice types in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period of 2017/2018 were obtained. Compared with the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method and the support vector machine (SVM) classification method, the proposed method has higher accuracy when discriminating the sea ice types, which proved the new method proposed in this paper is suitable for extracting sea ice types from Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data in Liaodong Bay. And its classification accuracy reaches 88.05%. The whole process of evolution such as the growth and development of sea ice in Liaodong Bay during the freezing period from January to March in 2018 was monitored. The maximum area of sea ice was detected on 27 January 2018, about 10,187 km2. At last, the quantitative relationship model between the sea ice area and the mean near-surface temperature derived by MODIS data in Liaodong Bay was established.

To relate behaviors with environmental variables, features must be evaluated at scales relevant to the animal or behavior. Remotely sensed environmental data, collected via satellites, often suffers from the effects of cloud cover and lacks the spatial or temporal resolution to adequately link with individual animal behaviors or behavioral bouts. This study establishes a new method for remotely and continuously quantifying surface ice concentration (SIC) at a scale relevant to individual whales using on-animal tag video data. Results: Motion-sensing and video-recording suction cup tags were deployed on 7 Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaerensis) around the Antarctic Peninsula in February and March of 2018. To compare the scale of camera-tag observations with satellite imagery, the area of view was simulated using camera-tag parameters. For expected conditions, we found the visible area maximum to be ~ 100m2 which indicates that observations occur at an equivalent or finer scale than a single pixel of high-resolution visible spectrum satellite imagery. SIC was classified into one of six bins (0%, 1-20%, 21-40%, 41-60%, 61-80%, 81-100%) by two independent observers for the initial and final surfacing between dives. In the event of a disagreement, a third independent observer was introduced, and the median of the three observer's values was used. Initial results (n = 6) show that Antarctic minke whales in the coastal bays of the Antarctic Peninsula spend 52% of their time in open water, and only 15% of their time in water with SIC greater than 20%. Over time, we find significant variation in observed SIC, indicating that Antarctic minke occupy an extremely dynamic environment. Sentinel-2 satellite-based approaches of sea ice assessment were not possible because of persistent cloud cover during the study period. Conclusion: Tag-video offers a means to evaluate ice concentration at spatial and temporal scales relevant to the individual. Combined with information on underwater behavior, our ability to quantify SIC continuously at the scale of the animal will improve upon current remote sensing methods to understand the link between animal behavior and these dynamic environmental variables. © 2020 The Author(s).","","Antarctic Peninsula; Biologging; Ice concentration; Minke whale; Sea ice; Tag-video","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092569971"

Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more accurate information on melt ponds on Arctic sea ice by remote sensing. The present large-scale melt pond products, especially the melt pond fraction (MPF), still require verification, and using very high resolution optical satellite remote sensing data is a good way to verify the large-scale retrieval of MPF products. Unlike most MPF algorithms using very high resolution data, the LinearPolar algorithm using Sentinel-2 data considers the albedo of melt ponds unfixed. In this paper, by selecting the best band combination, we applied this algorithm to Landsat 8 (L8) data. Moreover, Sentinel-2 data, as well as support vector machine (SVM) and iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithms, are used as the comparison and verification data. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the LinearPolar algorithm for melt ponds is higher than that of previous algorithms. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient results achieved by using the LinearPolar algorithm with L8 and Sentinel-2A (S2), the SVM algo-rithm, and the ISODATA algorithm are 95.38% and 0.88, 94.73% and 0.86, and 92.40%and 0.80, respectively, which are much higher than those of principal component analysis (PCA) and Markus algorithms. The mean MPF (10.0%) obtained from 80 cases from L8 data based on the LinearPolar algorithm is much closer to Sentinel-2 (10.9%) than the Markus (5.0%) and PCA algorithms (4.2%), with a mean MPF difference of only 0.9%, and the correlation coefficients of the two MPFs are as high as 0.95. The overall relative error of the LinearPolar algorithm is 53.5% and 46.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 30.9% and 27.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively. In the cases with-out obvious melt ponds, the relative error is reduced more than that of those with obvious melt ponds because the LinearPolar algorithm can identify 100% of dark melt ponds and relatively small melt ponds, and the latter contributes more to the reduction in the relative error of MPF retrieval.

Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions. © 2022 American Geophysical Union.

One basic tool to monitor dynamical changes is to analyze and compare the compressibility of image patches using their Normalized Compression Distances. These distances can be converted into similarity matrices providing reliable maps of surface changes. The accuracy of these change maps was quantified for several typical test cases. In addition, we analyzed the performance of an alternative active learning approach, where Gabor filters and Weber local descriptors were used to extract features from image patches that were classified and semantically annotated.

We tested the methodology on Sentinel-2A images from 10 June and 3 July, 2017, and selected five floes present in both images. We further added ten ""false samples""in the second image.

Due to the different spectral properties of open water, melt pond and sea ice, the melt pond fraction (MPF) can be retrieved using a fully constrained least-squares algorithm, which shows a high accuracy with root mean square error ~0.06 based on the validation experiment using WorldView-2 image. In this study, the evolution of ponds on first-year and multiyear ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was compared based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images. The relationships of pond coverage with air temperature and albedo were analysed. The results show that the pond coverage on first-year ice changed dramatically with seasonal maximum of 54%, whereas that on multiyear ice changed relatively flat with only 30% during the entire melting period. During the stage of pond formation, the ponds expanded rapidly when the temperature increased to over 0°C for three consecutive days. Sea-ice albedo shows a significantly negative correlation (R =-1) with the MPF in melt season and increases gradually with the refreezing of ponds and sea ice.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

The analysis of sea ice in SAR images is challenging because of the thermal noise effects and ambiguities in the radar backscatter for certain conditions that include the reflection of complex information from sea ice surfaces. We use manually annotated SAR images containing various sea ice types to construct a dataset for our Deep Learning (DL) analysis. To avoid contamination between classes we use a combination of near-simultaneous SAR images from S1 and fine resolution cloud-free optical data from Sentinel-2 (S2). For the classification, we use data augmentation to adjust for the imbalance of sea ice type classes in the training data. The SAR images are divided into small patches which are processed one at a time. We demonstrate that the combination of data augmentation and training of a proposed modified Visual Geometric Group 16-layer (VGG-16) network, trained from scratch, significantly improves the classification performance, compared to the original VGG-16 model and an ad hoc CNN model.

In this study, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) for pixel-based ice Stage of Development classification for the Baltic Sea using Landsat-8 optical satellite imagery to provide up-to-date ice information for Near-Real-Time maritime applications. In order to train the network, we labeled the ice regions shown in the Landsat-8 imagery with classes from the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) ice charts. These charts are routinely produced and distributed by the BSH Sea Ice Department. The compiled data set for the Baltic Sea region consists of 164 ice charts from 2014 to 2021 and contains ice types classified by the Stage of Development. Landsat-8 level 1 (L1b) images that could be overlaid with the available BSH ice charts based on the time of acquisition were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) global archive and indexed in a data cube for better handling. The input variables of the DNN are the individual spectral bands: aerosol coastal, blue, green, red and near-infrared (NIR) out of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor. The bands were selected based on the reflectance and emission properties of sea ice. The output values are 4 ice classes of Stage of Development and Ice Free. The results obtained show significant improvements compared to the available BSH ice charts when moving from polygons to pixels, preserving the original classes. The classification model has an accuracy of 87.5% based on the test data set excluded from the training and validation process. Using optical imagery can therefore add value to maritime safety and navigation in ice-infested waters by high resolution and real-time availability. Furthermore, the obtained results can be extended to other optical satellite imagery such as Sentinel-2. Our approach is promising for automated Near-Real-Time (NRT) services, which can be deployed and integrated at a later stage at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) ground station in Neustrelitz. © 2022 by the authors.

To solve this problem, a technique based on the fusion of optical image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for the extraction of sea ice is proposed in this paper. The Band 2 (B2) image of Sentinel-2 (S2) in the research area is selected as optical image data. Preprocessing on the optical image, such as resampling, projection transformation and format conversion, are conducted to the S2 dataset before fusion. Imaging characteristics of the sea ice have been analyzed, and a new deep learning (DL) model, OceanTDL5, is built to detect sea ices. The fusion of the Sentinel-1 (S1) and S2 images is realized by solving the optimal pixel values based on deriving Poisson Equation. The experimental results indicate that the use of a fused image improves the accuracy of sea ice detection compared with the use of a single data source. The fused image has richer spatial details and a clearer texture compared with the original optical image, and its material sense and color are more abundant. © 2021, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","","image fusion; optical image; Poisson Equation; SAR image; sea ice detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103348455"

In this study, we provide results update on RCM performance for selected SAR applications. The RCM was designed to address three core applications-disaster management, maritime surveillance, and ecosystem monitoring. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba. Visual analysis of coincident RCM compact polarimetric and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87. © 2022 IEEE.","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Floods; Image enhancement; Mapping; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Compact polarimetries; Constellation missions; Dual-polarized; Flood mapping; Operation phasis; Performance; Radarsat; RADARSAT constellation mission; Sea ice analyse; Wetland classification; Sea ice","Compact Polarimetry; flood mapping; RCM; sea ice analysis; wetland classification","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140366392"

Satellite imagery, in particular Sentinel-2 (S2), may enable large-scale monitoring of coastal areas in Greenland but its use is impacted by the optically complex environments and the scarcity of supporting data in the region. Additionally, the canopies of the dominant macrophyte species in Greenland do not extend to the sea surface, limiting the use of indices that exploit the reflection of near-infrared radiation by vegetation due to its absorption by seawater. Three hypotheses are tested: I) 10-m S2 imagery and commonly used detection methods can identify intertidal macrophytes that are exposed at low tide in an optically complex fjord system in Greenland impacted by marine and land terminating glaciers; II) detached and floating macrophytes accumulate in patches that are sufficiently large to be detected by 10-m S2 images; III) iceberg scour and/or turbid meltwater runoff shape the spatial distribution of intertidal macroalgae in fjord systems with marine-terminating glaciers. The NDVI produced the best results in optically complex fjord systems in Greenland. 12 km2 of exposed intertidal macrophytes were identified in the study area at low tide. Floating mats of macrophytes ranged in area from 400 m2 to 326,800 m2 and were most common at the mouth of the fjord. Icebergs and turbidity appear to play a role in structuring the distribution of intertidal macrophytes and the retreat of marine terminating glaciers could allow macrophytes cover to expand. The challenges and solutions presented here apply to most fjords in Greenland and, therefore, the methodology may be extended to produce a Greenland-wide estimate of intertidal macrophytes. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic Regions; Estuaries; Greenland; Satellite Imagery; Seawater; Arctic; Greenland; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Infrared reflection; Optical remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Surface waters; Vegetation mapping; sea water; Blue carbon; Coastal area; Complex environments; Green land; Large-scale monitoring; Macro-algae; Macrophytes; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; macroalga; macrophyte; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vegetation index; Arctic; estuary; Greenland; satellite imagery; Carbon","Blue carbon; Greenland; Macroalgae; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145666007"

The basis of the study was remote sensing data in the optical range, such as Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Terra/Aqua MODIS, as well as archival Landsat-5 TM data. Also, Sentinel-1 SAR-C and archival ERS-1/2 SAR and Envisat ASAR radar data were used. The main objectives of the study were: determination of areas occupied by ice, identification of trends in ice formation and clearing periods, their inter-annual variability. To solve the problem of determining the parameters of ice cover, we used the multisensory approach whenever possible, i.e. comprehensive integrated analysis of heterogeneous data. The analysis of a vast array of satellite data, differing in nature and spatial resolution, and ice mapping was carried out using the toolkit of the See the Sea (STS) information system developed at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI RAS). STS enables working with multi-year archival data, conduct joint analysis of different satellite data together with hydrometeorological information. It was found that during the study period, from the 1998-1999 winter to the present time, the largest area of ice cover of over 90,000 sq. km was observed in the 2011/2012 winter period. Ice was observed even in the bays of the Southern Caspian. Another direction of research, the results of which are presented, is the identification of capabilities and limitations in the use of satellite data obtained in different ranges (radar and optical) and at different polarizations. © 2019 SPIE.","Geodetic satellites; Hydrophilicity; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Space optics; Space research; Synthetic aperture radar; Caspian sea; Interannual variability; Ocean color; Remote sensing data; Russian Academy of Sciences; Satellite monitoring; Satellite radar; Space research institute; Space-based radar","Ocean Color Data; Satellite radar observation; Sea ice; The Caspian Sea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077786983"

The often observation of the film near aquaculture facilities has raised awareness on the possibility of the linkage between the development of the film and the anthropogenic activities taking place on site (i.e. artificial feeding and liquid waste). This study aims to investigate the possibility of the detection of biogenic oil film on optical satellite images and discriminate it from other oceanographic phenomena. For the purposes of the study we have used a Sentinel-2 (S2) dataset consisted of 73 images for the year 2019 to detect the film on three aquaculture areas. An automatic procedure was developed on a Python based algorithm which included the following stages: (a) downloading images, (b) preprocessing the input data, (c) identifying dark formations in the adjacent fish farming area, (d) extracting attribute tables with the statistical characteristics of the formations (shape, area, etc.), (e) classification of formations as biogenic film or other (lookalike) and (f) extraction of biogenic film vectors. The developed algorithm was able to detect biogenic oil film successfully however some misleading results regarding the decision of true or false positive (biogenic oil film or lookalike) was evidenced. The efficiency of the algorithm was tested against manual classification with overall accuracy 82,6%. As further step the results of this study should be validated with in-situ measurements and further work is required to verify the results obtained by testing the methods in other sites.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

While previous work focused on the Arctic, this is the first lead-width distribution for Antarctic sea ice. Previous studies suggest that the lead-width distribution follows a power law with a positive exponent; however their results for the power-law exponents are not all in agreement with each other. To detect leads we create a sea-ice surface-type classification based on 20 carefully selected cloud-free Sentinel-2 Level-1C products, which have a resolution of 10 m. The observed time period is from November 2016 until February 2018, covering only the months from November to April. We apply two different fitting methods to the measured lead widths. The first fitting method is a linear fit, while the second method is based on a maximum likelihood approach. Here, we use both methods for the same lead-width data set to observe differences in the calculated power-law exponent. To further investigate influences on the power-law exponent, we define two different thresholds: One for open-water-covered leads and one for open-water-covered and nilas-covered leads. The influence of the lead threshold on the exponent is larger for the linear fit than for the method based on the maximum likelihood approach. We show that the exponent of the lead-width distribution ranges between 1.110 and 1.413 depending on the applied fitting method and lead threshold. This exponent for the Weddell Sea sea ice is smaller than the previously observed exponents for the Arctic sea ice.  © 2021 Marek Muchow et al.","Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Wadden Sea; detection method; ice cover; image resolution; sea ice; Sentinel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116313686"

Experiment shows that thermal images from MODIS is only useful in extracting lead area with coarse resolution, while the high-resolution SAR image could provide more information on sea ice type in lead. However, overlay of signals from different ice type largely reduces the overall accuracy from supervised classification of RadarSat-2 image. Therefore, decision tree is established to incorporate multisensory data. Characteristics of different ice types and leads is analyzed and utilized in decision tree to detect ice leads in different stages of development. Validation shows that overall accuracy of the result from decision tree is 14.8% higher than that from supervised classification. The sequential structure composed of various development stages of ice leads is confirmed in Sentinel-2 images. The result might facilitate accurate calculation of heat flux and ice production, as well as ship navigation with detail ice type in lead. © 2019, Editorial Department of Wuhan University of Technology.

The MultiSpectral Instrument on board the Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites of the European Space Agency offers new possibilities for Arctic research; S-2A and S-2B provide 13 spectral bands between 443 and 2,202 nm and spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m, which may enable the monitoring of large areas of Arctic sea ice. For an accurate retrieval of parameters such as surface albedo, the elimination of atmospheric influences in the data is essential. We therefore provide an evaluation of five currently available atmospheric correction processors for S-2 (ACOLITE, ATCOR, iCOR, Polymer, and Sen2Cor). We evaluate the results of the different processors using in situ spectral measurements of ice and snow and open water gathered north of Svalbard during RV Polarstern cruise PS106.1 in summer 2017. We used spectral shapes to assess performance for ice and snow surfaces. For open water, we additionally evaluated intensities. ACOLITE, ATCOR, and iCOR performed well over sea ice and Polymer generated the best results over open water. ATCOR, iCOR and Sen2Cor failed in the image-based retrieval of atmospheric parameters (aerosol optical thickness, water vapor). ACOLITE estimated AOT within the uncertainty range of AERONET measurements. Parameterization based on external data, therefore, was necessary to obtain reliable results. To illustrate consequences of processor selection on secondary products we computed average surface reflectance of six bands and normalized difference melt index (NDMI) on an image subset. Medians of average reflectance and NDMI range from 0.80–0.97 to 0.12–0.18 while medians for TOA are 0.75 and 0.06, respectively. © 2019 König, Hieronymi and Oppelt.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Reflection; Remote sensing; Snow; Space optics; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical thickness; Arctic; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric parameters; Multispectral instruments; Multispectral remote sensing; Normalized differences; Sentinel-2; atmospheric correction; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel; snow; Sea ice","Arctic; Atmospheric correction; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064226484"
