Nonetheless, effectively exploiting such intersensor synergies still raises important challenges for super-resolution (SR) algorithms in terms of operational data availability, sensor alignment and substantial resolution changes, among others. In this scenario, this article sets a new SR framework for spatially enhancing S3 ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) products by taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI). To achieve this goal, we initially study some of the most important deep learning-based approaches. Then, we define a novel Level-4 SR framework which integrates a new convolutional neural network specially designed for super-resolving OLCI data. In contrast to other networks, the proposed SR architecture (termed as SRS3) employs a dense multireceptive field together with a residual channel attention mechanism to relieve the particularly low spatial resolution of OLCI while extracting more discriminating features for the large spatial resolution differences with respect to MSI. The experimental part of the work, conducted using ten coupled OLCI and MSI operational data, reveals the suitability of the presented Level-4 SR framework within the Copernicus programme context as well as the advantages of the proposed architecture with respect different state-of-the-art models when spatially enhancing OLCI products.

Specifically, the proposed approach assembles a multi-spectral data fusion scheme together with a convolutinal neural network (CNN) mapping function to project the OLCI sensor onto its corresponding spatial reference which is synthetically generated by the OLCI/MSI fusion.

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques - a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images - were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods - based on different strategies and tools - have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.  © 2021 IEEE.","Hyperspectral imaging; Image fusion; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; Experimental comparison; Hyper-spectral images; Marine observations; Multispectral images; Qualitative analysis; Spatial resolution; State-of-the-art methods; Strategies and tools; Image analysis","Image fusion; Real data; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2 MSI; Sentinel-3 OLCI; Simulations","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112845236"

In the view of 21 spectral bands and a short revisit time of no more than two days, a Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) image could be the optimum data source in the near-real-time mapping of water bodies. However, the image is often limited by its low spatial resolution in practice. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a good solution to generate finer spatial resolution maps than the input data allows. In this paper, a multiscale spatiotemporal super-resolution mapping (MSST_SRM) method for water bodies is proposed, particularly for Sentinel-3 OLCI images. The proposed MSST_SRM method employs the integrated Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images calculated from four near-infrared (NIR) bands and Green Band 6 of the Sentinel-3 OLCI image as input data and combined the spectral, multispatial, and temporal terms into one objective function to generate a fine water body map. Two experiments in the Tibet Plate and Daye lakes were employed to test the effectiveness of the MSST_SRM method. Results revealed that by using multiscale spatial dependence under the framework of spatiotemporal super-resolution Mapping, MSST_SRM could generate finer water body maps than the hard classification method and the other three SRM-based methods. Therefore, the proposed MSST_SRM method shows marked efficiency and potential in water body mapping using Sentinel-3 OLCI images. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the synergies between both multi-spectral instruments are often difficult to exploit from an operational perspective. Standard pansharpening algorithms may encounter important disadvantages due to the limited intersensor data availability in actual production environments. Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3. Specifically, we define an inter-sensor image enhancement framework which combines a PCA-based component substitution pansharpening scheme with a CNN-based spatial enhancing super-resolution mapping.

However, the tradeoff between spatial resolution and swath size (and hence revisit time) means that SST products derived from remote sensing measurements commonly only have a moderate resolution (>1 km). In this article, we adapt the design of a super-resolution neural network architecture [specifically very deep super-resolution (VDSR)] to enhance the resolution of both top-of-atmosphere thermal images of sea regions and bottom-of-atmosphere SST images by a factor of 5. When tested on an unseen dataset, the trained neural network yields thermal images that have an RMSE $2-3\times $ smaller than interpolation, with a 6-9 dB improvement in PSNR. A major contribution of the proposed neural network architecture is that it fuses optical and thermal images to propagate the high-resolution information present in the optical image to the restored thermal image. To illustrate the potential benefits of using super-resolution (SR) in the context of oceanography, we present super-resolved SST images of a gyre and an ocean front, revealing details and features otherwise poorly resolved by moderate resolution satellite images. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atmospheric temperature; Deep learning; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Infrared detectors; Network architecture; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Earth observing satellite; Moderate resolution; Potential benefits; Satellite images; Sea surface temperature (SST); Spatial resolution; Top of atmospheres; Trained neural networks; gyre; imaging method; Landsat; satellite sensor; sea surface temperature; Sentinel; spatial resolution; Oceanography","Data fusion; deep learning; gyre; Landsat 8; ocean front; sea surface temperature (SST); Sentinel 3; super-resolution (SR); thermal infrared","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110870667"
