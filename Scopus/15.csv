In this paper, 10 multi-source (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Landsat-7) medium and high-resolution images from January to March 2018 are selected to monitor the sea ice in Liaodong Bay of the Bohai Sea. The sea and land segmentation is based on the normalized water body index. By analyzing the spectral characteristics of sea water and sea ice, the sea ice region is extracted by the maximum likelihood method, and the sea ice thickness is inverted by the exponential albedo model. The inversion results are compared with the ice thickness calculated by Zubov empirical model. The correlation coefficient is 0. 884, which proves the feasibility of medium high resolution optical remote sensing data in sea ice thickness inversion. At the same time, taking advantage of the medium and high resolution remote sensing data, using ice thickness information to extract sea ice types and estimate sea ice resources, it can provide reference for the prevention and mitigation of sea ice disaster and the utilization of sea ice resources in the Bohai Sea. © 2021 Science Press.

Here we present a first assessment of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) over individual Arctic sea ice melt ponds with different reflective properties. We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions. Characterizing the complex photon backscatter signals of melt ponds on sea ice is a first step toward automating retrievals of pond parameters such as width, melt pond fraction and depth, and improving higher-level ICESat-2 sea ice height and freeboard products. © 2020.
