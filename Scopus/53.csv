These applications are enabled by the Sentinel-3 OLCI space sensors of the European Earth Observation Copernicus programme and the VIIRS sensors of the US Joint Polar Satellite System programme. Key drivers for the Copernicus ocean colour services are the national obligations of the EU member states to report on the quality of marine, coastal and inland waters for the EU Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Further applications include CO2 sequestration, carbon cycle and climate, fisheries and aquaculture management, near-real-time alerting to harmful algae blooms, environmental monitoring and forecasting, and assessment of sediment transport in coastal waters. Ocean colour data from polar-orbiting satellite platforms, however, suffer from fractional coverage, primarily due to clouds, and inadequate resolution of quickly varying processes. Ocean colour remote sensing from geostationary platforms can provide significant improvements in coverage and sampling frequency and support new applications and services. EUMETSAT's SEVIRI instrument on the geostationary Meteosat Second Generation platforms (MSG) is not designed to meet ocean colour mission requirements, however, it has been demonstrated to provide valuable contribution, particularly in combination with dedicated ocean colour polar observations. This paper describes the ongoing effort to develop operational ocean colour water turbidity and related products and user services from SEVIRI. SEVIRI's multi-temporal capabilities can benefit users requiring improved local-area coverage and frequent diurnal observations. A survey of user requirements and a study of technical capabilities and limitations of the SEVIRI instruments are the basis for this development and are described in this paper. The products will support monitoring of sediment transport, water clarity, and tidal dynamics by providing hourly coverage and long-term time series of the diurnal observations. Further products and services are anticipated from EUMETSAT's FCI instruments on Meteosat Third Generation satellites (MTG), including potential chlorophyll a products. © Author(s) 2016.","algae; carbon sequestration; chlorophyll a; Meteosat; ocean color; satellite sensor; sediment transport; Sentinel; tidal cycle; time series analysis; turbidity; VIIRS; water quality","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971493176"

Information from different sensors may assist in the variable retrieval by limiting potential ambiguities. This involves observations at different spatial, spectral, temporal and angular resolutions, etc. Furthermore, using timely data is of much importance for vegetation monitoring in environmental modeling. While the other necessary variables for such models can be collected daily (e.g. meteorological variables), the temporal resolution of optical sensors (high to intermediate spatial resolutions) does not allow having temporally frequent products of vegetation characteristics due to the revisit time of the sensors and cloud coverage. A multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach applied to a temporal sequence of radiometric data acquired by different sensors can improve mapping and monitoring of vegetation state variables over time. Even when no observations are available due to cloudiness or orbital configuration, the prior retrievals are taken.The study provides a prototype proof of concept for a multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach to retrieve vegetation state variables using data collected by different imaging spectral-radiometers over time. Focus is given to the retrieval of LAI, fCover and chlorophyll content over the agricultural test site in Barrax, Spain. The approach is evaluated over a limited number of remotely sensed data acquired during a short period in the Sentinel-3 Experiment (SEN3EXP 2009) field campaign. A variety of satellite observations including CHRIS-Proba, Landsat TM and ASTER are integrated and combined by means of the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and through inversion of a coupled surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model. We applied the iterative Bayesian model inversion in which retrievals of the current observation are incorporated as prior information to the successor observation.This paper presents an overview of the results and challenges in utilizing the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and the Bayesian inversion technique in the retrieval of terrestrial vegetation properties. Overall, the accuracy obtained with data acquired by multiple sensors over time was higher than when using a single sensor. LAI and fCover were retrieved with RMSE= 0.7 (m2/m2) and 0.1 respectively (multiple sensors), while RMSE= 1.09 (m2/m2) and 0.15 respectively, when using data acquired by a single sensor. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Albacete [Castilla-La Mancha]; Barrax; Castilla-La Mancha; Spain; Proba; Bayesian networks; Iterative methods; Orbits; Radiative transfer; Radiometry; Sensitivity analysis; Bayesian model; CHRIS-PROBA; FCover; LAI; MODTRAN; Multi sensor; Multi-temporal; TOA radiance; ASTER; Bayesian analysis; biophysics; chlorophyll; CHRIS; data acquisition; environmental modeling; forest cover; integrated approach; Landsat thematic mapper; leaf area index; monitoring; Proba; radiative transfer; radiometric survey; satellite sensor; sensitivity analysis; Sentinel; spatial resolution; vegetation mapping; Vegetation","Bayesian model inversion; CHRIS-Proba; FCover; LAI; Multi-sensor; Multi-temporal; Sensitivity analysis; SLC-MODTRAN; TOA radiance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949115322"

In this work, we present the results of the preliminary RST algorithm implementation to thermal infrared (TIR) data, at 90 m spatial resolution, from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Results achieved under the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment, by analyzing 20 years of satellite observations over three active volcanoes (i.e., Etna, Shishaldin and Shinmoedake) located in different geographic areas, show that the RST-based system, hereafter named RASTer, detected a higher (around 25% more) number of thermal anomalies than the well-established ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA). Despite the availability of a less populated dataset than other sensors, the RST implementation on ASTER data guarantees an efficient identification and mapping of volcanic thermal features even of a low intensity level. To improve the temporal continuity of the active volcanoes monitoring, the possibility of exploiting RASTer is here addressed, in the perspective of an operational multi-satellite observing system. The latter could include mid-high spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2/MSI, Landsat-8/OLI), as well as those at higher-temporal (lower-spatial) resolution (e.g., EOS/MODIS, Suomi-NPP/VIIRS, Sentinel-3/SLSTR), for which RASTer could provide useful algorithm’s validation and training dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

In this article, we built an upsampling moving window network for regional crop growth monitoring (UMRCGM) model to estimate the two key biophysical parameters (BPs), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) during the main growth period of winter wheat by using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-3 optical images. Sentinel-1 imagery is unaffected by cloudy weather and Sentinel-3 imagery has a wide width and short revisit period, the organic combination of the two will greatly improve the ability to monitor crop growth at a regional scale. The impact of two different types of SAR information (intensity and polarization) on the estimation of the two BPs was further analyzed. The UMRCGM model optimized the correspondence between inputs and outputs, it had more accurate LAI and CCC estimates compared with the three classical machine learning models, and had the highest accuracy at the green-up stage of winter wheat, followed by the jointing stage and the heading-filling stage, and the lowest accuracy was found at the milk maturity stage. The estimation accuracies of CCC were slightly higher than that of LAI for the first three growth stages of winter wheat, while lower than that of LAI for the milk maturity stage. This article proposes a new method for regional BPs (especially for CCC) estimation by combining SAR and optical imagery with large differences in spatial resolution under a deep learning framework. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Chlorophyll; Crops; Deep learning; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Light polarization; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Canopy chlorophyll; Canopy chlorophyll content; Chlorophyll contents; Deep learning; Leaf Area Index; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal monitoring; Optical imaging; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1 and -3; biophysics; chlorophyll; growth; leaf area index; machine learning; monitoring; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; wheat; Synthetic aperture radar","Canopy chlorophyll content; deep learning; leaf area index; multitemporal monitoring; sentinel-1 and -3","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137596280"

Large-scale mid-infrared (MIR) emissivity can be efficiently obtained using remote sensing technology, but current methods mainly rely on prior knowledge and multi-temporal or multi-angle remote sensing images, and additional errors may be introduced due to the uncertainty of external data such as atmospheric profiles and the inconsistency of multiple source data in spatial resolution, observation time, and other information. In this paper, a new practical method was proposed which can retrieve MIR emissivity with only a single image input by combining the radiance properties of TIR and MIR channels and the spatial information of remote sensing images based on the Sentinel-3 Sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) data. Two split-window (SW) algorithms that use TIR channels only and MIR and TIR channels to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) were developed separately, and the initial values of MIR emissivity were obtained from the known LST and TIR emissivity. Under the assumption that the atmospheric conditions in the local area are constant, the radiance transfer equations for adjacent pixels are iterated to optimize the initial values to obtain stable estimation results. The experimental results based on the simulation dataset and real SLSTR images showed that the proposed method can achieve accurate MIR emissivity results. In future work, factors such as angular effects, solar radiance, and the influence of atmospheric water vapor will be further considered to improve performance. © 2022 by the authors.","Algorithms; Climate; Remote Sensing Technology; Temperature; algorithm; land surface; radiative transfer; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; algorithm; climate; remote sensing; temperature","land surface emissivity; middle infrared; remote sensing; Sentinel-3 SLSTR; split-window algorithm; thermal infrared","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145970299"

In particular, Sentinel-2 (S-2) data with improved high spatial resolution and higher revisit frequency (five days with the pair of satellites in operation) will play a fundamental role in recording land cover types and monitoring land cover changes at regular intervals. Nevertheless, cloud coverage usually hinders the time series availability and consequently the continuous land surface monitoring. In an attempt to alleviate this limitation, the synergistic use of instruments with different features is investigated, aiming at the future synergy of the S-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (S-3) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). To that end, an unmixing model is proposed with the intention of integrating the benefits of the two Sentinel missions, when both in orbit, in one composite image. The main goal is to fill the data gaps in the S-2 record, based on the more frequent information of the S-3 time series. The proposed fusion model has been applied on MODIS (MOD09GA L2G) and SPOT4 (Take 5) data and the experimental results have demonstrated that the approach has high potential. However, the different acquisition characteristics of the sensors, i.e. illumination and viewing geometry, should be taken into consideration and bidirectional effects correction has to be performed in order to reduce noise in the reflectance time series. © 2015 by the authors.","Data fusion; Satellite imagery; Time series; Bidirectional effects; High spatial resolution; Multi sensor; Multi-temporal; Multispectral instruments; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spectral unmixing; Temporal weights; Sensor data fusion","Data fusion; Multi-sensor; Multi-temporal; Spatial-spectral unmixing; Temporal weights","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945906996"

Therefore, using alternative images to generate moderate resolution burned area maps becomes critical to guarantee temporal continuity of these products. This paper presents the development of a hybrid algorithm based on Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) Synergy (SYN) data and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fires for global detection of burned areas. Using the synergistic and co-located measurements of OLCI and SLSTR instruments on board S3A and S3B, the SYN product offers global, near-daily surface reflectance data at 300 m for both sensors. Our algorithm relied on SYN shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to compute a multi-temporal separability index that enhanced the burn signal. Active fires from the VIIRS sensor were used to generate spatio-temporal clusters for determining local detection thresholds. Active fires were filtered from those thresholds to obtain the seeds from which a contextual growing was applied to extract burned patches. The algorithm was processed globally for 2019 data to generate a new burned area product, named FireCCIS310. Based on a stratified random sampling, error estimates showed an important reduction of omission errors versus other global burned area products while keeping the commission errors at a similar level (Oe = 41.2% ± 3.0%, Ce = 19.2% ± 1.7%). The new FireCCIS310 dataset included 4.99 million km2 for the year 2019, which implied around 1 million more than the precursor FireCCI51 product, based on MODIS 250 m reflectance values. Temporal reporting accuracy was improved as well, detecting 53% of the burned pixels within a 0–1 day difference. Besides, the new product was much less affected by the border effects than FireCCI51, as a result of an improved active fire filtering process.
