A method of estimating aerosol optical depth (AOD) using only angular retrieval has previously been demonstrated on data from the ENVISAT and PROBA-1 satellite instruments, and is extended here to the synergistic spectral and angular sampling of Sentinel-3. The method aims to improve the estimation of AOD, and to explore the estimation of fine mode fraction (FMF) and single scattering albedo (SSA) over land surfaces by inversion of a coupled surface/atmosphere radiative transfer model. The surface model includes a general physical model of angular and spectral surface reflectance. An iterative process is used to determine the optimum value of the aerosol properties providing the best fit of the corrected reflectance values to the physical model. The method is tested using hyperspectral, multi-angle Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) images. The values obtained from these CHRIS observations are validated using ground-based sun photometer measurements. Results from 22 image sets using the synergistic retrieval and improved aerosol models show an RMSE of 0.06 in AOD, reduced to 0.03 over vegetated targets. © Author(s) 2015.","aerosol property; CHRIS; data set; Envisat; optical depth; Proba; radiative transfer; satellite data; Sentinel; spectral analysis; synergism","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84927594245"

Large-scale mid-infrared (MIR) emissivity can be efficiently obtained using remote sensing technology, but current methods mainly rely on prior knowledge and multi-temporal or multi-angle remote sensing images, and additional errors may be introduced due to the uncertainty of external data such as atmospheric profiles and the inconsistency of multiple source data in spatial resolution, observation time, and other information. In this paper, a new practical method was proposed which can retrieve MIR emissivity with only a single image input by combining the radiance properties of TIR and MIR channels and the spatial information of remote sensing images based on the Sentinel-3 Sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) data. Two split-window (SW) algorithms that use TIR channels only and MIR and TIR channels to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) were developed separately, and the initial values of MIR emissivity were obtained from the known LST and TIR emissivity. Under the assumption that the atmospheric conditions in the local area are constant, the radiance transfer equations for adjacent pixels are iterated to optimize the initial values to obtain stable estimation results. The experimental results based on the simulation dataset and real SLSTR images showed that the proposed method can achieve accurate MIR emissivity results. In future work, factors such as angular effects, solar radiance, and the influence of atmospheric water vapor will be further considered to improve performance. © 2022 by the authors.","Algorithms; Climate; Remote Sensing Technology; Temperature; algorithm; land surface; radiative transfer; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; algorithm; climate; remote sensing; temperature","land surface emissivity; middle infrared; remote sensing; Sentinel-3 SLSTR; split-window algorithm; thermal infrared","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145970299"
