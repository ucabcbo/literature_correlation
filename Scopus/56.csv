This will identify whether there is any obstruction in the way of ice or not so that ship does not strike with ice. The desired results are obtained when SAR algorithm is connected on RADARl imagery data. They also studied the algorithm for the segmentation of ice known as pixel based segmentation which helps to differentiate ice based on its properties. Large number of methods has been utilized for multi temporal segmentation from the MODIS data which is known as TempoSeg strategy for multiyear sea ice. Synthetic Aperture Radar utilized the RADARSATl imagery data in order to detect the ice of sea at different regions of the seas. With the help of Rl imagery data better outcomes are provided by the automated algorithm.

For polar bears Ursus maritimus, the physical configuration of the habitat and conditions in which seals are hunted may change on intra- and inter-seasonal scales. Additionally, while the effects of climate change on polar bears have focused on linking reductions in sea ice to body condition and survival, the potential changes to on-ice hunting conditions have not been examined. Employing observational counts of seals killed by polar bears between early-April and late-May 1985-2011 (n = 650), we modelled the likelihood of predation events in the Beaufort Sea, Canada at multi-temporal scales. We used the top model to estimate the expected kill rate of seals in the springs of 1985-1986 and 2005-2006 and integrated the result with fasting rates derived from physiological markers in blood samples. A log-likelihood ratio test suggested a multi-temporal approach fit the seal kill data better than any single scale alone. Predation events were influenced by ringed seal Pusa hispida reproduction and haul-out behaviour, regional sea ice concentration and the phase of climatic indices. The expected kill rate from the top predation model and the estimated mean biomass of seal kills were significant predictors of polar bear fasting rates. Results suggest that 50% less seal biomass was killed in 2005-2006 than in 1985-1986, which correlates with a significant increase in the frequency of polar bears in a fasting state. We propose that the documented changes in polar bear fasting rates between 1985-1986 and 2005-2006 are due to a complex set of abiotic and biotic factors including underlying prey dynamics, rather than a single-scale environmental correlation. © 2015 The Authors.","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus; bear; biological invasion; biomass; biotic factor; body condition; climate change; empirical analysis; haulout behaviour; pinniped; predator-prey interaction; sea ice; survival","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939543524"

To solve the problem, this letter presents a change detection method based on convolutional-wavelet neural networks (CWNNs). In CWNN, dual-tree complex wavelet transform is introduced into convolutional neural networks for changed and unchanged pixels' classification, and then, the effect of speckle noise is effectively reduced. In addition, a virtual sample generation scheme is employed to create samples for CWNN training, and the problem of limited samples is alleviated.

Satellite remote sensing is an important tool to monitor variability in lake surface area, but monitoring depth is challenging. The distribution of bottomfast ice within a lake provides an indicator of depth and previous research shows that as lake ice develops and becomes bottomfast it exhibits a distinct signature when observed using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This research proposes an efficient computational technique for identifying bottom-fast ice across lakes in the Northwest Territories using multi-temporal SAR backscatter images and applies a function called dynamic time warping (DTW), which provides a shape-based similarity metric for time series data. We used backscatter profiles from surveyed lakes with known bottomfast ice to generate a DTW similarity metric on a pixel by pixel basis for a set of lakes. The similarity metric was used to categorize ice status as bottomfast or floating ice with 89.1% accuracy. DTW is an effective technique to map bottomfast ice using SAR time series and has potential to address limitations of other approaches where certain ice structures over deep lakes can produce backscatter responses similar to bottomfast ice. ©, Copyright © CASI.","Backscattering; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Lakes; Pixels; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface water resources; Time series; Backscatter profiles; Computational technique; Dynamic time warping; Multi-temporal SAR; Satellite remote sensing; Shape based similarities; Similarity metrics; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074606293"

Additionally, these charts may have been compiled using inadequate data and contain unsurveyed areas. However, with more days per year of diminished Arctic sea-ice coverage, including along the North Slope, marine transportation in this region has increased during the past decade, thus increasing the need for updated nautical charts. Due to limited resources available for U.S. Arctic surveying, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is evaluating the capabilities of satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). This technology has proven useful as a reconnaissance tool in tropical and subtropical waters and clear-water conditions, especially over sandy seafloor. But in the Arctic, glacial flour from land reduces water clarity and limits the light penetration depth, which may affect SDB calculations. A new multi-temporal SDB approach is described in this paper using multiple images to extract ""clear water"" areas acquired on different dates. As a proof-of-concept, the extinction depth and bathymetry were calculated over areas that overlap with NOAA Charts 16081 and 16082 using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery. The derived and charted bathymetry are similar in most areas up to 4.5 m deep. The results of the study also identified a potential uncharted shoal. The multi-temporal SDB approach was further investigated by NOAA and was used to process imagery for other areas along Alaska's North Slope. As a result, the new editions of NOAA Chart 16081 include the location of a potential uncharted shoal, which is the first time an SDB product was utilized for a NOAA chart. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.","Alaska; Arctic; North Slope; United States; bathymetry; ice cover; identification method; Landsat; navigation; NOAA satellite; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice","Arctic; navigation charts; satellite-derived bathymetry; water clarity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008684136"

We studied a 1.5 km stretch of coastline off Richard’s Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, consisting of multiple retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) with varying degrees of activity over a one-year period. Multi-temporal 2D and 3D geomorphic analysis was based on unmanned aerial vehicle-Structure-from-Motion (UAV-SfM) data sets collected in 2018 and 2019. Over the observation period, −3.9 m and −1.1 m of planimetric cliff edge and toe retreat occurred, respectively, and corresponded to an average volumetric change of 8.1 m3 m−1. The accuracy of UAV-SfM-derived digital elevation models was tested using 12 data collection and processing scenarios, testing the influence of off-nadir camera angle, flight pattern, and georeferencing strategy. We found that oblique imaging and georeferencing strategy had a large influence on vertical accuracy and variability across the study site and has implications for studying volumetric changes in RTSs. This study furthers the geomorphological understanding of RTS processes by highlighting the complex relationship between planimetric and volumetric change along rapidly retreating Arctic coasts, and demonstrates advancements in measurement practices for UAV-SfM data sets. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

This feasibility study presents an application of high-resolution optical images from operational satellites, which have become more available in polar regions, for sea ice motion and deformation measurements. The sea ice motion, i.e., Lagrangian vector, is measured by using a maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique and multi-temporal high-resolution images acquired on 14-15 August 2014 from multiple spaceborne sensors on board Korea Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSATs) with short acquisition time intervals. The sea ice motion extracted from the six image pairs of the spatial resolutions were resampled to 4 m and 15 m yields with vector length measurements of 57.7 m root mean square error (RMSE) and -11.4 m bias and 60.7 m RMSE and -13.5 m bias, respectively, compared with buoy location records. The errors from both resolutions indicate more accurate measurements than from conventional sea ice motion datasets from passive microwave and radar data in ice and water mixed surface conditions. In the results of sea ice deformation caused by interaction of individual ice floes, while free drift patterns of ice floes were delineated from the 4 m spatial resolution images, the deformation was less revealing in the 15 m spatial resolution image pairs due to emphasized discretization uncertainty from coarser pixel sizes. The results demonstrate that using multi-temporal high-resolution optical satellite images enabled precise image block matching in the melting season, thus this approach could be used for expanding sea ice motion and deformation dataset, with an advantage of frequent image acquisition capability in multiple areas by means of many operational satellites. © 2017 by the authors.

Then, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) was applied to the data sets to decompose signals into finite numbers of intrinsic mode functions and a residual mode: long time trend. This approach allowed us to understand the long-term variability of the RSP area and occurrence in response to atmospheric forcing through teleconnections between low and high latitudes by comparing the Nino3.4 and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) indices. The nonlinear trend of the RSP areas derived from the EEMD residual had an upward trending shift in the early 1990s and was fairly consistent with the nonlinear trend of Nino3.4. However, the trend of RSP occurrence time progressively increased and had a significant effect on the long time scale. The trend of the RSP area is significantly correlated (+0.98) with the ratio of the trend of the meridional to zonal wind components related with the nonlinearity of Nino3.4, suggesting that meridional wind stress dominated the changes of the polynya area in the Ross Sea. In addition, the nonlinear trends between the SAM and RSP occurrence time show a strong positive correlation, contributing to the earlier onset of polynya expansion and delayed connection with the open ocean owing to enhanced southerly winds. © 2018 The Author(s).

In the study area, the presence of permafrost makes the erosional coasts vulnerable to rising temperatures. The increase in air temperatures contributes to the thawing of coastal sediments and their accelerated destruction. And a decrease in sea ice area potentially increases the wave fetch. The rapidly changing climate of the Arctic should influence the processes of destruction of frozen coasts. At West Yamal Peninsula near Cape Kharasavey the average coastal retreat rate is 1.1 m per year (1977-2016) for 7 km of coastline. Based on the analysis of multi-temporal aerial and space images, it has been established that the maximum retreat rates are typical of coastal segments composed of icy sediments. As for temporal variability, the maximum rate of destruction was observed in 1977-1988 (up to 6.5 m per year) immediately after the beginning of economic development of the territory. In this key site, human impact affects the rate of coastal destruction more than variations in hydrometeorological parameters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Antennas; Hazards; Petroleum prospecting; Sea ice; Air temperature; Changing climate; Coastal retreat; Coastal sediments; Economic development; Multi-temporal; Rising temperatures; Temporal variability; Gas condensates","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072978498"
