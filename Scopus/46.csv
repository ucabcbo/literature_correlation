When multiresolution imagery is collected simultaneously, high quality spatial and spectral image fusion techniques can be applied to the different sensor field of views that helps to improve detection of earth surface features and targets. Multispectral imagery fused with hyperspectral imagery described and results shown in this paper indicates the ability to detect subsurface water features along Florida littoral zones and coastal water regions. The use of multiresolution imaging from the same remote sensing platform provides a valuable approach for detecting sun glint regions and reflectance due to water wave facets and the presence of breaking waves. In littoral regions along Space Coast Florida and the Indian River Lagoon, surface bidirectional reflectance increases 5-6 times the background water surface reflectance, making typical water column constituent estimation questionable. The detection of the influence of surface water gravity waves can be modeled or easily detected using ground sampling distances or spatial resolutions less than or near 0.3 m. Spatial resolutions of approximately one meter or greater do not allow suitable detection of pixels affected by water waves. Satellite imagery based directional reflectance using ground sampling distance greater than 1 meter is contaminated by water wave facet reflection, breaking waves and sun glint effects. Thus bio-geophysical variables such as chlorophyll pigments, suspended matter, dissolved organic matter and light attenuation depths are biased. This bias effect can only be estimated reliably by using small spatial resolution imagery with knowledge gained from analytical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling and multiresolution fused imagery. Application of transferable remote sensing algorithms for water quality applications require bidirectional reflectance corrections for water waves, sun glint, and wave facet effects. Example high quality WorldView-3 multispectral and panchromatic clearly shows the water wave facet reflectance effects that is imbedded into larger GSD imagery of water regions and littoral zones and as shown in hyperspectral Monte Carlo model results. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Biological materials; Coastal zones; Feature extraction; Hydrophilicity; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Monte Carlo methods; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Surface waters; Water quality; Water waves; coastal; Dissolved organic matters; Ground sampling distances; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing algorithms; Spatial resolution imagery; Surface bidirectional reflectances; Remote sensing","coastal; hyperspectral; image fusion; Monte Carlo; multispectral; radiative transfer; water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056485855"

Calving of ice shelves and glaciers contributes to major ice loss along the coast of Antarctica. In the present study the ice dynamics along the Eastern coast of Antarctica using iceberg calving as an indicator has been studied. Using moderate resolution satellite data of LANDSAT 4-5, 7 & 8, we monitored calving events that occurred in the past and icebergs likely to be calved in future, and identified potential zones where major calving could take place along the eastern Antarctica region. The present study focuses on 3 such events from Princess Astrid Coast. In this region, as on 4-12-1989 there was a crevasse of 45.15 km which had grown up to 77.84 km by 19-11-2001. Also, as on 16-03-2016, an iceberg of an area 29.88 sq.km which is about to calve can be observed. Here the rifts can be seen which are orthogonal in orientation relative to the calving front. In the third case, there is presence of 12 widening rifts and around 48 physical structures, as observed on 16-03-2016. The total length of the 12 rifts is around 215.68 km with minimum 1.24 km and maximum 40.55 km in length. This study shows that temporal monitoring of iceberg calving is necessary for deciphering climate change signals. � 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

The shallow water estuarine study area is along Florida's east coast area known as ""space coast"" Florida. In-situ data, including water depths obtained from bathymetric charts, in-situ hyperspectral attenuation signatures and satellite- based reflectance factors are obtained from atmospherically corrected visible and near infra-red channels of World View-3 satellite imagery. The high spatial, radiometric and 11bit digital resolution satellite imagery is used to study water visibility that is an important ecosystem quality indicator. In shallow coastal waters as well as deeper water areas and nearby coastal waterways, the effects of water surface gravity wave facets and sun glint influence the estimates of water quality related variables estimated at the pixel level. The results have significant implications related to the estimation of the depth of penetration of light using satellite-based methods in coastal waters. Application of atmospherically corrected satellite imagery followed by glint removal is shown using translating and dilating derivative wavelet algorithms to estimate the attenuation depth of light in water.

In general, very large bergs are tracked and predicted using models or satellite imagery. Small and medium bergs are detectable using conventional marine radar. As icebergs decay they shed bergy bits and growlers, which are much smaller and more difficult to detect. Their low profile above the water surface, in addition to occasional relatively high seas, makes them invisible to conventional marine radar. Visual inspection is the most common method used to detect bergy bits and growlers, but the effectiveness of visual inspections is reduced by operator fatigue and low light conditions. The potential hazard from bergy bits and growlers is further increased by short detection range (<1 km). As such, there is a need for robust and autonomous near-field detection of such smaller icebergs. This paper presents a review of iceberg detection technology and explores applications for infrared imagers in the field. Preliminary experiments are performed and recommendations are made for future work, including a proposed imager design which would be suited for near field ice detection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hazards; Ice; Imaging techniques; Infrared imaging; Microlenses; Oil field development; Petroleum prospecting; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Thermography (imaging); Ice detection; Low light conditions; Micro-lens arrays; Multispectral sensors; Oil and gas exploration; Optical imaging technology; Production operations; Sub-arctic; Marine radar","Ice detection; Infrared imaging; Micro-lens arrays; Multi-spectral sensors; Process safety in arctic and sub-arctic operations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029856516"

A straightforward and cost-efficient bathymetry mapping of the Indonesian coral reef is urgently needed. To address this problem, we present a generalized multispectral bathymetry estimation formula that requires few field measurement data to adjust coefficients. The simulation dataset corresponding to the Indonesian coral reef and Worldview-2 Imagery spectral response was built to extract the coefficient. Then, the formula was validated using real Worldview-2 images from three shallow coral reef sites: the Gili Mantra islands, Menjangan Island, and Gondol Beach in Indonesia. During the evaluation of the dataset simulation, the formulated equation was tested; it achieved an adjusted R2 of 0.93 and an RMSR (Root Mean Square Residual) of 0.9 m. Such results show the good quality of our generalized bathymetry formula. Moreover, we tested the described formula using the imagery. The Gili islands shows that the best estimations of the depth corresponded to 0.62 and 1.5 m for R2 and RMSR, respectively. In the shallow areas, the depth estimation was accurate, but the error gradually increased with depth. The depth estimation for the Menjangan and Gondol sites failed (R2 ≤ 0.1), mostly because of a high image noise. In conclusion, the formula was able to estimate the depth accurately in a shallow water area using the least noisy image, but its error increased with depth. © 2016 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrophilicity; Quality control; Reefs; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Coral reef; Indonesia; Lyzenga; Multi-spectral; Simulation data; Worldview-2; Hydrographic surveys","Coral Reef; Indonesia; Lyzenga; Multispectral Bathymetry; Simulation data; Worldview-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011271390"

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

The locality preserving fusion arises from two-fold, i.e., the local characterization in both spatial and feature domains. We commence by simultaneously learning a projection matrix, which preserves spatial localities, and a similarity matrix, which encodes feature similarities. We map the pixels of multi-source images by the projection matrix to a set fusion vectors that preserve spatial localities of the image. On the other hand, by applying the Laplacian eigen-decomposition to the similarity matrix, we obtain another set of fusion vectors that preserve the feature local similarities. We concatenate the fusion vectors for both spatial and feature locality preservation and obtain the fusion image. Finally, we classify the fusion image pixels by a novel sliding ensemble strategy, which enhances the locality preservation in classification. Our locality preserving fusion framework is effective in classifying multi-source sea-ice images (e.g., multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images) because it not only comprehensively captures the spatial neighboring relationships but also intrinsically characterizes the feature associations between different types of sea-ices.

Surf zone imagery, images of shallow bays, lagoons and coastal waters are processed to produce bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) signatures corrected for changing viewing angles. Angular changes as a function of pixel location within a scene are used to estimate changes in pixel size and ground sampling areas. Diffuse calibration targets collected simultaneously from within the image scene provides the necessary information for calculating BRF signatures of the water surface and shorelines. Automated scanning using a pushbroom hyperspectral sensor allows imagery to be collected on the order of one minute or less for different regions of interest. Imagery is then rectified and georeferenced using ground control points within nadir viewing multispectral imagery via image to image registration techniques. This paper demonstrates the above as well as presenting how spectra can be extracted along different directions in the imagery. The extraction of BRF spectra along track lines allows the application of derivative reflectance spectroscopy for estimating chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic matter and suspended matter concentrations at or near the water surface. Imagery is presented demonstrating the techniques to identify subsurface features and targets within the littoral and surf zones. © 2017 SPIE.","Biological materials; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Fixed platforms; Hydrophilicity; Offshore oil wells; Pixels; Reflection; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Water quality; Georeferenced imagery; Geospatial mapping; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Image rectification; Multi-spectral imagery; Oblique imagery; Shallow subsurface; Satellite imagery","Fixed platform sensing; Georeferenced imagery; Geospatial mapping application; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Image rectification; Multispectral imagery; Oblique imagery; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Shallow subsurface sensing; Water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038421589"

Its monitoring has become a routine task for the maritime sector. Remote sensing, which depends mainly on SAR and optical sensors, has become the primary means for sea-ice research. Optical images contain abundant sea-ice multi-spectral information, whereas SAR images contain rich sea-ice texture information. If the characteristic advantages of SAR and optical images could be combined for sea-ice study, the ability of sea-ice monitoring would be improved. In this study, in accordance with the characteristics of sea-ice SAR and optical images, the transformation and fusion methods for these images were chosen. Also, a fusion method of optical and SAR images was proposed in order to improve sea-ice identification. Texture information can play an important role in sea-ice classification. Haar wavelet transformation was found to be suitable for the sea-ice SAR images, and the texture information of the sea-ice SAR image from Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) loaded on ENVISAT was documented. The results of our studies showed that, the optical images in the hue-intensity-saturation (HIS) space could reflect the spectral characteristics of the sea-ice types more efficiently than in the red-green-blue (RGB) space, and the optical image from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-02B) was transferred from the RGB space to the HIS space. The principal component analysis (PCA) method could potentially contain the maximum information of the sea-ice images by fusing the HIS and texture images. The fusion image was obtained by a PCA method, which included the advantages of both the sea-ice SAR image and the optical image. To validate the fusion method, three methods were used to evaluate the fused image, i.e., objective, subjective, and comprehensive evaluations. It was concluded that the fusion method proposed could improve the ability of image interpretation and sea-ice identification. © 2015, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","HIS transform; optical remote sensing image; PCA method; SAR remote sensing image; sea ice; wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924975294"

Within Arctic regions, in situ surveying presents risks to surveyors, is time consuming and costly. To better meet its mandate, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been investigating the potential of remote sensing to compliment traditional charting techniques. This paper focuses on an evaluation of sensors and techniques for operational Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) implementation. Analysis focused on Cambridge Bay, Nunavut using Pléiades, SPOT, WorldView and PlanetScope imagery. Multiple SDB techniques were applied to evaluate their agreement with in-situ bathymetric measurements: • An empirical logarithm band ratio approach. • A multiple band modeling technique. • A multi-dimensional Look-Up-Table approach. Through this analysis, CHS attempted to answer critical questions for operational SDB implementation: • Do specific optical sensors offer advantages for SDB? • Are there advantages/disadvantages with the application of SDB techniques within the examined environment? • Can multiple SDB techniques improve CHS's understanding of the confidence it can place in remotely sensed bathymetry estimates? Early results have achieved overall root mean square errors of 0.56 to 0.99 m relative to in situ survey depths for all sensors and techniques. These similarities suggest that CHS can be confident in the accuracies observed from various SDB approaches. Results do not indicate significant advantages or disadvantages of particular optical sensors, suggesting other factors contain greater importance for SDB image selection (e.g. sea floor visibility). While this analysis provides excellent information for operational empirical SDB implementation within Arctic environments, further work is required within other Canadian coastal regions to support national SDB application. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrographic surveys; Hydrophilicity; Mean square error; Optical sensors; Satellites; Sea ice; Table lookup; Canadian Arctic; Canadian hydrographic services; Empirical model; High resolution; Multi-spectral; Navigational Charting; Remote sensing","Canadian Arctic; Canadian Hydrographic Service; Empirical Models; High Resolution Optical; Multispectral; Navigational Charting; Remote Sensing; Satellite Derived Bathymetry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056476374"

They can influence energy and heat exchange between the ocean, ice, and atmosphere, as well as human activities. In this paper, the LINE module of Geomatics 2015 software was used to automatically extract tidal cracks in fast ice regions near the Chinese Zhongshan Station in East Antarctica from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data with resolutions of 15 m (panchromatic band 8) and 30 m (multispectral bands 1-7). The detected tidal cracks were determined based on matching between the output from the LINE module and manually-interpreted tidal cracks in OLI images. The ratio of the length of detected tidal cracks to the total length of interpreted cracks was used to evaluate the automated detection method. Results show that the vertical direction gradient is a better input to the LINE module than the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance input for estimating the presence of cracks, regardless of the examined resolution. Data with a resolution of 15 m also gives better results in crack detection than data with a resolution of 30 m. The statistics also show that, in the results from the 15-m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 8 performed best with values of the above-mentioned ratio of 50.92 and 31.38 percent using the vertical gradient and the TOA reflectance methods, respectively. On the other hand, in the results from the 30-m-resolution data, the ratios in Band 5 performed best with ratios of 47.43 and 17.8 percent using the same methods, respectively. This implies that Band 8 was better for tidal crack detection than the multispectral fusion data (Bands 1-7), and Band 5 with a resolution of 30 m was best among the multispectral data. The semi-automatic mapping of tidal cracks will improve the safety of vehicles travel in fast ice regimes. © 2016 by the authors.","Automation; Cracks; Ice; Mapping; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Automated detection; LANDSAT; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral fusion; Operational land imager; Safety of vehicles; Sea-level oscillations; Vertical direction; Crack detection","Fast ice; Landsat-8 OLI; Remote sensing; Tidal cracks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962508827"

An experiment was conducted on natural sea ice in Bohai Bay, China, to obtain the spectral reflectance of oil-contaminated sea ice. The spectral absorption index (SAI), spectral peak height (SPH), and wavelet detail coefficient (DWT d5) were calculated using stepwise multiple linear regression. The reflectances of some false targets were measured and analysed. The simulated false targets were sediment, iron ore fines, coal dust, and the melt pool. The measured reflectances were resampled using five common sensors (GF-2, Landsat8-OLI, Sentinel3-OLCI, MODIS, and AVIRIS). Some significant spectral features could discriminate between oil-polluted and clean sea ice. The indices correlated well with the oil area fractions. All of the adjusted R2 values exceeded 0.9. The SPH model1, based on spectral features at 507-670 and 1627-1746 nm, displayed the best fitting. The resampled data indicated that these multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors could be used to detect crude oil on the sea ice if the effect of noise and spatial resolution are neglected.

Particularly, calving of lake-terminating glaciers has been understudied. The aim of this work is to present an object-based method of iceberg detection and to create an inventory of icebergs located in a proglacial lagoon of San Quintin glacier, Northern Patagonia Icefield, Chile. This dataset is created using high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery and a derived DEM. We use it to briefly discuss the iceberg size distribution and area-volume scaling. Segmentation of the multispectral imagery produced a map of objects, which were classified with use of Random Forest supervised classification algorithm. An intermediate classification product was corrected with a ruleset exploiting contextual information and a watershed algorithm that was used to divide multiple touching icebergs into separate objects. Common theoretical heavy-tail statistical distributions were tested as descriptors of iceberg area and volume distributions. Power law models were proposed for the area-volume relationship. The proposed method performed well over the open lake detecting correctly icebergs in all size bands except 5-15 m2 where many icebergs were missed. A section of the lagoon with ice melange was not reliably mapped due to uniformity of the area in the imagery and DEM. The precision of the DEM limited the scaling effort to icebergs taller than 1.7 m and larger than 99 m2, despite the inventory containing icebergs as small as 4 m2. The work demonstrates viability of object-based analysis for lacustrine iceberg detection and shows that the statistical properties of iceberg population at San Quintin glacier match those of populations produced by tidewater glaciers. © 2020 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Lakes; Population statistics; Contextual information; Multi-spectral imagery; Object based image analysis; Object-based analysis; Object-based methods; Statistical distribution; Statistical properties; Supervised classification; Sea ice","Glacier calving; Iceberg; Lacustrine calving; Northern patagonia icefield; Object-based image analysis; Power law; Random forest; WorldView-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086437404"

Climate change due to anthropogenic activities is inducing global warming that, for example, has resulted in glacier melting. This has had a significant impact on sea levels and ocean circulation. In this study, the temporal trend of the marine-terminated d’Iberville glacier (Ellesmere Island, Canada) is analysed using C-band synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery collected by the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 missions. The data set consists of a time series of 10 synthetic aperture radar data collected from 2010 to 2022 in dual-polarimetric imaging mode, where a horizontally polarised electromagnetic wave was transmitted. An automatic approach based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate method is applied to the single- and dual-polarisation features, namely the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section and a combination of the HH- and HV-polarised scattering amplitudes, with the aim of extracting the ice front of the glacier and, therefore, estimating its behaviour over time. Independent collocated satellite optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument is also considered, where available, to support the experimental outcomes. The experimental results show that (1) the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section achieved better performance with respect to the dual-polarised feature, especially under the most challenging case of a sea-ice infested sea surface; (2) when the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section was considered, the ice front extraction methodology provided a satisfactory accuracy, i.e., a root mean square error spanning from about 1.1 pixels to 3.4 pixels, depending on the sea-surface conditions; and (3) the d’Iberville glacier exhibited, during the study period, a significant retreat whose average surface velocity was 160 m per year, resulting in a net ice area loss of 2.2 km2 (0.18 km2 per year). These outcomes demonstrate that the d’Iberville glacier is behaving as most of the marine-terminated glaciers in the study area while experiencing a larger ice loss. © 2022 by the authors.","Electromagnetic waves; Extraction; Global warming; Mean square error; Pixels; Polarization; Radar cross section; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Sea level; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Anthropogenic activity; C-band SAR; C-bands; Canada; D’iberville glacier; Ice front extraction; Multi-polarization; Normalized radar cross section; Polar Regions; SAR imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","C-band SAR; Canada; d’Iberville glacier; ice front extraction; polarisation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144421612"

They also studied the algorithm for the segmentation of ice known as pixel based segmentation which helps to differentiate ice based on its properties. Large number of methods has been utilized for multi temporal segmentation from the MODIS data which is known as TempoSeg strategy for multiyear sea ice.

It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel-3 and GIS. The subject of the study is to demonstrate the dynamics, during the summer season from 2015 to 2019, around the coastline of Livingston Island, New Shetland Islands in Antarctica and Longyearbyen in the Arctic. Changes in environmental objects are indicated by radar images through different processing approaches. The results clearly show that sea ice melting can be best recorded by using SAR data through the C-band.

Terrestrial laserscanning and unmanned aerial vehicles provide very high resolution data with high accuracy. Automatic cameras have become a valuable source of information-mostly in a qualitative manner-in recent years. The availability of satellite data with very high revisiting time has gained momentum through the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions, offering new application potential for Earth observation. This paper reviews the status of recent techniques such as terrestrial laserscanning, remote sensed imagery, and synthetic aperture radar in monitoring high mountain environments with a particular focus on the impact of new platforms such as Sentinel-1 and-2 as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The study area comprises the high mountain glacial environment at the Pasterze Glacier, Austria. The area is characterized by a highly dynamic geomorphological evolution and by being subject to intensive scientific research as well as long-term monitoring. We primarily evaluate landform classification and process characterization for: (i) the proglacial lake; (ii) icebergs; (iii) the glacier river; (iv) valley-bottom processes; (v) slope processes; and (vi) rock wall processes. We focus on assessing the potential of every single method both in spatial and temporal resolution in characterizing different geomorphic processes. Examples of the individual techniques are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of: (i) morphometric analysis; (ii) applicability in high alpine regions; and (iii) comparability of the methods among themselves. The final frame of this article includes considerations on scale dependent process detectability and characterization potentials of these Earth observation methods, along with strengths and limitations in applying these methods in high alpine regions. © 2020 by the authors.

In parallel, the ELF (automated image Edge detection and measurements of edge spread function, Line spread function, and Full width at half maximum) system is proposed to achieve automated and precise assessments of the effective resolutions of the input and SRR images. Subsequent ELF measurements of the TARSGAN SRR results suggest an averaged effective resolution enhancement factor of about 2.91 times (equivalent to ~3.44 m/pixel for the 10 m/pixel bands) given a nominal SRR upscaling factor of 4 times.
