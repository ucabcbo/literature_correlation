Dust storms have become a major problem in arid and semi-arid regions and cause adverse social, economic, and environmental effects. The Jazmurian wetland in Kerman Province is one such area. To identify dust sources in the Jazmurian basin, high resolution Sentinel 2 data were used. From these, sediment supply was mapped. Three artificially intelligent algorithms—artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and deep-learning neural network (DLNN)—were used to model dust-production potential in the study area. The results show that portions of the Jazmurian basin that have dried up in recent years have a very high potential for dust production. Evaluation of the models’ performances using area-under-curve (AUC) statistics revealed that the DLNN model is more efficient (AUC = 0.97) than either the ANN (AUC = 0.91) or SVM (AUC = 0.92). All three models reveal that NDVI, elevation, annual rainfall, and windspeed are the four most important factors influencing dust-production potential in the study area. This remote sensing-artificial intelligence framework should be tested for mapping dust-production potential in other regions as this study demonstrates highly accurate, high-resolution results. This study yielded fundamental information to identify locations in need of desertification management and mitigation of dust production in the Jazmurian basin. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Deep-learning neural network; desertification; dust-source; Jazmurian basin; Sentinel 2","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130697300"

The Sentinel-2 satellite has a high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and its unique three red-edge bands provide an ideal data source for LAI estimation. However, the inconsistent spatial resolution of different bands hinders the application potential of Sentinel-2 images. In view of this problem, we focused on mining more information provided by the high spatial resolution bands of Sentinel-2 images using the Super-Resolution for Multispectral Multiresolution Estimation (SupReME) algorithm. Furthermore, The SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) biophysical processor and the PROSAIL radiation transfer model coupled with Random Forest (RF) model were applied to estimate time-series LAI of maize canopy at 10 m spatial resolution, and the Leaf Area Index Wireless Sensor Network (LAINet) measurements were used for accuracy verification. Finally, the effectiveness of images reconstructed by SupReME and the two inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation were evaluated. The results showed that: (1) the Sentinel-2 images reconstructed by SupReME can improve spatial characteristics while maintaining spectral invariance, and they were more advantageous for LAI estimation than the original images; (2) The SNAP biophysical processor suits a quick large-scale estimation with robustness, while the PROSAIL coupled RF model achieved a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (R2 increased by more than 0.1, RMSE decreased by more than 0.33) for time-series LAI estimation in this specific study area; (3) both inversion methods showed apparent underestimation at the late growth stage. This study verifies the feasibility of obtaining high spatial resolution images using a super-resolution algorithm for LAI inversion and provides the effect of two commonly used inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation at 10 m resolution. © 2022 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Biophysics; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Mean square error; Time series; Wireless sensor networks; Application platforms; Estimation algorithm; Leaf Area Index; Multi-spectral; Multiresolution; PROSAIL model; Random forests; Sentinel application platform biophysical processor; Super-resolution for multispectral multiresolution estimation algorithm; Superresolution; accuracy assessment; algorithm; biophysics; comparative study; error analysis; estimation method; inversion layer; leaf area index; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial resolution; time series analysis; Decision trees","Leaf area index; PROSAIL model; Random forest; SNAP biophysical processor; SupReME algorithm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140392070"

This study incorporated a continuous coverage of multi-spectral optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) along with sparsely global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in the machine learning (ML) models for mapping Hcanopy in the mixed tropical forests of Shoolpaneshwar wildlife sanctuary (SWLS), Gujarat, India. We trained seven ML models, including quantile random forest (QRF), support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian regularization for feed-forward neural networks (BRNN), conditional inference random forest (Cforest), Extreme gradient boosting (Xgbtree), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) using GEDI_02A extracted Hcanopy as training data. We used predictors which were extracted from LiDAR (GEDI metrics), multispectral optical (Landsat -8, Sentinel-2), and SAR (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, Sentinel-1). A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) resampling was used to avoid overfitting or underfitting. The comparison of the models performances shows that the BRNN model has the highest satisfactory accuracy metrics, such as root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.686 m, R-squared (R2) of 0.49 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.66 m. Low training samples of tall canopies (>25 m), presence of mixed vegetation, geometric and structural variability and sloppy terrain of SWLS possibly restricted models from performing well. Field validation shows an R2 of 0.55, satisfactory for mixed tropical forests using spaceborne LiDAR. The present work provides insights into using spaceborne LiDAR GEDI data with optical and SAR data for Hcanopy mapping through ML models, which help to manage SWLS and further implications of forest Hcanopy mapping over large spatial scales. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Canopy height; GEDI; Machine learning; Optical; SAR; Tropical mixed forests","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135700380"

A new method (the TIP method) for cloud shadow detection in multi-spectral satellite images is presented and compared to current methods. The TIP method is based on the evaluation of thresholds, indices and projections. Most state-of-the-art methods solemnly rely on one of these evaluation steps or on a complex working mechanism. Instead, the new method incorpo-rates three basic evaluation steps into one algorithm for easy and accurate cloud shadow detection. Furthermore the performance of the masking algorithms provided by the software packages ATCOR (“Atmospheric Correction”) and PACO (“Python-based Atmospheric Correction”) is compared with that of the newly implemented TIP method on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe, covering a wide variety of environments and climates. The algorithms incorporated in each piece of masking software use the class of cloud shadows, but they employ different rules and class-specific thresholds. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or “truth”. The overall accuracies for the class cloud shadows of ATCOR and PACO (including TIP) for difference areas of the selected scenes are 70.4% and 76.6% respectively. The difference area encompasses the parts of the classification image where the classification maps disagree. User and producer accuracies for the class cloud shadow are strongly scene-dependent, typically varying between 45% and 95%. The experimental results show that the proposed TIP method based on thresholds, indices and projections can obtain improved cloud shadow detection performance. © 2022 by the authors.

Towards this end, we collected Sentinel 2 true color scenes of High-Mountain Asia (HMA) region using glacial lakes inventory of this region.

In this regard, its availability and variability influence the functioning of various ecosystems and most importantly human livelihoods. This becomes critical in drought prone and water-scarce areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The use of satellite remote sensing is increasingly becoming the primary data source for water resources monitoring. However, with emerging and advances in satellite remote sensing data, their ability in monitoring water resources remains uncertain. In addition, the remote sensing of surface water mapping has been limited to specific periods, which undermines the influence of seasonality on their spatial variability. This study therefore assessed the potential of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument derived Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalised Difference Water Index Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5) and Modified Normalised Difference Index (MNDVI), for monitoring seasonal surface waterbodies in the Western Cape, South Africa. The derived remote sensing estimates were assessed using the Producers', User's, Overall accuracies as well the Kappa coefficient. The spatial variations were also linked to monthly evapotranspiration, rainfall and temperature. These climatic factors all contribute to seasonal surface water availability. Further, the satellite-derived estimates were compared using the analysis of variance (ANOVA), to test whether there were any significant differences (α = 0.05) in their and mapping detection abilities. The results indicated that both sensors managed to detect and map surface water variations and it was observed that surface waterbodies varied spatially over time. During the wet season, more surface waterbodies were detected than during the dry season. The majority of waterbodies were detected by both sensors. Most of these waterbodies were found in the south western part of the study area and all the indices showed similar sizes and presence of seasonal surface waterbodies. Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed the best and yielded the highest accuracy, however, the Land Surface Water Index VI (LSWI+5) results overestimated the size and occurrence of surface waterbodies, when compared to other indices, especially during the wet season. The derived waterbodies followed a similar pattern with the observed climate data and evapotranspiration rates during the study period. Landsat 8 derived Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) performed slightly better when compared to other indices, with 92.33% and a Kappa coefficient of 84.67% in detecting and mapping surface waterbodies. On the other hand, Sentinel-2 produced lower classification estimates. Statistical analysis results demonstrated significant differences (α = 0.05) in the detection and mapping ability of different satellite-derived indices. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 data in understanding spatial variations in surface water. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","South Africa; Western Cape; Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Drought; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surface measurement; Land surface water index; Operational land imager; Primary data source; Resources monitoring; Satellite monitoring; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite remote sensing data; Western Cape , South Africa; detection method; drought; Landsat; livelihood; mapping method; remote sensing; resource scarcity; satellite data; semiarid region; spatial variation; surface water; water availability; Surface waters","Drought impacts; Satellite data; Semi-arid environments; Water indices; Water scarcity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090060831"

A severe outbreak of the moth Hyblaea puera occurred along the Thane creek in Mumbai (Maharashtra, India) between September and October 2019. The ecological interaction of pest species in a mangrove ecosystem is complex and very few detailed studies have been undertaken along the Indian coast. There is evidence that infestation can have a negative impact on the already threatened mangrove ecosystem. This study investigates the mangrove infestation, the influence of the infestation on the Leaf Area Index (LAI), rainfall's effect on such outbreaks’ occurrence, and spectral reflectance in infested and non-infested mangroves. Sentinel 2 MSI data was processed using the QGIS platform. There were two dominant mangrove species, Avicennia marina and Sonneratia apetala, of which the most affected species was A. marina. The study revealed that 67.90% (50.61 km2) of the mangrove area defoliated due to this outbreak, out of which 30.20% (22.50 km2) was highly defoliated, 37.70% (28.11 km2) was less defoliated, and 32.10% (23.95 km2) was unaffected. LAI is the health indicator of a forest affected by an infestation; it indicates the reduction in canopy cover due to the infestation. The t-test was applied to determine the significance of LAI before and after the infestation along the upper stretch of the creek,t-value was 3.886 (p = 0.0011, p ≤ 0.05 significant). The spectral reflectance analysis showed a reduction in the infested mangrove's Vegetation Red Edge and Near Infra-Red reflectance.

The current paper aims at extending the same approach to the analysis of the main irrigation patterns occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) during the 2000–2019 period. This operation was made possible by feeding the irrigation water (IW) estimation method with 250-m spatial resolution Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images. The results of this operation were first assessed versus various reference datasets available for the region; next, the annual maps of IW estimated for the 20 study years were analyzed at province scale in conjunction with relevant agricultural statistics. The use of MODIS in place of MSI images reduces the IW estimation accuracy irregularly at local scale, depending on the size and spatial arrangement of irrigated and non-irrigated fields; the reduction in accuracy is, however, marginal over relatively large areas. Irrigated crops are decreasing throughout most Tuscany provinces, while they are increasing in the most southern and driest province. The possible reasons and implications of these findings are finally discussed in relation to the main environmental issues affecting the region. © 2022 The Author(s).

Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images (“S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue” dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors. © 2022 The Authors","Deep learning; HTTP; Image processing; Landsat; Learning systems; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Cloud masks; Deep learning; Distortion model; Generative adversarial network; LANDSAT; Model method; Remote-sensing; Satellite sensors; artificial neural network; detection method; image processing; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral analysis; supervised learning; Generative adversarial networks","Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks (GAN); Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136277692"

High-resolution imagery is however expensive to obtain, while lower resolution imagery is often freely available and can be used for a range of social good applications. To that end, we curate a multi-spectral multi-image dataset for super-resolution of satellite images. We use PlanetScope imagery from the SpaceNet-7 challenge as the high resolution reference and multiple Sentinel-2 revisits of the same location as the low-resolution imagery. We present the first results of applying multi-image super-resolution (MISR) to multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. We, additionally, introduce a radiometric-consistency module into the MISR model to preserve the high radiometric resolution and quality of the Sentinel-2 sensor.

Recently, climate change and human activities have resulted in higher frequencies of wildfires throughout the world. Timely and accurate detection of the burned areas can help to make decisions for their management. Remote sensing satellite imagery can have a key role in mapping burned areas due to its wide coverage, high-resolution data collec-tion, and low capture times. However, although many studies have reported on burned area mapping based on remote sensing imagery in recent decades, accurate burned area mapping remains a major challenge due to the complexity of the background and the diversity of the burned areas. This paper presents a novel framework for burned area mapping based on Deep Siamese Morphological Neural Network (DSMNN-Net) and heterogeneous datasets. The DSMNN-Net framework is based on change detection through proposing a pre/post-fire method that is compatible with heterogeneous remote sensing datasets. The proposed network combines multiscale convolution layers and morphological layers (erosion and dilation) to generate deep features. To evaluate the performance of the method proposed here, two case study areas in Australian forests were selected. The framework used can better detect burned areas compared to other state-of-the-art burned area mapping procedures, with a performance of >98% for overall accuracy index, and a kappa coefficient of >0.9, using multispectral Sentinel-2 and hyperspectral PRISMA image datasets. The analyses of the two datasets illustrate that the DSMNN-Net is sufficiently valid and robust for burned area mapping, and especially for complex areas. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to explore the ability of remote sensing data to measure the salinity of low-salt lakes, this study used remote sensing reflectance data in blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands with 10 m spatial resolution of sentinel-2 to analyze the relationship between measured surface salinity and reflectance in the Co Ngoin Lake. Based on different combinations of variables, which included the reflectance of four bands and normalized difference water index (NDWI), a linear regression model was constructed with salinity data, and the accuracy evaluated. The model was also used to invert the surface salinity of the Co Ngoin Lake. The results showed that the correlation between reflectance and salinity in the green band was higher than that in other bands. However, the near-infrared band reflectivity had the highest correlation with salinity, when the salinity was lower than 3. Among the 9 models with the combination of variables, the addition of the NDWI variable improved the accuracy of model inversion, which was higher than the accuracy of the model without the NDWI variable. The linear regression model of the three variable combinations of NDWI, near-infrared band and blue band had the highest accuracy of salinity inversion. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.103, and the salinity observed value and predicted value correlated well. In the combination without NDWI variable, the salinity inversion accuracy of the green band and red band was high, with MAE of 0.126. The spatial distribution of water surface salinity of the Co Ngoin Lake generally presented a spatial pattern of low salinity at the shore and estuary, and high and relatively uniform distribution within the lake. From the inversion results, the average salinity of the Co Ngoin Lake was approximately 4.14, which was very close to the measured average (4.15). The results verified the effectiveness of the multispectral remote sensing method, which has the advantages of being fast, convenient and highly accurate in predicting the water surface salinity of the Co Ngoin Lake. This study has guiding significance for low lake surface salinity inversion using high-resolution multi-spectral remote sensing data.

Meanwhile, multispectral remote sensing technique can also provide a large amount of urban features changes information for analyzing the causes of land subsidence. In this study, SAR and multispectral images are both used to monitor and analyze land subsidence in Fuzhou of China. 115 scenes Sentinel-1 SAR images from May 2017 to May 2021 are used based on the Persistent Scatterers Interferometric (PSI) method to evaluate the land subsidence in Fuzhou, while Sentinel-2 multispectral images are used to evaluate several remote sensing indexes. During SAR data processing, Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) data is used to remove atmospheric errors for higher accuracy land subsidence. In order to analyze the relationship between the land subsidence and land cover changes in urban areas, the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) of the main subsidence areas are obtained based on Sentinel-2 multispectral images from 2016 to 2021. In the end, it is found that the land subsidence in some areas exceeded 12 mm/year in Fuzhou. The time series of four areas with severe subsidence were analyzed, and the cumulative subsidence reached about 60 mm. Besides, the spatial distribution and temporal changes of vegetation, buildings and water bodies in these areas were obtained based on the multispectral data, it is found there is very less relationship between the land subsidence and the urban features. It is concluded that that the main causes of the land subsidence are the changes of land internal components such as groundwater and others.  © Authors 2022","Data handling; Groundwater; Image analysis; Interferometry; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Subsidence; Time series; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Fuzhou; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Land subsidence; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Multispectral remote sensing; SAR Images; Subsidence monitoring; Times series; Urban features; Synthetic aperture radar","Fuzhou; InSAR; Land Subsidence; Multispectral; Time series","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131945144"

Remote sensing technology offers opportunity to improve the monitoring on growth and distribution of submerged plants. To analyze the spectral characteristics of submerged aquatic vegetation in Ulansuhai Lake, Inner Mongolia, China, the effects of coverage on the reflectance spectra of submerged plants in the lake was explored based on measured spectral data. A submerged plant coverage retrieval model was established. Results show that the spectral reflectance of submerged plants decreased with the coverage decrease. The spectral reflectance of submerged plants was close to that of water at a coverage of 1%~20% although the differences remained at 813 nm and 1 069 nm. The spectral reflectance of submerged plants was significantly and positively correlated with the coverage in 710~746 nm band. Among models established of submerged plant coverage retrieval, the band ratio retrieval model was better than that of the single band retrieval model in performance. The band ratio retrieval model had the highest accuracy and was shown to be suitable for monitoring submerged plants with coverage of 60%~100%. In addition, the multi-spectral instrument (MSI) coverage retrieval model was established by integrating the measured spectral reflectance into the Sentinel-2 MSI bands using the band response function. The band ratio quadratic polynomial coverage retrieval model achieved the best effect. Therefore, the submerged plant coverage retrieval model developed in this study can be used to inverse the coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation in the Ulansuhai Lake. © 2022, Science Press.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from satellite images. In this study, the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum and the capability of several multispectral satellite missions to distinguish them is first analyzed. The results show that the reflectance peak in visible wavelength is always in 550 nm for U. prolifera whether it is floating in clear open water or turbid nearshore water. However, the reflectance of Sargassum floating in clear and turbid water shows totally different characteristics, because most of Sargassum body is submerged in the water and the observed Sargassum reflectance is seriously affected by water reflectance. Compared with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), HuanJing-1, Charge-Coupled Devices (HJ-1 CCD), Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), GaoFen-1, Wide Field of View (GF-1 WFV) can preferably capture the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum. Based on the spectral difference analysis, we propose a random forest-based algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images with an overall accuracy of 97.6% except when U. prolifera and Sargassum mix together. The algorithm is more robust than the existing ones as it allowed more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions to be used in the training; in addition, it avoids negative effects caused by the selection of a threshold. The proposed algorithm is proved effective in distinguishing U. prolifera and Sargassum in the Yellow and East China Seas in May and June 2017 and in detecting Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, this method can be used in researches including floating macroalgae traceability and competition and succession between different macroalgae species in different regions of the ocean with similar environments.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atlantic Ocean; East China Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; Charge coupled devices; Decision trees; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellites; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multispectral satellite image; Operational land imager; Overall accuracies; Spectral differences; Visible wavelengths; Water reflectances; Wide field of view; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); Landsat; machine learning; macroalga; MODIS; satellite altimetry; Sentinel; spectral reflectance; tide; Random forests","Machine learning algorithms; multispectral imaging; remote monitoring; tide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104588080"

In this study, we perform agricultural LUC using sequences of multispectral reflectance Sentinel-2 images taken in 2018. LUC can be carried out using machine or deep learning techniques. Some existing models process data at the pixel level, performing LUC successfully with a reduced number of images. Part of the pixel information corresponds to multispectral temporal patterns that, despite not being especially complex, might remain undetected by models such as random forests or multilayer perceptrons. Thus, we propose to arrange pixel information as 2D yearly fingerprints so as to render such patterns explicit and make use of a CNN to model and capture them. The results show that our proposal reaches a 91% weighted accuracy in classifying pixels among 19 classes, outperforming random forest by 8%, or a specifically tuned multilayer perceptron by 4%. Furthermore, models were also used to perform a ternary classification in order to detect irrigated fields, reaching a 97% global accuracy.

Nonetheless, in the last decades a reduction in grain quality has been observed. Therefore, it is central to develop efficient quality-related phenotyping tools. In this sense, one of the most relevant wheat features related to grain quality traits is grain nitrogen content, which is directly linked to grain protein content and monitorable with remote sensing approaches. Moreover, the relation between nitrogen fertilization and grain nitrogen content (protein) plays a central role in the sustainability of agriculture. Both aiming to develop efficient phenotyping tools using remote sensing instruments and to advance towards a field-level efficient and sustainable monitoring of grain nitrogen status, this paper studies the efficacy of various sensors, multispectral and visible red–greenblue (RGB), at different scales, ground and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and phenological stages (anthesis and grain filling) to estimate grain nitrogen content. Linear models were calculated using vegetation indices at each sensing level, sensor type and phenological stage. Furthermore, this study explores the up-scalability of the best performing model to satellite level Sentinel-2 equivalent data. We found that models built at the phenological stage of anthesis with UAV-level multispectral cameras using red-edge bands outperformed grain nitrogen content estimation (R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 0.18%) in comparison with those models built with RGB imagery at ground and aerial level, as well as with those built with widely used ground-level multispectral sensors. We also demonstrated the possibility to use UAV-built multispectral linear models at the satellite scale to determine grain nitrogen content effectively (R2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.29%) at actual wheat fields. © 2022 China Agricultural University","Antennas; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen; Proteins; Satellites; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Grain nitrogen content; Grain quality; Multi-spectral; Nitrogen content; Phenological stage; Phenotyping; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat; Wheat grains; Remote sensing","Grain nitrogen content; Phenotyping; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Wheat","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131147172"

A lot of studies have been carried out for nearshore bathymetry using satellite data. The approach adopted extensively in shallow water depths estimation has recently been one of empirical models. However, the linear empirical model is simple and only takes limited band information at each bathymetric point into consideration. It may be not suitable for complex environments. In this paper, a deep learning framework was proposed for nearshore bathymetry (DL-NB) from ICESat-2 LiDAR and Sentinel-2 Imagery datasets. The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 LiDAR were extracted instead of in situ measurements. By virtue of the two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D CNN), DL-NB can make full use of the initial multi-spectral information of Sentinel-2 at each bathymetric point and its adjacent areas during the training. Based on the trained model, the bathymetric maps of several study areas were produced including the Appalachian Bay (AB), Virgin Islands (VI), and Cat Island (CI) of the United States. The performance of DL-NB was evaluated by empirical method, machine learning method and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The results indicate that the accuracy of the DL-NB is better than comparative methods can in nearshore bathymetry. After quantitative analysis, the RMSE of DL-NB could achieve 1.01 m, 1.80 m and 0.28 m in AB, VI and CI respectively. Given the same data conditions, the proposed method can be applied for high precise global scale and multitemporal nearshore bathymetric maps generation, which are beneficial to marine environmental change assessment and conservation. © 2022 by the authors.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Learning systems; Maps; Optical radar; 2d CNN; Appalachians; Deep learning; Empirical model; ICESat-2; Learning approach; Nearshore bathymetry; Nearshores; Sentinel-2; Virgin islands; Bathymetry","2D CNN; deep learning; ICESat-2; nearshore bathymetry; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137855447"

Knowing where PTEs accumulated in soil can mitigate their adverse effects on plants, animals, and human health. We evaluated the potential of using long-term remote sensing images that reveal the bare soils, to detect and map PTEs in agricultural fields. In this study, 360 soil samples were collected at the superficial layer (0–20 cm) in a 2574 km2 agricultural area located in São Paulo State, Brazil. We tested the Soil Synthetic Image (SYSI) using Landsat TM/ETM/ETM+, Landsat OLI, and Sentinel 2 images. The three products have different spectral, temporal, and spatial resolutions. The time series multispectral images were used to reveal areas with bare soil and their spectra were used as predictors of soil chromium, iron, nickel, and zinc contents. We observed a strong linear relationship (−0.26 > r > −0.62) between the selected PTEs and the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of Sentinel (ensemble of 4 years of data), Landsat TM (35 years data), and Landsat OLI (4 years data). The clearest discrimination of soil PTEs was obtained from SYSI using a long term Landsat 5 collection over 35 years. Satellite data could efficiently detect the contents of PTEs in soils due to their relation with soil attributes and parent materials. Therefore, distinct satellite sensors could map the PTEs on tropics and assist in understanding their spatial dynamics and environmental effects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; E-learning; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Soil pollution; Soil surveys; Tropics; chromium; iron; nickel; toxic substance; zinc; Agricultural soils; Bare soils; Digital mapping; Environmental Monitoring; Humid tropics; LANDSAT; Multi-spectral data; Potentially toxic elements; Remote-sensing; Toxic elements; agricultural soil; humid environment; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil pollution; soil quality; toxic substance; agricultural land; Article; Brazil; decision making; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; humidity; machine learning; prediction; remote sensing; tropics; agriculture; human; remote sensing; soil; soil pollutant; Soils","Digital mapping; Environmental monitoring; Machine learning; Multispectral data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118346767"

Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data, especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective EO optical data exploitation. During the last few years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural network capabilities. With this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: Clear, cloud shadow, semitransparent cloud (thin clouds), cloud and invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering the Northern European terrestrial area was labelled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level-2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes. A comparison with rule-based cloud mask methods was then performed on the same test dataset, where Sen2Cor reached 59% dice coefficient for clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent and cloud classes, Fmask reached 61% for clear, cloud shadow and cloud classes and Maja reached 51% for clear and cloud classes. The closest machine learning open-source cloud classification mask, S2cloudless, had a 63% dice coefficient providing only cloud and clear classes, while KappaMask L2A, with a more complex classification schema, outperformed S2cloudless by 17%. © 2021 by the authors.

Three land use classes (arable land, pastures, and natural grassland) report similar spectral responses which make it challenging to separate. Therefore, we adopted a multitemporal and multispectral approach using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in combination with the NDVI vegetation index, Haralick's textural measures, and topographic information. The workflow identifies a methodology for combining various groups of input data (optical, NDVI, textural, topographic) and explores the suitable use of the Random Forest classifier for the task. The classification was carried out in three different European locations. The results present a strong separation of arable land (F1 score over 96%) from the other two classes. Pastures and natural grassland classes achieved F1 in the range of 76% to almost 85% in both cases. In conclusion, we discuss the suitability of the CORINE database for such classification problems.  © Authors 2022","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Land use; Satellite imagery; Arable land; CORINE; Land cover; Land use class; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Natural grassland; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Spectral response; Agriculture","arable land; CORINE; land cover; land use; natural grassland; pastures; Random Forest; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131932956"

For this purpose, higher spatial resolution data from the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission are exploited. Particularly, 10 S2 bands at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution are used to accomplish the PRISMA super-resolution (SR) task. The article presents a new end-to-end procedure, called PRISMA-SR, that starting from the S2 data and the low-resolution PRISMA image, provides a super-resolved image with a spatial resolution of 10 m and the same spectral resolution as the PRISMA HS sensor. The first step of the PRISMA-SR procedure consists in fusing S2 data at different spatial resolutions to obtain a synthetic MS image with 10 m spatial resolution and 10 spectral bands. Then, an unsupervised procedure is applied to coregister the fused S2 image and the PRISMA image. Finally, the two images at different spatial resolutions are properly combined in order to obtain the super-resolved HS image. Solutions for each step of the PRISMA-SR processing chain are proposed and discussed. Simulated data are used to show the effectiveness of the PRISMA-SR scheme and to investigate the impact on its performance of each step of the processing chain. Real S2 and PRISMA images are finally considered to provide an example of the application of the PRISMA-SR. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Chains; Data fusion; Data handling; Hyperspectral imaging; Spectroscopy; European Space Agency; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral data processing; Hyperspectral-multispectral data fusion; Multi-spectral data; Processing chain; Satellite mission; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; data processing; data set; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; Image resolution","Hyperspectral (hs) data processing; Hyperspectral (hs)-multispectral (ms) data fusion; Satellite missions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120878788"

Based on these empirical models, a multi-scene ensemble and a non-linear Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning approaches are applied to improve the accuracies from these traditional methods. In this analysis, firstly the best scene is selected from a set of six Sentinel-2 A&B images using noise-equivalent reflectance NEΔRrs (sr−1), optimal bands for LRM and LLM are selected using Optimal band ratio analysis (OBRA) and by computing Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) between each band respectively. A total of 80% depth data points obtained from JetSki based echo-sounding measurements are used for training and the remaining 20% are used for testing each approach. The overall errors during the test phase for the range of depth 0–12 m are 0.79 m (0.67 m), 0.94 m (0.66 m) and 0.57 m (0.39 m) using traditional empirical LRM (LLM) methods from the best image, empirical-based ensemble and SVR approaches respectively. Irrespective of the approach, the LLM produced smoother and relatively accurate bathymetry as compared to the LRM. The LLM based SVR ML approach provides the best performance over the entire depth range as compared to all the methods considered in this study. Therefore, this method can be used for efficiently estimating nearshore depths and produce updated high-resolution bathymetry maps for many coastal applications. © 2021 COSPAR","Bathymetry; Correlation methods; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Spectroscopy; Empirical method; Ensemble; Ensemble learning approach; Loglinear model; Machine learning approaches; Nearshores; Optical remote sensing; Ratio models; Sentinel-2; Support vector regressions; Remote sensing","Bathymetry; Ensemble; Nearshore; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel-2; SVR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110248332"

The hydrology of the peatland serves as an indicator of the carbon storage capacity. Hence, we investigate the question how suitable different remote sensing data are for monitoring the size of open water surface and the water table depth (WTD) of a peatland ecosystem. Furthermore, we examine the potential of combining remote sensing data for this purpose. We use C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. The radar backscatter σ, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) are calculated and used for consideration of the WTD and the lake size. For the measurement of the lake size, we implement and investigate the methods: random forest, adaptive thresholding and an analysis according to the Dempster–Shafer theory. Correlations between WTD and the remote sensing data σ as well as NDWI are investigated. When looking at the individual data sets the results of our case study show that the VH polarized σ data produces the clearest delineation of the peatland lake. However the adaptive thresholding of the weighted fusion image of σ-VH, σ-VV and MNDWI, and the random forest algorithm with all three data sets as input proves to be the most suitable for determining the lake area. The correlation coefficients between σ/NDWI and WTD vary greatly and lie in ranges of low to moderate correlation. © 2022, The Author(s).","lake water; peatland; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; water depth; water table","Fusion; NDWI; Peatland; SAR; Water area; Water table depth","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137774021"

For the Amazon rainforest, automated mapping is of critical importance, as land cover is changing rapidly due to forest degradation and deforestation. Several research groups have addressed this challenge by conducting local surveys and producing maps using freely available remote sensing data. However, automating the process of large-scale land cover mapping remains one of the biggest challenges in the remote sensing community. One issue when using supervised learning is the scarcity of labeled training data. One way to address this problem is to make use of already available maps produced with (semi-) automated classifiers. This is also known as weakly supervised learning. The present study aims to develop novel methods for automated LULC classification in the cloud-prone Amazon basin (Brazil) based on the labels from the MapBiomas project, which include twelve classes. We investigate different fusion techniques for multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time-series from 2018. The newly designed deep learning architectures—DeepForest-1 and DeepForest-2—utilize spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as multi-scale representations of the data. In several data scenarios, the models are compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) models, such as U-Net and DeepLab. The proposed networks reach an overall accuracy of up to 75.0%, similar to the SotA models. However, the novel approaches outperform the SotA models with respect to underrepresented classes. Forest, savanna and crop were mapped best, with F1 scores up to 85.0% when combining multi-modal data, compared to 81.6% reached by DeepLab. Furthermore, in a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the classifiers sometimes outperform the inaccurate labels. © 2022 by the authors.","Automation; Data fusion; Deep learning; Deforestation; Land use; Mapping; Modal analysis; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Supervised learning; Tropics; Amazon rain forest; Deep learning; Land-use and land-cover classifications; Multi-modal; Multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Tropic; Weak supervision; Synthetic aperture radar","Amazon rainforest; data fusion; deep learning; land use and land cover classification; multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; tropics; weak supervision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140030738"

Existing freeware do not consider novel segmentation algorithms, thus restrict their application to relatively homogeneous, large landholdings. We developed an open source QGIS plug-in ‘HS-FRAG’ to delineate agricultural fields of a fragmented landscape from a multi-spectral imagery using an object-based, hybrid segmentation algorithm. ‘HS-FRAG’ uses Sobel operator to extract the edges from individual spectral bands, followed by watershed algorithm to close the polygons. Three metrics, namely geometric evaluation (GE), quantitative completeness (QC), and spatial correctness (SC) were considered to evaluate segmentation performance. Robustness of the tool was demonstrated on a highly fragmented, heterogeneous cropland in south India using Sentinel-2 (10 m spatial) and Cartosat-2 (1.6 m spatial) imagery. Both Sentinel-2 and Cartosat-2 have resulted in over-segmentation (OS) with a generalization of 1.30, 1.37 and an overall accuracy (OA) of 38.06 %, 75.61 % respectively. Segmentation with Cartosat-2 has outperformed in representing the geometry, number, and extent of the reference polygons.

Of course, measured sensor data is altered by spectrally dependent effects due to the atmosphere, particularly molecular absorption and Rayleigh and aerosol scattering (e.g., haze, smoke, fog). Thus, an atmospheric compensation approach is warranted to remove these effects. Most existing atmospheric compensation algorithms, such as Landsat’s LaSRC and Sentinel’s Sen2Cor, are specifically designed to operate on single image products and do not leverage information collected over time. Leveraging a co-registered temporal series of images can be used to understand changing atmospheric effects over non-changing ground materials or objects. This can lead to a general improvement in surface reflectance retrievals as compared to retrievals from a single image. We present an atmospheric compensation algorithm, leveraging the dark dense vegetation approach to aerosol estimation, that takes advantage of multiple temporal images over a single site for an overall improved compensation result. More specifically the algorithm identifies psuedo-invariant feature pixels common across an entire time series and adjusts the compensation for an improved result over single image compensation. In this paper we illustrate results relative to RadCalNet ground truth bottom of the atmosphere reflectance measurements. Initial results show that our temporal approach outperforms Sen2Cor, improves surface reflectance retrieval accuracy of Sentinel-2 products by 38.63% (i.e., percent change relative to stand-alone processed), and yields an overall accuracy of 5.6% using a stack of 8 Sentinel-2 images (relative to RadCalNet ground truth values). © 2022 SPIE.","Aerosols; Image enhancement; Landsat; Reflection; Smoke; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Atmospheric compensation; Compensation algorithm; Ground truth; Multi-spectral; Multispectral imagery; Remote-sensing; Single images; Space-based; Surface reflectance; Temporal; Remote sensing","Atmospheric compensation; Multispectral; Remote sensing; Temporal","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141854550"

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the ability of the PRISMA hyperspectral imager to estimate topsoil properties (i.e., organic carbon, clay, sand, silt), in comparison with current satellite multispectral sensors. To investigate this expectation, a test was carried out using topsoil data collected in Italy following two approaches. Firstly, PRISMA, Sentinel‐2 and Landsat 8 spectral simulated datasets were obtained from the spectral resampling of a laboratory soil library. Subsequently, bare soil reflectance data were obtained from two experimental areas in Italy, using real satellites images, at dates close to each other. The estimation models of soil properties were calibrated employing both Partial Least Square Regression and Cubist Regression algorithms. The results of the study revealed that the best accuracies in retrieving topsoil properties were obtained by PRISMA data, using both laboratory and real datasets. Indeed, the resampled spectra of the hyperspectral imager provided the best Ratio of Performance to Inter‐Quartile distance (RPIQ) for clay (4.87), sand (3.80), and organic carbon (2.59) estimation, for the spectral soil library datasets. For the bare soil reflectance obtained from real satellite imagery, a higher level of prediction accuracy was obtained from PRISMA data, with RPIQ ± SE values of 2.32 ± 0.07 for clay, 3.85 ± 0.19 for silt, and 3.51 ± 0.16 for soil organic carbon. The results for the PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery with the Cubist Regression provided the best performance in the prediction of silt, sand, clay and SOC. The same variables were better estimated using PLSR models in the case of the resampled hyperspectral data. The statistical accuracy in the retrieval of SOC from real and resampled PRISMA data revealed the potential of the actual hyperspectral satellite. The results supported the expected good ability of the PRISMA imager to estimate topsoil properties. © 2022 by the authors.

In Palawan, Philippines, coastal aquaculture is gaining momentum towards increasing fish production, a pressure that presents a challenge to the sustainability of these areas. In this paper, we explore the application of Earth observation methods to map coastal aquaculture development in Palawan and evaluate the extent of its change. The European Space Agency Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument sensor data were applied in fully automatic mode to build maps of Palawan coastal aquaculture. The maps were validated using Google Earth high-resolution optical images and in situ observations in Malampaya Sound, and demonstrated a successful detection rate of 72%, while the false alarm rate was less than 7.5%. Objects only 5 m across, four times smaller than the spatial resolution of the Sentinel-1 sensors, were successfully detected using the developed methodology, thus exceeding the capabilities of other published methods that are limited to detecting large groups of aquaculture structures. The maps revealed aquaculture structures in high quantities in Malampaya Sound, Taytay Bay, and other locations in the coastal waters of Palawan, Philippines. A significant change of aquaculture spatial distribution was identified by comparing aquaculture maps generated with an interval of three years. This new automated methodology was validated as robust for mapping aquaculture objects in Palawan, Philippines, and can be applied to aquaculture studies in other regions worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

This paper applied a novel holistic biodiversity approach that could partition γ-diversity into α- and β-diversities for plant diversity mapping with operational satellites (WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and Zhuhai-1) and field plots in the Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. We compared the resulting outputs of the α-diversity from the holistic method (SDα) to those by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Rao's Q index, and the contributions of individual spectral features to α- and β-diversity were also measured. Results indicated that α- and β-diversities accounted for ~30% and ~ 70% of the total diversity in the Reserve, respectively. α-diversity derived from the WorldView-2 images showed statistically higher correlations with the observed Shannon's index (R2: 0.20–0.42) compared to that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (R2: 0.03–0.15). β-diversity derived from WorldView-2 images had the highest accuracy (90.00%), followed by that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (83.33% and 73.33%, respectively). Red-edge and near-infrared spectral features were the most informative features for diversity mapping while shortwave infrared (SWIR) features were also valuable for β-diversity mapping. Concurrent mapping of α- and β-diversities of mangrove forests represents the first step toward achieving rapid biodiversity monitoring schemes of mangrove forests over a national or global scale. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","China; Biodiversity; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Photomapping; Space optics; Spectroscopy; 20th century; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; Multi-spectral; Orders of magnitude; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Spectral diversity; Spectral feature; Worldview-2; biodiversity; deforestation; ground-based measurement; mangrove; mapping method; multispectral image; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; WorldView; Remote sensing","Biodiversity; Mangroves; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Spectral diversity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127771938"

In recent years, the water quality of inland water has deteriorated, the eutrophication has intensified, and the algal blooms frequently occur. The research of remote sensing inversion of PC has attracted more and more attention. Therefore, it is urgent to sort out and write a comprehensive overview paper. In this paper, 178 relevant literatures were reviewed, and the development history and trend of PC remote sensing inversion research of PC in the past 30 years (1990-2020) were comprehensively summarized from the perspectives of PC optical characteristics, development of inversion algorithms, application of satellite sensors, difficulties and interference factors of quantitative remote sensing inversion of PC. This paper helps us to understand the new ideas and new methods emerging at home and abroad, master the new development trends of PC remote sensing inversion in the future, and provide data basis for the monitoring and management of water environment, water quality and water resources. Over the past 30 years, PC remote sensing inversion study number rising, and a breakthrough in the algorithm, has a lot of classic algorithms, such as band ratio method, the baseline method, nested band ratio method, biological optical model, derivative algorithm and machine learning algorithms, algorithm successfully isolated PC spectral characteristic of absorption coefficients at wavelength of 620 nm. Decreased the influence of other optically active substances (Chla、TSM) and obtained the high precision of inversion and validation. In addition, the development of PC inversion algorithms mostly based on in situ hyperspectral data or aerial images (CASI-2, AISA Eagle). In order to meet the needs of PC concentration distribution in a certain space and frequency, satellite image data sources are mostly used. PC. There are many types of multi-spectral satellite data sources to choose, such as Landsat series, MODIS, MERIS, Sentinel-2 MSI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, etc. However, due to the more appropriate band setting, MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI are still the most used data sources for PC remote sensing inversion research. Because PC spectrum signal is weak, and vulnerable to the interference of chlorophyll a, TSM, there is still a major difficult to get an accurate estimation result. Based on the above analysis, the future development direction of PC remote sensing inversion can be summarized as the following aspects: first, an international standard measurement method is urgently needed in PC extraction testing; secondly, the development of algorithm, adhere to the mechanism research related to the inherent optical properties, and the integrating machine learning algorithm to bring higher inversion accuracy; third, the scale of study area water body in space and time will toward a larger geographical space scale, longer time series history tracing and future prediction; fourth, at the aspect of the expansion of application, PC remote sensing inversion is not limited to the quantitative estimation of cyanobacteria biomass, but will predict distribution of algal toxins and related diseases based on the relationships between these parameters and PC concentration, furtherly establish a water risk factor rating system based on remote sensing in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

For example, while the earliest versions of Planet's CubeSats provided tri-band and then quad-band optical image data, the most recent iterations deliver imaging capabilities with eight unique spectral bands for Earth system monitoring. To determine the utility of these rich geospatial data collections for a range of applications, it is necessary to characterise their radiometric accuracy. Leveraging on-ground spectroradiometer measurements of radiometrically pseudo-invariant features, we assess the absolute accuracy of an annual sequence of Planet SuperDove surface reflectance data. Date-coincident and spectrally overlapping Sentinel-2 image data were also used to assess the relative radiometric accuracy of the CubeSat reflectance data. Additionally, confidence levels for acquiring consistent SuperDove surface reflectance data were calculated, and the multi-temporal patterns of surface reflectance between the SuperDove and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products were evaluated by examining their rank correlation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) the average accuracy of the Coastal-Blue, Blue, Green I, and Green II SuperDove surface reflectance bands was 5% higher than for the Yellow, Red, Red-Edge, and Near-Infrared bands; (2) the SuperDove surface reflectance data was on average almost identical to the surface reflectance derived from the coincident Sentinel-2 data; and (3) the radiometric accuracies (i.e., mean errors) can be improved by using band combinations (e.g. normalised difference vegetation index). However, due to the different radiometric performance between the spectral bands, some vegetation indices (e.g. the Yellowness Index) did not provide a linear relationship between the SuperDove and reference data. The probability of acquiring surface reflectance data with less than 5% reflectance variation was approximately 90% for the annual multi-satellite dataset. On average, 68% of the data derived from a single satellite had at least 95% probability of acquiring surface reflectance with less than 5% variation. The time series patterns of the SuperDove reflectance data had an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 for all types of surface units and 0.77 for vegetated surfaces when compared with the spectrally overlapping bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. In addition to providing confidence levels for users to directly assess the radiometric accuracies of SuperDove surface reflectance products, we also provide suggestions to improve the data quality from an end-user's perspective. © 2022","accuracy assessment; radiometric method; satellite constellation; spatial data; spectral reflectance; surface reflectance","CubeSat; PlanetScope constellation; Radiometric accuracy; SuperDove; Surface reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138334985"

Although they are inherent part of the natural ecosystem processes, they severely impact managed forests. Modeling approaches serve as key tools for the evaluation of disturbance risk and different predisposing factors. However, data availability on relevant forest attributes can be problematic on a larger scale. While spaceborne remote sensing has already proven itself as a tool for disturbance detection, its use in relation to predisposing forest attributes remains underexploited. The present work explores multispectral object-based proxy predictors for statistical wind disturbance modeling based on the publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery and recorded damage polygons from the pan-European FORWIND database. Potential predictors were tested in logistic and random forests (RF) regression models for both disturbance occurrence and severity for a case study of a major storm event in Northern Germany from 2017. The results reveal a general potential of the derived spaceborne variables to be used as proxy variables to critical predisposing forest attributes. The presented proxy variables also outperformed a set of publicly available derived spatial data products for modeling both disturbance occurrence and severity. Model accuracies were moderate (reaching AUC = 0.76 for logistic regression fit and AUC = 0.69 for predictive accuracy of RF models), yet falling within the range of reported results in previous studies from the field. Limitations of the spectral satellite imagery as a single information source were acknowledged; however, the results indicate the further potential of spaceborne imagery applications in disturbance modeling, assessment and resulting mapping of disturbance susceptibility at different spatial scales. Considering the growing spatiotemporal availability of high-resolution spaceborne data, we propose that a model representation of post-disturbance forest patterns could improve the understanding of complex disturbance regimes and recurrent susceptibility. © 2022 by the authors.","Data; Forestry; Forests; Germany; Properties; Remote Sensing; Resolution; Variables; Germany; Forestry; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Case-studies; Disturbance models; Disturbance severity; Forest disturbances; Forest structure; Multi-spectral; Proxy variables; Sentinel-2; Space-borne; Windthrows; environmental disturbance; environmental factor; forest dynamics; image analysis; image resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; storm damage; Storms","disturbance modeling; disturbance severity; forest structure; Sentinel-2; windthrow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144612045"

The covered ancient tombs can be identified by studying the time-series features of the vegetation covering the ancient tombs on the multi-time series remote sensing images because the ancient tombs buried deep underground have long-term underground space structures, which affect the intrinsic properties of the surface soil so that the growth status of the covering vegetation is different from that of the vegetation in the area without ancient tombs. We first use the highly detailed DSM data to select the ancient tombs that cannot be visually distinguished on the optical images. Then, we explored and constructed the temporal features of the ancient tombs under the forest and the non-ancient tombs in the images, such as the radar timing-series features of Sentinel 1 and the multi-spectral and vegetation index timing-series features of Sentinel 2. Finally, based on these features and machine learning, we designed an automatic identification algorithm for ancient tombs under the forest. The method has been validated in Baling Mountain in Jingzhou, China. It is very feasible to automatically identify ancient tombs covered by surface vegetation by using the timing-series features of remote sensing images. Additionally, the identification of large ancient tombs or concentrated ancient tombs is more accurate, and the accuracy is improved after adding radar features.

The excessive amount of heavy metals in soil can harm and threaten human health. Therefore, monitoring of soil heavy metal content is urgent. Monitoring soil heavy metals by traditional methods requires many human and material resources. Remote sensing has shown advantages in the field of monitoring heavy metals. Based on 971 heavy metal samples and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images in Tai Lake, China, we analyzed the correlation between six heavy metals (Cd, Hg, As, Pb, Cu, Zn) and spectral factors, and selected As and Hg as the input factors of inversion model. The correlation coefficient of the best model of As was 0.53 (p < 0.01), and of Hg was 0.318 (p < 0.01). We used the methods of partial least squares regression (PLSR) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish inversion models with different combinations of spectral factors by using 649 measured samples. In addition, 322 measured samples were used for accuracy evaluation. Compared with the PLSR model, the BP neural network builds the model with higher accuracy, and B1-B4 combined with LnB1-LnB4 builds the model with the highest accuracy. The accuracy of the best model was verified, with an average error of 19% for As and 45% for Hg. Analyzing the spatial distribution of heavy metals by using the interpolation method of Kriging and IDW. The overall distribution trend of the two interpolations is similar. The concentration of As elements tends to increase from north to south, and the relatively high value of Hg elements is distributed in the east and west of the study area. The factories in the study area are distributed along rivers and lakes, which is consistent with the spatial distribution of heavy metal enrichment areas. The relatively high-value areas of heavy metal elements are related to the distribution of metal products factories, refractory porcelain factories, tile factories, factories and mining enterprises, etc., indicating that factory pollution is the main reason for the enrichment of heavy metals. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, various efforts have been made to extract critical information for agriculture land use classification areas using Sentinel-2 datasets, which was not possible with the help of multi-spectral datasets. As part of the current work, the artificial neural networks (ANN) classifier is combined with the post-classification comparison (PCC), thereby predicting seasonal variability from satellite imagery. The ANN classifier is incorporated into the post-classification comparison procedure, called ANN-based change detection. As part of the demonstration, the datasets were acquired using Sentinel-2 datasets during the period 2017 - 2018 over the agricultural land in Block Khamanon, District Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab State, India. This process cross-validated the performance of ANN with a conventional maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) for confirmation. In comparison with the conventional PCC-MLC model (classified maps have an average of 86 - 88.8%, and change maps have an average of 83.6 - 84.2%), the PCC-ANN model achieved accuracy (classified maps have an average of 90.4 - 93.4%, and change maps have an average of 87.4 - 90%). In addition to identifying water surfaces, crop types, and man-made features, this study can also help in performing a wide range of land-use patterns.  © 2022 IEEE.","Change detection; Classification (of information); Commerce; Land use; Maximum likelihood; Neural networks; Satellite imagery; Agricultural land; Artificial neural network classifiers; Change detection; Classifieds; Maximum likelihood classifier classifier; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Performance; Post-classification comparison-based change detection technique; Post-classification comparisons; Sentinel-2 dataset; Crops","ANN classifier; MLC classifier; PCC-based change detection technique; Sentinel-2 dataset","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146944145"

Here, we use a recently developed algorithm, S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), to invert coastal bathymetry from wave kinematics, based on the linear dispersion relation. Wave numbers and celerity are extracted from optical Sentinel-2 imagery, by exploiting the small temporal offset between the image bands of its Multi-Spectral Instrument. Inverted depths are output at 200 m resolution, and individual depth points are merged to create a composite bathymetry using a weighted average of images from 10 different dates. The resulting bathymetry mosaic spans 4000 km along the West African coast. S2Shores is able to detect depths up to 35 m, depending on mean incident wave conditions and cloud cover, which varies by location. Underwater features are well reproduced by S2Shores, such as flow channels in Guinea, the St. Ann's Shoal in Sierra Leone, and ebb delta lobes at several outlets along the Niger River Delta. S2Shores results match well (r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 4.9 m) with a bathymetry survey along the Senegalese coast. As a difference with traditional satellite-derived bathymetry methods based on water colour, a wave-based approach allows estimations in turbid areas and relatively deep waters, which suggest that the two approaches are complementary and should be used in combination to cover coastal environments in their diversity. The new possibility offered by this regional coastal atlas opens the door to increased research and planning capabilities and sets an example that can be applied to the rest of the world. © 2022 The Authors","Guinea; Niger River; Sierra Leone; Behavioral research; Hydrographic surveys; Satellite imagery; Coastal bathymetry; Coastal behaviors; Large-scales; Linear dispersion relations; Optical imagery; Optical-; Satellite-derived bathymetry; Underwater feature; Wave kinematics; West Africa; atlas; bathymetry; cloud cover; image analysis; satellite imagery; underwater vehicle; wave action; Bathymetry","Optical imagery; Satellite-derived bathymetry; Underwater features; Waves; West Africa","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131404798"

Faidherbia albida trees are characterized by their inverse phenology, growing leaf flowers and pods during the dry season, thereby providing fodder and shedding leaves during the wet season, which minimizes competition with pastures and crops for resources. Multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite systems and novel computational methods open new doors for classifying single trees and identifying species. This study used a Multi-Layer Perception feedforward artificial neural network to classify pixels covered by Faidherbia albida canopies from Sentinel-2 time series in Senegal, West Africa. To better discriminate the Faidherbia albida signal from the background, monthly images from vegetation indices were used to form relevant variables for the model. We found that NDI54/NDVI from the period covering onset of leaf senescence (February) until end of senescence (leaf-off in June) to be the most important, resulting in a high precision and recall rate of 0.91 and 0.85. We compared our result with a potential Faidherbia albida occurrence map derived by empirical modelling of the species ecology, which deviates notably from the actual species occurrence mapped by this study. We have shown that even small differences in dry season leaf phenology can be used to distinguish tree species. The Faidherbia albida distribution maps, as provided here, will be key in managing farmlands in drylands, helping to optimize economic and ecological services from both tree and crop products. © 2022 by the authors.

Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data of the Copernicus program offer time series with temporal, spatial, radiometric, and spectral characteristics that have great potential for mapping and monitoring agricultural crops. This paper presents an approach which synergistically uses these multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series for the classification of 17 crop classes at 10 m spatial resolution for Germany in the year 2018. Input data for the Random Forest (RF) classification are monthly statistics of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series. This approach reduces the amount of input data and pre-processing steps while retaining phenological information, which is crucial for crop type discrimination. For training and validation, Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) data were available covering 15 of the 16 German Federal States. An overall map accuracy of 75.5% was achieved, with class-specific F1-scores above 80% for winter wheat, maize, sugar beet, and rapeseed. By combining optical and SAR data, overall accuracies could be increased by 6% and 9%, respectively, compared to single sensor approaches. While no increase in overall accuracy could be achieved by stratifying the classification in natural landscape regions, the class-wise accuracies for all but the cereal classes could be improved, on average, by 7%. In comparison to census data, the crop areas could be approximated well with, on average, only 1% of deviation in class-specific acreages. Using this streamlined approach, similar accuracies for the most widespread crop types as well as for smaller permanent crop classes were reached as in other Germany-wide crop type studies, indicating its potential for repeated nationwide crop type mapping. © 2022 by the authors.

However, a substantial amount of effort and infrastructure is still required for the generation of analysis-ready data (ARD) from the low-level products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). Here, a flexible Python framework able to generate a range of consistent ARD aligned with the ESA-recommended processing pipeline is detailed. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are radiometrically calibrated, speckle-filtered and terrain-corrected, and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data resampled in order to harmonise the spatial resolution between the two streams and to allow stacking with multiple scene classification masks. The global coverage and flexibility of the framework allows users to define a specific region of interest (ROI) and time window to create geo-referenced Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, or a combination of both with closest temporal alignment. The framework can be applied to any location and is user-centric and versatile in generating multi-modal and multi-temporal ARD. Finally, the framework handles automatically the inherent challenges in processing Sentinel data, such as boundary regions with missing values within Sentinel-1 and the filtering of Sentinel-2 scenes based on ROI cloud coverage. © 2022 by the authors.

Since April 2021, mucilage has emerged as both an ecological and economical problem in Turkey, spreading over an area of kilometers, clogging the fishing nets, causing problems in marine vessels, and disrupting the industry. These findings indicate that mucilage monitoring, early detection, and intervention before the economic and ecological damages grow out of proportion is quite necessary. Through the analysis of satellite data, it is possible to observe the existence of mucilage as thin, extended layers of white substance. Therefore, in this work, we analyze the Sentinel-2 multispectral data and PRISMA hyperspectral data to detect the mucilage in the early stages through the use of both traditional as well as deep learning algorithms.

However, due to cloud cover the observations of NDVI are discrete and vary in the intensity. Therefore, there is a need to estimate the NDVI during cloud cover using alternative sources of satellite observations. The main objective of this study is to estimate NDVI during cloudy conditions using moderate resolution multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations. Two approaches were identified: 1) pixel replacement and 2) machine learning based regression analysis to estimate cloud free NDVI. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day NDVI composite, Sentinel-1 SAR and cloud masked Sentinel-2 multi-spectral observations were collected for entire cropping season. The satellite observations were selected only for agricultural areas by applying the agriculture, non-agriculture land use land cover mask. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used for NDVI estimation. Regression analysis was performed using Sentinel-2 NDVI as an independent variable and VV, VH, Cross Ratio (i.e., VV/VH), and MODIS NDVI as dependent variables.

Particularly ice-rich permafrost is vulnerable to rapid thaw and erosion, impacting whole landscapes and ecosystems. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are abrupt permafrost disturbances that expand by several meters each year and lead to an increased soil organic carbon release. Local Remote Sensing studies identified increasing RTS activity in the last two decades by increasing number of RTS or heightened RTS growth rates. However, a large-scale assessment across diverse permafrost regions and at high temporal resolution allowing to further determine RTS thaw dynamics and its main drivers is still lacking. In this study we apply the disturbance detection algorithm LandTrendr for automated large-scale RTS mapping and high temporal thaw dynamic assessment to North Siberia (8.1 × 106km2). We adapted and parametrised the temporal segmentation algorithm for abrupt disturbance detection to incorporate Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics, conducted spectral filtering, spatial masking and filtering, and a binary machine-learning object classification of the disturbance output to separate between RTS and false positives (F1 score: 0.609). Ground truth data for calibration and validation of the workflow was collected from 9 known RTS cluster sites using very high-resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope imagery. Our study presents the first automated detection and assessment of RTS and their temporal dynamics at large-scale for 2001–2019. We identified 50,895 RTS and a steady increase in RTS-affected area from 2001 to 2019 across North Siberia, with a more abrupt increase from 2016 onward. Overall the RTS-affected area increased by 331% compared to 2000 (2000: 20,158 ha, 2001–2019: 66,699 ha). Contrary to this, 5 focus sites show spatio-temporal variability in their annual RTS dynamics, with alternating periods of increased and decreased RTS development, indicating a close relationship to thaw drivers. The majority of identified RTS was active from 2000 onward and only a small proportion initiated during the assessment period, indicating that the increase in RTS-affected area was mainly caused by enlarging existing RTS and not by new RTS. The detected increase in RTS dynamics suggests advancing permafrost thaw and underlines the importance of assessing abrupt permafrost disturbances with high spatial and temporal resolution at large-scales. Obtaining such consistent disturbance products will help to parametrise regional and global climate change models. © 2021","Siberia; Dynamics; Erosion; Image segmentation; Machine learning; Organic carbon; Permafrost; Spectrum analysis; Thawing; Time series analysis; Affected area; LANDSAT; Large-scales; Multi-spectral analysis; Permafrost thaws; Retrogressive thaw slump; Sentinel-2; Thaw slump; Thermo-erosion; Times series; climate change; disturbance; global climate; organic carbon; permafrost; RapidEye; remote sensing; segmentation; Remote sensing","Landsat; Multi-spectral analysis; Permafrost thaw; Retrogressive thaw slumps; Sentinel-2; Thermo-erosion; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118110174"

Since 2017, Sentinel-2A/B provide multi-spectral time series with global coverage at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This is a new opportunity for mapping tree species over large areas that has not yet been fully explored. Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5%, ranged between 98.9% and 66.8%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Europe; Conservation; Forestry; Image texture; Mapping; Textures; Time series analysis; Area proportions; Classification errors; Environmental data; High spatial resolution; Sentinel-2; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Species mapping; Temperate forests; Times series; Tree species; canopy architecture; forest management; phenology; satellite data; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; temperate forest; time series analysis; Time series","Image texture; Interpolation; Sentinel-2; Temperate forests; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116885234"

Among the possible Earth Observation (EO) applications, the detection of volcanic eruptions has been investigated with the objective to produce prompt alerts and allow immediate interventions. Before mounting the equipment on possible future satellite missions, experiments must be carried out in advance to prove the efficiency of the proposed architecture.

A strip with an image from a volcanic eruption is printed and used for the demo. The prototype employs hardware components characterized by low costs, and simple to find and to use. Moreover, the dataset created and used for this work has been published on GitHub, made available to interested researchers.

Remote sensing has the great advantages of broad spatial coverage and regular revisit to meet the demand of large-scale and long-term tasks of earth observation. Although there already exist some methods for coarse-grained identification of reservoirs at region-level in remote sensing images, it remains a challenge to recognize and localize reservoirs accurately with insufficiency of object details and samples annotated. This study focuses on the fine-grained identification and location of reservoirs with a two-stage CNN framework method, which is comprised of a coarse classification between aquatic and land areas of image patches and a fine detection of reservoirs in aquatic patches with precise geographical coordinates. Moreover, a NIR RCNN detection network is proposed to make use of the multi-spectral characteristics of Sentinel-2 images. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we construct a reservoir and dam dataset of 36 Sentinel-2 images which are sampled in various provinces across China and annotated at the instance level by manual work. The experimental results in the test set show that the two-stage CNN method achieves an average recall of 80.83% nationwide, and the comparison between reservoirs recognized by the proposed model and those provided by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research verifies that the model reaches a recall of about 90%. Both the indicator evaluation and visualization of identification results have shown the applicability of the proposed method to reservoir recognition in remote sensing images. Being the first attempt to make a fine-grained identification of reservoirs at the instance level, the two-stage CNN framework, which can automatically identify and localize reservoirs in remote sensing images precisely, shows the prospect to be a useful tool for large-scale and long-term reservoir monitoring. © 2022 by the authors.","China; Deep learning; Flood control; Learning systems; Object detection; Remote sensing; Water resources; Deep learning; Fine grained; Large-scales; Objects detection; Recognition of reservoir; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Two-stage CNN framework; Waters resources; mapping; recognition; remote sensing; reservoir; Sentinel; Reservoirs (water)","deep learning; object detection; recognition of reservoirs; remote sensing; Sentinel-2; two-stage CNN framework","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142443965"

While some Land Cover (LC) maps are publicly available, the knowledge of the up-to-date urban extent for a specific instance in time is often missing. The lack of a relevant urban mask, especially in developing countries, increases the burden on Earth Observation (EO) data users or requires them to rely on time-consuming manual classification. This paper explores fast and effective exploitation of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for the generation of urban LC, which can be frequently updated. The method is based on an Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), where one Multi-Spectral (MS) image is used to define clusters of similar pixels through super-pixel segmentation. A short stack (<2 months) of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is then employed to classify the clusters, exploiting the unique characteristics of the radio backscatter from human-made targets. The repeated illumination and acquisition geometry allows defining robust features based on amplitude, coherence, and polarimetry. Data from ascending and descending orbits are combined to overcome distortions and decrease sensitivity to the orientation of structures. Finally, an unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) model is used to separate the signature of urban targets in a mixed environment. The method was validated in two sites in Portugal, with diverse types of LC and complex topography. Comparative analysis was performed with two state-of-the-art high-resolution solutions, which require long sensing periods, indicating significant agreement between the methods (averaged accuracy of around 90%). © 2021 by the authors.

MS sensors are limited to cloud free conditions, whereas SAR imagery is plagued by noise-like speckle. Prior studies that use combinations of MS and SAR data to overcome individual limitations of these sensors have not fully examined sensitivity of flood mapping performance to different combinations of SAR and MS derived spectral indices or band transformations in color space. This study explores the use of diverse bands of Sentinel 2 (S2) through well-established water indices and Sentinel 1 (S1) derived SAR imagery along with their combinations to assess their capability for generating accurate flood inundation maps. The robustness in performance of S-1 and S-2 band combinations was evaluated using 446 hand labeled flood inundation images spanning across 11 flood events from Sen1Floods11 dataset which are highly diverse in terms of land cover as well as location. A modified K-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of 32 combinations of S1 and S2 bands using a fully connected deep convolutional neural network known as U-Net. Our results indicated that usage of elevation information has improved the capability of S1 imagery to produce more accurate flood inundation maps. Compared to a median F1 score of 0.62 when using only S1 bands, the combined use of S1 and elevation information led to an improved median F1 score of 0.73. Water extraction indices based on S2 bands have a statistically significant superior performance in comparison to S1. Among all the band combinations, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation of S2 bands provides a median F1 score of 0.9, outperforming the commonly used water spectral indices owing to HSV's transformation's superior contrast distinguishing abilities. Additionally, U-Net algorithm was able to learn the relationship between raw S2 based water extraction indices and their corresponding raw S2 bands, but not of HSV owing to relatively complex computation involved in the latter. Results of the paper establishes important benchmarks for the extension of S1 and S2 data-based flood inundation mapping efforts over large spatial extents. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The 20 m method incorporates an ensemble of three spectral indexes with optimal band thresholds, whereas the 10 m method achieves similar results using fewer bands and a single spectral index. A spectrally balanced and randomly generated set of training data based on the index values and optimal thresholds is used to fit machine learning classifiers. Statistical validation compares the 20 m ensemble-only method to the 20 m ensemble method with a random forest classifier. Results show the 20 m ensemble-only method had an overall accuracy of 89.5% (±1.7%), whereas the ensemble method combined with the random forest classifier performed better, with a ~4.8% higher overall accuracy: 20 m method (94.3% (±1.3%)) with optimal spectral index and SWIR thresholds of −0.03 and 800, respectively, and 10 m method (93.4% (±1.5%)) with optimal spectral index and NIR thresholds of −0.01 and 800, respectively. Comparison of other supervised classifiers trained automatically with the framework typically resulted in less than 1% accuracy improvement compared with the random forest, suggesting that training data quality is more important than classifier type. This straightforward framework enables accurate surface water classification across diverse geographies, making it ideal for development into a decision support tool for water resource managers. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the consistencies of LAI products derived from different satellites using different retrieval approaches should be assessed. This study aimed at understanding the spatiotemporal consistency of crop LAI derived from S2/MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument, Sentinel-2) and L8/OLI (Operational Land Imager, Landsat 8) data using two retrieving approaches, a field-data-driven (FDD) approach driven by field measured LAI and a hybrid approach based on simulations of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model. Results from the two approaches were assessed using field measured LAI for six types of crops in 2016 over Manitoba, one of the major agricultural provinces in the Canadian Prairies. LAI estimates from S2/MSI data obtained unbiased root-mean-square-error (ubRMSE) of 0.39 and 0.51 cm2 cm−2 for the FDD and hybrid approaches respectively. For the L8/OLI, ubRMSE of LAI estimates were 0.82 and 0.92 cm2cm−2 for the FDD and hybrid approaches, respectively. To evaluate the temporal consistency of crop LAI derived from the two satellites, daily crop LAI was reconstructed using the Parametric Double-Hyperbolic Tangent model (PDHT) with the aid of Bayesian statistical approach. Time series crop LAI of the hybrid approach had lower variability of estimated parameters in the PDHT and reconstructed daily LAI compared with that of the FDD approach. Based on the Spatial Efficiency Metric (SPAEF) that is a spatial performance metric for assessing spatial pattern similarity, the hybrid approach obtained relatively strong spatial consistency of LAI derived from the two satellites compared with the FDD approach. The study revealed that hybrid approach can achieve good spatiotemporal consistencies in seasonal LAI estimates from the two satellites combined when large numbers of field measurements are not available. © 2023","","LAI; Landsat 8; Sentinel-2; Spatiotemporal consistency","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147878374"

Fusion of a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI datacube) with its corresponding high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI datacube) to reconstruct a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) has been a significant subject in recent years. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve a high quality of spatial and spectral information fusion. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-Scale Learning Model (called DeepSen3) of spatial-spectral information fusion based on multi-scale inception residual convolutional neural network (CNN) for more efficient hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion from ESA remote sensing satellite missions (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images). The proposed DeepSen3 fusion network was applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10, 20 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images.

Therefore, cloud detection or cloud mask products for optical image processing is a very important step. Compared with conventional optical remote sensing satellites (such as Landsat series and Sentinel-2), sustainable development science Satellite-1 (SDGSAT-1) multi-spectral imager (MII) lacks a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band that can be used to effectively distinguish cloud and snow. To solve the above problems, a cloud detection method based on spectral and gradient features (SGF) for SDGSAT-1 multispectral images is proposed in this paper. According to the differences in spectral features between cloud and other ground objects, the method combines four features, namely, brightness, normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and haze-optimized transformation (HOT) to distinguish cloud and most ground objects. Meanwhile, in order to adapt to different environments, the dynamic threshold using Otsu’s method is adopted. In addition, it is worth mentioning that gradient features are used to distinguish cloud and snow in this paper. With the test of SDGSAT-1 multispectral images and comparison experiments, the results show that SGF has excellent performance. The overall accuracy of images with snow surface can reach 90.80%, and the overall accuracy of images with other surfaces is above 94%. © 2022 by the authors.","Feature extraction; Geometrical optics; Image processing; Infrared radiation; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Cloud detection; Cloud detection method; Gradient feature; Ground objects; Multispectral images; Optical remote sensing; Overall accuracies; SDGSAT-1; Spectral feature; Visible band; Snow","cloud detection; gradient features; SDGSAT-1; spectral features","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145877895"

Climate change due to anthropogenic activities is inducing global warming that, for example, has resulted in glacier melting. This has had a significant impact on sea levels and ocean circulation. In this study, the temporal trend of the marine-terminated d’Iberville glacier (Ellesmere Island, Canada) is analysed using C-band synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery collected by the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 missions. The data set consists of a time series of 10 synthetic aperture radar data collected from 2010 to 2022 in dual-polarimetric imaging mode, where a horizontally polarised electromagnetic wave was transmitted. An automatic approach based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate method is applied to the single- and dual-polarisation features, namely the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section and a combination of the HH- and HV-polarised scattering amplitudes, with the aim of extracting the ice front of the glacier and, therefore, estimating its behaviour over time. Independent collocated satellite optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument is also considered, where available, to support the experimental outcomes. The experimental results show that (1) the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section achieved better performance with respect to the dual-polarised feature, especially under the most challenging case of a sea-ice infested sea surface; (2) when the HH-polarised normalised radar cross-section was considered, the ice front extraction methodology provided a satisfactory accuracy, i.e., a root mean square error spanning from about 1.1 pixels to 3.4 pixels, depending on the sea-surface conditions; and (3) the d’Iberville glacier exhibited, during the study period, a significant retreat whose average surface velocity was 160 m per year, resulting in a net ice area loss of 2.2 km2 (0.18 km2 per year). These outcomes demonstrate that the d’Iberville glacier is behaving as most of the marine-terminated glaciers in the study area while experiencing a larger ice loss. © 2022 by the authors.","Electromagnetic waves; Extraction; Global warming; Mean square error; Pixels; Polarization; Radar cross section; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Sea level; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Anthropogenic activity; C-band SAR; C-bands; Canada; D’iberville glacier; Ice front extraction; Multi-polarization; Normalized radar cross section; Polar Regions; SAR imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","C-band SAR; Canada; d’Iberville glacier; ice front extraction; polarisation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144421612"

In this study, we explored the detection of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) outbreaks at the individual tree crown level using multispectral satellite images. Moreover, we explored the possibility of tracking the progression of the outbreak over time using multitemporal data. Sentinel-2 data acquired during the summer of 2020 over a bark beetle–infested area in the Italian Alps were used for the mapping and tracking over time, while airborne lidar data were used to automatically detect the individual tree crowns and to classify tree species. Mapping and tracking of the outbreak were carried out using a support vector machine classifier with input vegetation indices extracted from the multispectral data. The results showed that it was possible to detect two stages of the outbreak (i.e., early, and late) with an overall accuracy of 83.4%. Moreover, we showed how it is technically possible to track the evolution of the outbreak in an almost bi-weekly period at the level of the individual tree crowns. The outcomes of this paper are useful from both a management and ecological perspective: it allows forest managers to map a bark beetle outbreak at different stages with a high spatial accuracy, and the maps describing the evolution of the outbreak could be used in further studies related to the behavior of bark beetles. © 2022 by the authors.

Freely available multispectral datasets are widely used for land cover and land use mapping, but they have limited utility for fuel mapping due to their coarse spectral resolution. So, in this study, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from PRISMA has been used for fuel types classification. The feed-forward neural network showed an overall accuracy of 79% by validation. To convert the classification map into a dynamic fuel map, the knowledge of the proportion of live/dead herbaceous loads available in that area is essential.

This can be a critical issue for crop monitoring, especially for applications relying on machine learning techniques, which generally assume that the feature matrix does not have missing values. This paper proposes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for the reconstruction of parcel-level features extracted from multispectral images. A robust version of the GMM is also investigated, since datasets can be contaminated by inaccurate samples or features (e.g., wrong crop type reported, inaccurate boundaries, undetected clouds, etc). Additional features extracted from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using Sentinel-1 data are also used to provide complementary information and improve the imputations. The robust GMM investigated in this work assigns reduced weights to the outliers during the estimation of the GMM parameters, which improves the final reconstruction. These weights are computed at each step of an Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm by using outlier scores provided by the isolation forest (IF) algorithm. Experimental validation is conducted on rapeseed and wheat parcels located in the Beauce region (France). Overall, we show that the GMM imputation method outperforms other reconstruction strategies. A mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.013 (resp. 0.019) is obtained for the imputation of the median Normalized Difference Index (NDVI) of the rapeseed (resp. wheat) parcels. Other indicators (e.g., Normalized Difference Water Index) and statistics (for instance the interquartile range, which captures heterogeneity among the parcel indicator) are reconstructed at the same time with good accuracy. In a dataset contaminated by irrelevant samples, using the robust GMM is recommended since the standard GMM imputation can lead to inaccurate imputed values. An application to the monitoring of anomalous crop development in the presence of missing data is finally considered. In this application, using the proposed method leads to the best detection results, especially when SAR data are used jointly with multispectral images. Exploiting the information contained in cloudy multispectral images instead of removing these images is beneficial for this application. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Beauce [Centre]; Anomaly detection; Crops; Data mining; Forestry; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Oilseeds; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Statistics; Synthetic aperture radar; Anomaly detection; Crop monitoring; Data imputation; Expectation Maximization; Gaussian Mixture Model; Heterogeneity; Isolation forest; Missing data; Multi-spectral; Robust gaussian mixture model; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic aperture radar; Vigor; algorithm; data set; detection method; heterogeneity; machine learning; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Gaussian distribution","Anomaly detection; Crop monitoring; Data imputation; Expectation–Maximization; Heterogeneity; Isolation Forest; Missing data; Multispectral; Robust Gaussian Mixture Model; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Vigor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129796783"

In particular, time-critical disaster applications, require accurate and immediate cloud and cloud shadow masks while being able to adapt to possibly large variations caused by different sensor characteristics, scene properties or atmospheric conditions. This study introduces the newly developed open-source Python package ukis-csmaski for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation in multi-spectral satellite images. Segmentation with ukis-csmaski is performed with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network based on a U-Net architecture. It works directly on Level-1C data, eliminating the need for prior atmospheric correction. Images need to be in top of atmosphere reflectance and include at least the Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 spectral bands. We provide a performance evaluation on a recent benchmark dataset for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation and proof the generalization ability of our method across multiple satellites (Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2). We also show the influence of augmentation and image bands on the segmentation performance and compare it to the widely used Fmask algorithm and a Random Forest classifier.

Within this framework, this work proposed a hierarchical (HI) approach to the classification of crops (soya, corn, wheat, rice, and meadow) explicitly aimed at supporting CAP controls in agriculture, with special concerns about the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) agricultural situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a comparison is made between HI and other, more ordinary approaches. In particular, two algorithms were considered as references: the minimum distance (MD) and the random forest (RF). Tests were operated in a study area located in the southern part of the Vercelli province (Piemonte), which is mainly devoted to agriculture. Training and validation steps were performed for all the classification approaches (HI, MD, RF) using the same ground data. MD and RF were based on S2‐derived NDVI image time series (TS) for the 2020 year. Differently, HI was built according to a rule‐based approach developing according to the following steps: (a) TS standard deviation analysis in the time domain for meadows mapping; (b) MD classification of winter part of TS in the time domain for wheat detection; (c) MD classification of summer part of TS in the time domain for corn classification; (d) selection of a proper summer multi‐spectral image (SMSI) useful for separating rice from soya with MD operated in the spectral domain. To separate crops of interest from other classes, MD‐based classifications belonging to HI were thresholded by Otsu’s method. Overall accuracy for MD, RF, and HI were found to be 63%, 80%, and 89%, respectively. It is worth remarking that thanks to the SMSI‐based approach of HI, a significant improvement was obtained in soya and rice classification. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, we focus on one of the remote glacier areas, namely the Tyndall Glacier area in the Southern Patagonian Icefield in Chile. Based on optical remote sensing data in the form of multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery, we analyze the extent of different snow and ice classes on the surface of the glacier by means of pixel-wise classification. Our study comprises three main steps: (1) Labeled Sentinel-2 compliant data are obtained from theoretical spectral reflectance curves, as there are no training data available for the investigated area; (2) Four different classification approaches are used and compared in their ability to identify the defined five snow and ice types, thereof two unsupervised approaches (k-means clustering and rule-based classification via snow and ice indices) and two supervised approaches (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Random Forest classifier); (3) We first focus on the pixel-wise classification of Sentinel-2 imagery, and we then use the best-performing approach for a multi-temporal analysis of the Tyndall Glacier area. While the achieved classification results reveal that all of the used classification approaches are suitable for detecting different snow and ice classes on the glacier surface, the multi-temporal analysis clearly reveals the seasonal development of the glacier. The change of snow and ice types on the glacier surface is evident, especially between the end of ablation season (April) and the end of accumulation season (September) in Southern Chile. © 2022 by the authors.

Remote sensing technology can be an effective way to rapidly acquire the spatial distribution of soil texture. Taking the Youyi Farm in Heilongjiang Province of China as the study area, this study aims to evaluate the best time window for the remote sensing inversion of soil texture in the cultivated land. 25 Sentinel-2 images were selected in the study area from 2019 to 2021. The band and spectral index of each image were input into the random forest model, in order to establish a remote sensing inversion model of soil texture. A comparison was made on the model accuracy of soil texture inversion from the images in different periods. The most suitable image was determined for the remote sensing inversion of soil texture. The spatial distribution of soil texture was obtained to evaluate the accuracy of soil texture inversion from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images on different dates. The results showed that: 1) From the visible light to short wave infrared 1 (1 565-1 655nm) spectral reflectance increased with the increase of wavelength, from the short wave infrared 1 to short wave infrared 2 (2 100-2 280nm) spectral reflectance decreased significantly. The spectral reflectance decreased with the increase of silt and clay content, whereas there was an increase with the increase of sand content. 2) There was the maximum accuracy of inversion model in the silt and sand on May 7, 2020 (the coefficient of determination (R2) of silt was 0.785 in 25 Sentinel-2 images, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 6.697%; the R2 of sand was 0.776, and RMSE was 8.296 %). The maximum accuracy was also achieved in the clay inversion model on May 3, 2019 (R2=0.776, RMSE=1.600%). 3) The appropriate time of satellite images was selected as an important impact on soil texture inversion. The best time window was from late April to mid-May in the study area. The time window and good-quality spectral data were obtained to develop a stable spectral model for the spatial distribution of soil texture. 4) Different inversion accuracy of soil texture were obtained using the 25 Sentinel-2 images from 2019 to 2021. This data was attributed to the soil water content and straw mulching. 5) The silt and clay particles were distributed more in the northeast, north, and south, and less in the middle and southwest of the study area. There was the opposite trend of the sand, especially the generally high sand content in the middle of the study area. Therefore, the high-precision remote sensing inversion model was achieved in the soil texture. The finding can provide the key technologies for regional soil texture mapping and farmland protection in the black soil areas. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Therefore, the knowledge of bathymetry is crucial for a variety of maritime applications, such as shipping and navigation. Maritime applications have benefited from recent advancements in satellite navigation technology, which can utilize multi-spectral bands for retrieving information on water depth. As part of these efforts, this study combined deep learning techniques with satellite observations in order to improve the estimation of satellite-based bathymetry. The objective of this study is to develop a new method for estimating coastal bathymetry using Sentinel-2 images. Sentinel-2 was used here due to its high spatial resolution, which is desirable for bathymetry maps, as well as its visible bands, which are useful for estimating bathymetry. The conventional linear model approach using the satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) ratio (green to blue) was applied, and a new four-band ratio using the four visible bands of Sentienl-2 was proposed. In addition, three atmospheric correction models, Sen2Cor, ALOCITE, and C2RCC, were evaluated, and Sen2Cor was found to be the most effective model. Gradient boosting was also applied in this study to both the conventional band ratio and the proposed FVBR ratio. Compared to the green to blue ratio, the proposed ratio FVBR performed better, with R2 exceeding 0.8 when applied to 12 snapshots between January and December. The gradient boosting method was also found to provide better estimates of bathymetry than linear regression. According to findings of this study, the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, sediments, and atmospheric dust do not affect the estimated bathymetry. However, tidal oscillations were found to be a significant factor affecting satellite estimates of bathymetry. © 2022 by the authors.","Bathymetry; Deep learning; Abu Dhabi; Arabian Gulf; Band ratios; Coastal bathymetry; Gradient boosting; Satellite-derived bathymetry; Sentinel-2; Shallow waters; Turbid water; Visible band; Satellites","Abu Dhabi; Arabian Gulf; SDB; Sentinel-2; shallow waters; turbid waters","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140021949"

In particular, a disruption to the delivery of goods and services can leave large portions of the population in a vulnerable state. Research suggests that resilience to shocks is a function of physical fortifications and social processes, such as levees and critical infrastructure, the strength of social networks, or community efficacy, and trust. While physical fortifications are relatively easy to identify and catalog, the measurement of social processes is more difficult due to data limitations and geographic constraints. Recent work has shown that certain types of infrastructure may correlate with social processes that enhance community resilience; however, the ability to assess where and to what extent that infrastructure exists depends on a complete representation of the built environment. OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Places are two sources of data commonly used to identify the location and type of infrastructure but can display varying degrees of completeness depending on geographic location. We address this limitation by applying a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to remotely sensed data from Sentinel-2 to estimate the density and type of infrastructure. We compare the classification results to known infrastructure locations from OSM data. Our results show that the CNN classifier performs well and may be used to augment incomplete data sets for a deeper understanding of the prevalence of infrastructure associated with social processes that enhance community resilience.  © 2022 SPIE.","Classification (of information); Computer software maintenance; Ecosystems; Remote sensing; Built environment; Community resiliences; Convolution neural network; Dense urban areas; Fragile city; Multi-spectral analysis; Remote-sensing; Social process; Spectral feature; Spectral reflectances; Location","community resilience; Dense urban areas; fragile cities; multispectral analysis; remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136116560"

The Selenga River is the most important water resource on the Mongolian Plateau and the only river that enters the largest freshwater lake in the world--Lake Baikal in Russia. Thus, an accurate understanding of the hydrologic characteristics of the Selenga River Basin is critical in monitoring the ecology, environment, and water resources in Northeast Asia. Obtaining the plane morphology of curved rivers in the upper reaches of the plateau region is helpful to analyze the mathematical and physical mechanism of the evolution of curved rivers, which is of great significance to the study of river geomorphology. In this study, the Selenga River Basin in the Mongolia was taken as the study area. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite remote sensing images, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) were used to construct a deep neural network model for the extraction of fine water body data in the Selenga River Basin. Three different types of water bodies, including lakes, main streams, and tributaries, were selected to compare the extraction results of deep neural network with the extraction results of support vector machines and Global Surface Water data. Global 30 m SRTM data were then used to generate a river system vector distribution map, identify river extraction target areas, and draw a 10 m spatial resolution river distribution map for the 2019 Selenga River Basin using output from the deep neural network model. Results indicate that, firstly, this method can accurately produce a water regime map for a large basin. The extraction results can reflect the spatial distribution of rivers in the Selenga River Basin in Mongolia, as well as reduce the drying-up and empty phenomenon of rivers. Secondly, the batch size of eight in the deep neural network model optimize data processing speed and accuracy while the four hidden layers in the neural network structure produce an accuracy evaluation index of 0.9666, which guarantees feature mining capabilities of models. Thirdly, after the verification of sample points, the overall accuracy reaches 97.65%, meeting actual application requirements. Thus, this research provides a method and data support for water body extraction for the Mongolian Plateau, which will play an important role in revealing long-term changes in river hydrological conditions, and impact related research on resources and environmental benefits. © 2022, Science Press.

The framework is made up of three basic parts including data collection and preprocessing, deep-learning-based active fire detection, and final product generation modules. The active fire detection module is developed on a specifically designed dual-domain channel-position attention (DCPA)+HRNetV2 model and a dataset with semi-manually annotated active fire samples is con-structed over wildfires that commenced on the east coast of Australia and the west coast of the United States in 2019–2020 for the training process. This dataset can be used as a benchmark for other deep-learning-based algorithms to improve active fire detection accuracy. The performance of active fire detection is evaluated regarding the detection accuracy of deep-learning-based models and the processing efficiency of the whole framework. Results indicate that the DCPA and HRNetV2 combination surpasses DeepLabV3 and HRNetV2 models for active fire detection. In addition, the automated framework can deliver active fire detection results of Sentinel-2 inputs with coverage of about 12,000 km2 (including data download) in less than 6 min, where average intersections over union (IoUs) of 70.4% and 71.9% were achieved in tests over Australia and the United States, respectively. Concepts in this framework can be further applied to other remote sensing sensors with data acquisitions in SWIR-NIR-Red ranges and can serve as a powerful tool to deal with large volumes of high-resolution data used in future fire monitoring systems and as a cost-efficient resource in support of governments and fire service agencies that need timely, optimized firefighting plans. © 2021 by the authors.

Recently, supervised DL models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely studied for landslide detection. Even though these models provide robust performance and reliable results, they depend highly on a large labeled dataset for their training step. As an alternative, in this paper, we developed an unsupervised learning model by employing a convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) to deal with the problem of limited labeled data for training. The CAE was used to learn and extract the abstract and high-level features without using training data. To assess the performance of the proposed approach, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and a digital elevation model (DEM) to map landslides in three different case studies in India, China, and Taiwan. Using minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation, we reduced the multispectral dimension to three features containing more than 80% of scene information. Next, these features were stacked with slope data and NDVI as inputs to the CAE model. The Huber reconstruction loss was used to evaluate the inputs. We achieved reconstruction losses ranging from 0.10 to 0.147 for the MNF features, slope, and NDVI stack for all three study areas. The mini-batch K-means clustering method was used to cluster the features into two to five classes. To evaluate the impact of deep features on landslide detection, we first clustered a stack of MNF features, slope, and NDVI, then the same ones plus with the deep features. For all cases, clustering based on deep features provided the highest precision, recall, F1-score, and mean intersection over the union in landslide detection. © 2021 by the authors.

The study approach uses spatiotemporal multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and from 2021 and investigates the potential of remote sensing-based vegetation and water indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Aquatic Vegetation Index (NDAVI), Green Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)) for detecting duckweeds’ infestation and its severity. The NDAVI was identified as the vegetation index (VI) that better depicted the presence of duckweeds in the surface of the water course; however, results obtained for the other VIs are also encouraging, with NDVI showing a response that is very similar to NDAVI. Results are promising regarding the ability of remote sensing products to provide insight into the behavior of Lemna minor and to identify problematic sections along small watercourses. © 2022 by the authors.","Leiria [Portugal]; Lis River; Portugal; River pollution; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Vegetation mapping; Aquatic weeds; Environmental Monitoring; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite sensor; Multispectral-based index; Open watercourse; Remote-sensing; Satellite sensors; Vegetation index; aquatic environment; biomonitoring; environmental monitoring; macrophyte; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral analysis; weed; Remote sensing","aquatic weeds; environmental monitoring; multispectral satellite sensors; multispectral-based indices; open watercourses; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136998697"

We focus on the problem of cloud masking, using several preexisting datasets, and a new, freely available dataset for Sentinel-2. Our model is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the satellites on which it was trained (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) and is able to extrapolate to sensors that it has not seen during training, such as Landsat 7, PerúSat-1, and Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Model performance is shown to improve when multiple satellites are used in training, approaching, or surpassing the performance of specialized, single-sensor models. This work is motivated by the fact that the remote sensing community has access to data taken with a huge variety of sensors. This has inevitably led to labeling efforts being undertaken separately for different sensors, which limits the performance of deep learning models, given their need for huge training sets to perform optimally. Sensor independence can enable deep learning models to utilize multiple datasets for training simultaneously, boosting performance, and making them much more widely applicable. This may lead to deep learning approaches being used more frequently for onboard applications and in ground segment data processing, which generally requires models to be ready at launch or soon afterward.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Data handling; Deep learning; Distributed computer systems; Interoperability; Network architecture; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Cloud masking; Cloud-computing; Deep learning; Earth observations; Learning models; Multi-spectral; Performance; Remote-sensing; Sensor independence; artificial neural network; data set; numerical model; Sentinel; Satellites","Cloud masking; deep learning; Earth observation; interoperability; multispectral; sensor independence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120077101"

Space factors such as elevation, temperature, and spatial locations are usually used as input variables for a model to estimate the SSC. However, whether temporal patterns of salt-affected soils (identified as temporal spectral patterns) can indicate the SSC level and be applied as a covariate in a model to estimate the SSC remains unclear. Hence, temporal changes in soil spectral patterns need to be characterized and explored as to their use as an input variable to improve SSC estimates. In this study, a total of 54 field samples and a time-series of Sentinel-2 multispectral images taken at monthly intervals (from October 2017 to April 2018) were collected in the Yinbei area of western China. Then, two-date satellite images were used to quantify significant spectral changes over time using spectral change vector analysis, and four two-date-based index methods were used to characterize soil spectral changes. Lastly, the optimal two-date-based spectral indices and multispectral bands were used as input variables to build the estimation models using a random forest algorithm. Results showed that the two-date-based spectral index could be applied as an input variable to improve the accuracy of SSC estimation at a regional scale. Temporal changes in salt-induced spectral patterns can be indicated by the band difference in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 900 nm. Three two-date-based indices designated as D28a (i.e., the band difference between band 2 from an image acquired in April 2018 and band 8a from an image acquired in December 2017), D22, and D28 were the optimal parameters for characterizing salt-induced spectral changes, which were dominated by the total brightness, chloride, and sulfate accumulation of the soils. The model did not yield satisfactory estimation results (RPD = 1.49) when multispectral bands were used as the input variables. Multispectral bands coupled with two two-date-based indices (D22 and D28a) used as the input variables produced the best estimation result (R2 = 0.92, RPD = 3.27). Incorporating multispectral bands and two-date-based indices into the random forest model provides a remotely-sensed strategy that effectively supports the monitoring of soil salt content. © 2021 by the authors.

An effective way to assess the resulting impacts on biodiversity lies in vegetation mapping. Species classification achieved through supervised machine learning algorithms at the pixel level has shown promising results using hyperspectral images and multispectral, multitemporal images. This study aims to determine whether airborne hyperspectral images with a high spatial resolution or phenological information obtained by spaceborne multispectral time series (Sentinel-2) are suitable to discriminate species and assess biodiversity in a complex impacted context. The industrial heritage of the study site has indeed induced high spatial heterogeneity in terms of stressors and species over a reduced scale. First, vegetation indices, derivative spectra, continuum removed spectra, and components provided by three feature extraction techniques, namely, Principal Component Analysis, Minimal Noise Fraction, and Independent Component Analysis, were calculated from reflectance spectra. These features were then analyzed through Sequential Floating Feature Selection. Supervised classification was finally performed using various machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Regularized Logistic Regression) considering a probability-based rejection approach. Biodiversity metrics were derived from resulted maps and analyzed considering the impacts. Average Overall Accuracy (AOA) reached up to 94% using the hyperspectral image and Regularized Logistic Regression algorithm, whereas the time series of multispectral images never exceeded 72% AOA. From all tested spectral transformations, only vegetation indices applied to the time series of multispectral images increased the performance. The results obtained with the hyperspectral image degraded to the specifications of Sentinel-2 emphasize the importance of fine spatial and spectral resolutions to achieve accurate mapping in this complex context. While no significant difference was found between impacted and reference sites through biodiversity metrics, vegetation mapping highlighted some differences in species distribution. © 2022 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Decision trees; Feature Selection; Independent component analysis; Learning algorithms; Photomapping; Population distribution; Principal component analysis; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Anthropogenic activity; HyperSpectral; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Multi-spectral; Multispectral time series; Sentinel-2; Species distributions; Times series; Vegetation mapping; Classification (of information)","anthropogenic activities; biodiversity; classification; hyperspectral; machine learning; multispectral time series; Sentinel-2; vegetation mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137101740"

In addition, a reliable CA-MA prediction map designated that there would be recognizable upbeat progressive increases in barren (+4.8%) and abandoned (+5%) lands, particularly the emergence of vegetation vulnerability in the region.

In these plots, canopies do not fully cover the soil and the planting frames are incompatible with the Resolution of Sentinel 2. The present work proposes a procedure for the fusion of images with different temporal and spatial resolutions and with different degrees of spectral quality. It uses images from the Sentinel 2 mission (low resolution, high spectral quality, high temporal resolution), orthophotos (high resolution, low temporal resolution) and images obtained with drones (very high spatial resolution, low temporal resolution). The procedure is applied to generate time series of synthetic RGI images (red, green, infrared) with the same high resolution of orthophotos and drone images, in which gray levels are reassigned from the combination of their own RGI bands and the values of the B3, B4 and B8 bands of Sentinel 2. Two practical examples of application are also described. The first shows the NDVI images that can be generated after the process of merging two RGI Sentinel 2 images obtained on two specific dates. It is observed how, after the merging, different NDVI values can be assigned to the soil and vegetation, which allows them to be distinguished (contrary to the original Sentinel 2 images). The second example shows how graphs can be generated to describe the evolution throughout the vegetative cycle of the estimated values of three spectral indices (NDVI, GNDVI, GCI) on a point in the image corresponding to soil and on another assigned to vegetation. The robustness of the proposed algorithm has been validated by using image similarity metrics. © 2022 by the author.","Agriculture; Algorithms; Crops, Agricultural; Soil; Drones; Forestry; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Merging; Orchards; Soils; Vegetation; Google earth engine; Google earths; Image similarity; Images processing; Multi-spectral analysis; Orthophotos; Sentinel 2; Spectral indices; Spectral quality; Temporal resolution; agriculture; algorithm; crop; procedures; soil; Image fusion","drone; google earth engine; image processing; image similarity; multispectral analysis; orthophoto; Sentinel 2; spectral indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137564088"

The observational data of oceanic whitecap coverage are generally in situ photographs or videos. The use of spaceborne optical sensors to capture oceanic whitecaps could provide more spatial distribution and dynamic marine environment information. In this study, more than 100 Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images and corresponding synchronous buoy wind speed data were collected to investigate oceanic whitecaps. A curvature image processing method was employed to successfully identify oceanic whitecaps in MSI images and the whitecap coverage was estimated based on the whitecap recognition results. We established a power-law model of MSI-estimated whitecap coverage (W) and whitecap number density with buoy-measured wind speed at a height of 10 m above the sea surface (U10). In addition, the differences between the MSI-derived model and in situ measurement-derived models which are mainly caused by the scale effect of optical remote sensing, are discussed. The whitecap-wind model demonstrates that MSI images can improve the quantification of sea surface wind speed with high spatial resolution. MSI images were used to estimate regional high-spatial resolution (4 km) wind speeds, and the merged results (0.25°) were verified with the hourly wind products of the fifth generation European ECMWF (Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). Moreover, the influence of sunglint on whitecap recognition and whitecap coverage was also analyzed. The reflectance of whitecap-affected pixels in MSI images increased obviously with wind speed compared with background seawater in weak sunglint reflection area. These results indicated that the parameters of oceanic whitecaps derived from high-spatial resolution optical images can be used to estimate wind speed and provide a new approach for monitoring marine dynamic environments in the future. © 2022.

When applied to small water bodies, misjudging often occurs. The multi-spectral remote sensing data of the Sentinel 2 satellite has a spatial resolution of 10, 20, and 60 meters; a dual-star time resolution of 5 days; and a high temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, this paper uses the sentinel-2 green light band (560 nm), red-edge band (705 nm), near-infrared band (842 nm, 865 nm), and short wave-infrared band (2190 nm) for remote sensing reflectance. A new water index algorithm (red edge-based water index, RWI for short) is proposed for the extraction of fine water. The normalized remote sensing reflectance of vegetation, shadow, building, mixed pixel, bare soil, and water body is compared and analyzed. The mechanism explains why RWI has a better effect of extracting fine water bodies compared with other water body indexes.To quantitatively evaluate the advantages of the RWI water body extraction algorithm proposed in this paper, this paper compares several current water body extraction algorithms, including the improved normalized difference water index MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index), multi-band water body index MBWI (multi-band water index), and AWEI (automatic water extraction index). The water body extraction results obtained by several algorithms and the area statistics of the artificial water interpretation of the water body results are calculated using the error formula to obtain RWI. The errors of MNDWI, MBWI, AWEIsh, and AWEInsh are 3.6%, 4.2%, 12.2%, 8.8%, and 19.8%, respectively. Results show that the RWI algorithm has the highest accuracy. At the same time, through analysis, the advantages and disadvantages of several water extraction results are quantitatively evaluated. From the results of image extraction, this paper proposes that the water boundary extraction method extracted by the RWI water body extraction algorithm is better, and it can eliminate mountains, building shadows, and clouds. The effect of shadows can eliminate the effects of mixed pixels.At the same time, this paper carried out multi-temporal water extraction in Xiong'an New District, Shendong Mining Area, and Yongcheng Mining Area. In the time range from January 2016 to December 2018, a total of 43 Sentinel-2 images without clouds were screened, and the small broken water bodies in the three areas of Xiong'an New District, Shendong Mining Area, and Yongcheng Mining Area were selected by the algorithm proposed in this paper. The distribution carried out multi-temporal analysis. Results from statistical area analysis indicate that Xiong'an New District has the largest water body area in spring, followed by summer and autumn. No significant change in water area was observed in the Shendong and Yongcheng mining areas.

Upstream of Imjin River, on the North Korean side, is the Hwanggang Dam, with a 350 million m3 of storage capacity, which is in operation for power generation and water supply. The sharing of the operation information of Hwanggang Dam has been limited due to political and military tension. South Korea has constructed the Gunnam Flood Control Reservoir downstream of the Imjin River to prevent potential flood damage due to the urgent and unilateral release from the Hwanggang Dam. However, it is difficult to manage the flood of the Imjin River basin under the situation of limited shared real-time information on the Hwanggang Dam operation. In this study, a hydrological analysis system was established to estimate the inflow and release of the Hwanggang Dam by building a lumped hydrological model and an Auto ROM (Reservoir Operation Method)-based reservoir operation algorithm. To estimate the inflow of the Gunnam Flood Control Reservoir, the water level of the Hwanggang Dam was calculated using the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images, and the hydrological analysis system was calibrated. The evaluation index of the water level of the ungauged Hwanggang Dam derived from January 2017 to August 2020 using the hydrological analysis system was shown to have a coefficient of determination of 0.76 and an RMSE of 3.97 m. In the case of the flood event in August 2020, the coefficient of determination of the flood inflow in the Gunnam Flood Control Zone was calculated to be 0.86. © 2022 by the authors.","Climate models; Dams; Flood control; Floods; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Spectroscopy; Water levels; Water supply; Analysis system; Coefficient of determination; Hydrological analysis; Hydrological models; Remote-sensing; Reservoir operation; South Korea; Transboundary rivers; Ungaged; Ungaged basins; Remote sensing","flood; hydrological model; remote sensing; reservoir operation; trans-boundary river; ungauged basin","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137074412"

While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-m resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables. © 2022 The Author(s)","Norway; Antennas; Biodiversity; Climate change; Decision making; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Forestry; Geometrical optics; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian; Bayesian deep learning; Biodiversity loss; Country-scale; Forest structure; Multi-spectral; Optical-; Regional levels; Sentinel; Structure variables; Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; calibration; climate change; error analysis; forest cover; machine learning; model validation; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Bayesian deep learning; Country-scale; Forest structure; Multispectral; SAR; Sentinel","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144062328"

Remote sensing imagery captured via satellites, drones, and aircraft has successfully influenced a wide range of fields such as monitoring vegetation health, tracking droughts, and weather forecasting, among others. Researchers studying the Earth's surface are often hindered while gathering reliable observations due to contaminated reflectance values that are sensitive to thin, thick, and cirrus clouds, as well as their shadows. In this study, we propose a deep learning network architecture, CloudNet, to alleviate cloud-occluded remote sensing imagery captured by Landsat-8 satellite for both visible and non-visible spectral bands. We propose a deep neural network model trained on a distributed storage cluster that leverages historical trends within Landsat-8 imagery while complementing this analysis with high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. Our empirical benchmarks profile the efficiency of the CloudNet model with a range of cloud-occluded pixels in the input image. We further compare our CloudNet's performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as SpAGAN and Resnet. We propose a novel method, dynamic hierarchical transfer learning, to reduce computational resource requirements while training the model to achieve the desired accuracy.

Furthermore, cloud covers limit the use of optical sensing, especially in subtropical climates where they are persis-tent. This research assessed the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data for mapping fruit trees and co-existing land-use types by using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers independently. These classifiers were also applied to fused data from the two sensors. Feature ranks were extracted using the RF mean decrease accuracy (MDA) and forward variable selection (FVS) to identify optimal spectral windows to classify fruit trees. Based on RF MDA and FVS, the SVM classifier resulted in relatively high classification accuracy with overall accuracy (OA) = 0.91.6% and kappa coefficient = 0.91% when applied to the fused satellite data. Application of SVM to S1, S2, S2 selected variables and S1S2 fusion independently produced OA = 27.64, Kappa coefficient = 0.13%; OA= 87%, Kappa coefficient = 86.89%; OA = 69.33, Kappa coefficient = 69. %; OA = 87.01%, Kappa coefficient = 87%, respectively. Results also indicated that the optimal spectral bands for fruit trees mapping are green (B3) and SWIR_2 (B10) for S2, whereas for S1, the vertical-horizontal (VH) polarization band. Including the textural metrics from the VV channel improved crop discrimination and co-existing land use cover types. The fusion approach proved robust and well suited for accurate smallholder fruit plantation mapping. © 2022 by the authors.

True color and multi-spectral images at 10 m resolution are used over 50 × 50 km2 domain centered on the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site over the Southern Great Plains to recognize green pixels and estimate the vegetation fraction. The GVF retrieved from several spectral bands is compared with Sentinel-2 true color images, Sentinel-3, MODIS vegetation products, and observations from the US DOE research aircraft on selected days from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign. Unlike MODIS or Sentinel-3, our approach to retrieve the GVF is independent of absolute reflectance or photosynthetic response. Spatial patterns in vegetation distribution are similar in all three satellite approaches, however MODIS underestimates the vegetation cover by about 10% compared to the Sentinel-2, -3 retrievals over the study domain. The largest contrast in MODIS and Sentinel-2, -3 is found when the GVF is less than 0.2 or greater than 0.9, likely as a result of different retrieval approaches and spectral bands used to estimate the vegetation products. The NDVI retrieved from MODIS is also underestimated compared to the aircraft observations suggesting that MODIS underestimates both NDVI and GVF. In the past, various satellite observations have been used to retrieve the vegetation fraction at medium (0.25–0.50 km) and coarser resolutions (15 km) but our approach is extended to a much higher (10 m) resolution. Our analysis from Sentinel-2 shows large spatial variability in GVF and a clear disparity with estimates from MODIS and Sentinel-3 satellites. The new approach to estimate GVF has the potential to increase spatial accuracy and precision of surface properties relevant for crop and forest management, surface and energy balance processes, and land surface parameterizations in atmospheric models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM); Green vegetation fraction; MODIS; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-3","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134182502"

Results show that all VIs are generally well correlated to ground LAI, among the 11 tested ones EVI, NDI45 and NBR shows best results for the three considered categories. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Infrared radiation; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Comparison of performance; Key variables; Leaf Area Index; Maize; Parametric method; Parametric regression; Performance indices; Sentinel-2 vegetation index; Vegetation index; Wheat; Vegetation","Maize; Parametric method; Sensitivity analysis; Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices; Wheat","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141736093"

Ocean color instruments with low spatial resolution have been used to monitor cyanobacterial bloom in large lakes; however, they cannot be applied to small water bodies well. Here, the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2A and-2B and the Operational Landsat Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 were employed to assemble the virtual constellation and to track spatial and seasonal variations in floating algae blooms from 2016 to 2020 in a small eutrophic plateau lake: Lake Xingyun in China. The floating algae index (FAI) was calculated using Rayleigh-corrected reflectance in the red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared bands. The MSI-derived FAI had a similar pattern to the OLI-derived FAI, with a mean absolute percentage error of 19.98% and unbiased percentage difference of 17.05%. Then, an FAI threshold, 0.0693, was determined using bimodal histograms of FAI images for floating algae extraction. The floating algae had a higher occurrence in the northern region than the southern region in this lake, whilst the occurrence of floating algae in summer and autumn was higher than that in spring and winter. Such a spatial and seasonal pattern was related to the variability in air temperature, wind speed and direction, and nutrients. The climatological annual mean occurrence of floating algae from 2016 to 2020 in Lake Xingyun exhibited a significant decrease, which was related to decreases in nutrients, resulting from efficient ecological restoration by the local government. This research highlighted the application of OLI-MSI virtual constellation on monitoring floating algae in a small lake, providing a practical and theoretical reference to monitor aquatic environments in small water bodies. © 2021 by the authors.

The classification is based on free high-resolution satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 collected in 2020, ancillary data derived from Sardinian Geoportal, Joint Research Centre (JRC) and OpenStreetMap. The LULC map production includes three steps: 1) pixel-based classification, realized with two different approaches, that use i) information derived from existing thematic maps eventually re-coded in case of incoherencies observed between datasets and/or satellite data products, and ii) spectral indices and parameter thresholds defined on the basis of multitemporal analysis; 2) segmentation of Sentinel-1 and 2 annual composites, and pre-labelling of segments with the pixel-based classified map, obtaining the preliminary map; 3) visual inspection procedure in order to confirm, or re-assign, classes to polygons. The accuracy of the preliminary map was tested in a sample area and on specific class of non-irrigated crops through ground truth data collected from a detailed photo-interpretation, estimating 97% of overall accuracy. The results show a great improvement from existing thematic maps in terms of detail, with the possibility of a yearly updating of the map via automatic processes. However, some limitations were found, due to the high fragmentation of Sardinian landscape and the high variety of crop types and agricultural practices, that could affect the efficiency of the classifier.  © Authors 2022","Classification (of information); Crops; Land use; Photointerpretation; Photomapping; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series analysis; Agricultural mapping; Land cover; Land cover maps; Land use/land cover; Multi-spectral analysis; Sardinia; Sentinel; Sentinel-1; Spectral indices; Thematic maps; Maps","agricultural mapping; Land cover; multispectral analysis; Sardinia; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131937114"

However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediterranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of environmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3% and 14.6% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2–82.7% overall accuracy.

Complications arise while incorporating multispectral datasets for regional-scale spatial assessment of soil macronutrients. Sporadically satellite image fusion techniques have been used for soil nutrient interpolation to circumvent the complications. The fusion of multispectral bands encompasses precise soil information that cannot be observed as accurate with single satellite dataset. In this study, fusion of near infrared regions of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel 2 has been observed for its contribution on soil macronutrient assessments. Area-to-point regression Kriging (ATPRK) approach is followed in fusing the two satellite imagery and in situ soil spectral have used for the validation of the resultant. Comparative statistical analysis on Landsat 8 OLI band 5 (wavelength: 845–885 nm), Sentine-2 band 8,8A (wavelength: 785–900 nm) datasets and fused satellite bands provides R2 values of 0.8209, 0.8436, and 0.8763 respectively.

Computations reveals the ranges of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that floats from 48 to 295 kg/ha, 5.0 to 37 kg/ha, and 32 to 455 kg/ha in the study area.

However, attempts to evaluate the performances of SDMs using S2 spectral bands and S2 Radiometric Indices (S2-RIs) and biophysical variables, in particular, were limited. Hence, this study aimed at evaluating the performance of six commonly used SDMs and one ensemble model for S2-based variables in modelling the current distribution of Prosopis juliflora in the lower Awash River basin, Ethiopia. Thirty-five variables were computed from Sentinel-2B level-2A, and out of the variables, twelve significant variables were selected using Variable Inflation Factor (VIF). A total of 680 presence and absence data were collected to train and validate variables using the tenfold bootstrap replication approach in the R software “sdm” package. The performance of the models was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, True Skill Statistics (TSS), kappa coefficient, area under the curve (AUC), and correlation. Results: Our findings demonstrated that except bioclim all machine learning and regression models provided successful prediction. Among the tested models, Random Forest (RF) performed better with 93% TSS and 99% AUC followed by Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), ensemble, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) in decreasing order. The relative influence of vegetation indices was the highest followed by soil indices, biophysical variables, and water indices in decreasing order. According to RF prediction, 16.14% (1553.5 km2) of the study area was invaded by the alien species. Conclusions: Our results highlighted that S2-RIs and biophysical variables combined with machine learning and regression models have a higher capacity to model invasive species distribution.

Although satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to monitor CyanoHABs, there are also some automatic extraction methods of CyanoHABs based on spectral indices (such as gradient mode, fixed threshold, and the Otsu method, etc.), the accuracy is generally not very high. This study developed a high-precision automatic extraction model for CyanoHABs using a deep learning (DL) network based on Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data of Chaohu Lake, China. First, we generated the CyanoHABs “ground truth” dataset based on visual interpretation. Thereafter, we trained the CyanoHABs extraction model based on a DL image segmentation network (U-Net) and extracted CyanoHABs. Then, we compared three previous automatic CyanoHABs extraction methods based on spectral index threshold segmentation and evaluated the accuracy of the results. Based on “ground truth”, at the pixel level, the F1 score and relative error (RE) of the DL model extraction results are 0.90 and 3%, respectively, which are better than that of the gradient mode (0.81,40%), the fixed threshold (0.81, 31%), and the Otsu method (0.53, 62%); at CyanoHABs area level, the R2 of the scatter fitting between DL model result and the “ground truth” is 0.99, which is also higher than the other three methods (0.90, 0.92, 0.84, respectively). Finally, we produced the annual CyanoHABs frequency map based on DL model results. The frequency map showed that the CyanoHABs on the northwest bank are significantly higher than in the center and east of Chaohu Lake, and the most serious CyanoHABs occurred in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, CyanoHAB extraction based on this model did not cause cloud misjudgment and exhibited good promotion ability in Taihu Lake, China. Hence, our findings indicate the high potential of the CyanoHABs extraction model based on DL in further high-precision and automatic extraction of CyanoHABs from large-scale water bodies. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep learning; Image segmentation; Lakes; Remote sensing; Automatic extraction; Chaohu lakes; Cyanobacterial blooms; Cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom; Deep learning; Extraction modeling; Harmful algal blooms; Learning models; Multi-spectral; Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument; Extraction","automatic extraction; Chaohu Lake; cyanobacterial blooms; CyanoHABs; deep learning; Sentinel-2 MSI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139935351"

Fusion methods based on spectral unmixing have led to state-of-the-art results with the advantage of obtaining pure spectral signatures and their proportion in the image of analysis as a result of the fusion process. However, pure spectral signatures observed in HS images are affected by variations in atmospheric, environmental and illumination conditions which are significant sources of errors in HS image analysis. Conventional unmixing-based fusion methods neglect the spectral variability of HS images introducing and propagating errors through the fusion process, affecting further inference tasks such as classification, target detection, and change detection. Therefore, this paper proposes HS-MS image fusion algorithm based on spectral unmixing accounting for spectral variability through an augmented linear mixing model (ALMM).

To bridge this gap, we build on a multidisciplinary collaboration ex-ploring the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and open access multispectral satellite imagery, for quantifying the archaeological evidence located within a prospective reservoir area before dam construction. Based on previous research by Marchetti (2020) claiming the necessity for ad hoc protocols to document and monitor the impact of dams on cultural heritage, we selected two complementary situations: the planned dam of Halabiyeh in Syria and the under construction Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. These case studies were analyzed with state-of-the-art methodologies to develop a feasible workflow that may contribute to fostering the use of satellite imagery in operational contexts such as those represented by these particular cases, and be replicated by archaeologists in other areas. The workflow is designed to be integrated to ground-truthing methodologies into two dedicated protocols named Pre-Construction Archaeological Risk Assessment (PCARA) and Pre-Flooding Rescue Archaeological Program (PFRAP) which could eventually become a standard procedure for rescue archaeology in dams areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Given the ever-increasing rate of population growth and the implications of multiplying global food production, the necessity for timely, accurate, and reliable agricultural data is of the utmost importance. When it comes to ensuring high accuracy in crop maps, spectral similarities between crops represent serious limiting factors. Crops that display similar spectral responses are notorious for being nearly impossible to discriminate using classical multi-spectral imagery analysis. Chief among these crops are soft wheat, durum wheat, oats, and barley. In this paper, we propose a unique multi-input deep learning approach for cereal crop mapping, called “CerealNet”. Two time-series used as input, from the Sentinel-2 bands and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), were fed into separate branches of the LSTM-Conv1D (Long Short-Term Memory Convolutional Neural Networks) model to extract the temporal and spectral features necessary for the pixel-based crop mapping. The approach was evaluated using ground-truth data collected in the Gharb region (northwest of Morocco). We noted a categorical accuracy and an F1-score of 95% and 94%, respectively, with minimal confusion between the four cereal classes. CerealNet proved insensitive to sample size, as the least-represented crop, oats, had the highest F1-score. This model was compared with several state-of-the-art crop mapping classifiers and was found to outperform them. The modularity of CerealNet could possibly allow for injecting additional data such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) bands, especially when optical imagery is not available. © 2022 by the authors.","","CerealNet; CNN; crop mapping; deep learning; LSTM; spectral similarity; time-series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144662479"

Population growth in the developing area, Makassar coastal zone, will contribute significantly to the land's waste. Consequently, floating plastic debris comes directly from the land's plastic leaks to rapidly increase marine plastic debris. Due to being a major environmental issue in the coastal zone and reducing options for removal are very limited, this study becomes to detect the potential marine plastic debris in Makassar by Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) using Kernel Normalization Vegetation Index (KNDVI) and Floating Debris Index (FDI) for satellite image processing. The plastic debris was corrected atmospheric effect by Sen2Cor and processed by Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The resolution of images was set to 10 x 10 meters. The target area was calculated as 173.47 Ha. The results show that KNDVI and FDI combined are a developed and powerful approach to detecting plastic debris. KNDVI has more representative indices (SE 0.38) than FDI indices (SE 0.47). Through the discriminant analysis were verified pixels of KNDVI (3506 pixels) and FDI indices (701 pixels).

Three distinct classifiers were designed to distinguish individual or compound wetland categories using random forest (RF) classification. They were determined, in part, to best use the available remotely sensed features in order to maximize that information and to maximize classification accuracy. The results from these classifiers were integrated according to Dempster–Shafer theory (D–S theory). The developed method was tested on data collected from a study area in Northern Alberta, Canada. The data utilized were Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (multi-spectral), Sentinel-1 (synthetic aperture radar—SAR), and digital elevation model (DEM). Classification of fen, bog, marsh, swamps, and upland resulted in an overall accuracy of 0.93 using the proposed methodology, an improvement of 5% when compared to a traditional classification method based on the aggregated features from these data sources. It was noted that, with the traditional method, some pixels were misclassified with a high level of confidence (>85%). Such misclassification was significantly reduced (by ~10%) by the proposed method. Results also showed that some features important in separating compound wetland classes were not considered important using the traditional method based on the RF feature selection mechanism. When used in the proposed method, these features increased the classification accuracy, which demonstrated that the proposed method provided an effective means to fully employ available data to improve wetland classification. © 2022 by the authors.","Canada; Information Storage and Retrieval; Radar; Wetlands; Classification (of information); Data fusion; Decision trees; Landsat; Random forests; Remote sensing; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification accuracy; Data fusion methods; Dempster-Shafer theory; Ensemble-classifier; Multi-Sources; Random forest classification; Random forests; Remotely sensed data; Study areas; Wetland classification; Canada; information retrieval; telecommunication; wetland; Wetlands","data fusion; Dempster–Shafer theory; ensemble classifier; multi-source; random forest; wetlands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142730746"

The use of spectral diversity metrics from different remote sensing platforms has emerged as a promising tool for such biodiversity assessments. Satellite remote sensing presents the next frontier for implementation of these methods to assess plant diversity with spatial and temporal continuity at truly regional or global scales. However, the question of what exactly is monitored by spectral diversity metrics from relatively coarse multi-spectral satellite observations has remained largely unanswered. In this research, we examined which components contribute to satellite remotely sensed spectral diversity. We assessed the relationships between spectral diversity and in-situ taxonomic and trait diversity, and evaluated the role of confounding factors, vegetation cover, and landscape morphology (slope and elevation), in shaping these relationships. Hereto, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ field trait and species count data collected in the Montesinho-Nogueira Natura 2000 site (Portugal) together with radiative transfer models to quantify the theoretical link between in-situ trait diversity and simulated spectral diversity. Through the use of linear mixed-effect models, our results highlight that variation in vegetation cover dominates the Sentinel-2's spectral diversity signal (contributing 53–84% of the R2marginal). The vegetation cover component encompasses spatial variability in canopy architecture traits as well as the fraction of bare soil and plant litter spectra. These elements together strongly impact the overall spectral diversity signal, as shown both in our radiative transfer simulations and empirical comparisons. Next to vegetation cover, we found that taxonomic diversity is a significant predictor and covariate of spectral diversity, while the role of leaf trait diversity appeared insignificant in our multispectral dataset. Variation in vegetation cover dominated the spectral diversity signal in our study while it is not necessarily correlated with plant diversity. We, therefore, recommend that future applications of multi-spectral diversity metrics consider the impact of vegetation cover, including soil variability and the role of morphological traits, in shaping leaf trait - canopy reflectance relationships to better understand the ambiguous performance of spectral diversity as a proxy of plant diversity. This will result in higher robustness, consistency, and scalability of spectral diversity metrics for predicting in-situ plant diversity across scales, sensors, and ecosystems in regional biodiversity assessments. © 2021","Portugal; Varanidae; Ecology; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Functional diversity; Leaf traits; Mediterranean; Portugal; PROSAIL; PROSPECT; Sentinel-2; Species richness; Spectral diversity; Vegetation cover; bare soil; canopy architecture; canopy reflectance; EOS; geomorphology; in situ measurement; landscape change; landscape ecology; morphology; remote sensing; soil-vegetation interaction; vegetation cover; Biodiversity","Biodiversity; Ecology; Functional diversity; Leaf traits; Mediterranean; Portugal; PROSAIL; PROSPECT; Sentinel-2; Species richness; Spectral diversity; Vegetation; Vegetation cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114407467"

The spectral variables, including the original bands of the three satellite images and a variety of spectral indices derived from the original bands, were employed. Then, a machine learning model (quantile regression forest) was used to determine the relationships between the spectral variables and the measured soil pH, and prediction models were established to estimate the soil pH and to characterize the spatial pattern of the soil pH. The results revealed that the soil pH prediction model based on the GF-2 image had a slightly higher prediction accuracy than the models constructed using the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images.

To optimize cross-platform synergies between field-deployable UAV and space-based satellite systems, an understanding of spectral characteristics and compatibility is required. Here, we present the assessment of spectral consistency, undertaking a pixel-to-pixel similarity assessment of co-registered reflectance maps using corresponding spectral bands from UAV and satellite multispectral imagery. A high-resolution centimeter-scale UAV-mounted MicaSense RedEdge-MX sensor is intercompared against variable-resolution multi-spectral sensors on-board PlanetScope, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 platforms. Sampling from within an urban environment that covers a range of both natural and man-made surfaces, we employ ground-based spectroradiometer data to evaluate pixel-level responses, using regression analysis and measurements of relative root mean square error (rRMSE) to assess for factors such as spatial and spectral misalignment. Using two radiometric correction approaches for the UAV data, we found that a vicarious radiometric correction was more accurate than a linear empirical line method, with the former improving rRMSE by between 1.6% and 20.11% when assessed against spectroradiometer measurements. Spectral band misalignment between the UAV and satellite sensors affected their spectral consistency, causing different reflectance values for the same object in the corresponding UAV and satellite bands, with the issue amplified over specific land-cover classes (e.g. grass in the red edge part of the spectrum). Using the standard deviation of a UAV-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a metric of spatial heterogeneity, larger differences between the UAV and satellite-based NDVI were observed for different ground features in response to both land-cover boundary and shadow effects. Interestingly, higher spatial heterogeneity did not necessarily lead to higher spectral inconsistencies. It was also determined that as spatial scale differences between the UAV and satellite platforms increased, the lower was the impact of geometric misregistration on their consistency. Indeed, the rRMSE between the reflectance values of the UAV-based spectral bands and the corresponding satellite imagery was smaller at lower resolution (e.g. Landsat 8) than higher resolution (e.g. PlanetScope). Overall, the study provides insight into the collective effect of spectral and spatial misalignments on the degree of spectral consistency that can be expected between UAV and satellite data, guiding robust radiometric intercalibration efforts and the potential for improved synergy and interoperability between UAV and satellite data. © 2022 The Author(s).

For this we use hyperspectral satellite images from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) and multispectral images from Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) in July 2020. The visual inspection of the available acquisitions differentiates between four aquatic types: lagoons; river and stream plumes mixing with marine waters; turbid and optically complex coastal waters; and optically clean waters away from the shore. For each of the four types we determine the characteristic averaged reflectance spectra from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 for the spectral range from 400 nm to 2500 nm. It is found that Sentinel-2 spectra are very similar for the 4 water types, in contrast to the PRISMA spectra which give substantial additional information. Further we analyse the gradual modification of the characteristic hyper- and multispectral spectra from the shoreline to the open sea (1/425 km distance) in 15 locations passing through areas of varying turbidity. We demonstrate that the intensity of surface reflectance from the hyperspectral instrument decreases gradually with distance from shoreline, clearly showing the transition zone between riverine and marine water. The multispectral reflectance spectra for the same study areas did not present such consistent behaviour. The presented results demonstrate the benefits of hyperspectral over multispectral images for turbid aquatic regions in the Black Sea coastal zone. They show that with little requirements regarding pre-processing and computational resources hyperspectral data can contribute greatly to classification of water types, in respect of their turbidity.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Reflection; Turbidity; Black sea; Coastal area; HyperSpectral; Marine waters; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Reflectance spectrum; Spectra's; Water types; Zone-based; Coastal zones","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131197700"

Indeed, fires and BAs can be detected using burn severity indices, which are usually obtained by simple band algebra operations. However, simple approaches can aid BA estimation only if typical error patterns are known and accounted for, especially when working at large (e.g., continental) scales. This article proposes an automatic BA detection system based on burn severity index thresholding, which integrates dedicated false and missed alarm mitigation strategies to improve the detection accuracy. The system is tested on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data over ten different locations in Europe and spanning year 2018. Three known burn severity indices plus a custom one defined to improve the performance in the considered study area are under study.

In order to make up for this deficiency and take advantage of the complementary for multi-source remote sensing data in forest canopy height mapping, a new method to estimate forest canopy height was proposed by synergizing the spaceborne LiDAR (ICESat-2) data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, multi-spectral images, and topographic data considering forest types. In this study, National Geographical Condition Monitoring (NGCM) data was used to extract the distributions of coniferous forest (CF), broadleaf forest (BF), and mixed forest (MF) in Hua’ nan forest area in Heilongjiang Province, China. Accordingly, the forest canopy height estimation models for whole forest (all forests together without distinguishing types, WF), CF, BF, and MF were established, respectively, by Radom Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT). The accuracy for established models and the forest canopy height obtained based on estimation models were validated consequently. The results showed that the forest canopy height estimation models considering forest types had better performance than the model grouping all types of forest together. Compared with GBDT, RF with optimal variables had better performance in forest canopy height estimation with Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values for CF, BF, and MF of 0.72, 0.59, 0.62, and 3.15, 3.37, 3.26 m, respectively. It has been validated that a synergy of ICESat-2 with other remote sensing data can make a crucial contribution to spatio-continuous forest canopy height mapping, especially for areas covered by different types of forest. © 2022 by the authors.

However, such images occupy a large space that poses problems of processing, storage, transmission, and management. Lossy compression is widely used to decrease the size of data. In lossy compression, one has to provide a reasonable trade-off between compression ratio (CR) and introduced losses or quality of compressed data. Quality can be characterized in various ways including traditional criteria as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or some others as well as criteria that describe efficiency of solving the final tasks of remote sensing as, e.g., probability of correct classification. In this paper, we concentrate on classification of three-channel images that can be either color images or three components of multi-or hyperspectral data acquired, e.g., by Sentinel-2 sensor. In lossy compression of color images, downscaling of color components is often applied to increase CR without essential loss of quality. The goal of this paper is to study the influence of such downscaling on classification accuracy for three-channel remote sensing data. The compression method based on atomic functions is considered since this method allows easy control of compressed image quality and its providing. The neural networks trained for distorted-free images are applied for image classification. Analysis is carried out for four images of different complexity. Based on it, practical recommendations are given. © 2022 IEEE.","Color; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Image classification; Image compression; Image quality; Quality control; Signal to noise ratio; Space optics; Color component; Colour image; Down-scaling; Lossy compressions; Multi-spectral; Noise; Probability of correct classifications; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Three channel; Remote sensing","lossy compression; multispectral; noise; probability of correct classification; remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140384855"

Here we use an ensemble of modelling and remote sensing techniques in a ‘top-down, bottom-up’ approach comprising instruments onboard orbital platforms and a ground-based lidar, to interrogate the particle loading to determine its composition and origins. Using a novel, miniature lidar system and back-trajectory modelling to link the measurements to sources, we show that the event comprised two distinct phases, the first dominated by Saharan dust (volume depolarisation ratio at 532 nm; δ = 0.15-0.25) and the second by an optically dense layer, starting at ∼0.7 km, comprising a mixture of Saharan dust and biomass burning particles (δ = 0.08-0.18) originating from intense wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula. CO levels in the weather system were measured as high as ∼273 ppbV and the aerosol index to be >5. Also, the Ophelia system was probed for the first time using multi-spectral imaging data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2.

Clouds and cloud shadows significantly decrease the usability of optical satellite data especially in agricultural applications; therefore, an accurate and reliable cloud mask is mandatory for effective Earth Observation (EO) optical data exploitation. During the last years, image segmentation techniques have developed rapidly with the exploitation of neural networks capabilities. In this perspective, the KappaMask processor using U-Net architecture was developed with the ability to generate a classification mask over northern latitudes into the following classes: clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent cloud (thin clouds), and cloud, invalid. For training, a Sentinel-2 dataset covering Northern European terrestrial area was labeled. KappaMask provides a 10 m classification mask for Sentinel-2 Level- 2A (L2A) and Level-1C (L1C) products. The total dice coefficient on the test dataset, which was not seen by the model at any stage, was 80% for KappaMask L2A and 76% for KappaMask L1C for 27 clear, cloud shadow, semi-transparent, cloud classes.

Hyperspectral narrowbands are more sensitive spectrally to changes in crop growth than multispectral broadbands but few studies quantified the gains in the former over the later. The PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) mission offers narrow (≤10 nm) band capability across the full optical range. The multispectral broadband Sentinel-2 mission carries four experimental red-edge and near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral narrow (≤20 nm) bands. We compared the performance of PRISMA and Sentinel-2 spectral bands at important phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) in estimating field-level biomass and yield for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We selected three data-driven methods: two-band vegetation indices (TBVIs), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The PRISMA and Sentinel-2 models on average explained approximately 20% more variability in biomass and yield with RF than TBVIs and PLSR. The mean RMSE of the PRISMA RF models was 0.42 and 0.17 kg m−2, which was lower than the Sentinel-2 RF models (0.48 and 0.18 kg m−2). Multidate image (seasonal) model performance was generally higher than single-date image model performance. PRISMA shortwave infrared narrowbands and Sentinel-2 red-edge and near infrared bands were among the top-performing spectral regions. The results highlight potential complementarity between the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 missions for predicting crop biomass and yield. The results also show the benefits, limitations, and pitfalls of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural monitoring, which is important for upcoming operational hyperspectral missions, such as ESA CHIME and NASA Surface Biology and Geology (formerly HysPIRI). © 2022 The Author(s)","Crops; Decision trees; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared devices; Least squares approximations; Machine learning; NASA; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Crop yield; Field level; HyperSpectral; Imaging spectroscopy; Multi-spectral; Narrow bands; Random forests; Red edge; Remote-sensing; Yield estimation; biomass; complementarity; crop yield; estimation method; field method; near infrared; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral analysis; Biomass","Agriculture; Hyperspectral; Imaging spectroscopy; Machine learning; Random forest; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126565637"

However, the use of these satellites requires a process called “atmospheric correction”. This process aims to remove the contribution of the atmosphere from the total top of atmosphere reflectance measured by the remote sensors. For the purpose of assessing this processing, seven atmospheric correction algorithms have been compared over two French coastal regions (English Channel and French Guiana): Image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), Atmospheric correction for OLI ‘lite’ (ACOLITE), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC), Sentinel 2 Correction (Sen2Cor), Polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (Polymer), the standard NASA atmospheric correction (NASA-AC) and the Ocean Color Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART). The satellite-estimated remote-sensing reflectances were spatially and temporally matched with in situ measurements collected by an ASD FieldSpec4 spectrophotometer. Results, based on 28 potential individual match-ups, showed that the best performance processor is OC-SMART with the highest values for the total score Stot (16.89) and for the coefficient of correlation R2 (ranging from 0.69 at 443 nm to 0.92 at 665 nm). iCOR and Sen2Cor show the less accurate performances with total score Stot values of 2.01 and 7.70, respectively. Since the size of the in situ observation platform can be significant compared to the pixel resolution of MSI onboard Sentinel-2, it can create bias in the pixel extraction process.

The AFAI algal index (Alternative Floating Algae Index) is often used with remote sensing data in order to estimate the Sargassum coverage, and more precisely the AFAI deviation, which consists of the difference between AFAI and AFAI of the Sargassum-free background. In this study, the AFAI deviation is computed using NASA’s 1 km Terra/MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ESA/Copernicus’s 20 m Sentinel-2/MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) for the same sites and at the same time. Both MODIS and MSI AFAI deviations are compared to confirm the relevance of AFAI deviation technique for two very different spatial resolutions. A high coefficient of determination was found, thus confirming a satisfactory downsampling from 20 m (MSI) to 1 km (MODIS). Then, AFAI deviations are used to estimate the fractional coverage of Sargassum (noted FC). A new linear relationship between the MODIS AFAI deviation and FC is established using the dense Sargassum aggregations observed by MSI data. The AFAI deviation is proportional to FC with a factor of proportionality close to 0.08. Finally, it is shown that the factor is dependent on the Sargassum spectral reflectance, submersion or physiological state. © 2021 by the authors.

However, most improve detection performance by improving large network structures, which require strong computer performance. In addition, the visible image is difficult to detect ships in the cloud, fog, sea clutter, night and other complex scenes. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight ship detection algorithm, which integrates the spectral information of Red, Green, Blue and NIR bands from coarse to fine. This paper uses the improved water detection algorithm to extract the ship candidate area from the existing methods that extract the water area by using the water detection algorithm according to the spectral characteristics. To obtain a more accurate candidate area, in this paper, the ships, the thick clouds, cloud, calm sea, five kinds of cluttered sea four bands of pixels in the scene have carried on the statistical analysis. Near-infrared is greater than the threshold as the auxiliary judgment, and in its center for candidate area the size of 32 X 32 slices, and to the maximum inhibition of slice, thus obtained the coarse detection results of the ship. Then constructs a lightweight LSGFNet network for fine identification of ship candidate regions. In the structural design of the network, the spectral features extracted by 1 X 1 convolution and the geometric features extracted by 3 X 3 are fused. In order to prevent the ""information not flowing"" during the fusion of spectral features and geometric features, the channel disruption mechanism in ShuffleNet is introduced in the LSGFNet network, and the model structure is reduced. Compared with the typical lightweight network, it has a better effect and a smaller model. Finally, 1 120 sets of data with 512X512 and 6014 sets of data with 32X32 were constructed for rough detection and fine network training using sentinel-2 multi-spectral 10-meter resolution data. Among them, the recall rate of rough extraction of candidate regions was 98.99%, and the fine identification network precision was 96.04%. The overall average precision is 92. 98%. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection efficiency in the complex background of suppressing clouds, sea clutter and other disturbances, the training time is short, and the computer performance demand is low. © 2022 Science Press.

However*the accuracy of crop identification by remote sensing is currently limited by many factors*such as the influence of other ground objects and the lack of time-series data. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes an algorithm named improved artificial immune network crop recognition algorithm based on dispersed vegetation index genetic chain (IaiNet). This algorithm can be combined with multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2 series satellites for crop identification. As a test case, we identified and evaluated 3 different crop recognition scenarios in Henan, China. The results show that IaiNet can accurately identify the spatial distribution of crop planting. In all identification results, the accuracy is higher than 90%, and the kappa coefficient is greater than 0.9. In addition, the crop recognition results of IaiNet are significantly better than the random forest algorithm and support vector machine algorithm.  © Authors 2022.","Crops; Decision trees; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Artificial immune networks; Artificial immunity; Artificial immunity network; Crop identification; Crop recognition; Plantings; Recognition algorithm; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Remote sensing","Artificial Immunity Network; Crop Identification; Genetics; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132045072"

Moreover, for city or urban planning, it can be used for determining the proper location for seaport or tourist destination areas such as diving spots, coral reef monitoring, etc. However, the acquisition of shallow depth water data in a large area is somehow costly. In this paper, we represent an approach of mapping the high accuracy bathymetry with input from open satellite access data and some point measurement of bathymetry in the field (can be from LiDAR, Fathometer, Single Beam, or Multi-Beam). The study area is located in the Florida coastline, the USA that has satellite data from Sentinel-2 while the bathymetry is from a single beam survey. The method is combining satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) with the regression kriging analysis, which shows a better depth water prediction compared to the SDB alone or the ordinary kriging method. The statistical result of the bathymetry shows the regression kriging has a better mean value, standard deviation and coefficient correlation compared to the true bathymetry value.

Therefore, accurate and stable atmospheric correction is particularly important, which is the premise and basis of the quantitative application of remote sensing. It can also be used to directly compare different images and sensors. The Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) surface reflectance products are publicly available and demonstrate high accuracy. However, there is not enough validation using synchronous spectral measurements over China’s land surface. In this study, we utilized Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric products reconstructed by Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) and 30 m ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) data to adjust the relevant parameters to optimize the Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) model. The accuracy of surface reflectance products obtained from the optimized 6S model was compared with that of the original 6S model and the most commonly used Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model. Surface reflectance products were validated and evaluated with synchronous in situ measurements from 16 sites located in five provinces of China: Fujian, Gansu, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. Through the indirect and direct validation across two sensors and three methods, it provides evidence that the synchronous measurements have the higher and more reliable validation accuracy. The results of the validation indicated that, for Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI SR products, the overall root mean square error (RMSE) calculated results of optimized 6S, original 6S and FLAASH across all spectral bands were 0.0295, 0.0378, 0.0345, and 0.0313, 0.0450, 0.0380, respectively. R2 values reached 0.9513, 0.9254, 0.9316 and 0.9377, 0.8822, 0.9122 respectively. Compared with the original 6S model and FLAASH model, the mean percent absolute error (MPAE) of the optimized 6S model was reduced by 32.20% and 15.86% for Landsat-8 OLI, respectively. On the other, for the Sentinel-2 MSI SR product, the MPAE value was reduced by 33.56% and 33.32%. For the two kinds of data, the accuracy of each band was improved to varying extents by the optimized 6S model with the auxiliary data. These findings support the hypothesis that reliable auxiliary data are helpful in reducing the influence of the atmosphere on images and restoring reality as much as is feasible. © 2021 by the authors.

Machine learning (ML) methods offer promising ways of generating spatially explicit LAI data covering large regions based on optical images. However, there have been few efforts to analyze the LAI in heterogeneous subtropical forests with complex terrain by fusing high-resolution multi-sensor data from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 digital elevation model (DEM). Here, forest LAI mapping was performed by integrating the MSI, SAR, and DEM data using a stacking learning (SL) approach that incorporates distinct predictions from a set of optimized individual ML algorithms. The method’s performance was evaluated by comparison to field forest LAI measurements acquired in Xingguo and Gandong of subtropical China. The results showed that the addition of the SAR and DEM images using the SL model compared to the inputs of only optical images reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 26% and 18%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 12% and 8%, respectively, in Gandong. Furthermore, the combination of all images had the best prediction performance. SL was found to be more robust and accurate than conventional individual ML models, while the MAE and RMSE were decreased by 71% and 64%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 68% and 59%, respectively, in Gandong. Therefore, the SL model using the three-source data combination produced satisfied prediction accuracy with the coefficients of determination (R2 ), MAE, and RMSE of 0.96, 0.17, and 0.28, respectively, in Xingguo and 0.94, 0.30, and 0.47, respectively, in Gandong.

With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building reflectance composites using time series of images. Although composite imagery has demonstrated its potential in SOC prediction, it is still not well established if the resulting composite spectra mirror the reflectance fingerprint of the optimal conditions to predict topsoil properties (i.e. a smooth, dry and bare soil). We have collected 303 photos of soil surfaces in the Belgian loam belt where five main classes of surface conditions were distinguished: smooth seeded soils, soil crusts, partial cover by a growing crop, moist soils and crop residue cover. Reflectance spectra were then extracted from the Sentinel–2 images coinciding with the date of the photos. After the growing crop was removed by an NDVI < 0.25, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2) was calculated to characterize the soil surface, and a threshold of NBR2 < 0.05 was found to be able to separate dry bare soils from soils in unfavorable conditions i.e. wet soils and soils covered by crop residues. Additionally, we found that normalizing the spectra (i.e. dividing the reflectance of each band by the mean reflectance of all spectral bands) allows for cancelling the albedo shift between soil crusts and smooth soils in seed–bed conditions. We then built the exposed soil composite from Sentinel–2 imagery for southern Belgium and part of Noord-Holland and Flevoland in the Netherlands (covering the spring periods of 2016–2021). We used the mean spectra per pixel to predict SOC content by means of a Partial Least Squares Regression Model (PLSR) with 10–fold cross–validation. The uncertainty of the models was assessed via the prediction interval ratio (PIR). The cross validation of the model gave satisfactory results (mean of 100 bootstraps: model efficiency coefficient (MEC) = 0.48 ± 0.07, RMSE = 3.5 ± 0.3 g C kg–1, RPD = 1.4 ± 0.1 and RPIQ = 1.9 ± 0.3). The resulting SOC prediction maps show that the uncertainty of prediction decreases when the number of scenes per pixel increases, and reaches a minimum when at least six scenes per pixel are used (mean PIR of all pixels is 12.4 g C kg–1, while mean SOC predicted is 14.1 g C kg–1). The results of a validation against an independent data set showed a median difference of 0.5 g C kg–1 ± 2.8 g C kg–1 SOC between the measured (average SOC content 13.5 g C kg–1) and predicted SOC contents at field scale. Overall, this compositing method shows both realistic within field and regional SOC patterns. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Belgium; Flevoland; Netherlands; North Holland; Agricultural wastes; Crops; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Organic carbon; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Surface roughness; Uncertainty analysis; Multi-spectral data; NBR2; Sentinel–2; Soil organic carbon; Soil reflectance; Soil reflectance composite; Soil surface condition; Soil surfaces; Surface conditions; Uncertainty; crop residue; organic carbon; Sentinel; soil surface; Reflection","multispectral data; NBR2; Sentinel–2; soil organic carbon; Soil reflectance composite; soil surface conditions","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138727502"

However, the large majority of remote sensing-based degradation assessments are trend-based, implying that they can only detect degradation that occurred after medium or high-resolution satellite imagery became available. This makes them less suitable to map long-term degradation in ecosystems that have been under high human pressure since before. The main goal of this study was to develop a robust operational approach to map forest degradation status in heterogeneous landscapes with a long-standing degradation history to inform the planning of restoration interventions. We hereby use the tropical dry forests of Lambayeque, Peru, as a case study. Instead of using a trend-based assessment, we evaluated forest degradation status by comparing current woody cover (WC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates obtained from remote sensing imagery with benchmark values consisting of the 95th percentile WC and AGB values inside environmentally homogenous land capability classes. Using boosted regression tree models and a combination of optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data of different seasons, we mapped WC and AGB, using training data obtained through very high-resolution imagery and field measurements. Further, we aimed at assessing (i) whether the inclusion of Sentinel-1 data improves mapping accuracy in comparison to using only Sentinel-2 data, and (ii) whether the use of multi-seasonal data improves accuracy in comparison to single-season data. Models combining multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data resulted in the most accurate WC predictions (mean absolute error (MAE): 16%; MAE normalized by dividing by the inter-quartile range of training data: 26%) and AGB predictions (MAE: 28.6 t/ha; normalized MAE: 65%), but differences in predictive accuracy with single season models or models using only Sentinel-2 data were small. The most accurate models estimated an average WC of 41% and an average AGB of 23.4 t/ha. Average WC and AGB reduction due to degradation was 35% and 36%, respectively, indicating that these forests are highly degraded. The site-specific scaling of WC and AGB allows to efficiently estimate forest degradation status irrespective of the time when this degradation occurred, and to express degradation status against site-specific benchmarks. On the condition that there are still some areas that are sufficiently undegraded to be used as a benchmark, the approach can be used to prioritize forest restoration actions and inform targets for restoration in heterogeneous landscapes suffering the impacts of undocumented long-term degradation. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Lambayeque; Peru; Biomass; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Mapping; Radar imaging; Restoration; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Aboveground biomass; Canopy cover; Forest degradation; Land capability; Land capability class; Long-term forest degradation; Multi-spectral; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Woody cover; aboveground biomass; dry forest; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation cover; woody plant; Remote sensing","Aboveground biomass; Canopy cover; Land capability classes; Long-term forest degradation; Multispectral; Radar; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Woody cover","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129120089"

This study aims to map the land area affected by the flood by using multispectral satellite images. To pursue this aim, Level-2A multispectral images from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 sensor were acquired before and after the tailing dam collapse in the period 2019–2021. The pre-and post-failure event analysis allowed us to evidence drastic changes in the vegetation rate, as well as in the nature of soils and surficial waters. The spectral signatures of the minerals composing the mining products allowed us to highlight the effective area covered by the flood and to investigate the evolution of land properties after the disaster. This technique opens the possibility for quickly classifying areas involved in floods, as well as obtaining significant information potentially useful for monitoring and planning the reclamation and restoration activities in similar cases worldwide, representing an additional tool for evaluating the environmental issues related to mining operations in large areas at high temporal resolution. © 2022 by the authors.

However, robust retrieval algorithms still havel to be developed based on a full understanding of light interaction with plastic litter and the other optically active constituents of the atmosphere-water system. To this end, we performed laboratory-based hyperspectral reflectance measurements of submerged macroplastics under varying water clarity conditions (clear - 0 mg/L, moderate - 75 mg/L, very turbid - 321.3 mg/L) and submersion depths. This comprehensive optical dataset was used (i) to relate the plastic-related signal to submersion depth and turbidity parameters, and (ii) to investigate the top-of-atmosphere signal through full radiative transfer calculations. Simulated TOA radiation was used to explore the nominal pixel and spectral requirements based on WorldView-3, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions with very high to moderate geo-spatial resolutions. Results showed that plastics remained detectable when submerged in the top ∼1 m of the water column regardless of water clarity conditions. At TOA, uncertainties attached to atmospheric correction were shown to be reasonable and acceptable for plastic detection purposes in the infrared part of the spectrum (> 700 nm). The impact of aerosols on the TOA signal was found to be complex as (i) over large plastic patches. The aerosols produced little impact on satellite observations mostly due to adjacency effects and (ii) optical signature from isolated/small extent plastic patches was critically altered suggesting the atmospheric transmittance should be accurately corrected for in plastic detection algorithms. The sensitivity analyses also revealed that the narrow band widths of Sentinel-3 did not improve detection performance compared to the WorldView-3 coarser band widths. It is proposed that high spatial resolution wavebands such as the pan-chromatic could be advantageously explored for submerged plastic monitoring applications. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement","Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Aquatic environments; Band width; Condition; Critical asset; Multi-spectral; Retrieval algorithms; Satellite remote sensing; Top of atmospheres; Water clarity; Water depth; Aerosols","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129415348"

However, the water reticulation role by wetlands and crop production can negatively impact wetland plants. Knowledge on the foliar biochemical elements of wetland plants enhances understanding of the impacts of agricultural practices in wet-lands. This study thus used Sentinel-2 multispectral data to predict seasonal variations in the concentrations of nine foliar biochemical elements in plant leaves of key floodplain wetland vegetation types and crops in the uMfolozi floodplain system (UFS). Nutrient concentrations in different flood-plain plant species were estimated using Sentinel-2 multispectral data derived vegetation indices in concert with the random forest regression. The results showed a mean R2 of 0.87 and 0.86 for the dry winter and wet summer seasons, respectively. However, copper, sulphur, and magnesium were poorly correlated (R2 ≤ 0.5) with vegetation indices during the summer season. The average % relative root mean square errors (RMSE’s) for seasonal nutrient estimation accuracies for crops and wetland vegetation were 15.2 % and 26.8%, respectively. There was a significant difference in nutrient concentrations between the two plant types, (R2 = 0.94 (crops), R2 = 0.84 (vegetation). The red-edge position 1 (REP1) and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were the best nutrient predictors. These results demonstrate the usefulness of Sentinel-2 imagery and random forests regression in predicting seasonal, nutrient concentrations as well as the accumulation of chemicals in wetland vegetation and crops. © 2021 by the authors.

Slum mapping is one of the key problems concerning slums. Policymakers need to delineate slum settlements to make informed decisions about infrastructure development and allocation of aid. A wide variety of machine learning and deep learning methods have been applied to multispectral satellite images to map slums with outstanding performance. Since the physical and visual manifestation of slums significantly varies with geographical region and comprehensive slum maps are rare, it is important to quantify the uncertainty of predictions for reliable and confident application of models to downstream tasks. In this study, we train a U-Net model with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) on 13-band Sentinel-2 images, allowing us to calculate pixelwise uncertainty in the predictions. The obtained outcomes show that the proposed model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model, having both higher AUPRC and lower uncertainty when tested on unseen geographical regions of Mumbai using the regional testing framework introduced in this study. We also use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to investigate how the different features contribute to our model’s predictions which indicate a certain shortwave infrared image band is a powerful feature for determining the locations of slums within images. With our results, we demonstrate the usefulness of including an uncertainty quantification approach in detecting slum area changes over time. © 2022 by the authors.

Three main scenarios were considered when input features were used in the SVR model. In scenario 1, the SVR was fed by all the features generated from Sentinel-2 data, and in the other two scenarios, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Sequential Feature Selection (SFS) were applied to select the optimum input features to be used in the SVR model. The results showed that the salinity of Lake Urmia was estimated with a relatively reliable accuracy using GA along with the SVR model, where the R2 of 65.7% and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.5 PSU were obtained when the results were compared with in-situ data.

DEM data at high spatial resolution and high accuracy of elevation data are not only costly and time-consuming to acquire but also often confidential. In this paper, we explore a cost-effective approach to derive good quality DEM data by applying a multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance free resources of available DEM data. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, multi-spectral imaging Sentinel-2, as well as Google satellite imagery were used as inputs to the CNN model. The CNN model was first trained using high-quality reference DEM data in a dense urban city—Nice, France—then validated on another site in Nice and finally tested in the Orchard Road area (Singapore), which is also an equally dense urban area in Singapore. The CNN model not only shows an impressive reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) of 50% at validation site in Nice and 30% at the test site in Singapore, but also results in much clearer profiles of the land surface than input SRTM data. A comparison between CNN performance and that of an earlier conducted study using artificial neural networks (ANN) was conducted as well. The comparison within this limited study shows that CNN yields a more accurate DEM. © 2022 by the authors.","","convolutional neural networks; deep machine learning; DEM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147753852"

A two-stage CGAN approach, including representation and generation stages, is presented to generate virtual Sentinel-2 spectral bands using all available information from Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images. The dual-polarization-based radar vegetation index and all available multi-spectral bands of Sentinel-2 imagery are particularly considered for feature extraction in the representation stage. A crop classification experiment using Sentinel-1 and -2 images in Illinois, USA, demonstrated that the use of all available scattering and spectral features achieved the best prediction performance for all spectral bands, including visible, near-infrared, red-edge, and shortwave infrared bands, compared with the cases that only used dual-polarization backscattering coefficients and partial input spectral bands. Early crop mapping with an image time series, including the virtual Sentinel-2 image, yielded satisfactory classification accuracy comparable to the case of using an actual time-series image set, regardless of the different combinations of spectral bands. Therefore, the generation of virtual optical images using the proposed model can be effectively applied to early crop mapping when the availability of cloud-free optical images is limited. © 2023 by the authors.","","crop classification; deep learning; generative adversarial networks; virtual image","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147917899"

The near real-time (NRT) change detection of forest cover loss enables forest landowners, government agencies and local communities to monitor natural and anthropogenic disturbances in a much timelier fashion than the thematic maps that are released every year. NRT deforestation alerts enable the establishment of more up-to-date forest inventories and rapid responses to unlicensed logging. The Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellites provide operational Earth observation (EO) data from multi-spectral optical/near-infrared wavelengths every five days at a global scale and at 10 m resolution. The amount of acquired data requires cloud computing or high-performance computing for ongoing monitoring systems and an automated system for processing, analyzing and delivering the information promptly. Here, we present a Sentinel-2-based NRT change detection system, assess its performance over two study sites, Manantlán in Mexico and Cartagena del Chairá in Colombia, and evaluate the forest changes that occurred in 2018. An independent validation with very high-reso-lution PlanetScope (~3 m) and RapidEye (~5 m) data suggests that the proposed NRT change detection system can accurately detect forest cover loss (> 87%), other vegetation loss (> 76%) and other vegetation gain (> 71%). Furthermore, the proposed NRT change detection system is designed to be attuned using in situ data. Therefore, it is scalable to larger regions, entire countries and even con-tinents. © 2022 by the authors.

In the last decade, the amount of available data dramatically increased, whether it can come from Remote Sensing (using Copernicus Sentinel-2 data) or directly from the farmers (providing in-situ crop information throughout the years and information on crop rotation). Nevertheless, the majority of the studies are restricted to the use of one modality (Remote Sensing data or crop rotation) and never fuse the Earth Observation data with domain knowledge like crop rotations. Moreover, when they use Earth Observation data they are mainly restrained to one year of data, not taking into account the past years. In this context, we propose to tackle a land use and crop type classification task using three data types, by using a Hierarchical Deep Learning algorithm modeling the crop rotations like a language model, the satellite signals like a speech signal and using the crop distribution as additional context vector. We obtained very promising results compared to classical approaches with significant performances, increasing the Accuracy by 5.1 points in a 28-class setting (.948), and the micro-F1 by 9.6 points in a 10-class setting (.887) using only a set of crop of interests selected by an expert.

Analysis and prediction of micronutrient of the soil chemical parameters are highly insisted upon by farmers and agriculture researchers. The soil nutrients parameters can be analyzed from multispectral data through ISO cluster unsupervised classification. Understanding the nutrient level of soil is highly recommended for farming; early understanding may help to improve soil fertility and fully meet productivity requirements. This paper addresses the soil nutrients analysis by the regression method and its spectral indexed based on the prediction model by Iterative Self-Organizing (ISO) cluster unsupervised classification algorithm. Therefore, for this study, the Baggi, Ibrahimpur, Wai, Mogra, and Bori (for validation) villages were selected. These villages are located in the Amravati district and fall under Maharashtra provenance of India. From the study area, three soil nutrients parameters such as P, Fe, pH indices-based data were acquired from the spectral calculation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bands. The P, Fe and pH indices were calculated from the yellowness index (YI), ferrous oxide index, and carbonate level. The ISO cluster unsupervised mechanism has been used for prediction of soil chemical parameter indices out of 100 samples. The study regions recognition rate is 97% for P, 94.05% for Fe, and 69% for pH. During the validation process, four villages' results were used for the identification of soil nutrient parameters for Bori village. The results of the study area can be helpful for the development of the planning of soil fertility in the agriculture fields and effectively increase the crop yield production in the semi-arid region. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical analysis; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Iron oxides; Nutrients; pH; Productivity; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Chemical parameters; Image index; Iterative self-organizing cluster; Multi-spectral data; Precision Agriculture; Prediction modelling; Remote-sensing; Self-organising; Soil nutrients; Unsupervised classification; Soils","Classification; Image index; ISO cluster; Remote sensing; Soil nutrients","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132151296"

Our approach compares the standard deviation and the mean values of a greenness-index in Sentinel-2 time-series, and does not require to determine the date of mowing. A high standard deviation of the greenness-index demonstrates that the area of interest (AOI) includes grassland patches with tall and short (un-mowed and mowed) grass at a certain timepoint.

The Remote Sensing (RS) community has adopted GANs quickly, and reported successful use in a wide variety of applications. Given a sharp increase in research on GANs in the field of RS, there is a need for an in-depth review of the major technological/methodological advances and new applications. In this regard, we conducted a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of GAN-related RS papers, with the goals of familiarizing the RS community with the potential of GANs and helping researchers further explore RS applications of GANs by untangling challenges common in this field. Our review is based on 231 journal papers that were retrieved and selected through the Web of Science (WoS) database. We reviewed the theories, applications, and challenges of GANs, and highlighted the gaps to explore in future studies. Through the meta-analysis conducted in this study, we observed that image classification (especially urban mapping) has been the most popular application of GANs, potentially due to the wide availability of benchmark datasets. One the other hand, we found that relatively few studies have explored the potential of GANs for analyzing medium spatial-resolution multi-spectral images (e.g., Landsat or Sentinel-2), even though such images are often freely available and useful for a wide range of applications (e.g., urban expansion analysis, vegetation mapping, etc.). In spite of the applications of GANs for different RS processing tasks, there are still several gaps/questions in this field such as: 1) which GAN models/configurations are more suitable for different applications?) 2) to what degree can GANs replace real RS data in different applications? Such gaps/questions can be appropriately addressed by, for example, conducting experimental studies on evaluating different GAN models for various RS applications to provide better insights into how/which GAN models can be best deployed. The meta-analysis results presented in this study could be helpful for RS researchers to know the opportunities of using GANs and understand how GANs contribute to the current challenges in different RS applications. © 2022 The Authors","database; image analysis; machine learning; meta-analysis; remote sensing; spatial resolution","Deep learning; GANs; Generative adversarial networks; Remote sensing","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126636731"

Humans can utilize this data in agriculture, forestry, disaster management, urbanization, and many more applications. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel −2 satellite delivers freely accessible multispectral remote sensing data of different high spatial resolutions, which can be used in various remote sensing fields to extract meaningful information. In this work, the multispectral imagery of 10 m spatial resolution of a densely populated urban area, obtained from sentinel-2, is classified using Support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). The results obtained using the classifiers SVM, ANN and MLC are compared in terms of the kappa coefficient, overall accuracy and accuracy of users and producers.

This study introduces a new multi-source remote sensing approach that leverages both multi-spectral optical imagery and the weather- and illumination-independent characteristics of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to streamline, automate, and map geographically reliable flood inundation extents. Utilizing the near real-time and cloud computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), this process facilitates data acquisition and enables large-scale flood monitoring in an expeditious manner. Two major hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast were evaluated: (1) the 2021 Hurricane Ida to the south of New Orleans, Louisiana and (2) the 2017 Hurricane Harvey to the east of Houston, Texas. We devised a change detection and thresholding framework using multi-temporal SAR imagery and validated the results with flood extent maps derived from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical imagery. We demonstrate that constant threshold values for flood extraction from SAR change detection indices are not ubiquitously suitable for all geographies, thus we outline a heuristic that can be used to select thresholds suitable for specific sites through a fully automated sensitivity analysis. The results indicated high agreement between the SAR and optical imagery (77&#x2013;80%), with SAR providing the benefit of under-cloud detection. Furthermore, our results contribute to scaling the SAR approach to produce rapid and accurate information for decision-makers and emergency responders during time-sensitive flood events.

For this, multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Polarimetric (PolSAR) Sentinel-1 imagery and multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data were jointly used. We applied the Cloude–Pottier polarimetric decomposition on PolSAR data to compute 23 polarimetric indicators and extracted vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 time-series to generate a big feature space of 818 features. In order to assess the relevance of the different features for the crop mapping task, we run a number of scenarios using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The model that was trained using only the polarimetric data demonstrates a very promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy over 82%. A genetic algorithm was also implemented as a feature selection method for deriving an optimal feature subset. To showcase the positive effect of using polarimetric data over areas suffering from cloud coverage, we contaminated the original Sentinel-2 time-series with simulated cloud masks. By incorporating the genetic algorithm, we derived a high informative feature subset of 120 optical and polarimetric features, as the corresponding classification model increased the overall accuracy by 5% compared to the model trained only with Sentinel-2 features. The feature importance analysis indicated that apart from the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, several polarimetric parameters, such as Shannon entropy, second eigenvalue and normalised Shannon entropy are of high value in identifying crops. In summary, the findings of our study highlight the significant contribution of Sentinel-1 PolSAR data in crop classification in areas with frequent cloud coverage and the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in discovering the most informative features. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feature Selection; Food supply; Optical remote sensing; Polarimeters; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Cloud cover; Common agricultural policy; Crop classification; Crop type mappings; Features selection; Polarimetric data; Radar polarimetry; Sentinel-1; Times series; Vegetation index; Genetic algorithms","cloud cover; common agricultural policy; crop type mapping; feature selection; genetic algorithm; radar polarimetry; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142677999"

The extraction of the accurate building footprints in densely populated urban areas from medium resolution satellite images is still a challenging task which requires the development of the new methods to solve such problem. In this paper, a novel Dilated-ResUnet deep learning architecture for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested on three novel building datasets that are prepared for three densely populated cities of India (viz. Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) using Sentinel-2 satellite images and Planet OSM. First FCC (false colour composite) dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green bands, second FCC dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green and Blue bands and third is TCC (true colour composite) dataset by merging red, green and blue bands. The proposed architecture is applied to both the FCC datasets and TCC dataset separately; it has been identified that the proposed model has obtained better building extraction results using FCC (NIR, Red, Green) dataset. The input satellite image enhancement and extensive experimentations to identify the optimal deep learning hyper-parameters using FCC spatial dataset have also been carried out to further improve the performance of the proposed model. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed model has out-performed the state of the art models available in literature by achieving the F1-score of 0.4718 and Mean IoU of 0.582 for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images.

This is due to numerous confounding factors such as the com-plexity of water optical properties, the surface glint, the heterogeneous nature of atmospheric aero-sols, and the proximity of bright land surfaces. This combination of factors makes it difficult to re-trieve accurate information about the system observed. Moreover, the impact of radiance coming from adjacent land (adjacency effects) in complex geometries further adds to this challenge, especially for small lakes. In this study, ten atmospheric correction algorithms were evaluated for high-resolution multispectral imagery of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 MultiSpec-tral Instrument using in situ optical measurements from ~300 lakes across Canada. The results of the validation show that the performance of the algorithms varies by spectral band and evaluation metrics. The dark spectrum fitting algorithm had the best performance in terms of similarity angle (spectral shape), while the neural network-based models showed the lowest errors and bias per band. However, none of the tested atmospheric correction algorithms meet a 30% retrieval accuracy target across all the visible bands, likely due to uncorrected adjacency effects. To quantify this pro-cess, three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations were performed and compared to satellite observations. These simulations show that up to 60% of the top of atmosphere reflectance in the near-infrared bands over the lake was from the adjacent lands covered with green vegetation.

Detecting anomalies in time series of multispectral remote sensing images for crop monitoring is generally performed using a large sample of historical data at a pixel level. Conversely, this article presents a framework for anomaly detection (AD), localization, and classification that exploits the temporal information contained in a given season at a parcel level to detect and localize outliers using hidden Markov models (HMMs). Specifically, the AD part is based on the learning of HMM parameters associated with unlabeled normal data that are used in a second step to detect abnormal crop parcels referred to as anomalies. The learned HMM can also be used in time segments to temporally localize the anomalies affecting the crop parcels. The detected and localized anomalies are finally classified using a supervised classifier, e.g., based on support vector machines. The proposed framework is applicable to images partially covered by clouds and can handle a set of crop parcels acquired in the same season bypassing problems due to crop rotations. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic and real data, where the real data correspond to vegetation indices extracted from several multitemporal Sentinel-2 images of rapeseed crops. The proposed approach is compared to standard AD methods yielding better detection rates with the advantage of allowing anomalies to be localized and characterized. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Classification (of information); Crops; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Time series; Trellis codes; Agricultural monitoring; Anomaly classification; Anomaly detection; Hidden markov model; Hidden-Markov models; Localised; Multi-spectral; Remote-sensing; Times series; detection method; essential oil; image classification; Lotka-Volterra model; model; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; time series analysis; vegetation type; Hidden Markov models","Agricultural monitoring; anomaly classification; anomaly detection (AD); hidden Markov models (HMMs); remote sensing; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123622102"

Most monitoring programs require in situ measurements, which are expensive, time-consuming, and lack spatial and temporal resolution. Extensive research focuses on mitigating these costs by minimizing the indicators or using remote sensing tools. One of the currently investigated options is the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) data since it can narrow the multi-resolution gap between the in situ and satellite data. As an initial step of such a multi-scaling approach, we focused on testing the applicability of existing algorithms developed for the Sentinel-2 multispectral data (MS) on our hyperspectral (HS) data obtained using UAV. We applied the available algorithms to estimate three water quality (WQ) parameters: Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), and turbidity (TUR), for the in situ data acquired at the estuary of the River Jadro near the city of Split (Croatia). The higher spectral resolution obtained by HS imaging enabled us to use the specific wavelengths corresponding to the satellite bands for which the initial algorithms were developed. Moreover, we made one synthetic dataset of MS data, obtained by spectral resampling of HS data using spectral response functions for Sentinel 2 sensors given by ESA. By using these corresponding bandwidths, the initial study found medium and poor correlations with the WQ parameters: Chl a (R2=0.48), turbidity (R2=0.07), and CDOM (R2=0.22). Furthermore, all algorithms revealed higher correlations when using HS data compared to synthesized MS data. However, to fortify these results, we need to test more algorithms and compare the results with satellite reflectance data. Moreover, the future goals of this study are to develop new algorithms which could serve as surrogate data for satellite predictions. © 2022 SPIE.","Agriculture; Antennas; Chlorophyll; Estuaries; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sewage; Spectroscopy; Turbidity; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Chlorophyll a; Coloured dissolved organic matters; Hyperspectral Data; In-situ data; Multi-spectral data; Sentinel-2; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Water quality monitoring; Water quality parameters; Water quality","CDOM; chlorophyll a; hyperspectral imaging; Sentinel-2; turbidity; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142866801"

The possibility to identify the quality based on the spectral properties allows remote sensing methods to offer an alternative form of monitoring the environment. This study used laboratory spectroscopy and multi-spectral images (Sentinel 2) with environmental covariates (physicochemical parameters) to find an affordable method that can be used to present spatial prediction models as a tool for the evaluation of the quality of Andean soils. The models were developed using statistical techniques of logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis to generate an index based on soil order and three indexes based on the combination of soil order and land use. This combined approach offers an effective method, relative to traditional laboratory methods, to derive estimates of the content and composition of soil constituents, such as electrical conductivity (CE), organic matter (OM), pH, and soil moisture (HU). For Mollisol index.3 with Páramo land use, a value of organic matter (OM) ≥8.6% was obtained, whereas for Mollisol index.4 with Shrub land use, OM was ≥6.1%. These results reveal good predictive (estimation) capabilities for these soil order–land use groups.

In this context, impervious surface coverage is increasingly becoming an essential indicator for assessing urbanization and environmental quality, with several works relying on satellite imagery to determine it. However, although satellite imagery is typically available with a frequency of 3–10 days worldwide, imperviousness maps are released at most annually as they require a huge human effort to be produced and validated. Attempts have been made to extract imperviousness maps from satellite images using machine learning, but (i) the scarcity of reliable and detailed ground truth (ii) together with the need to manage different spectral bands (iii) while making the resulting system easily accessible to the end users is limiting their diffusion. To tackle these problems, in this work we introduce a deep-learning-based approach to extract imperviousness maps from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images leveraging a very detailed imperviousness map realised by the Italian department for environment protection as ground truth. We also propose a scalable and portable inference pipeline designed to easily scale the approach, integrating it into a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application.

Optical RS imaging systems usually provide images of high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution and vice versa. Therefore, fusing those images to obtain a fused image having both high spectral and spatial resolution is desirable in many applications. This article proposes a fusion framework using an unsupervised convolutional neural network (CNN) and Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE). We derive a new loss function for a CNN that incorporates a backprojection mean square error (MSE) with SURE to estimate the projected mse between the fused image and the ground truth. The main motivation is that training a CNN with this SURE loss function is unsupervised and avoids overfitting. Experimental results for two fusion examples, multispectral and hyperspectral (MS-HS) image fusion and multispectral and multispectral (MS-MS) image fusion, show that the proposed method yields high-quality fused images and outperforms the competitive methods.

In this study, we focused on the development of a framework leading to a generalized Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) model applicable to an extensive and diversified coastal region (>200 km of coastline) utilizing multi-date images. The model calibration and validation were done using airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB). As ALB surveys are very expensive to conduct, the proposed model was trained with a limited and practically feasible ALB data sample to expand the model’s practicality. Out of the three different sub-models introduced using varying combinations of historical satellite imagery, the combined-band model with the largest feature pool yielded the highest accuracy. The results showed root mean square error (RMSE) values of 8% and lower for the 0–13.5 m depth range (limit of the lidar surveys used) for all areas of interest, indicating the model efficiency and adaptability to varying coastal characteristics. The influence of training sample locations on model performance was evaluated using three distinct model configurations. The difference between these configurations was less than 5 cm, which highlights the robustness of the proposed SDB model. The quality of the satellite imagery is a significant factor that influences the accuracy of the bathymetry estimation.

Recently, the mangrove vegetation index (MVI) was developed for rapid and accurate mapping of mangrove extent from remotely sensed imageries. In this study, we combine two techniques (random forest classification and the MVI) to improve the detection of mangrove changes within the Bintang Bolong Estuary in The Gambia. The two techniques were implemented on Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imageries covering the study area at two periods-2017 and 2020. The random forest classifier was used to extract the full land cover information from which the mangroves were separated, while the MVI was implemented using the green, near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands. Subsequently, the results were extracted for interpretation and analysis. The image classification results showed an increase in mangroves from 38.6 km2 in 2017 to 41.5 km2 in 2020. The areal extent of mangroves from image classification was positively correlated with the MVI-generated extent. The findings prove the importance of combining image classification and spectral indices for gaining more comprehensive perspectives of mangrove changes.  © 2022 L. K.

Unlike other machine learning-based regression models, GP regression provides uncertainty information and automatically optimizes hyperparameters. An experiment using Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images was conducted for cloud removal in the two agricultural regions. The prediction performance of GP regression was compared with that of random forest (RF) regression. Various combinations of input images and multi-spectral bands were considered for quantitative evaluations. The experimental results showed that using multi-temporal images with multi-spectral bands as inputs achieved the best prediction accuracy. Highly correlated adjacent multi-spectral bands and temporally correlated multi-temporal images resulted in an improved prediction accuracy. The prediction performance of GP regression was significantly improved in predicting the near-infrared band compared to that of RF regression. Estimating the distribution function of input data in GP regression could reflect the variations in the considered spectral band with a broader range. In particular, GP regression was superior to RF regression for reproducing structural patterns at both sites in terms of structural similarity. In addition, uncertainty information provided by GP regression showed a reasonable similarity to prediction errors for some sub-areas, indicating that uncertainty estimates may be used to measure the prediction result quality. These findings suggest that GP regression could be beneficial for cloud removal and optical image reconstruction. In addition, the impact analysis results of the input images provide guidelines for selecting optimal images for regression-based cloud removal. © 2022 The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.","","Cloud removal; Gaussian process; Image reconstruction; Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138014797"

The S2 sensors have three spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 m. The Landsat 8 (L8) satellite has sensors that provide seasonal coverage at spatial resolutions of 15, 30, and 60 m. Many remote sensing applications require the spatial resolutions of all data to be at the highest resolution possible, i.e., 10 m for S2. To address this demand, researchers have proposed various methods that exploit the spectral and spatial correlations within multispectral data to sharpen the S2 bands to 10 m. In this study, we combined S2 and L8 data. An S2 sharpening method called Sentinel-2 Sharpening (S2Sharp) was modified to include the 30 m and 15 m spectral bands from L8 and to sharpen all bands (S2 and L8) to the highest resolution of the data, which was 10 m. The method was evaluated using both real and simulated data. © 2022 by the authors.

Especially for agricultural areas with complex planting structures and rapid changes in crop phenology, more detailed and dense time-series remote sensing data are necessary. The Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (S2-MSI) sensor with high spatial resolution (10–60 m) and temporal resolution (5–10 days) plays a key role in spatiotemporal fusion. But the inconsistent spatial resolution of the various bands hinders its potential application at 10 m resolution, and the multiple available fine images it provides are not fully utilized for spatiotemporal fusion. It is worth exploring how to maximize the spatial and temporal resolution of S2-MSI images to help improve the effect of spatiotemporal fusion and the dynamic monitoring of rapid crop growth. In this research, a new spatiotemporal fusion (STF) framework is developed to fuse the S2-MSI image (10 m) enhanced by Super-Resolution for multispectral Multiresolution Estimation (SupReME) algorithm and MODIS image (460 m) with a large spatial ratio (46). The proposed fusion method in the new STF framework combines the existing STF methods with Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO) algorithm, abbreviated as CA-STF. The accuracy of the fused reflectance and its capability for dynamic LAI monitoring were tested in Daman Superstation of Heihe watershed. The results indicate that: (1) the new STF framework is competent to fuse multi-source images with a ratio of 46 and outperforms the existing STF methods for both near-real-time and post-growth applications; (2) the proposed CA-STF method improves the fusion accuracy and spatial details even if only two S2-MSI images are available, especially for post-growth applications; (3) the vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from the fused images by the new STF framework provide a better correlation with LAINet measurements and improve dynamic LAI monitoring in accuracy and spatial details. This study proposes a framework to maximize the spatial and temporal resolution of S2-MSI images for spatiotemporal fusion. The synthetic daily time-series images with a high resolution of 10 m will have great potential for monitoring the dynamic changes of the land surface. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","China; Heihe; Heilongjiang; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Reflection; Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation; Consistent adjustment of the climatology to actual observation; Estimation algorithm; Fusion methods; Multi-spectral; Multiresolution; Multispectral imagers; Sentinel-2 multispectral imager; Spatio-temporal fusions; Super-resolution for multispectral multiresolution estimation algorithm; Superresolution; leaf area index; MODIS; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral reflectance; watershed; Crops","CACAO; Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (S2-MSI); Spatiotemporal fusion; SupReME algorithm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130372766"

Due to the influence of satellite orbits, sensor parameters, sensor errors, and atmospheric effects, there are great differences in vegetation spectral information captured by different satellite sensor images. Spectral fusion technology can couple the advantages of different multispectral sensor images to produce new multispectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution, it has great potential for improving the spectral sensitivity of forest vegetation and alleviating the spectral satura-tion. However, how to quickly and effectively select the multi-spectral fusion data suitable for forest above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation is a very critical issue. This study proposes a scheme (RF-S) to comprehensively evaluate multispectral fused images and develop the appropriate model for forest AGB estimation, on the basis of random forest (RF) and the stacking ensemble algorithm. First, four classic fusion methods are used to fuse the preprocessed GaoFen-2 (GF-2) multispectral image with Sentinel-2 image to generate 12 fused Sentinel-like images. Secondly, we apply a com-prehensive evaluation method to quickly select the optimal fused image for the follow-up research. Subsequently, two feature combination optimization methods are used to select feature variables from the three feature sets. Finally, the stacking ensemble algorithm based on model dynamic integration and hyperparameter automatic optimization, as well as some classic machine learners, are used to construct the forest AGB estimation model. The results show that the fused image NND_B3 (based on nearest neighbor diffusion pan sharpening method and Band3_Red) selected by the evaluation method proposed in this study has the best performance in AGB estimation. Using the stacking ensemble method and NND_B3 image, we get the highest estimation accuracy, with the adjusted R2 and relative root mean square error (RMSEr) of 0.6306 and 15.53%, respectively. The AGB estimation RMSEr of NND_B3 is 19.95% and 24.90% lower than those of GF-2 and Sentinel-2, re-spectively. We also found that the multi-window texture factor has better performance in the area with low AGB, and it can suppress the overestimation significantly. The AGB spatial distribution estimated using the NND_B3 image matches the field observations well, indicating that the multispectral fusion image combined with the Stacking algorithm can increase the accuracy and saturation of the AGB estimates. © 2021 by the authors.

Traditional techniques, including satellite remote sensing and ground-based techniques used to assess habitat condition, have limitations in terms of costs and low resolution of satellite platforms. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI (GNDVI) have potential for assessing habitat condition, e.g., forage quantity and quality, vegetation cover and degradation, soil erosion and salinization, fire, and pollution of vegetation cover. We, therefore, examined how the recently emerged Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform and the traditional Sentinel-2 differs in indications of habitat condition using NDVI and GNDVI. We assigned 13 survey plots to random locations in the major land cover types: three survey plots in grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands, and two in riverine and mosaics cover types. We used a UAV-mounted, multi-spectral sensor and obtained Sentinel-2 imagery between February and March 2020. We categorized NDVI and GNDVI values into habitat condition classes (very good, good, poor, and very poor). We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and linear regression model in R-software. The results revealed higher sensitivity and ability of UAV to provide the necessary preliminary diagnostic indications of habitat condition. The UAV-based NDVI and GNDVI maps showed more details of all classes of habitat conditions than the Sentinel-2 maps. The linear regressions results showed strong positive correlations between the two platforms (p < 0.001). The differences were attributed primarily to spatial resolution and minor atmospheric effects. We recommend further studies to test other vegetation indices. © 2022 by the authors.","","ecological monitoring; remote sensing; satellite platforms; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; vegetation indices; wildlife habitats","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139777151"

However, most of existing methods focus on the fusion of two of the spatial, temporal, and spectral metrics of remote sensing images. The few spatial-temporal-spectral fusion (STSF) methods available are mainly for fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images, which are not suitable for the characteristics of the spaceborne hyperspectral images (HSIs) with low temporal resolution, such as Hyperion, ZY-1 02D, and PRISMA. For this purpose, we proposed a novel generalized linear spectral mixing model for STSF (GLMM-STSF). In the method, the GLMM is introduced into the STSF problem, and the temporal variations of images at different times are transferred to the endmember and abundance matrix variations of images for estimation. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, the STSF task of remote sensing images is handled from the perspective of spectral unmixing. Compared with the existing STSF fusion methods, our method targets the task of fusing spaceborne HSI with low temporal and spatial resolutions with multispectral image (MSI) featured by high temporal and spatial resolutions. Taking the STSF of ZY-1 02D hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 multispectral real datasets as an example, comparisons with related state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior fusion performance. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Economic and social effects; Hyperspectral imaging; Image resolution; Matrix algebra; Mixing; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; HyperSpectral; Linear spectral mixing models; Multi-spectral; Sparse matrices; Spatial resolution; Spatial temporals; Spectral unmixing; Task analysis; Temporal resolution; MODIS; Image fusion","Hyperspectral; Image fusion; Multispectral; Spatial resolution; Spectral resolution; Spectral unmixing; Temporal resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134257366"

Our study explores the use of remote sensing tools to monitor and categorize the spread of water hyacinth, aiming at new insights into the detection, observation, and mapping of this invasive plant using vegetation indices and water indices calculated from multispectral data from satellite Sentinel-2, such as normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index.

Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations’ call for “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. In many countries – particularly developing countries –, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60% of the total population, whereas approximately 30% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization. © 2021 The Authors","Satellites; Big data; Climate change; Data Analytics; Data fusion; Deep learning; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Morphology; Population statistics; Quality control; Deep learning; Global inequalities; Global perspective; Global urban LCZ dataset; Local climate; Local climate zone; Remote-sensing; Sentinel; United Nations; Urban morphology; geographical region; global change; morphology; planet; stakeholder; United Nations; urban morphology; urbanization; Remote sensing","Big data; Data fusion; Deep learning; Global inequality; Global urban LCZ dataset; Local climate zones; Remote sensing; Sentinels; Urban morphology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119657449"

Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0–10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.85 with the field data. Similarly, the shoreline erosion and accretion have been analysed from the shoreline change analysis methods. In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast.

ISA extraction methods based on supervised classification usually rely on a large number of manually labeled samples, the production of which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Furthermore, in arid areas, man-made objects are easily confused with bare land due to similar spectral responses. To tackle these issues, a self-trained deep-forest (STDF)-based ISA extraction method is proposed which exploits the complementary information contained in multispectral and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images using limited numbers of samples. In detail, this method consists of three major steps. First, multi-features, including spectral, spatial and polarimetric features, are extracted from Sentinel-2 multispectral and Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) PolSAR images; secondly, a deep forest (DF) model is trained in a self-training manner using a limited number of samples for ISA extraction; finally, ISAs (in this case, in three major cities located in Central Asia) are extracted and comparatively evaluated. The experimental results from the study areas of Bishkek, Tashkent and Nursultan demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with an overall accuracy (OA) above 95% and a Kappa coefficient above 0.90. © 2022 by the authors.","Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Humans; Radar; Urbanization; Arid regions; Forestry; Image processing; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Arid area; Deep forest; Extraction method; Gaofen-3; Impervious surface area; Multi-spectral; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Self-training; Sentinel-2; Synthetic aperture radar images; city; environmental monitoring; forest; human; procedures; telecommunication; urbanization; Extraction","deep forest; GaoFen-3; impervious surface area; PolSAR; self-training; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138391093"

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users. © 2022 by the authors.

The study site is the Arcachon Bay inlet (France). A dataset composed of 450,837 echosounder data points and 89 Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 images acquired from 2013 to 2020, is generated to test and validate SDB and uncertainty models for various contrasting optical conditions. Results show that water column optical properties are characterized by a high spatio-temporal variability controlled by hydrodynamics and seasonal conditions. The best performance and highest robustness are found for the cluster-based approach using a green band log-linear regression model. A total of 80 satellite images can be exploited to calibrate SDB models, providing average values of root mean square error and maximum bathymetry of 0.53 m and 7.3 m, respectively. The uncertainty model, developed to extrapolate information beyond the calibration dataset, is based on a multi-scene approach. The sensitivity of the model to the optical variability not explained by the calibration dataset is demonstrated but represents a risk of error of less than 5%.

In this study, the potential for differentiating non-forest Natura 2000 habitats from the other habitats was examined using hyperspectral data in the scope of VNIR (0.4–1 µm), SWIR (1–2.5 µm) and simulated multispectral data (Sentinel-2). The aim of the research was also to determine the most informative spectral ranges from the optical range. Five different Natura 2000 habitats common in Central Europe were analysed: heaths (code 4030), mires (code 7140), grasslands (code 6230) and meadows (codes 6410 and 6510). In order to guarantee the objectivity and transferability of the results each habitat was tested in two areas and in three campaigns (spring, summer, autumn). Hyperspectral data was acquired using HySpex VNIR-1800 and SWIR-384 scanners. The Sentinel-2 data was resampled based on HySpex spectral reflectance. The overflights were performed simultaneously with ground reference data – habitats and background polygons. The Linear Discriminant Analysis was performed in iterative mode based on spectral reflectance acquired from hyperspectral and multispectral data. This resulted in distribution of correctness rate values and information about the most differentiating spectral bands for each habitat. Based on the results of our experiments we conclude that: (i) hyperspectral data (both VNIR and SWIR) obtained from May to September was useful for differentiation of habitats from background with efficiency reaching over 90%, regardless of the area; (ii) the most useful spectral ranges are: in VNIR − 0.416–0.442 µm and 0.502–0.522 µm, in SWIR − 1.117–1.165 µm and 1.290–1.361 µm; (iii) the potential of multispectral data (Sentinel-2) in distinguishing Natura 2000 habitats from the background is diverse; higher for heaths and mires (comparable to hyperspectral data) lower for meadows (6410, 6510) and grasslands (6230); (iv) in case of meadows and grasslands, the correctness rate for the Sentinel-2 data was on average about 20% lower compared to the hyperspectral data. © 2022 The Authors","Central Europe; Codes (symbols); Conservation; Discriminant analysis; Forestry; Iterative methods; Reflection; Remote sensing; Correctness rates; Hyperspectral Data; Hyspex; Linear discriminant analyze; Multi-spectral data; Natura 2000; Sentinel-2; Spectral range; Spectral reflectances; Vegetation identification; comparative study; data acquisition; discriminant analysis; experimental study; identification method; mire; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; Ecosystems","HySpex; Linear Discriminant Analysis; Sentinel-2; Vegetation identification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122594987"

The following MS image for the same region can be acquired with respect to the satellite revisit period. The images captured at different times over the same region are called multitemporal images. Traditional compression methods generally benefit from spectral and spatial correlation within the MS image. However, there is also a temporal correlation between multitemporal images. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based prediction method called MultiTempGAN for compression of multitemporal MS images. The proposed method defines a lightweight GAN-based model that learns to transform the reference image to the target image. Here, the generator parameters of MultiTempGAN are saved for the reconstruction purpose in the receiver system. Due to MultiTempGAN has a low number of parameters, it provides efficiency in multitemporal MS image compression. Experiments were carried out on three Sentinel-2 MS image pairs belonging to different geographical regions. We compared the proposed method with JPEG2000-based conventional compression methods and three deep learning methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, mean spectral angle, mean spectral correlation, and laplacian mean square error metrics. Additionally, we have also evaluated the change detection performances and visual maps of the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that MultiTempGAN not only achieves the best metric values among the other methods at high compression ratios but also presents convincing performances in change detection applications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Geographical regions; Image compression; Mean square error; Signal to noise ratio; Change detection; Compression methods; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Multispectral images; Multispectral-image compression; Reflected energy; Remote-sensing; Spectral correlation; Remote sensing","Big data; Generative adversarial networks; Multispectral image compression; Multitemporal images; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119176940"

This work presents an approach for training a deep learning ship detector in Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images with few labeled examples. We design a network architecture for detecting ships with a backbone that can be pre-trained separately. By using self supervised learning, an emerging unsupervised training procedure, we learn good features on Sentinel-2 images, without requiring labeling, to initialize our network’s backbone. The full network is then fine-tuned to learn to detect ships in challenging settings. We evaluated this approach versus pre-training on ImageNet and versus a classical image processing pipeline. We examined the impact of variations in the self-supervised learning step and we show that in the few-shot learning setting self-supervised pre-training achieves better results than ImageNet pre-training. When enough training data are available, our self-supervised approach is as good as ImageNet pre-training. We conclude that a better design of the self-supervised task and bigger non-annotated dataset sizes can lead to surpassing ImageNet pre-training performance without any annotation costs. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the different objects may have similar spectral values and the same objects may have different spectral values, which makes it difficult to improve the classification accuracy. Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images is greatly facilitated via deep learning methods. For medium-resolution remote sensing images, the convolutional neural network-based model does not achieve good results due to its limited field of perception. The fast-emerging vision transformer method with self-attentively capturing global features well provides a new solution for medium-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. In this paper, a new multi-class segmentation method is proposed for medium-resolution remote sensing images based on the improved Swin UNet model as a pure transformer model and a new pre-processing, and the image enhancement method and spectral selection module are designed to achieve better accuracy. Finally, 10-categories segmentation is conducted with 10-m resolution Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi-Spectral Imager) images, which is compared with other traditional convolutional neural network-based models (DeepLabV3+ and U-Net with different backbone networks, including VGG, ResNet50, MobileNet, and Xception) with the same sample data, and results show higher Mean Intersection Over Union (MIOU) (72.06%) and better accuracy (89.77%) performance.

However, due to the lack of measured water depth data and the limitation of the number of visible light segments in multi-spectral images, the traditional empirical model and semi-analytical model can not be used. Aiming at the remote sensing images with only three visible bands, an adaptive empirical semi-analytical model without measured water depth data is proposed. The new model is based on the partial pixel water depth obtained by the joint semi-analytical model and two empirical models, and the cooperative adaptive linear ratio model can determine the final result. The Sentinel-2 image (spatial resolution is 10 m) is used to test the AESM model, Log_ratio model and Log-ratio and Semianalytical (L-S) model in Ganquan island and Langhua reef, and the calculated results are compared with the water depth data. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the new model is 1.14 m in Ganquan island and 1.55 m in Langhua reef, respectively. The inversion accuracy of the new model is slightly better than that of the Log_ratio model trained with 200 water depth data.

Yet we only have a poor understanding of the dynamics and feedback mechanisms in these hydrological systems as arid and semi-arid zones are typically poorly equipped with reliable in situ monitoring stations to provide necessary information. The main objective of our study is to show the potential of satellite data to monitor the dynamics of ephemeral rivers, such as the Kuiseb located in Namibia, since remotesensing offers the advantage of adapted spatial and temporal resolutions. For this study, multi-spectral imagery (Sentinel-2), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR, Sentinel-1), and SAR interferometry (Sentinel-1) data were used to produce Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps, backscattering maps (as σ0), and interferograms, respectively. These parameters provide information on the hydrologic and vegetation dynamics of the river. Strong variations in NDVI, σ0, and interferograms are observed during March–April 2017 and June–July 2018 in a tributary of the Kuiseb in the central Namib Desert. In those years, rain events caused the reactivation of the tributary. However, during a major flood in 2021, when no rain occured, no variations in NDVI were detected in this tributary, unlike the σ0 and interferogram anomalies after the flood. Thus, these variations cannot be explained by rains, which were non-existent during this period, but seem to be linked to the dynamics of the aquifer of the Kuiseb River, wherein floods recharge the alluvial aquifers and the rising water table levels produce a signal that is measurable by satellite radar sensors.

Optical remote-sensing datasets from different sensors are available for estimating soil moisture and salinity from different spatial-temporal scales. Given the co-regulation of soil spectral reflectance (SR) by soil moisture and salinity, the simultaneous estimation of moisture and salinity in saline soil may result in great bias and uncertainty. To address this problem, soil samples were collected in the salinized area during irrigation. Synchronously, processed multi-spectral images were acquired from Sentinel-2 satellite. The spectrum mechanism responsive to soil moisture and salinity was verified by statistical tests, and its corresponding mathematical model (MSS model) was developed to identify the dominant factors affecting SR and to inverse moisture and salinity. The result showed that the effects of moisture and salinity were temporally constant (facilitation) and changing (from inhibition to facilitation), respectively, during the irrigation stages. The dominant factors in the variation of SR shifted from salinity and moisture-salinity interaction to moisture. Reliable accuracy was achieved in the moisture and salinity estimation using inverse MSS model. The profile from the series of estimations can further reveal the dynamic changes of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation, and provide guidance for local irrigation management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Estimation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Spectroscopy; %moisture; Dominant factor; Hetao irrigation area; Irrigation area; Irrigation management; Moisture-salinity interaction; Remote-sensing; Simultaneous estimation; Soil salinity; Soil salinization; agricultural modeling; estimation method; irrigation; remote sensing; salinity; satellite data; Sentinel; soil moisture; spectral reflectance; Irrigation","Hetao irrigation area; Irrigation management; Moisture-salinity interaction; Remoter sensing; Soil salinization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124800539"

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an $F1$ score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Media streaming; Remote sensing; Satellites; Urban growth; Change detection; Deep learning; Features extraction; Multispectral satellite image; Remote-sensing; Shape; Spatial pyramid pooling; Spatial pyramids; Streaming medium; multispectral image; Sentinel; Feature extraction","Change detection (CD); deep learning; multi-spectral satellite images; spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127087143"

While regional studies allow detailed insights into land use and ecosystem service interactions, information on a national scale can aid biodiversity assessments. However, for most European countries this information is not yet widely available. We used an analysis-ready-data cube that contains dense time series of co-registered Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, covering the extent of Germany. We propose an algorithm that detects mowing events in the time series based on residuals from an assumed undisturbed phenology, as an indicator of grassland use intensity. A self-adaptive ruleset enabled to account for regional variations in land surface phenology and non-stationary time series on a pixel-basis. We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Germany; Agriculture; Big data; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Land use; Photomapping; Pixels; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Analyse-ready data; Area mapping; Common agricultural policy; Germany; Land use intensity; Large-area mapping; Multi-spectral data; Optical remote sensing; Planetscope; Times series; biodiversity; ecosystem service; land surface; land use; Landsat; mapping; mowing; phenology; Sentinel; time series; Time series","Analysis-ready data; Big data; Common agricultural policy; Germany; Land use intensity; Large-area mapping; Multi-spectral data; Optical remote sensing; PlanetScope; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120159637"

Current remote sensing methods for mapping floating aquatic vegetation at the genus level relies on airborne imaging spectroscopy, resulting in temporal gaps because routine hyperspectral satellite coverage is not yet available. Here we achieved genus level and species level discrimination between two invasive aquatic vegetation species using Sentinel 2 multispectral satellite data and machine‐learning classifiers in summer and fall. The species of concern were water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes) and water primrose (Ludwigia spp.). Our classifiers also identified submerged and emergent aquatic vegetation at the community level. Random forest models using Sentinel‐2 data achieved an average overall accuracy of 90%, and class accuracies of 79–91% and 85–95% for water hyacinth and water primrose, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has mapped water primrose to the genus level using satellite remote sensing. Sentinel‐2 derived maps compared well to those derived from airborne imaging spectroscopy and we also identified misclassifications that can be attributed to the coarser Sentinel‐2 spectral and spatial resolutions. Our results demonstrate that the intra‐annual temporal gaps between airborne imaging spectroscopy observations can be supplemented with Sentinel‐2 satellite data and thus, rapidly growing/expanding vegetation can be tracked in real time. Such improvements have potential management benefits by improving the understanding of the phenology, spread, competitive advantages, and vulnerabilities of these aquatic plants. © 2022 by the authors.

As the revisit cycle of L8 and S2A satellites is 16 and 5 days, which means they may have a harmonized overpass from a particular place every 80 days, two field measurements were conducted to determine the matchup Zsd values around Kish Island in the northern Persian Gulf, so that both chosen dates were coincident with the two harmonized overpasses of the above-mentioned satellites from the study area. Afterward, a general combined linear and ratio transform model was formed to estimate the Zsd values from the satellite data, based on the matchup field measured Zsd values. The statistical indicators, including the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were further determined for many combinations of bands and/or band ratios to suggest the optimum model.

How to effectively integrate cross-modal information to obtain a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image with the characteristics of the SAR is promising. However, due to divergent imaging mechanisms of modalities, existing SAR and optical image fusion techniques generally remain limited due to the spectral or spatial distortions, especially for complex surface features such as coastal wetlands. This paper provides, for the first time, an efficient multi-resolution collaborative fusion method for multispectral, hyperspectral, and SAR images. We improve generic multi-resolution analysis with spectral-spatial weighted modulation and spectral compensation to achieve minimal spectral loss. The backscattering gradients of SAR are guided to fuse, which is calculated from saliency gradients with edge preserving.

Sentinel-2 senses the same location providing different spatial resolutions as well as generating a multi-spectral image with 13 bands of 10, 20, and 60 m/pixel. In this work, we propose a single-image super-resolution model based on convolutional neural networks that enhances the low-resolution bands (20 m and 60 m) to reach the maximal resolution sensed (10 m) at the same time, whereas other approaches provide two independent models for each group of LR bands. Our proposed model, named Sen2-RDSR, is made up of Residual in Residual blocks that produce two final outputs at maximal resolution, one for 20 m/pixel bands and the other for 60 m/pixel bands. The training is done in two stages, first focusing on 20 m bands and then on the 60 m bands. Experimental results using six quality metrics (RMSE, SRE, SAM, PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS) show that our model has superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and it is very effective and suitable as a preliminary step for land and coastal applications, as studies involving pixel-based classification for Land-Use-Land-Cover or the generation of vegetation indices. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to enhance the correlation between SSC and spectral reflectance under vegetation coverage using Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing. Soil samples of salinity and moisture were collected at 100 sampling sites with different depth ranges, including <20, 20-40, and >40-60 cm, in Shahaoqu Irrigation Area, Inner Mongolia, China, from June to August in 2019. The multispectral data of Sentinel-2 satellite was acquired synchronously according to the sample time and location. The specific procedure was as follows. Firstly, a depth decision tree was constructed with the normalized difference vegetation index as a branching criterion, where the best one was then selected to determine the optimal depth range for the SSC retrieval of soil samples. Secondly, a classification decision tree was used to divide the soil samples into different categories, according to the normalized vegetation index and Soil Moisture Content (SMC). As such, the category of each soil sample was determined using the classification decision tree. Thirdly, the optimal spectral combination for each category was calculated to serve as an input variable into the SSC inversion model. Several machine learning models were adopted for the SSC inversion models to monitor the SSC at the optimal depth range from the salinity depth decision tree, including Adaptive boosting algorithm (Adaboost), Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that the correlation coefficient between SSC and spectral reflectance was above 0.66, considering the decision tree. In terms of soil depth range, the optimal inversion depth for the SSC under vegetation cover was >40-60 cm, followed by <20 cm, but the SSC inversion model presented some limitations in the middle layer (20-40 cm). Furthermore, the inversion accuracy was ranked in the descending order of RF, GBDT, Adaboost, SVM, and PLSR, where the RF and Adaboost presented similar inversion. Correspondingly, the SSC inversion model using ensemble learning demonstrated a strong generalization ability to achieve the ideal and stable inversion under different application scenarios, compared with the other machine learning. Specifically, the SSC inversion model performed the best using RF, where the coefficient of determination, the root mean square error, the residual predictive interquartile range, and the residual predictive deviations were 0.70, 0.25%, 0.35, and 1.67, respectively. The correlation between SSC and spectral reflectance was 0.38 without considering the decision tree, indicating there was no significance in the SSC inversion model. Considering the decision tree, the coefficient of determination of the SSC inversion model was 0.70, indicating that the decision tree effectively enhanced the sensitivity of spectral reflectance to SSC for the high accuracy, particularly when the vegetation on the surface of the soil. Consequently, this finding can provide a promising potential way to monitor the soil salinization in the irrigated areas during crop growth using multi-spectral satellites in modern agriculture. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, current passive remote sensing methods for estimating bathymetry require in situ depth measurements to train inversion models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in many areas. To address this issue, we investigated the fusion of range measurements from the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS) aboard the NASA ICESat-2 satellite, and multispectral satellite imagery from European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 using two common bathymetric inversion algorithms. The active ranging capability of the ATLAS green (532-nm) laser has been shown to generate returns of up to 38-m depth in optically clear waters, providing depth measurements to constrain passive bathymetric inversion results. Data acquired in November 2018 over the nearshore in Destin, FL, USA, offer a proof of concept for this approach. The results of the bathymetric inversion were quantitatively assessed by comparison with airborne bathymetric LiDAR collected using the U.S. Army Corps Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LiDAR (CZMIL) system in October-November 2018. Overall, the results of the bathymetric inversion compared with the CZMIL data have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 m in waters with similar turbidity and bottom reflectivity, and demonstrate that a combination of ICESat-2 depth observations with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can estimate seamless nearshore bathymetry for optically clear coastal waters. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","United States; Aneroid altimeters; Bathymetry; Coastal engineering; Mean square error; NASA; Optical radar; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Bathymetric lidars; Depth measurements; European Space Agency; Inversion algorithm; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral satellite imagery; Passive remote sensing; Root mean square errors; algorithm; altimeter; bathymetry; coastal zone; ICESat; in situ measurement; lidar; nearshore environment; numerical model; observational method; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Hydrographic surveys","Bathymetry; ICESat-2; Sentinel-2; support vector regression (SVR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104845088"

Sentinel-2 A/B images have been highly valued in the aspects of land surface vegetation and ecological monitoring at different spatial scales due to their advantages of free access, multi-spectral bands (especially the introduction of red edge bands), and finer spatial (10 m/20 m) and temporal (5-day) resolutions. Compared with Landsat and other similar satellite products, cloud coverage analysis of Sentinel-2 A/B has not been reported. In this paper, the cloud of 5288 Sentinel-2 A/B images (Granule/Tile) over northern Laos from 2016 to 2018 were used to determine the appropriate threshold of cloud coverage for image acquisition probability analysis under different cloud coverage thresholds (0~100%) based on GIS, aiming to reveal the spatial-temporal difference in acquisition probability. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Sentinel-2 A/B imagery was highly appropriate for land surface remote sensing monitoring with a cloud coverage threshold of 20% (i.e., cloud coverage is ≤ 20%). This threshold resulted in the largest monthly cumulative probability (~27.41%) of Sentinel-2 A/B images in northern Laos. (2) Using the threshold of 20% cloud coverage, the differences in monthly cumulative average acquisition probabilities of Sentinel-2 A/B images in northern Laos were consistent with the temporal distributions of dry season (November to April) and wet season (May to October). The acquisition probability was 42.91% in the dry season, with the largest in March (50.27%), followed by April and February. The fact that Sentinel-2 is featured by larger acquisition probability during the peak of dry season greatly facilitates the monitoring of dynamics in swidden agriculture and rubber plantations. The corresponding probability in the wet season was merely 11.81%, with the lowest in June (~1.26%). (3) Huge differences in monthly cumulative average acquisition probabilities of Sentinel-2 A/B images between the east and west of northern Laos were revealed. In the dry season, the image acquisition probabilities of the western provinces (e.g., Luang Namtha) were much larger than those of the eastern ones, while the situation was just the opposite in the wet season. This study can provide important reference for the large-scale (e.g. global) cloud coverage analysis of Sentinel-2 A/B images and the selection of Sentinel-2 images for monitoring land use change due to United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) in the tropics, including swidden agriculture transformation and rubber plantation expansion. © 2020, Science Press.

Managing and delivering large sets of data becomes extremely difficult and resource demanding for the data vendors, but even more for individual users and third party stakeholders. Hence, research in the field of efficient remote sensing data handling and manipulation has become a very active research topic (from both storage and communication perspectives). Driven by the rapid growth in the volume of optical satellite measurements, in this work we explore the lossy compression technique for multispectral satellite images. We give a comprehensive analysis of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) still-image intra coding part applied to the multispectral image data. Thereafter, we analyze the impact of the distortions introduced by the HEVC's intra compression in the general case, as well as in the specific context of crop classification application. Results show that HEVC's intra coding achieves better trade-off between compression gain and image quality, as compared to standard JPEG 2000 solution. On the other hand, this also reflects in the better performance of the designed pixel-based classifier in the analyzed crop classification task. We show that HEVC can obtain up to 150:1 compression ratio, when observing compression in the context of specific application, without significantly losing on classification performance compared to classifier trained and applied on raw data. In comparison, in order to maintain the same performance, JPEG 2000 allows compression ratio up to 70:1. © 2020 by the authors.","Crops; Data compression ratio; Data handling; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Image coding; Remote sensing; Satellites; Video signal processing; Classification performance; Comparative studies; Comprehensive analysis; High-efficiency video coding; Multi-spectral image data; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing data; Image compression","Crop classification; HEVC; High bit-depth compression; Intra coding; JPEG 2000; Landsat-8; Multispectral satellite images; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085582316"

In Ireland, traditionally wetland-monitoring is carried out by manual field visits which can be very time-consuming. To automate the process, this study extends the ability of remote sensing-based monitoring of wetlands by combining RGB image processing, machine learning algorithms, and satellite data analysis to create seasonal maps of vegetation communities within the wetlands. The methodology matches multispectral and broad coverage of open-source Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery with the high spatial granularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drone images. Single sensor drone imagery was captured, colour corrected and classified using random forest (RF) classifier for a subset of the wetland. The classified imagery was upsampled to satellite imagery scale to create training data for vegetation-segmentation in the entire wetland. The process was repeated for multiple seasons, and an annual map was created utilising the majority voting. The proposed framework has been evaluated on various wetlands across Ireland, with results presented herein for an ombrotrophic peatland complex, Clara Bog. The accuracy of the maps was checked utilising a set of area-based performance metric. The application of this method thereby reduces the number of field surveys typically required to assess the long-term ecological change of such wetland habitats. The performance of the proposed method demonstrates that the technique is a robust, quick, and cost-effective way to map wetland habitats seasonally and to explore their ecohydrological synergies. © 2021 The Authors","Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Drones; Ecosystems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Wetlands; Ecological changes; Ecological conditions; Multi-spectral; Performance metrices; Satellite data; Spatial granularity; Vegetation community; Wetland habitats; aerial photography; ecohydrology; ecological approach; environmental monitoring; field method; image processing; peatland; remotely operated vehicle; satellite altimetry; vegetation cover; wetland; Color image processing","Colour correction; Drone imagery augmentation; Machine learning; Sentinel-2; Wetland mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101401870"

Satellite remote sensing techniques are increasingly used to map newly erupted lava, thanks to their capability to survey large areas with frequent revisit time and accurate spatial resolution. Visible and infrared satellite data are routinely used to detect the distributions of volcanic deposits and monitor thermal features, even if clouds are a serious obstacle for optical sensors, since they cannot be penetrated by optical radiation. On the other hand, radar satellite data have been playing an important role in surface change detection and image classification, being able to operate in all weather conditions, although their use is hampered by the special imaging geometry, the complicated scattering process, and the presence of speckle noise. Thus, optical and radar data are complementary data sources that can be used to map lava flows effectively, in addition to alleviating cloud obstruction and improving change detection performance. Here, we propose a machine learning approach based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to analyze simultaneously the images acquired by the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor, on board of Sentinel-1 mission, and by optical and multispectral sensors of Landsat-8 missions and Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI), on board of Sentinel-2 mission. Machine learning classifiers, including K-means algorithm (K-means) and support vector machine (SVM), are used to map lava flows automatically from a combination of optical and SAR images. We describe the operation of this approach by using a retrospective analysis of two recent lava flow-forming eruptions at Mount Etna (Italy) and Fogo Island (Cape Verde). We found that combining both radar and optical imagery improved the accuracy and reliability of lava flow mapping. The results highlight the need to fully exploit the extraordinary potential of complementary satellite sensors to provide time-critical hazard information during volcanic eruptions. © 2021 by the authors.

We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m^{3}, collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks.

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a widely used proxy of vegetation conditions, and it has been measured at various footprint sizes using satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and ground-installed sensors. The goal of this study was to analyze the spatial characteristics of NDVI data by comparing the values obtained at different footprint sizes. In particular, the NDVI was evaluated in garlic and onion fields that featured ridges and furrows. The evaluation was performed using data from a leaf spectrometer, field spectrometers, ground-installed spectral reflectance sensors, a multispectral camera onboard a UAV, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The correlation coefficients between NDVIs evaluated from the various sensors (excluding the satellite-mounted sensors) ranged from 0.628 to 0.944. The UAV-based NDVI (NDVIUAV) exhibited the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 0.088) when compared with field spectrometer data. On the other hand, the satellite-based NDVI data (NDVISentinel-2) were poorly correlated with those obtained from the other sensors as a result of the footprint mismatch. However, by upscaling the NDVIUAV data to the pixel size of Sentinel-2, the comparison was improved, and the following statistics were obtained: correlation coefficient: 0.504-0.785; absolute bias: 0.048-0.078; RMSE: 0.063-0.094. According to the aforementioned results, ground-based NDVI data can be used to validate NDVIUAV data without further processing and NDVIUAV data can be used to validate NDVISentinel-2 data after upscaling to the Sentinel-2 pixel size. Overall, the results presented in this study may be helpful to understand and integrate NDVI data at different spatial scales. © 2020 by the authors.","Antennas; Infrared devices; Mean square error; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectrometers; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Correlation coefficient; Multi-spectral cameras; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing techniques; Root mean square errors; Spatial characteristics; Terrestrial vegetation; Visible and near infrared; Data handling","Footprint; NDVI; Satellite; Spatial scale; Spectrometer; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Letter","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092119181"

As leaf surfaces are the primary sites of energy, mass exchange, and fundamental production of terrestrial ecosystem, many important processes are directly proportional to LAI. With this, LAI can be considered as an important parameter of plant growth. Multispectral optical images have been widely utilized for mangrove-related studies, such as LAI estimation. In Sentinel-2, for example, LAI can be estimated using a biophysical processor in SNAP or using various machine learning algorithms. However, multispectral optical images have disadvantages due to its weather-dependence and limited canopy penetration. In this study, a multi-sensor approach was implemented by using free multi-spectral optical images (Sentinel-2 ) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (Sentinel-1) to perform Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation. The use of SAR images can compensate for the abovementioned disadvantages and it then can pave the way for regular mapping and assessment of LAI, despite any weather conditions and cloud cover. In this study, generation of LAI models that explores linear, non-linear and decision trees modelling algorithms to incorporate Sentinel-1 derivatives and Sentinel-2 LAI were executed. The Random Forest model have exhibited the most robust model having the lowest RMSE of 0.2845. This result poses a concrete relationship of a biophysical entity derived from optical parameters to RADAR derivatives to which opens the opportunity of integrating both systems to compensate each disadvantages and produce a more efficient quantification of LAI.  © Author(s) 2021.","Decision trees; Geometrical optics; Machine learning; Plants (botany); Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Canopy penetration; Leaf Area Index; Optical parameter; Random forest modeling; Robust modeling; Statistical machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Terrestrial ecosystems; Learning algorithms","Leaf Area Index; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Sentinel-1 SAR; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113154106"

Publicly accessible multi-spectral datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) are particularly helpful in analyzing the spatial extent of disturbances, however, the datasets are large and require intensive processing on high-powered computers by trained analysts. HazMapper is an open-Access hazard mapping application developed in Google Earth Engine that allows users to derive map and GIS-based products from Sentinel or Landsat datasets without the time-and cost-intensive resources required for traditional analysis. The first iteration of HazMapper relies on a vegetation-based metric, the relative difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (rdNDVI), to identify areas on the landscape where vegetation was removed following a natural disaster. Because of the vegetation-based metric, the tool is typically not suitable for use in desert or polar regions. HazMapper is not a semi-Automated routine but makes rapid and repeatable analysis and visualization feasible for both recent and historical natural disasters. Case studies are included for the identification of landslides and debris flows, wildfires, pyroclastic flows, and lava flow inundation. HazMapper is intended for use by both scientists and non-scientists, such as emergency managers and public safety decision-makers.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Meanwhile, the open data policies embraced by some of the principal Earth Observation programs have boosted the spread of such analyses. This asset has attracted also the interest of the private sector which is developing strategies to exploit the potential of these data. In view of the above, we present an experimental procedure to investigate land cover displacements through an application on open multispectral imagery from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 missions for desert sand dunes movements analysis. While most of the change detection techniques focus on locating changes and describing them by means of variation in the pixel spectral responses, the proposed technique aims at describing spatial and temporal patterns of displacements (i.e. directions and magnitude) applying cross-correlation analysis on a multitemporal images stack. Results of the proposed analysis are critical to a number of construction engineering operations that require sand mitigation planning and continuous site monitoring to prevent windblown sand interactions with infrastructures in the desert environment. An overview of the preliminary results is presented together with an extensive discussion on further improvements requested by the procedure.

The present study considers the use of a Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) algorithm as a non-parametric classifier using Sentinel-2A data and topographic variables to estimate the forest stand characteristics, namely the basal area (m2/ha), stem volume (m3/ha), and stem density (number/ha). These results were compared with those of three other popular machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as generalised linear model (GLM), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A feature selection was done on 28 variables including the multi-spectral bands on Sentinel-2 satellite, related vegetation indices, and ancillary data (elevation, slope, and topographic solar-radiation index derived from digital elevation model (DEM) and then the most insignificant variables were removed from the datasets by recursive feature elimination (RFE). The study area was a mountainous forest with high biodiversity and an elevation gradient from 26 to 1636 m. An inventory dataset of 1200 sample plots was provided for training and testing the algorithms, and the predictors were fed into the ML models to compute and predict the forest stand characteristics. The accuracies and certainties of the ML models were assessed by their root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) values. The results demonstrated that BART generated the best basal area and stem volume predictions, followed by GLM, SVM, and KNN. The best RMSE values for both basal area (8.12 m2/ha) and stem volume (29.28 m3/ha) estimation were obtained by BART. Thus, the ability of the BART model for forestry application was established. On the other hand, KNN exhibited the highest RMSE values for all stand variable predictions, thereby exhibiting the least accuracy for this specific application. Moreover, the effectiveness of the narrow Sentinel-2 bands around the red edge and elevation was highlighted for predicting the forest stand characteristics. Therefore, we concluded that the combination of the Sentinel-2 products and topographic variables derived from the PALSAR data used in this study improved the estimation of the forest attributes in temperate forests. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Nearest neighbor search; Photomapping; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Surveying; Bayesian additive regression trees; Generalised linear models; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Machine learning methods; Non-parametric classifiers; Recursive feature elimination; Root mean square errors; Sustainable forest management; Forestry","Bayesian additive regression tree; Forest stand characteristics; Machine learning; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092115376"

This sensor configuration is expected to improve the prediction accuracy of vegetation chlorophyll content. In this work, we assessed the performance of several statistical and physical-based methods in retrieving canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) from Sentinel-2 in a heterogeneous mixed mountain forest. Amongst the algorithms presented in the literature, 13 different vegetation indices (VIs), a non-parametric statistical approach, and two radiative transfer models (RTM) were used to assess the CCC prediction accuracy. A ﬁeld campaign was conducted in July 2017 to collect in situ measurements of CCC in Bavarian forest national park, and the cloud-free Sentinel-2 image was acquired on 13 July 2017. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to compare the VIs and the non-parametric approach. Whereas physical-based methods were calibrated using simulated data and validated using the in situ reference dataset. The statistical-based approaches, such as the modified simple ratio (mSR) vegetation index and the partial least square regression (PLSR) outperformed all other techniques. As such the modified simple ratio (mSR3) (665, 865) gave the lowest cross-validated RMSE of 0.21 g/m2 (R2 = 0.75). The PLSR resulted in the highest R2 of 0.78, and slightly higher RMSE =0.22 g/m2 than mSR3. The physical-based approach-INFORM inversion using look-up table resulted in an RMSE =0.31 g/m2, and R2 = 0.67. Although mapping CCC using these methods revealed similar spatial distribution patterns, over and underestimation of low and high CCC values were observed mainly in the statistical approaches. Further validation using in situ data from different terrestrial ecosystems is imperative for both the statistical and physical-based approaches' effectiveness to quantify CCC before selecting the best operational algorithm to map CCC from Sentinel-2 for long-term terrestrial ecosystems monitoring across the globe. © 2019","chlorophyll a; image analysis; montane forest; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; terrestrial ecosystem","Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC); Comparing methods; Radiative transfer model inversion; Sentinel-2; SNAP toolbox; Statistical methods","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081605717"

Because remote sensing data enable automated LCZ mapping on a large scale, there is a need to evaluate how well remote sensing resources can produce fine LCZ maps to assess urban thermal environments. In this study, we combined Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and dual-polarized (HH + HV) PALSAR-2 data to generate LCZ maps of Nanchang, China using a random forest classifier and a grid-cell-based method. We then used the classifier to evaluate the importance scores of different input features (Sentinel-2 bands, PALSAR-2 channels, and textural features) for the classification model and their contribution to each LCZ class. Finally, we investigated the relationship between LCZs and land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from summer nighttime ASTER thermal imagery by spatial statistical analysis. The highest classification accuracy was 89.96% when all features were used, which highlighted the potential of Sentinel-2 and dual-polarized PALSAR-2 data. The most important input feature was the short-wave infrared-2 band of Sentinel-2. The spectral reflectance was more important than polarimetric and textural features in LCZ classification. PALSAR-2 data were beneficial for several land cover LCZ types when Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 were combined. Summer nighttime LSTs in most LCZs differed significantly from each other. Results also demonstrated that grid-cell processing provided more homogeneous LCZ maps than the usual resampling methods.

Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data for the period from October-2018 to March-2019 was analysed in this study. The major objective of this study was to generate crop growth profiles of different crops and identify the relationships between crop phenology and crop growth stages by generating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) profiles of wheat and mustard crops. The results of spectral behavior of wheat (normal & late sown) and mustard during active growth stages indicated that these winter crops have distinct spectral signatures in Sentinel-2 spectral bands. The NDVI growth profiles of wheat and mustard indicate the temporal variations during different growth stages of these crops. The maximum temporal variations were observed during early growth stages to flowering & grain filling stages. The difference in sowing dates of wheat and mustard crops result in different phenological stages of these winter crops. The NDVI curve of Rabi Season-2018-19 was divided into different phenological growth phases namely, i) Phase-I: G0 (Spectral emergence) to G1(Flag leaf emergence), Phase-II: G1 (Flag leaf emergence) to Gmax (Flowering and Grain filling), Phase-III: Gmax (Flowering and Grain filling) to G2 (Dough Stage) and Phase-IV: G2 (Dough Stage) to G3 (Physiological Maturity). The temporal changes in the NDVI was analysed by computing the Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) between different phenological phases from G0 to G3. Mean TNPI values of wheat crop for different phenological phases were computed which indicated that rising part of NDVI profile of growth phases from G0 to Gmax higher TNPI values whereas the declining part of NDVI profile of growth phases from Gmax to G3 showed lower TNPI values. The difference NDVI images were generated using the NDVI images of two different phenological phases of wheat crop which represent the temporal changes in wheat crop greenness, where “0” represents no temporal change and “1” represents the maximum temporal change in vegetation greenness across wheat crop areas in the study area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","Normalized Difference VVegetation II IIndex (NDVI); Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data; Temporal NDVI profile; Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093655104"

Automated water segmentation of satellite imagery has traditionally been achieved using spectral indices. Spectral water segmentation is limited by environmental factors and requires human expertise to be applied effectively. In recent years, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN’s) for water segmentation has been successful when used on high-resolution satellite imagery, but to a lesser extent for medium resolution imagery. Existing studies have been limited to geographically localized datasets and reported metrics have been benchmarked against a limited range of spectral indices. This study seeks to determine if a single CNN based on Red, Green, Blue (RGB) image classification can effectively segment water on a global scale and outperform traditional spectral methods. Additionally, this study evaluates the extent to which smaller datasets (of very complex pattern, e.g harbour megacities) can be used to improve globally applicable CNNs within a specific region. Multispectral imagery from the European Space Agency, Sentinel-2 satellite (10 m spatial resolution) was sourced. Test sites were selected in Florida, New York, and Shanghai to represent a globally diverse range of waterbody typologies. Region-specific spectral water segmentation algorithms were developed on each test site, to represent benchmarks of spectral index performance. DeepLabV3-ResNet101 was trained on 33,311 semantically labelled true-colour samples. The resulting model was retrained on three smaller subsets of the data, specific to New York, Shanghai and Florida. CNN predictions reached a maximum mean intersection over union result of 0.986 and F1-Score of 0.983. At the Shanghai test site, the CNN’s predictions outperformed the spectral benchmark, primarily due to the CNN’s ability to process contextual features at multiple scales. In all test cases, retraining the networks to localized subsets of the dataset improved the localized region’s segmentation predictions. The CNN’s presented are suitable for cloud-based deployment and could contribute to the wider use of satellite imagery for water management. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Florida [United States]; New York [United States]; Shanghai; United States; Florida; Benchmarking; Convolution; Forecasting; Image segmentation; Satellite imagery; Statistical tests; Water management; Contextual feature; Environmental factors; European Space Agency; High resolution satellite imagery; Multi-spectral imagery; Resolution imagery; Segmentation algorithms; Spatial resolution; artificial neural network; environmental factor; image resolution; satellite imagery; Sentinel; water management; Convolutional neural networks","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105057000"

In the past two decades, the water environment of Honghu Lake has been suffering from serious deterioration due to the rapid development of agriculture and industry in the urbanization of surrounding areas. Under the combined effect of multiple non-point source pollution and point source pollution, cyanobacteria blooms often occur here. As a proxy of eutrophication, chlorophyll-A (Chl-A) has been considered to be an important indicator of water quality parameters. For better understanding of the change of the water quality of Honghu Lake, an improved empirical model for estimating chlorophyll-A concentrations (Chl-A) from different multi-spectral satellites images was established and validated. (1) We combined the results of two-band algorithms(2BDA), three-band algorithms(3BDA), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) and fluorescence line height (FLH) into support vector machine model (SVM) for better multi-nonlinear relationship establishment between Chl-A concentration and surface water reflectance, which acquired higher model accuracy.(2) Based on the long-Term time series data derived from Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, the variation of Chl-A concentration of Honghu Lake over long term was obtained. (3) Our results demonstrate that the average chlorophyll concentration has been at a very high level and showing an increasing tendency in recent years, which may indicate the eutrophication in the Honghu Lake is still getting worse.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Combined microwave and optical data have been widely used to improve the accuracy of SSM retrievals. However, the influence of vegetation indices derived from the red-edge spectral bands of multi-spectral optical data on retrieval accuracy has not been sufficiently analyzed. In this study, we retrieved soil moisture from wheat-covered surfaces using Sentinel-1/2 data. First, a modified water cloud model (WCM) was proposed to remove the influence of vegetation from the backscattering coefficient of the radar data. The vegetation fraction (FV) was then introduced in this WCM, and the vegetation water content (VWC) was calculated using a multiple linear regression model. Subsequently, the support vector regression technique was used to retrieve the SSM. This approach was validated using in situ measurements of wheat fields in Hebi, located in northern Henan Province, China. The key findings of this study are: (1) Based on vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 data, the proposed VWC estimation model effectively eliminated the influence of vegetation; (2) Compared with vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarization, vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarization was better for detecting changes in SSM key phenological phases of wheat; (3) The validated model indicates that the proposed approach successfully retrieved SSM in the study area using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. © 2021 by the authors.

They are defined as “a collection of beauty, icon of well-being, model of sustainability, but abandoned”. This study investigates the changes in the urban landscape of Nicosia, a particular historical centre in the Mediterranean region (Cyprus). The city centre is characterised by excep-tionally well-preserved Venetian fortifications. Due to political circumstances, the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia, is still divided and has been ruled by two different administrations for several decades.

In this study, we sought to determine the value of S1 and S2 data characteristics in discriminating and mapping commercial forest species. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm, S2 multi-spectral imagery showed an overall classification accuracy of 84% (kappa = 0.81), with bands such as the red-edge (703.9–740.2 nm), narrow near infrared (835.1–864.8 nm), and short wave infrared (1613.7–2202.4 nm) particularly influential in discriminating individual forest species stands.

Although the systematic band‐to‐band registration conducted during the image production process corrects most BBMR errors, there are still quite a few images being observed with discernible BBMR. Thus, a quick BBMR detection method is needed to assess the quality of online RS products. We here propose a hybrid framework for detecting BBMR between the visible bands in MSI images. This framework comprises three main steps: first, candidate chips are captured based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) spatial analysis functions to shrink the valid areas inside image scenes as potential target chips. The redundant data pertaining to the local operation process are thus narrowed down. Second, spectral abnormal areas are precisely extracted from inside every single chip, excluding the influences of clouds and water surfaces. Finally, the abnormal areas are matched pixel by pixel between bands, and the best‐fit coordinates are then determined to compare with tolerance. Here, the proposed method was applied to 71,493 scenes of MSI Level‐1C images covering China and its surrounding areas on the GEE platform. From these images, 4356 chips from 442 scenes were detected with inter-band offsets among the visible bands. Further manual visual inspection revealed that the proposed method had an accuracy of 98.07% at the chip scale and 88.46% at the scene scale. © 2021 by the authors.

The results revealed that the multi-temporal coherence approach has the promising capability to map building damage but is not as accurate for detecting building damage under a vegetation canopy. Meanwhile, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) still provides meaningful damage maps independent of the canopy, however, the accuracy was slightly lower than the multi-temporal coherence approach for the buildings not covered by the canopy. Nonetheless, we observed that the multi-temporal coherence methods better classified the damage severity than the NBR method.

Timely and accurate estimation of CRC at regional scale is essential for understanding the ecosystem condition and interactions with the surrounding environment. Satellite remote sensing is an effective method of regional CRC estimation. Tillage indices based on multi-spectral satellite imagery data are commonly used in CRC estimation. However, this method is ineffective in high coverage areas due to ""saturation"". Previous studies have shown that a combination of image spectral and textural information can solve saturation problems to a certain extent. Sentinel-2 is a new satellite mission that can provide observations at multi-spectral bands with spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 60 m. Sentinel-2 can provide more information about texture compared with the commonly used multi-spectral satellite Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager. Therefore, exploring the potential of combining spectral and textural information from Sentinel-2 data is an important task in CRC estimation. The objectives of this study are to (1) analyze correlation between field measured CRC and satellite-derived variables such as Sentinel-2 band reflectance, tillage indices, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix statistics in different windows, and (2) determine the optimal CRC estimation method from optimal subset regression with various combinations of tillage indices and image textural features. The results showed that the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), B12_CO (contrast of band12, B12 in window 5×5), and B12_DI (dissimilarity of B12 in window 5×5) were significantly correlated with the measured CRC with correlation coefficient R values of 0.765, -0.641, -0.553. The estimation model based on NDTI outperformed the models based on other single variables. The model that combined the spectral and textural information in an optimal window (R=0.869, RMSE=11.0%) provided a more precise result than that based solely on spectral information (R=0.775 and RMSE=14.5%). The results demonstrated that a combination of spectral and textural information can improve the accuracy of CRC estimation. © 2020, Science Press.

Tailings excavated from a large open pit zinc mine in the center of the city have been aggregated in four large stockpiles within close proximity to neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals. Visual comparison of ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) imagery from 2001 and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2018 suggests a size increase in one tailing stockpile in particular near the neighborhood of Paragsha. Due to ongoing mining efforts, the hypothesis motivating the work presented here is that Pb-bearing minerals would be detectable through multispectral analysis, an increase in Pb mineral percent abundance would be observed and tailing stockpile volume would be detectable between 2001 and 2016. This hypothesis is tested using Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Adaptive Coherence Estimator (ACE), and Jeffries-Matusita distance calculation on ASTER (2001) and Sentinel-2 (2018) VNIR and SWIR bands. Volume and area estimate of tailing stockpiles were calculated using a photogrammetrically derived point cloud. SAM detected the presence of five Pb-bearing minerals around Cerro de Pasco and Paragsha. The results of the temporal SAM analysis displayed an increase of approximately 17% of Pb-bearing minerals around the greater Cerro de Pasco city area and approximately 11% for the neighborhood of Paragsha. Jeffries-Matusita distance results suggest clear correlation between contamination sources and affected locations. Total tailing stockpile volume was measured to be approximately 200,300,000 m3. Volume for Pile 4 was estimated to have increased by approximately 46,000,000 m3 between 2001 and 2018. These presented results will hopefully inspire and guide future remote sensing campaigns, perhaps involving a UAV or aircraft-based hyperspectral instrument. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cerro de Pasco; Pasco; Peru; Contamination; Minerals; Open pit mining; Remote sensing; Water resources; Zinc mines; copper; iron; lead; silver; zinc; Adaptive coherence estimator; Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer; ASTER; Hyperspectral instrument; Multi-spectral analysis; Pb contamination; Remote sensing campaigns; Sentinel-2; ASTER; lead; remote sensing; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; Article; concentration (parameter); contamination; controlled study; human impact (environment); image analysis; image reconstruction; mine tailings; mining; Peru; photogrammetry; priority journal; satellite imagery; spectroscopy; three dimensional imaging; X ray fluorescence spectrometry; Piles","ASTER; Multispectral analysis; Pb contamination; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076468237"

In support of this effort, the team curated a custom multispectral dataset of coca fields in WorldView-3 imagery, starting with Sentinel-2 annotations provided by expert image analysts. We present baseline land cover classification results using traditional methods, and compare these results to detection metrics obtained with Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN.

Mean average precision metrics indicate that the standard RGB imagery outperforms false-color imagery.

Traditionally, maps have been created using field-based approaches which, due to limitations in costs and time, restrict the size of the area for which they can be created and frequency at which they can be updated. With the increasing availability of satellite sensors providing multi-spectral imagery with high temporal frequency, new methods for efficient and accurate vegetation mapping have been developed. The objective of this study was to investigate to what extent multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery can assist in mapping complex compositional classifications at fine spatial scales. We deliberately chose a challenging case study, namely a visually and structurally homogenous scrub vegetation (known as kwongan) of Western Australia. The classification scheme consists of 24 target classes and a random 60/40 split was used for model building and validation. We compared several multi-temporal (seasonal) feature sets, consisting of numerous combinations of spectral bands, vegetation indices as well as principal component and tasselled cap transformations, as input to four machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machines; SVM, Nearest Neighbour; NN, Random Forests; RF, and Classification Trees; CT) to separate target classes. The results show that a multi-temporal feature set combining autumn and spring images sufficiently captured the phenological differences between the classes and produced the best results, with SVM (74%) and NN (72%) classifiers returning statistically superior results compared to RF (65%) and CT (50%). The SWIR spectral bands captured during spring, the greenness indices captured during spring and the tasselled cap transformations derived from the autumn image emerged as most informative, which suggests that ecological factors (e.g. shared species, patch dynamics) occurring at a sub-pixel level likely had the biggest impact on class confusion. However, despite these challenges, the results are auspicious and suggest that seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery has the potential to predict compositional vegetation classes with high accuracy. Further work is needed to determine whether these results are replicable in other vegetation types and regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Western Australia; imagery; multispectral image; phenology; Sentinel; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; vegetation type","Mapping; Multispectral; Phenology; Tasselled cap; Vegetation classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081916210"

This study examines the accuracy of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery when estimating biophysical properties of savannah grasses. Six commonly used vegetation indices utilising spectral ranges covered by the MSI were derived from a satellite image coinciding with a field campaign. The imaging and fieldwork dates were at the end of the growing season, at peak grass productivity. Two common grass species were selected for sampling: one broad-leaved, the other narrow-leaved. At widely spread sampling sites under different grazing intensities, five plants with no external manifestation of infection and in close proximity were selected for each species. From each species 35 foliar and 10 stem reflectance measurements were collected using a spectroradiometer which sensed in the 350–2500 nm range in 1.1–1.4 nm bandwidths. The reflectance was later averaged to generate one reflectance profile per species per sampling site. The leaves and stems from which reflectance was measured were collected for laboratory analysis to determine macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) concentrations. At three sites where sampling coincided with sunny weather during the satellite overpass window of 09:30–10:30 AM local time, above canopy grass reflectance was measured at ground resolution distance (GRD) of 1 m. Some reflectance was collected within 10 min of image acquisition, which facilitated comparison. The image data were corrected to bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance using the Sent2Cor algorithm whose output included 20 m GRD visible, red edge, near- and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands, which were used for the respective vegetation indices. The plant level and above canopy reflectance were resampled to the spectral ranges of the MSI bands, and values of the respective indices computed. Plant level values of three red edge indices, which collectively indicated green biomass and chlorophyll, had the strongest significant correlation with N concentrations in both grass species (r = 0.473–0.561; p < 0.01). P and K concentrations had low correlations with the tested indices. Largely due to canopy background reflectance, the above canopy and image-derived vegetation index values differed from corresponding plant level values by up to 9% and 40%, respectively. Despite the attenuation, the Red Edge Chlorophyll Index, Red Edge Inflection Point and a devised SWIR ratio index (ρ1650 nm/ρ2200 nm) showed potential for monitoring relative chlorophyll and green biomass (indicated by N concentrations), Ca and Mg content of savannah grass using Sentinel-2 MSI images. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Poaceae; Chlorophyll; Edge detection; Infrared radiation; Vegetation; Biophysical properties; Canopy reflectance; Ground resolution; Laboratory analysis; Red edge inflection points; Short wave infrared bands; Spectro-radiometers; Vegetation index values; algorithm; biomass; chlorophyll; correlation; leaf; multispectral image; satellite imagery; savanna; Sentinel; stem; vegetation index; Reflection","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077960910"

However; the spatial consistency and radiometric quality of data from such sensors is relatively poorly explored beyond the lab; in operational settings and against other sensors. This study explores the extent to which accurate hemispherical-conical reflectance factors (HCRF) and vegetation indices (specifically: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and chlorophyll red-edge index (CHL) can be derived from a low-cost multispectral drone-mounted sensor (Parrot Sequoia). The drone datasets were assessed using reference panels and a high quality 1 m resolution reference dataset collected near-simultaneously by an airborne imaging spectrometer (HyPlant). Relative errors relating to the radiometric calibration to HCRF values were in the 4 to 15% range whereas deviations assessed for a maize field case study were larger (5 to 28%). Drone-derived vegetation indices showed relatively good agreement for NDVI with both HyPlant and Sentinel 2 products (R2 = 0.91). The HCRF; NDVI and CHL products from the Sequoia showed bias for high and low reflective surfaces. The spatial consistency of the products was high with minimal view angle effects in visible bands. In summary; compact multi-spectral sensors such as the Parrot Sequoia show good potential for use in index-based vegetation monitoring studies across scales but care must be taken when assuming derived HCRF to represent the true optical properties of the imaged surface. © 2020 by the authors.","Birds; Calibration; Chlorophyll; Optical properties; Radiometry; Reflection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Airborne imaging spectrometers; Maize; Multi-spectral; Ndvi; Normalised difference vegetation index; Operational conditions; Parrot sequoia; Radiometric calibrations; Drones","Calibration; Chlorophyll; Drone; Maize; Multispectral; Ndvi; Parrot sequoia; Reflectance; Uav; Vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080883824"

To assist the non-profit group to map the locations of Maasailand boma, we have investigated different types of remote sensing data and deep neural networks that can be applied for broad area search through satellite imagery. Our area of interest encompasses over 3900 square kilometers of Maasailand, where we have manually identified 635 boma homesteads for ground-truth. In this work, we evaluated the application of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery on automatic boma mapping using the ProxylessNAS model. Specifically, we evaluated Sentinel-2 data at different scales for level-1C and level-2A products. Additionally, we extended the ProxylessNAS model to accommodate 4-band full multi-spectral imagery from the sensor. We investigated the 4-band variations that add the near infrared channel to the traditional RGB using the extended ProxylessNAS model. The highest preliminary cross-validation scores using Sentinel-2-1C data and Sentinel-2-2A data are 73.42% and 73.19% respectively.

Moreover, the northeastern part of the Himalaya, severely affected by landslides every monsoon, is poorly studied. The information on the inventories is inhomogeneous and lacking. In this context, satellite-based earth observation data, which has significantly advanced in the last decade and often serves as a potential source for data collection, monitoring, and damage assessment for disasters in a short time span, has been implemented. Keeping in mind the above framework, this study aims to exploit the potentials of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for identifying new landslides in vegetated and hilly areas of the northeastern part of India. In order to assess the potentials of our data and methodology, a landslide event which occurred on 13 August 2016 13:30 h (IST) in North Sikkim, India, triggered due to rainfall has been explored in detail. The landslide also resulted in the formation of a lake, 2.2 km in length and 290 m in width. Difficulty in procurement of cloud-free datasets immediately after the event led us to the use of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data, to assess its potential for this purpose. It is observed that the potential of SAR amplitude imagery is limited to different aspects as per the sensor look direction during the mode of acquisition. Furthermore, the present study also incorporates a change detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of the Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP) model to identify new landslides using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Overall, the results exhibit that integrated usage of both optical and SAR amplitude imagery may provide a plethora of information for identification and mapping of new landslides for damage assessment and early warning. All the above results combined together suggest this method for rapid identification of landslides in the Himalayan terrain with special emphasis on the northeastern part of the Himalaya. The automation of this method for future operational usage is also suggested. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Environmental Monitoring; India; Landslides; Radar; Sikkim; Himalayas; India; Sikkim; Damage detection; Disasters; Landslides; Mapping; Synthetic aperture radar; rain; Change detection algorithms; Climatic conditions; Damage assessments; Landslide identification; Multi-spectral imagery; Rapid identification; Satellite based Earth observation; Tectonic deformations; algorithm; geological mapping; landslide; multispectral image; radar imagery; rainfall; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; trigger mechanism; Article; automation; detection algorithm; environmental exploitation; environmental monitoring; fluorescence imaging; information processing; landslide; multispectral imaging; natural disaster; satellite imagery; Sikkim; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation; India; telecommunication; Radar imaging","Himalaya; Landslide; Look direction; Sudden Landslide Identification Product; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107288938"

The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as “standard” or as “test” quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as “standard” at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution. © 2021 The Author(s)","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Image acquisition; Infrared devices; Rock mechanics; Constellation; Cubesats; Global coverage; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observation; Overpass time; Planetscope; Revisit interval; Temporal availability; Three sensors; global change; ground control; histogram; image analysis; Landsat; near infrared; satellite constellation; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; temporal variation; Orbits","Cloud; Constellation; CubeSats; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observations; Overpass time; PlanetScope; Revisit interval","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109568001"

Therefore, mapping HSE is critical for various environmental issues at local, regional, and even global scales. This paper presents a deep-learning-based framework to automatically map HSE from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data using regionally available geo-products as training labels. A straightforward, simple, yet effective fully convolutional network-based architecture, Sen2HSE, is implemented as an example for semantic segmentation within the framework. The framework is validated against both manually labelled checking points distributed evenly over the test areas, and the OpenStreetMap building layer. The HSE mapping results were extensively compared to several baseline products in order to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HSE mapping framework. The HSE mapping power is consistently demonstrated over 10 representative areas across the world. We also present one regional-scale and one country-wide HSE mapping example from our framework to show the potential for upscaling.

In riverine systems, biotic components like flora and fauna play critical roles in filtering water so it is available for human use and consumption. Preservation of ecosystems and associated ecosystem functions is therefore vital. In highly regulated large river basins, natural ecosystems are often supported through provision of environmental flows. Flow delivery, however, should be underpinned by rigorous monitoring to identify and prioritise biotic water requirements. Currently, large-scale monitoring solutions are scaled from remote sensing data via measurement of field evapotranspiration for woody tree vegetation species. However, as there is generally a mismatch between field data collection area and remote sensing pixel size, new methods are required to proportion tree evapotranspiration based on tree fractional canopy area per pixel. We present a novel method to derive tree fractional canopy cover (FTCC) at 20 m resolution in semi-arid and arid floodplain areas. The method employs LiDAR as a canopy area field measurement proxy (10 m resolution). We used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (radar and multispectral imagery) in a Random Forest analysis, undertaken to develop a predictive FTCC model trained using LiDAR for two regions in the Murray–Darling Basin. A predictor model combining the results of both regions was able to explain between 71%–85% of FTCC variation when compared to LiDAR FTCC when output in 10% increments. Development of this method underpins the advancement of woody vegetation monitoring to inform environmental flow management in the Murray–Darling Basin. The method and fine scale outputs will also be of value to other catchment management concerns such as altered catchment water yields related to bushfires and as such has application to water management worldwide. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Australia; Murray-Darling Basin; Catchments; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Pixels; Predictive analytics; Remote sensing; Runoff; Vegetation; Water management; Watersheds; Catchment management; Ecosystem functions; Field data collection; Field evapotranspiration; Large-scale monitoring; Multi-spectral imagery; Remote sensing data; River basin management; catchment; evapotranspiration; lidar; model test; pixel; prediction; radar; remote sensing; resource assessment; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral resolution; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation cover; water management; water quality; Optical radar","catchment water management; evapotranspiration; LiDAR; Murray–Darling basin; radar; SAR; sentinel; vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104963150"

The Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm (ToPeCAl) without longwave thermal infrared (TIR) (henceforth known as ToPeCAl-2) was tested on Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and then applied to Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The research is aimed at establishing peatland fire information at higher spatial resolution and more frequent observation than from Landsat-8 data over Indonesia’s peatlands. ToPeCAl-2 applied to Sentinel-2 was assessed by comparing fires detected from the original ToPeCAl applied to Landsat-8 OLI/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) verified through comparison with ground truth data. An adjustment of ToPeCAl-2 was applied to minimise false positive errors by implementing pre-process masking for water and permanent bright objects and filtering ToPeCAl-2’s resultant detected fires by implementing contextual testing and cloud masking. Both ToPeCAl-2 with contextual test and ToPeCAl with cloud mask applied to Sentinel-2 provided high detection of unambiguous fire pixels (>95%) at 20 m spatial resolution. Smouldering pixels were less likely to be detected by ToPeCAl-2. The detected smouldering pixels from ToPeCAl-2 applied to Sentinel-2 with contextual testing and with cloud masking were only 35% and 56% correct, respectively; this needs further investigation and validation. These results demonstrate that even in the absence of TIR data, an adjusted ToPeCAl algorithm (ToPeCAl-2) can be applied to detect peatland fires at 20 m resolution with high accuracy especially for flaming. Overall, the implementation of ToPeCAl applied to cost-free and available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data enables regular peatland fire monitoring in tropical environments at higher spatial resolution than other satellite-derived fire products. © 2020 by the authors.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the “Copernicus module” of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level. © 2020 The Author(s)","Germany; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica rapa; Helianthus; Hordeum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Biology; Land use; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Search engines; Sugar beets; Surface measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Land surface phenology; Mean absolute error; Multi-spectral data; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological observations; Spatial resolution imagery; Start of seasons (SOS); backscatter; data acquisition; error analysis; image resolution; phenology; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Crops","Agriculture; Crop phenology; DWD ground phenological observations; Europe; Land surface phenology; LUCAS survey; Satellite image time series; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097639924"

Through simple trigonometry this can give a clue about relative elevation change. These shadow ridges can be easily identified in multi-spectral satellite imagery as they are strong illumination changes in all spectral bands. Following shadow cast can be more complicated, due to different sun angles and changes in terrain slope. This results in a deformed appearance, which complicate tracking when simple pattern matching techniques are used. In this contribution we explore two affine matching methods in both the spatial and frequency domain, to increase the matching success of shadow cast on mountain glaciers.  © 2021 IEEE.","Frequency domain analysis; Landforms; Least squares approximations; Satellite imagery; Affine fourier; Affine matching; Elevation data; Fourier; Glacier elevation retrieval; Least square matching; Matching methods; Pattern-matching; Sentinel-2; Simple++; Pattern matching","affine Fourier; Glacier elevation retrieval; least squares matching; pattern matching; sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129830404"

Using the potential of earth observation data and remote sensing technologies provides an opportunity to address this environmental issue and makes it possible to identify salt-affected regions accurately. While most of the utilized methods and model development techniques for monitoring soil salinity to date have been globally considered and tried to detect salinity and create predictive maps with a single regression algorithm, fewer studies have investigated the potential of local models and weighted regression techniques for estimating soil salinity. Accordingly, this research deals with monitoring surface soil salinity by the potential of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery using the geographic weighted regression (GWR) technique. The field study was conducted in an area that has suffered from salinization, and the salinity of several soil samples was measured to be used as a source of ground truth data. The most efficient satellite features, which accurately predict surface soil salinity by its higher spectral reflectance, were derived from the Sentinel-2 data to be used as explanatory variables in the analysis. The GWR algorithm was then implemented with a fixed Gaussian kernel, and the optimized bandwidth was calculated in a calibration process using the cross-validation score (CV score). The results of the analysis proved that the GWR method has a great capability to predict soil salinity with an accuracy of two decimal places. The visual interpretation of the local estimates of coefficients and local t-values for each predictor variable has also been provided, which highlights the local variations in the study site. Finally, the achieved results were compared with the outcomes obtained from implementing two global regression techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which confirmed the higher performance of the GWR algorithm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Environmental technology; Linear regression; Remote sensing; Soils; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Earth observation data; Explanatory variables; Multi-spectral imagery; Multiple linear regressions; Regression algorithms; Remote sensing technology; Spectral reflectances; Visual interpretation; algorithm; detection method; environmental issue; natural hazard; regression analysis; remote sensing; salinity; satellite data; satellite imagery; support vector machine; Soil surveys","Geographic weighted regression; Local variation; Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery; Soil salinity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100076202"

They cause loss of biodiversity, land degradation & ecological imbalance. As the forest fires cause extreme damage to the habitat, it is of utmost necessity to assess the impact of fire on canopy/vegetation. Post-fire assessment is an essential element for finding the effects of fire on vegetation and implementing mitigation strategies. In this article, a Post-fire burn severity assessment was carried out with high-resolution multi-spectral images such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 employing Google Earth Engine (GEE) to locate the burnt areas and fire severity. Three commonly used fire severity indices based on pre-fire Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and post-fire NBR, namely differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), and Relativized dNBR (RdNBR) are computed and compared based on their accuracy with the active fire points provided by MODIS & VIIRS. Both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 exhibited a similar trend in mapping burn severity. The RdNBR resulted in high accuracy over heterogeneous landscapes with 61.52% for Sentinel-2 and 64.1% for Landsat-8 followed by dNBR (41.67% for Sentinel-2 and 47.44% for Landsat-8) and weak performance by RBR with 32.69% for Sentinel-2 and 26.92% for Landsat-8. Hence RdNBR burn severity maps are considered highly appropriate for mapping burnt areas. Even though severity analysis from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 is at an acceptable level, the Landsat based burn severity maps provided an adequate assessment of the degree of damage. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","forest fire; Landsat; landscape change; mapping method; MODIS; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software","Active fire points; Burnt area mapping; dNBR; Fire severity indices; Post‐fire mitigation; RBR; RdNBR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098797867"

The objectives of the study are to determine the area of burned areas from different time space images obtained from the satellite Sentinel-2 using a normalized burn ratio (NBR). Implemented researches show that the use of remote data of high periodicity and the presence of additional bands of surveying systems significantly expands the range of tasks that can be solved using them. Normalized burned ratio allows quickly and efficiently to identify and calculate the area damaged by fires, that gives possibility operatively assess the consequences of such fires and estimate the damage. It is established that in the studied area the accuracy of area calculation using the normalized burned ratio is 6.7% of the template area, which is sufficient for this type of task. © GeoTerrace 2021.All right reserved.","Fire hazards; Fires; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Space optics; Exclusion zones; Fire spread; Forest fires; Hotspots; Method of processing; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing data; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Space image; Deforestation","Forest fires; Remote sensing data; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126247168"

High-quality DEM is used as target data in the training of ANN. The trained ANN will then be ready to efficiently and effectively generate a high-quality DEM, at low cost, for places where ground truth DEM data is not available. In this paper, the performance of the DEM improvement scheme is evaluated over two dense urban cities, Nice (France) and Singapore; with the performance criteria using various matrices, e.g., visual clarity, scatter plots, root mean square error (RMSE) and flood maps.

Traditionally, it has been assumed that when a flow is recorded, there is water throughout that river. These assumptions have led to incorrect estimations of available water resources. This work thus aimed at developing a new spatially explicit framework, for monitoring river water availability in a N-PR system. The Tankwa River in South Africa was used for testing this approach. The length of the river reach with water was determined using the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data derived indices. Image thresholding was applied to Sentinel-1, and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) to Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 yielded an overall accuracy (OA) of 85%, whereas Sentinel-1 yielded an OA of 38%. The analysed reach of the Tankwa River had an actual length of 9 244 m. Based on the performance of Sentinel-2 data, further analysis was undertaken using Sentinel images acquired during the months of February, May and July of 2016. The results indicated that the lengths of the reaches of inundated Tankwa River were 2 809 m, 3 202 m and 2 890 m, respectively.

Consequently, instead of vicarious calibration once a year, more frequent calibration is required to guarantee its radiometric consistency. The cross-calibration method based on the Badain Jaran Desert site using the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model calculated by Landsat-8/OLI and ZY-3/Three-Line Camera (TLC) data is subsequently applied to GF-6/WFV and much higher frequencies of calibration are achieved. Finally, the cross-calibration results are validated using the synchronized ground measurements at Dunhuang test site and the uncertainty of the proposed method is analyzed. The validation shows that the relative difference of cross-calibration is less than 5% and it is satisfied with the requirements of cross-calibration. © 2020 by the authors.

Authors characterized the mineral phases present in soil A horizons at three different farms located in the Department of Tolima within the regions of Líbano and Villahermosa. Our analysis includes X-ray diffraction, Mössbauer spectroscopy, and remote sensing to discriminate the distribution of the different magnetic mineral phases. X-ray diffraction was used to identify the mineralogical properties of iron oxide such as hematite, goethite, and ferrihydrite (Fh), as well as tectosilicate minerals such as albite and sanidine. Mössbauer spectroscopy results for samples taken at room temperature indicate the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ mineral phases, which possibly correspond to ilmenite or magnetite. Finally, Sentinel-2A multi-spectral imager (MSI) data was used to map the distribution of iron oxides and study the influence of their distribution throughout the study area. A high correlation between Mössbauer spectroscopy and Sentinel-2A MSI data exists throughout the study area. The results suggest that farms close to the main Nevado del Ruíz Volcano have a more significant mineralogical variability. In contrast, more distant farms are characterized by soils with more iron oxides, the product of weathering, erosion, and human activities. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08–0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we investigated the use of multispectral imagery to monitor the winter evolution of land cover in the Albufera wetland (Spain), using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. With multispectral data, the frequency of observation is limited by the possible presence of clouds. To overcome this problem, the data acquired by the two missions, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, were jointly used, thus roughly halving the revisit time. The varied types of land cover were grouped into four classes: (1) open water, (2) mosaic of water, mud and vegetation, (3) bare soil and (4) vegetated soil. The automatic classification of the four classes was obtained through a rule-based method that combined the NDWI, MNDWI and NDVI indices. Point information, provided by geo-located ground pictures, was spatially extended with the help of a very high-resolution image (Ge-oEye-1). In this way, surfaces with known land cover were obtained and used for the validation of the classification method. The overall accuracy was found to be 0.96 and 0.98 for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively. The consistency evaluation between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 was performed in six days, in which acquisitions by both missions were available. The observed dynamics of the land cover were highly variable in space. For example, the presence of the open water condition lasted for around 60–80 days in the areas closest to the Albufera lake and progressively decreased towards the boundaries of the park. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using mod-erate-resolution multispectral images to monitor land cover changes in wetland environments. © 2021 by the authors.

To address this problem, an automatic distortion-suppressed time series fitting method for irregular sampled NDVI is proposed in this paper. First, the observation quality is evaluated: (I) the observations on a fully clear image are identified as clear observations. (II) According to the prior knowledge that the NDVI is underestimated, the observations in the upper convex hull and above the line of two temporal-adjacent clear observations (identified by fully clear image and upper convex) are labelled as clear observations. (III) As the temporal evolution of NDVI is a slow and continuous process, deep-V observations, which has experienced an abrupt decrease and increase consecutively, are identified as noisy observations. Second, different weights are assigned to observations based on the quality assessment result, and the NDVI time series is weighted fitted. To highlight the observations above the fitting line and suppress those below the fitting line, the weights are updated according to the direction and distance between the actual observation and fitting prediction value. Then, fitting and reweighting processes are repeated until a stable fitting result is obtained. We use images acquired by the Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellite in Shouxian, Anhui Province to construct NDVI time series and test the method. The result demonstrates that our method can suppress the distortion and realize time series fitting automatically, compared with the state of art method, our method can obtain reasonably overestimation of the NDVI, providing an alternative for fitting irregular sampled NDVI. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anhui; China; Shouxian; Continuous time systems; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Continuous process; Discrete time series; Multi spectral imager; Observation qualities; Remote sensing images; State-of-art methods; Temporal evolution; Timeseries Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); image analysis; NDVI; noise; numerical model; remote sensing; Sentinel; time series; Time series","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087590685"

The oil spills pose and cause severe and long-term effect havoc on mangrove forests that sustain them. Previous research has found that satellite remote sensing technologies are one of the most effective techniques to detect oil spills and assess the health of mangrove forests in contaminated areas. This study utilized the Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images from dualpolarized Sentinel-1 and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) from Sentinel-2 to study the impact of oil spills on Mangrove Forest in Pantai Cermin, Negeri Sembilan. The Random Forest classification was used to detect the oil spill areas, while vegetation indices were used to assess the impact of oil pollution on mangrove forests in the early stages. Analysis from Sentinel1 imagery shows that the oil spill could be accurately detected using the Random Forest classifer with accuracy of 76%. Spectral indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was explored and evaluated to study the health of mangrove forest after the oil spills event. It is found that the oil spills have caused physical suffocation as well as toxicological effects to the mangrove forests. © 2021 IEEE.","Decision trees; Forestry; Oil spills; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Contaminated areas; Long-term effects; Mangrove forest; Remote sensing technology; Remote-sensing; Satellite remote sensing; Sea surfaces; Sentinel 2; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar images; Remote sensing","oil spill; remote sensing; sentinel 1; sentinel 2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130245326"

Characteristics such as ground sampling distance, resolution, number of bands and the information these bands convey are the keys to its accuracy. Random Forest is the most widely used approach but better and more modern alternatives do exist. In this paper, state-of-the-art methods are evaluated, consisting of semantic segmentation networks such as UNet and DeepLabV3+. In addition, two datasets based on aircraft and satellite imagery are generated as a new state of the art to test land use classification. These datasets, called UOPNOA and UOS2, are publicly available. In this work, the performance of these networks and the two datasets generated are evaluated. This paper demonstrates that ground sampling distance is the most important factor in obtaining good semantic segmentation results, but a suitable number of bands can be as important. This proves that both aircraft and satellite imagery can produce good results, although for different reasons. Finally, cost performance for an inference prototype is evaluated, comparing various Microsoft Azure architectures. The evaluation concludes that using a GPU is unnecessarily costly for deployment. A GPU need only be used for training. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

In the past, this problem has been addressed by adapting computer vision approaches to GIS data with significant recent contributions to the field. But when trying to adapt these models to Sentinel-2 multi-spectral satellite imagery these approaches fall short. Previously, researchers used transfer learning methods trained on ImageNet and constrained the 13 channels to 3 RGB ones using existing training sets, but this severely limits the available data that can be used for complex image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks. To address this deficit, we present Distil, and demonstrate a specific method using our system for training models with all available Sentinel-2 channels. There currently is no publicly available rich labeled training data resource such as ImageNet for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery that covers the entire globe. Our approach using the Distil system was: A) pre-Training models using unlabeled data sets and b) adapting to specific downstream tasks using a small number of annotations solicited from a user. We discuss the Distil system, an application of the system in the remote sensing domain, and a case study identifying likely locust breeding grounds in Africa from unlabeled 13-channel satellite imagery.  © 2021 SPIE.","Classification (of information); Image segmentation; Machine learning; Object detection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Building machines; Data set; GIS data; Images classification; Labeled data; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multispectral satellite imagery; Remote-sensing; Training model; Image classification","Image Classification; Machine Learning; Remote Sensing; Satellite Imagery","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118574619"

First, a S2 monodate classification is studied with the seasonal effect. Secondly S2 time series were used, with different attribute combinations integrating the NDVI. Results showed a high accuracy improvement with S2 time series (up to +0.14). Two classifiers were tested; support vector machines and Random forests.

We present a methodology developed to characterize spatial and temporal variations of Secchi depth and diffuse attenuation coeffcient (both related to dissolved/suspended particles and to water transparency), using high spatial resolution satellite images from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). Empirical relations between satellite retrievals of surface reflectances and in situ measurements of water parameters were defined and applied to the entire reservoir for spatial and temporal analysis in the period July 2017-June 2019, useful in the identification of microalgae blooms and rapid variations in water characteristics, which allowed us to differentiate five zones. Water estimates with lower transparency and higher attenuation of radiation were found in the northern area of Alqueva reservoir during the months characterized by higher water temperatures, with Secchi depth monthly averages near 1.0 m and diffuse attenuation coeffcient near or above 1.5 m1. Satellite retrievals of water with greater transparency in the reservoir were obtained in the southern area in months with low water temperature and atmospheric stability, presenting some monthly Secchi depth averages above 3 m, and diffuse attenuation coeffcient below 0.8 m-1 . January 2018 presented great transparency of water with a Secchi depth of 7.5 m for pixels representing the 95th percentile and diffuse attenuation coeffcient of 0.36 m for pixels representing the 5th percentile in the Southern region. © 2020 by the authors.","Algae; Microorganisms; Pixels; Satellites; Temperature; Transparency; Turbidity; Water quality; Water resources; Alqueva; Atmospheric stability; High spatial resolution; Micro-algae; Sen2Cor; Spatial and temporal analysis; Spatial and temporal variation; Temporal and spatial variation; Reservoirs (water)","6SV; Alqueva reservoir; Microalgae; Sen2Cor; Turbidity; Water quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081892279"

SDB can efficiently fill data gaps obtained from traditional measurements with echo sounding. However, it still requires numerous training data, which is not available in many areas. Furthermore, the accuracy problem still arises considering the linear model could not address the non-relationship between reflectance and depth due to bottom variations and noise. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) offers the ability to capture the connection between neighbouring pixels and the non-linear relationship. These CNN characteristics make it compelling to be used for shallow water depth extraction. We investigate the accuracy of different architectures using different window sizes and band combinations. We use Sentinel-2 Level 2A images to provide reflectance values, and Lidar and Multi Beam Echo Sounder (MBES) datasets are used as depth references to train and test the model. A set of Sentinel-2 and in-situ depth subimage pairs are extracted to perform CNN training. The model is compared to the linear transform and applied to two other study areas. Resulting accuracy ranges from 1.3m to 1.94m, and the coefficient of determination reaches 0.94. The SDB model generated using a window size of 9x9 indicates compatibility with the reference depths, especially at areas deeper than 15m. The addition of both short wave infrared bands to the four visible bands in training improves the overall accuracy of SDB. The implementation of the pre-trained model to other study areas provides similar results depending on the water conditions. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

Despite the great potential for vegetation and land cover studies, there are few studies examining the LSMM efficiency for optically complex inland waters. In addition, LSMM-derived images have shown a promising application in water quality mapping. In this context, Mirim lagoon (Brazil) presents seasonal variability of suspended solids (SS) influenced by sediment yield from tributaries and surrounding areas (e.g.: croplands). While negative impact on water quality makes relevant the SS mapping for management of this ecosystem, there is no studies using remote sensoing in this lagoon. This study develops an empirical model for SS concentration in the Northern Mirim lagoon using Sentinel-2 MSI images. The framework applies the linear spectral mixing algorithm in two MSI images and the empirical model was developed using the multiple linear regression. We validated the model performance using Monte Carlo simulation method. The mapping of SS was satisfactory in both images: the estimated concentrations are consistent with in-situ measurements. The results show that LSMM application supports the mapping of SS and its spatial distribution. Finally, this study is the first application of Sentinel-2 MSI images in the Mirim lagoon and the results present the potential of this empirical modelling for sediment mapping. The spatial information supports the local managers to understand the sources of degradation of water quality and protect this aquatic ecosystem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","LSMM; Mirim lagoon; Multi-spectral imagery; Sentinel-2 MSI; Water quality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089817817"

SBW occurrence as well as the extent and severity of its damage are highly dependent on the characteristics of the forests and the availability of host species namely, spruce (Picea sp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Remote sensing satellite imagery represents a valuable data source for seamless regional-scale mapping of forest composition. This study developed and evaluated new models to map the distribution and abundance of SBW host species at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery in combination with several site variables for a total of 191 variables in northern New Brunswick, Canada using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found Sentinel-2 multi-temporal single spectral bands and numerous spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) yielded the classification of SBW host species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 72.6% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.65. Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 variables coupled with elevation, only marginally improved the performance of the model (OA: 73.0% and K: 0.66). The use of Sentinel-1 SAR data with elevation resulted in a reasonable OA of 57.5% and K of 0.47. These spatially explicit up-to-date SBW host species maps are essential for identifying susceptible forests, monitoring SBW defoliation, and minimizing forest losses from insect impacts at landscape scale in the current SBW outbreak in the region. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

These images, due to the open data distribution policy, are becoming an important resource for several applications. However, for small scale studies, the spatial detail of these images might not be sufficient. On the other hand, WorldView commercial satellites offer multi-spectral images with a very high spatial resolution, typically less than 2 m, but their use can be impractical for large areas or multi-temporal analysis due to their high cost. To exploit the free availability of Sentinel imagery, it is worth considering deep learning techniques for single-image super-resolution tasks, allowing the spatial enhancement of low-resolution (LR) images by recovering high-frequency details to produce high-resolution (HR) super-resolved images. In this work, we implement and train a model based on the Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) with pairs of WorldView-Sentinel images to generate a super-resolved multispectral Sentinel-2 output with a scaling factor of 5. Our model, named RS-ESRGAN, removes the upsampling layers of the network to make it feasible to train with co-registered remote sensing images. Results obtained outperform state-of-the-art models using standard metrics like PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS, SAM and CC. Moreover, qualitative visual analysis shows spatial improvements as well as the preservation of the spectral information, allowing the super-resolved Sentinel-2 imagery to be used in studies requiring very high spatial resolution. © 2020 by the authors.","Deep learning; Image analysis; Image resolution; Network layers; Open Data; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Commercial satellites; Data distribution policies; Low resolution images; Multi-temporal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Spectral information; Very high spatial resolutions; Image enhancement","Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Sentinel-2; Super-resolution; WorldView","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089853089"

Although urbanization leads to great social and economic progress, they may be confronted with other issues, including extra heat and air pollution. Local climate zone (LCZ), a new concept developed for urban heat island research, provides a standard classification system for the urban environment. LCZs are defined by the context of the urban environment; the minimum diameter of an LCZ is expected to be 400–1,000 m so that it can have a valid effect on the urban climate. However, most existing methods (e.g., the WUDAPT method) regard this task as pixel-based classification, neglecting the spatial information. In this study, we argue that LCZ mapping should be considered as a scene classification task to fully exploit the environmental context. Fifteen cities covering 138 million population in three economic regions of China are selected as the study area. Sentinel-2 multispectral data with a 10 m spatial resolution are used to classify LCZs. A deep convolutional neural network composed of residual learning and the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, namely the LCZNet, is proposed. We obtained an overall accuracy of 88.61% by using a large image (48×48 corresponding to 480×480 m2) as the representation of an LCZ, 7.5% higher than that using a small image representation (10×10) and nearly 20% higher than that obtained by the standard WUDAPT method. Image sizes from 32×32 to 64×64 were found suitable for LCZ mapping, while a deeper network achieved better classification with larger inputs. Compared with natural classes, urban classes benefited more from a large input size, as it can exploit the environment context of urban areas. The combined use of the training data from all three regions led to the best classification, but the transfer of LCZ models cannot achieve satisfactory results due to the domain shift. More advanced domain adaptation methods should be applied in this application. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Timely and accurate mapping of its spatial distribution and planting area is of great significance to local economy and ecology. As a special tree species planted in the Grain for Green Program of China, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture (Linxia) in Gansu Province of China has vigorously developed ZBM cultivation since the launch of the program. However, lacking the accurate ZBM planting information hinders the assessment of the benefits and losses of the program to local people. Therefore, this study investigated the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) to accurately map ZBM in the study area in 2019. We first investigated the classification accuracies of four alternative Random Forest (RF) classifications using either alone or in combination, spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and topographical variables. The importance of the three categories of features was examined based on the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) metric. The classification results with the most important features were further assessed for their consistency by considering the voting rates of 800 trees based on testing samples. Results show that the sole use of the spectral bands (40 input features) already achieves a satisfactory classification accuracy of 95.43%. Adding extra VIs and topographical variables further improves the results, but only to a small extent. However, certain VIs and topographic variables are far more effective in classification compared with the original spectral bands, especially the Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705) and Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI). The classification accuracy achieves nearly 95% when using only the top 15 most important features. The desirable periods for differencing of ZBM and other land cover types are fruit coloring and ripening periods. The final map shows that the ZBM planting in Linxia is mainly distributed along the Yellow River and around the Liujiaxia reservoir. The total mapped acreages of ZBM is 51,601 ha, covering 9.51% of the study area. 99% of ZBM tends to grow between 1500 and 2400 m altitude, and 67% of ZBM are planted in areas with slopes between 5 and 25°. Voting rates show that the percentages of classification results with strong and good consistency are generally over 70% for all land cover types, proving the derived land cover map's high credibility, including ZBM. Altogether, our results demonstrate the high potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in accurate mapping of ZBM, which can serve as a reference for other specialty crops or tree species. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, the characterization of the stack emission plume properties from in situ observations remains a challenging task. This paper focuses on the characterization of the aerosol properties of a steel plant stack plume through the use of hyperspectral (HS) airborne remote sensing imagery. We propose a new method, based on the combination of HS airborne acquisition and surface reflectance imagery derived from the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). The proposed method detects the plume footprint and estimates the surface reflectance under the plume, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT), and the modal radius of the plume. Hyperspectral surface reflectances are estimated using the coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) method combining HS and MSI data. The CNMF reduces the error associated with estimating the surface reflectance below the plume, particularly for heterogeneous classes. The AOT and modal radius are retrieved using an optimal estimation method (OEM), based on the forward model and allowing for uncertainties in the observations and in the model parameters. The a priori state vector is provided by a sequential method using the root mean square error (RMSE) metric, which outperforms the previously used cluster tuned matched filter (CTMF). The OEM degrees of freedom are then analysed, in order to refine the mask plume and to enhance the quality of the retrieval. The retrieved mean radii of aerosol particles in the plume is 0.125 µm, with an uncertainty of 0.05 µm. These results are close to the ultra-fine mode (modal radius around 0.1 µm) observed from in situ measurements within metallurgical plant plumes from previous studies. The retrieved AOT values vary between 0.07 (near the source point) and 0.01, with uncertainties of 0.005 for the darkest surfaces and above 0.010 for the brightest surfaces. © 2021 by the authors.

Various burned area detection methods have been developed using satellite remote sensing measurements with wide coverage and frequent revisits. Our study aims to expound on the capability of deep learning (DL) models for automatically mapping burned areas from uni-temporal multispectral imagery. Specifically, several semantic segmentation network architectures, i.e., U-Net, HRNet, Fast-SCNN, and DeepLabv3+, and machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to Sentinel-2 imagery and Landsat-8 imagery in three wildfire sites in two different local climate zones. The validation results show that the DL algorithms outperform the ML methods in two of the three cases with the compact burned scars, while ML methods seem to be more suitable for mapping dispersed burn in boreal forests. Using Sentinel-2 images, U-Net and HRNet exhibit comparatively identical performance with higher kappa (around 0.9) in one heterogeneous Mediterranean fire site in Greece; Fast-SCNN performs better than others with kappa over 0.79 in one compact boreal forest fire with various burn severity in Sweden. Furthermore, directly transferring the trained models to corresponding Landsat-8 data, HRNet dominates in the three test sites among DL models and can preserve the high accuracy. The results demonstrated that DL models can make full use of contextual information and capture spatial details in multiple scales from fire-sensitive spectral bands to map burned areas. Using only a post-fire image, the DL methods not only provide automatic, accurate, and bias-free large-scale mapping option with cross-sensor applicability, but also have potential to be used for onboard processing in the next Earth observation satellites. © 2021 by the authors.

The R-G-B representation obtained by mapping the visual bands to the R, G, and B channels is highly used due to its great resemblance with the natural color one and aspects perceivable by the human eye. However, despite the similarity in terms of color code, ambiguities between classes such as water and vegetation or atmospheric phenomena like fog, clouds, and smoke that have been penetrated by other bands, remain visible and hinder the process of visualization of the Earth surface. This article presents a set of five different methods to offset the effects caused by ambiguities, fog, light clouds, and smoke by transferring relevant information between bands in order to visually reconstitute those parts of the image affected by atmospheric phenomena. The general concept shared by these methods implies a stacked autoencoder that successfully encompasses the information from all spectral bands into a latent representation used for visualization. Each proposed method is defined by different combination of input and error function formula. Spectral and polar coordinates features represent the possible options for the input, while formulas based on mean squared error or angular spectral distances determine the potential choices in terms of error function definition. The property of angular spectral distance and polar coordinates transformation to obtain illuminant invariant features determined their use in three out of five methods. We evaluate the methods through spectral signature graphical comparison and visual comparison related to the R-G-B representation.

For instance, the Eucalyptus species are notoriously known for releasing toxic chemicals which impedes the growth of indigenous plants which usually results in severe erosion. It is, therefore, important and necessary to quantify and understand the spatial extent and distribution of these IAPs to identify critical hotspots for restoration. This study, therefore, tested the utility of Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data in distinguishing Eucalyptus community-woodlots from other land cover types with an aid of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. The results show that eucalyptus species were successfully discriminated from other land cover types with an overall accuracy (OA) of 85.07%.

The dataset includes imagery acquired from terrestrial hyperspectral imager (THI), airborne hyperspectral sensor (AVIRIS-NG), and space-borne multi-spectral (Sentinel-2) sensor on 20th March 2018. Five engineered targets of different materials and colours were placed on different surface backgrounds. Besides, in-situ reflectance spectra of the targets were also acquired using a spectroradiometer for serving as a spectral reference source. The airborne and space-borne imagery were processed to remove un-calibrated/noisy bands and were atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer method based Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model. The in-situ target reflectance spectra were resampled to spectrally match with airborne and space-borne imagery. Further, a target region of interest (ROI) was designated for each of the targets in both airborne and space-borne imagery using the known ground position of targets using a GPS device. This article provides a ground to space integrated target detection dataset, including ground positions ROI of the targets, point, and pixel-based in-situ target reference spectra, and the processed airborne and space-borne imagery to make the dataset ready for use. The data acquired in this experiment is an attempt to assess the potential of engineered material target detection in a multi-scale multi-platform view setup.

Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) is comprised of visible spectral bands, near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. These spectral bands, band 8A (865 nm), band 11 (at 1.61 μm), and band 12 (at 2.19 μm), are employed to roughly approximate the temperature within the forest fire range (400 - 1500°C) using Planck's blackbody radiation law. The Normalised Difference Indices (NDI) of band 11 with 8A and band 12 with 11 are formulated, namely NDI1 and NDI2, respectively. The criteria of NDI1, NDI2, and band 12 ranges are estimated empirically to identify forest fire area into four thermal anomaly levels, i.e., high-temperature crown fire, typical crown fire, surface fire or smoldering area and remains of the fire. For the high-temperature crown fire area, band 12 value is very high, all indices are positive, and the NDI2 is lower than NDI1, following Planck's curve for temperature higher than 1200 K. For the typical crown fire area, the band 12 value is high, and the NDI2 can be higher than NDI1. For the smolder area, the band 12 value is in the middle range, and the NDI2 must be larger than 0.2. Finally, for remains area, the band 12 value is in the lower range, and NDI1 must be higher than -0.27. This work shows that the active fire area can be identified and mapped into four thermal anomaly levels. This approach can be employed for rapid fire management as soon as the image data is obtained.  © 2020 IEEE.","Deforestation; Fire hazards; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Nondestructive examination; Blackbody radiation laws; Fire management; High temperature; Level algorithms; Multi-spectral; New approaches; Short wave infrared; Thermal anomalies; Fires","active fire mapping; fire management; forest fire; Planck's law; remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091865783"

In this context, we introduce the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery, with a medium spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, to estimate rice crop yields in Nepal as a case study. Firstly, we build a new large-scale rice crop database (RicePAL) composed by multi-temporal S2 and climate/soil data from the Terai districts of Nepal. Secondly, we propose a novel 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) adapted to these intrinsic data constraints for the accurate rice crop yield estimation.

Furthermore, our fusion approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in BUA mapping in the selected cities.

However, those methods suffer from high cost and cannot be used at large-scale nor frequently. In our study, we adopt a neural network architecture to estimate pixel-wise canopy height from cost-effective spaceborne imagery. A deep convolutional encoder-decoder network, based on the SegNet architecture together with skip connections, is trained to embed the multi-spectral pixels of a Sentinel-2 input image to height values via end-to-end learned texture features. Experimental results in a study area of 942 km2 yield similar or better estimation accuracy resolution in comparison with a method based on costly airborne images as well as with another state-of-the-art deep learning approach based on spaceborne images. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Decoding; Deep learning; Network architecture; Pixels; Remote sensing; Signal encoding; Textures; Accurate estimation; Airborne measurements; Convolutional encoders; Height estimation; Multimedia modeling; Remote sensing applications; Sustainable ecosystems; Very high resolution; Learning systems","Canopy height estimation; Convolutional encoder-decoder; Deep learning; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101629377"

However, spatially-continuous information on LCC variability at fine time-steps, and at fine spatial resolutions across regional spatial extents, is sparse. In this study, we improved a physically-based, two-step inversion approach by using an advanced canopy-to-leaf reflectance conversion model to estimate LCC at fine spatial resolution (20 m) from Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. The first step is to convert MSI canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance using look-up tables constructed from a geometric optical model (4-Scale). The second step is to estimate LCC from the modeled leaf reflectance using the PROSPECT-5 leaf optical model. Both leaf reflectance and LCC derived from MSI were validated against field measurements at a mixed temperate forest site in Canada to examine the accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) and LCC retrievals. The results demonstrate robust canopy-level inversions with strong relationships between measured and MSI-derived leaf reflectance (R2 = 0.995, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.0143). The modeled LCC results were also strong when compared to measured LCC samples: R2 = 0.849, p < 0.001, and RMSE = 0.304 μg/cm2, respectively. The most important Sentinel-2 MSI band for LAI and LCC derivation was centered at 705 nm (Band 5). Importantly, this two-step radiative transfer inversion approach substantially improved upon the current LAI and LCC algorithms adopted by the Sentinel-2 Application Platform, which underestimated LAI by 52.93% and overestimated LCC by 44.45%.

As a case study, the detection of volcanic eruptions has been investigated with the objective to swiftly produce alerts and allow immediate interventions. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been designed and realized from scratch, showing how to efficiently implement them for identifying the eruptions and at the same time adapting their complexity in order to fit on board requirements. The CNNs are then tested with experimental hardware, by means of a drone with a paylod composed of a generic processing unit (Raspberry PI), an AI processing unit (Movidius stick) and a camera. The hardware employed to build the prototype is low-cost, easy to found and to use. Moreover, the dataset has been published on GitHub, made available to everyone.

Most of the coastal shallow-water zones worldwide either remain unmapped or not updated. Bathymetry estimations from optical satellite imageries have been increasingly implemented as an alternative tool for traditional bathymetry surveys. In this study, we examine the usefulness of freely available, five-day revisit and relatively high-resolution Multi Spectral Instruments (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2A and 2B twin satellites. A process workflow has been developed which automatically incorporates a robust atmospheric correction through ACOLITE software and multi-scene compositing of several scenes to improve the reliability and no data gaps. Two study sites in India are explored owing to their variability in submarine morphology. High-resolution bathymetry maps are generated through a log-ratio transform model calibrated with minimal in situ data from the jet ski soundings. The satellite-derived bathymetry obtained has an overall bias of −0.01 and 0.02 m, and root mean square error of 1.09 and 0.93 m respectively, at two study sites up to 15 m depth. The consistency in bathymetry retrieval indicates a potential for automated application for the benefit of operational and scientific studies. These high-resolution maps capture small-scale nearshore features like sandbars and rip channels, which are of prime importance for coastal and beach managers. © 2020.

As these tailings have a wide spread distribution, it is important to characterize and estimate their impact on soil contamination. This study examines the potential of field hyperspectral spectroscopy and SENTINEL-2 Multispectral data in estimating and mapping seven minerals content, including three toxic minerals (fluorite, barite and sphalerite), within soils around Hammam Zriba mine in Northen Tunisia. 69 soil and dike surface samples were collected, field Visible, Near InfraRed (VNIR) and Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) reflectance spectra were measured on these surfaces. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used to identify the types of mineral and their associated contents on each collected soil samples. The mineral contents were predicted using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method using i) field VNIR-SWIR spectra at raw spectral resolution, ii) field VNIR-SWIR spectra aggregated to the SENTINEL-2 spectral resolution and then iii) SENTINEL-2 spectra. This study shows 1) an accurate prediction of four of the seven minerals using field VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy, 2) a slight decrease of performances due to spectral resolution degradation (SENTINEL-2 simulated spectra) and 3) a significant decrease of performances due to spatial resolution degradation, except for fluorite. This work paves the way for large-scale mapping of minerals with high pollution potential using SENTINEL-2 data.

The goal is to retrieve a spatially distributed and long-term time-series of slope movements in large-scale moderately rapid landslides. The short revisit time of Sentinel-2 satellites (5 days sinceMarch 2017 and 10 days before) increases the availability of cloud and snow free satellite acquisitions of the area of interest, which is a prerequisite for the extrapolation of slope movement time-series using DIC techniques. Despite the Sentinel-2 limited spatial resolution, the derived long time-series can be integrated with-and validated by-continuous GNSS monitoring data. This allows to effectively monitor landslide movements that are too fast for the application of interferometric approaches. In this study, we used the Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC) digital image correlation technique by 51 Sentinel-2 MSI scenes (band 4 with 10 m spatial resolution), acquired between 19 February 2016 and 16 July 2019, to derive the slope movement time-series of the Ca' Lita earthslide-earthflow in the northern Apennines (Italy). During the period considered, the landslide experienced two to three months-long phases of moderately rapid velocity (around 10 m/month) and, in between, prolonged periods of slow movements (approx. 10 cm/month). NCC results have been integrated with, and are compared to, time series from three continuous GNSS devices located in different geomorphic zones of the landslide. On this basis, the errors and limitations associated to NCC time series are analysed and discussed together with their advantages and potentialities for assessing the spatial distribution and monitoring slope movements during moderately rapid reactivation events. © 2020 by the authors.","Image analysis; Image resolution; Landslides; Monitoring; Satellites; Spatial distribution; Strain measurement; Time series; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Digital image correlation technique; Digital image correlations; Errors and limitations; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Landslide movements; Normalized cross correlation; Satellite acquisition; Global positioning system","Digital image correlation; GNSS; Italy; Landslides; Monitoring; Northern apennines; Sentinel-2 MSI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090015800"

Herein, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from in situ measurements and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images were used to estimate the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the largest black-water river of the Amazon basin. The Negro River exhibits extremely low Rrs values (<0.005 sr-1 at visible and near-infrared bands) due to the elevated absorption of coloured dissolved organic matter (aCDOM at 440 nm > 7 m-1) caused by the high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC > 7 mg L-1) and low SSC (<5 mg L-1). Interannual variability of Rrs is primarily controlled by the input of suspended sediments from the Branco River, which is a clear water river that governs the changes in the apparent optical properties of the Negro River, even at distances that are greater than 90 km from its mouth. Better results were obtained using the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band (Band 4 at 665 nm) in order to estimate the SSC, with an R2 value greater than 0.85 and an error less than 20% in the adjusted models. The magnitudes of water reflectance in the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band were consistent with in situ Rrs measurements, indicating the large spatial variability of the lower SSC values (0 to 15 mg L-1) in a complex anabranching reach of the Negro River. The in situ and satellite data analysed in this study indicates sedimentation processes in the lower Negro River near the Amazon River. The results suggest that the radiometric characteristics of sensors, like sentinel-2 MSI, are suitable for monitoring the suspended sediment concentration in large tropical black-water rivers. © 2021 by the authors.","","Anabranching; Black-water river; Floodplain; Fluvial archipelago; Inorganic sediment; Remote sensing reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104267696"

Species discrimination has shown promising results using both HyperSpectral (HS) and MultiSpectral (MS) images. Airborne HS instruments enable high spatial and spectral resolution imagery while time series of satellite MS images provide high temporal resolution and phenological information. This paper aims to compare supervised classification results obtained with non-parametric (Random Forest, RF, Support Vector Machine, SVM) and parametric methods (Regularized Logistic Regression, RLR) applied on both kinds of images acquired on an industrial brownfield. The studied site is a complex vegetated environment due to species diversity: 8 dominant species are retained. The performance obtained by preliminary feature selection based on principal component analysis and vegetation indices, to improve separability of spectral or temporal information according to species, is analysed. The best performance is obtained by RLR method applied on HS data without feature selection (global accuracy of 93 %). Feature selection is found to be a necessary step to perform classification with time series of MS images.

Satellite-based monitoring approaches offer an alternative to traditional field sampling measurements for detecting coral reef composition changes, especially given the advantages in their broad spatial coverage and high temporal frequency. However, the effect of benthic composition changes on water-leaving reflectance remains underexplored. In this study, we examined benthic change detection abilities of four representative satellite sensors: Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Planet Dove and SkySat. We measured the bottom reflectance of different benthic compositions (live coral, bleached coral, dead coral with algal cover, and sand) in the field and developed an analytical bottom-up radiative transfer model to simulate remote sensing reflectance at the water surface for different compositions at a variety of depths and in varying water clarity conditions. We found that green spectral wavelengths are best for monitoring benthic changes such as coral bleaching.

Traditional evaluation methods and manual on-site measurements are time-consuming and labor- and capital-intensive. In this study, a remote sensing model to distinguish lodging rice was constructed based on spectral and textural features. To accurately extract the area of lodging rice from high-resolution remote sensing images, this study used Sentinel-2 multispectral images taken on September 27, 2019, to study the spectral and textural characteristics of lodging rice, in Tongjiang City, Heilongjiang Province. Analysis of the surface reflectance of normal rice and lodged rice, showed that reflectance of eight bands, including visible light, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared, increased after rice lodging; the reflectance of shortwave infrared, red light, and red edge 1 increased by more than 0.06. Except for the difference vegetation index (DVI), the typical vegetation indices of lodged rice, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and red edge position index (REP), decreased. There were significant differences between lodging rice and normal rice in the mean texture feature values of the red band, red edge 1, and shortwave infrared; the largest difference was for the mean texture value of the red band. Therefore, in this study, normalized difference vegetation index, land surface water index (LSWI), ratio vegetation index, difference vegetation index, and texture mean of the red band were used to construct the decision tree classification model. The results of remote sensing monitoring showed that rice lodging on the farm was decentralized. The area of rice disaster was larger in the west and south and smaller in the north. There was no lodging rice in the middle of the north and the east. Compared with the measured area, the area recognition errors of normal and lodged rice were 3.33% and 2.23%, respectively. When using random verification samples and model verification results for the confusion matrix analysis, the user accuracy and mapping accuracy of lodging rice were 92.0%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.93. These results show that this method can be applied to remote sensing data from lodged rice in large areas and can provide a relevant basis for the investigation of rice lodging areas using high-resolution and multi-spectral remote sensing data. © 2021, Science Press.

Recent advances in machine learning bring a great potential for automatic river mapping using satellite imagery. Surface river mapping can provide accurate and timely water extent information that is highly valuable for solid policy and management decisions. However, accurate large-scale river mapping remains challenging given limited labels, spatial heterogeneity and noise in satellite imagery (e.g., clouds and aerosols). In this paper, we propose a new multi-source data-driven method for large-scale river mapping by combining multispectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar data. In particular, we build a multi-source data segmentation model, which uses contrastive learning to extract the common information between multiple data sources while also preserving distinct knowledge from each data source. Moreover, we create the first large-scale multi-source river imagery dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with 1013 handmade accurate river segmentation mask (which will be released to the public). In this dataset, our method has been shown to produce superior performance (F1score is 91.53%) over multiple state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms.

The overall accuracy for the forest/non-forest covers reached over 98% and declined to 75.75% for the sub classification of the forest types.

Within SDG-14, targets 14.1 and 14.2 deal with marine pollution and the adverse impacts of human activities on aquatic systems. Here, we present a remote-sensing-based analysis of short-term changes in the Vembanad-Kol wetland system in the southwest of India. The region has experienced high levels of anthropogenic pressures, including from agriculture, industry, and tourism, leading to adverse ecological and socioeconomic impacts with consequences not only for achieving the targets set out in SDG-14, but also those related to water quality (SDG-6) and health (SDG-3). To move towards the sustainable management of coastal and aquatic ecosystems such as Lake Vembanad, it is important to understand how both natural and anthropogenic processes affect water quality. In 2020, a unique opportunity arose to study water quality in Lake Vembanad during a period when anthropogenic pressures were reduced due to a nationwide lockdown in response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (25 March–31 May 2020). Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multi-spectral remote sensing and in situ observations to analyse changes in five different water quality indicators, we show that water quality improved in large areas of Lake Vembanad during the lockdown in 2020, especially in the more central and southern regions, as evidenced by a decrease in total suspended matter, turbidity, and the absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter, all leading to clearer waters as indicated by the Forel-Ule classification of water colour. Further analysis of longer term trends (2013–2020) showed that water quality has been improving over time in the more northern regions of Lake Vembanad independent of the lockdown. The improvement in water quality during the lockdown in April–May 2020 illustrates the importance of addressing anthropogenic activities for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources. © 2021 by the authors.

Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Learning systems; Optical resolving power; Spectroscopy; Earth observation data; Higher resolution images; Learning techniques; Multispectral images; Posterior analysis; Reference satellites; Spectral radiometry; Super-resolution models; Image enhancement","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Multi-spectral image; Sentinel-2; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091855430"

In this study, we highlight the potential of combined multi-spectral Sentinel-2 and fully polarimetric PALSAR-2 data for land cover classification in dense urban areas, based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. We classified differently combined spectral and back-scattering characteristics using the subspace method in comparison with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) methods. Results show that, (i) the overall accuracy (OA) was 65.9% for the Sentinel-2 data, (ii) higher OA (71.9%) was achieved by adding four intensity images of PALSAR-2 to Sentinel-2, (iii) the inclusion of decomposed components increased OA to 72.8%, and (iv) the highest OA (73.3%) was achieved using all features. These results suggest that the inclusion of different backscattering characteristics disproportionately improved classification accuracy from using multi-spectral data alone. The results of comparison between different methods show that the subspace method performed better than SVM and MLC, particularly when high-dimensional data were used. The subspace method classified particularly well for some specific LCZ classes which are easily mixed between each other. It provides a promising option for LCZ mapping. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","","Local Climate Zone; PALSAR-2; Polarimetric features; Sentinel-2; Shanghai; Subspace","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087061336"

However, estimating surface reflectance from the TOA reflectance satellite data requires knowledge about the state of the atmosphere (e.g., water vapor and ozone) and the contribution of aerosols to the atmospheric path radiance. Thus, obtaining precise measurements of these parameters, which is very difficult, is crucial for accurate estimation of surface reflectance. The SREM (Simplified and Robust Surface Reflectance Estimation Method) is a physical-based atmospheric correction method based on the Radiative transfer (RT) equations of the second simulation of the Satellite Signal in Solar Spectrum (6SV). Essentially the SREM is a simplified version of 6SV which does not require Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), aerosol type, water vapor, and ozone. An initial study showed accuracy comparable to the Landsat operational Surface Reflectance Products (SRProd) which is generated through different RT models using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data. To further validate the SREM under varying atmospheric conditions and at different spatial resolutions, an independent Reference Surface Reflectance (SRRef) dataset was generated using the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements as input to the 6SV RT model. The surface reflectances estimated by SREM (SRSREM) and SRProd from Planet Scope (PS, at 3 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 AB (S2AB) Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI, at 10 to 60 m spatial resolution), and Landsat-8 (L8) operational Land Imager (OLI, at 30 m spatial resolution) were validated against SRRef. Results showed that SRSREM performed similar to the SRProd of PS, S2AB MSI, and L8 OLI against SRRef. An inferior performance (R of 0.35 and 0.57) of L8 OLI's SRProd in the coastal blue (SB1) and blue (SB2) bands was observed, compared to SREM. The comparison of SRSREM with SRProd reveals the robustness of SREM, without using AOD, water vapor, and ozone data, for estimation of surface reflectance for all RT models tested. For some dates, SRRef and the SRProd under-corrected and produced higher values than the TOA reflectance, even when the atmosphere was clear but this was not the case for SREM. Analysis of surface reflectance estimation in shadowed areas revealed that the SRRef and SRProd had mainly negative values in coastal blue and blue bands for L8 OLI, while no negative SR value was observed for SREM in any band. These results recommend the utilization of SREM for the provision of surface reflectance products across a range of sensors © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosols; Image resolution; Ozone; Remote sensing; Satellites; Water vapor; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric path radiance; Operational land imager; Radiative transfer equations; Satellite remote sensing data; aerosol; atmospheric correction; atmospheric modeling; Landsat; radiative transfer; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; surface reflectance; top of atmosphere; Reflection","Atmospheric correction; Landsat-8 OLI; Sentinel-2 MSI; SREM; Surface reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092936291"

Five different water indices, including normalized difference water index (NDWI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), automated water extraction index for shadow (AWEIsh ) and non-shadow (AWEInsh ), tasseled cap wetness index (TCWI), and maximum likelihood classification methods were compared to evaluate the potential for mapping coastal lagoons. Additionally, spectral consistency of index algorithms was examined to introduce the coastal lagoon monitoring potential whereas cross-calibration analysis was carried out. Among the methods, the AWEInsh achieved quite better results compared with the other methods for mapping Enez Dalyan Lagoon while TCWI had relatively poor results independent from the sensors. AWEInsh had the strongest correlation with 0.989, while NDWI had the poorest correlation value as 0.966. Results pointed out the linear correlation and spectral consistency between almost all corresponding indices derived from the data of two sensors.

An established model for the estimation of the green area index (GAI) of winter wheat from a UAV-based multispectral camera was used to calibrate the Sentinel-2 data. Large independent datasets were used for evaluation purposes. Furthermore, the potential of the satellite-based GAI-predictions for crop monitoring and yield prediction was tested. Therefore, the total absorbed photosynthetic radiation between spring and harvest was calculated with satellite and UAV data and correlated with the final grain yield. Yield maps at the same resolution were generated by combining yield data on a plot level with a UAV-based crop coverage map. The best tested model for satellite-based GAI-prediction was obtained by combining the near-, infrared-and Red Edge-waveband in a simple ratio (R2 = 0.82, mean absolute error = 0.52 m2 /m2 ). Yet, the Sentinel-2 data seem to depict average GAI-developments through the seasons, rather than to map site-specific variations at single acquisition dates. The results show that the lower information content of the satellite-based crop monitoring might be mainly traced back to its coarser Red Edge-band. Additionally, date-specific effects within the Sentinel-2 data were detected. Due to cloud coverage, the temporal resolution was found to be unsatisfactory as well. These results emphasize the need for further research on the applicability of the Sentinel-2 data and a cautious use in the context of precision agriculture. © 2021 by the authors.

Bathymetric information is thus important for the protection and management of the estuarine environment, but little effort has been made to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different methods and datasets. In this study, two linear regression models—the linear band model and the log-transformed band ratio model, and two non-linear regression models—the support vector regression model and the random forest regression model—were applied to Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery for bathymetry mapping in 2019 and 2020. Results suggested that a priori area clustering based on spectral features using the K-means algorithm improved estimation accuracy. The random forest regression model performed best, and the three-band combinations outperformed two-band combinations in all models. When the non-linear models were applied with three-band combination (red, green, blue) to L8 and S2 imagery, the Root Mean Square Error (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 23.10% (35.53%), and the coefficient of determination (Kling-Gupta efficiency) increased by 0.08 (0.09) on average, compared to those using the linear regression models. Despite the differences in spatial resolution and band wavelength, L8 and S2 performed similarly in bathymetry estimation. This study quantified the relative performance of different models and may shed light on the potential combination of multiple data sources for more timely and accurate bathymetry mapping. © 2021 by the authors.

The usage of Synthetical Aperture Radar (SAR) data has gained popularity due to the unique characteristics of the backscattered radio signal from human-made targets. The Sentinel-1 (S1) constellation, with a global revisit time of 6-12 days in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode and free and open access to the data, allows the development of new applications to monitor urban sites. However, S1 is rarely considered when fine resolution is required due to the large pixel size and the need for spatial averaging to obtain robust estimators. We propose a method to improve Sentinel-1 urban classification performance by exploiting one Multi-Spectral (MS) image acquired by Sentinel-2 (S2). MS data is used for tracing the precise natural boundaries in a scene through superpixels segmentation. A machine learning approach is then applied to interpret the thematic context of each segment from short temporal stacks of coregistered SAR data. We use a short sensing period (around two months), so rapid changes can be traces. The proposed fusion of S1 and S2 data was tested in the area of Milan (Italy), with a total accuracy of about 90%. The ability to follow high-resolution details in a mixed environment is demonstrated, opening the possibility of efficiently tracing the human footprint. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

In this study, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated for mainland France from multispectral imagery. For 67% and 84% of the area under spring-sown crops for years 2018 and 2019, soil cover during the previous winter was estimated through the computation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using Sentinel-2 multispectral images. At country scale, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated between 37% and 48% for 2018 and between 31% and 43% for 2019, depending on the NDVI threshold for a soil to be considered covered by at least 50% of vegetation. Spatial patterns were relatively similar between the two years studied, highlighting strong heterogeneities between French departments. Cropping systems may explain some of these heterogeneities, as it has been shown that there is a large variability in the soil cover rate between spring-sown crops, but also depending on the previous crop. Winter soil cover rate was higher for crops associated with livestock production, such as maize silage (between 59% and 74% of plots covered before this crop). It was also shown that winter soil cover could be ensured by other means than cover crops: temporary grasslands were the previous crop with the highest soil cover, probably due to late ploughing. For these reasons, mixed systems combining livestock and crop productions may be a solution to increase winter soil cover before spring-sown crops.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Hyperspectral imagery, with a more continuous representation of their spectral behavior may instead be used for their classification.

The Agricultural and Forestry Satellite CAS500(Compact Advanced Satellite 500)-4 is a multi-spectral satellite with a spatial resolution of 5 m and with a revisit cycle of 3 days. Prior to launch, this study intends to develop a NDVI composite technique to minimize the effect of clouds. A high-altitude Korean cabbage field (<67ha), which has a relatively large area as a single crop field in Korea, was selected as the study area. Sentinel-2A/B (10m spatial resolution, 5-day revisit cycle) acquired from May 2019 to July 2021 for the study area was used. For monthly compositing, the MaxNDVI technique, which is a representative composite technique, and the recently suggested score-based composite technique were applied and compared. The score-based method calculates the fitness score for compositing for each pixel by assigning various factors and weights to minimize the effect of clouds during NDVI composite and maximize temporal representativeness. Therefore, the reflectance of the pixel with the highest score is used for compositing. The reflectance composite image produced in this way is converted to NDVI. Although both composite techniques minimize the effect of clouds, both results show that MaxNDVI shows high NDVI at the end of the month at the time of early growth after sowing, whereas the score-based technique shows NDVI at the middle of the month. Compared to the MODIS composite data from 2019 to 2021, the monthly composite data of Sentinel-2 NDVI showed various growth patterns by site in more detail. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Moreover, with the introduction of self-attention and introspection mechanisms, deep learning approaches have shown promising results in processing long temporal sequences in the multi-spectral domain with a contained computational request. Nevertheless, most practical applications cannot rely on labeled data, and in the field, surveys are a time-consuming solution that pose strict limitations to the number of collected samples. Moreover, atmospheric conditions and specific geographical region characteristics constitute a relevant domain gap that does not allow direct applicability of a trained model on the available dataset to the area of interest. In this paper, we investigate adversarial training of deep neural networks to bridge the domain discrepancy between distinct geographical zones. In particular, we perform a thorough analysis of domain adaptation applied to challenging multi-spectral, multi-temporal data, accurately highlighting the advantages of adapting state-of-the-art self-attention-based models for LC&CC to different target zones where labeled data are not available. Extensive experimentation demonstrated significant performance and generalization gain in applying domain-adversarial training to source and target regions with marked dissimilarities between the distribution of extracted features. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on Google Earth engine and Sentinel-2 images, an automatic water extraction model in complex environment(AWECE) was developed. The accuracy of water extraction by AWECE, NDWI, MNDWI and the revised version of multi-spectral water index (MuWI-R) models was evaluated from visual interpretation and quantitative analysis. The results show that the AWECE model could significantly improve the accuracy of water extraction in complex environment, with an overall accuracy of 97.16%, and an extremely low omission error (0.74%) and commission error (2.35%). The AEWCE model could effectively avoid the influence of cloud shadow, mountain shadow and paddy soil on water extraction accuracy. The model can be widely applied in cloudy, mountainous and other areas with complex environments, which has important practical significance for water resources investigation, monitoring and protection.

In minimum ecological flux management, objective determination of the minimum ecological flux and evaluation of whether a river complies with standards are urgently required.

Herein, the Tangmazhai cross-section of the Taizi River was analyzed using the Chinese Gaofen (GF) series satellite that comprises panchromatic multi-spectral sensors and the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images to automatically extract the water surface width.

We proposed a method to evaluate the minimum ecological flux using water surface width. The river surface width at this location increased from January 2015 to November 2019, and all widths exceeded the minimum river surface water width for the month. The degree of the minimum ecological flux guarantee was determined to be satisfactory.

At the same time, climate change impacts are pronounced in the Arctic. Ground temperatures are, for example, increasing as well as coastal erosion. A consistent account of the current human footprint is needed in order to evaluate the impact on the environments as well as risk for infrastructure. Identification of roads and settlements with satellite data is challenging due to the size of single features and low density of clusters. Spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data are the main issues regarding their separation. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 and-2 missions recently provided good spatial coverage and at the same time comparably high pixel spacing starting with 10 m for modes available across the entire Arctic. The purpose of this study was to assess the capabilities of both, Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Sentinel-2 multispectral information for Arctic focused mapping. Settings differ across the Arctic (historic settlements versus industrial, locations on bedrock versus tundra landscapes) and reference data are scarce and inconsistent. The type of features and data scarcity demand specific classification approaches. The machine learning approaches Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation have been tested. Records for the Alaskan North Slope, Western Greenland, and Svalbard in addition to high-resolution satellite data have been used for validation and calibration. Deep learning is superior to GBM with respect to users accuracy. GBM therefore requires comprehensive postprocessing. SAR provides added value in case of GBM. VV is of benefit for road identification and HH for detection of buildings. Unfortunately, the Sentinel-1 acquisition strategy is varying across the Arctic. The majority is covered in VV+VH only. DL is of benefit for road and building detection but misses large proportions of other human-impacted areas, such as gravel pads which are typical for gas and oil fields. A combination of results from both GBM (Sentinel-1 and-2 combined) and DL (Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1 optional) is therefore suggested for circumpolar mapping. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptive boosting; Climate change; Deep learning; Mapping; Oil fields; Roads and streets; Satellites; Semantics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Acquisition strategies; Classification approach; High resolution satellite data; Impact on the environment; Industrial development; Machine learning approaches; Semantic segmentation; Spectral characteristics; Classification (of information)","Arctic; Infrastructure; Machine learning; Multi-spectral; SAR; Settlements","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089689584"

Accumulation of marine debris, besides climate change factors, including warming water, sea-level rise, and changes in oceans’ chemistry, are causing the potential collapse of the marine environment’s health. Due to the increase of marine debris, including plastics in coastlines, ocean and sea surfaces, and even in deep ocean layers, there is a need for developing new advanced technology for the detection of large-sized marine pollution (with sizes larger than 1 m) using state-of-the-art remote sensing and machine learning tools. Therefore, we developed a cloud-based framework for large-scale marine pollution detection with the integration of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and advanced machine learning tools on the Sentinel Hub cloud application programming interface (API). Moreover, we evaluated the performance of two shallow machine learning algorithms of random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), as well as the deep learning method of the generative adversarial network-random forest (GAN-RF) for the detection of ocean plastics in the pilot site of Mytilene Island, Greece. Based on the obtained results, the shallow algorithms of RF and SVM achieved an overall accuracy of 88% and 84%, respectively, with available training data of plastic debris. The GAN-RF classifier improved the detection of ocean plastics of the RF method by 8%, achieving an overall accuracy of 96% by generating several synthetic ocean plastic samples. © 2021 by the authors.

Essential to RRN are the pseudo-invariant features (PIFs)–ground objects with invariant reflectance across the acquisition dates of multiple images. To meet the requirements of RRN for change detection in multi-temporal images, this paper proposed a novel automatic method for PIF extraction: first, we calculated spectral, spatial, and visual features for the images. Next, a set of change vectors were generated to quantify the features’ differences. Then, the initial PIF was obtained by synthesizing similar pixels from each change vector. Finally, an iterative linear regression was performed to generate the final PIFs. Furthermore, we employed the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to establish the RRN model for normalizing the target image. The methods and workflow of PIF extraction and the RRN model establishment were validated with two TripleSat-2 multi-spectral images with a spatial resolution of 3.2 metres. The applicability of the proposed PIF extraction method was further validated by Landsat-8 OLI, GF-1 WFV, Sentinel-2 MSI, and WorldView-2 images. The results showed that: (1) The proposed PIF extraction method can automatically obtain the PIFs with high precision. Based on the extracted PIFs, the RANSAC algorithm is capable of building the RRN model with a significant linear relationship. (2) The PIF extraction method is applicable to multi-spectral images with different spatial resolutions. (3) Compared with the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) and the iteratively reweighted MAD (IR-MAD), the proposed PIF extraction method achieved a better performance in selecting the pixels with smaller radiometric differences, which is helpful to reach a higher accuracy of the RRN model. (4) Differences in image brightness, spectral domain, and spatial domain are considered in the PIF extraction method with fewer parameters and high portability. (5) Spectral features are dominant to obtain ideal PIFs, and feature combinations can get the advantages to enhance the effectiveness of the PIFs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Extraction; Iterative methods; Pixels; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Alteration detections; High resolution image; Linear relationships; Multi-temporal image; Multispectral images; Pseudo-invariant features; Random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm; Relative radiometric normalization; automation; data acquisition; data processing; image analysis; Landsat; multispectral image; pattern recognition; radiometer; remote sensing; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108061612"

Here we present an algorithm that simultaneously retrieves soil moisture, surface roughness and vegetation water content by jointly using high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, with an application directed towards the provision of information at the precision agricultural scale. Sentinel-2-derived vegetation water indices are investigated and used to quantify the backscatter resulting from the vegetation canopy. The proposed algorithm then inverts the water cloud model to simultaneously estimate soil moisture and surface roughness by minimizing a cost function constructed by model simulations and SAR observations. To examine the performance of VV- and VH-polarized backscatters on soil moisture retrievals, three retrieval schemes are explored: a single channel algorithm using VV (SCA-VV) and VH (SCA-VH) polarizations and a dual channel algorithm using both VV and VH polarizations (DCA-VVVH). An evaluation of the approach using a combination of a cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system (COSMOS) and Soil Climate Analysis Network measurements over Nebraska shows that the SCA-VV scheme yields good agreement at both the COSMOS footprint and single-site scales. The features of the algorithms that have the most impact on the retrieval accuracy include the vegetation water content estimation scheme, parameters of the water cloud model and the specification of initial ranges of soil moisture and roughness, all of which are comprehensively analyzed and discussed. Through careful consideration and selection of these factors, we demonstrate that the proposed SCA-VV approach can provide reasonable soil moisture retrievals, with RMSE ranging from 0.039 to 0.078 m3/m3 and R2 ranging from 0.472 to 0.665, highlighting the utility of SAR for application at the precision agricultural scale. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Backscattering; Cloud computing; Cosmic ray measurement; Cosmology; Cost functions; Polarization; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Water content; Estimation schemes; Multi-spectral imagery; Network measurement; Retrieval accuracy; Single-channel algorithms; Soil moisture retrievals; Vegetation water content; Water cloud models; Soil surveys","Microwave remote sensing; Precision agriculture; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088626234"

However, the use of primary satellite information is often limited by clouds, cloud shadows, and haze, which generally contaminate optical imagery. For purposes of hazard assessment, for instance, such as flooding, drought, or seismic events, the availability of uncontaminated optical data is required. Different approaches exist for masking and replacing cloud/haze related contamination. However, most common algorithms take advantage by employing thermal data. Hence, we tested an algorithm suitable for optical imagery only. The approach combines a multispectral-multitemporal strategy to retrieve daytime cloudless and shadow-free imagery. While the approach has been explored for Landsat information, namely Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI, here we aim at testing the suitability of the method for Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument. A multitemporal stack, for the same image scene, is employed to retrieve a composite uncontaminated image over a temporal period of few months. Besides, in order to emphasize the effectiveness of optical imagery for monitoring post-disaster events, two temporal stages have been processed, before and after a critical seismic event occurred in Lombok Island, Indonesia, in summer 2018. The approach relies on a clouds and cloud shadows masking algorithm, based on spectral features, and a data reconstruction phase based on automatic selection of the most suitable pixels from a multitemporal stack. Results have been tested with uncontaminated image samples for the same scene. High accuracy is achieved. © Authors 2020.

Predictions of invasion dynamics derived from modeling tools are often spatially coarse and therefore unsuitable for guiding local management. Accurate information on the occurrence of invasive plants and on the main factors that promote their spread is critical to define successful control strategies. For addressing this challenge, we developed a dual framework combining satellite image classification with predictive ecological modeling. By combining data from georeferenced invaded areas with multispectral imagery with 10-meter resolution from Sentinel-2 satellites, a map of areas invaded by the woody invasive Acacia longifolia in a municipality of northern Portugal was devised. Classifier fusion techniques were implemented through which eight statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to produce accurate maps of invaded areas. Through a Random Forest (RF) model, these maps were then used to explore the factors driving the landscape-level abundance of A. longifolia. RF models were based on explanatory variables describing hypothesized environmental drivers, including climate, topography/geomorphology, soil properties, fire disturbance, landscape composition, linear structures, and landscape spatial configuration. Satellite-based maps synoptically described the spatial patterns of invaded areas, with classifications attaining high accuracy values (True Skill Statistic, TSS: 0.895, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, ROC: 0.988, Kappa: 0.857). The predictive RF models highlighted the primary role of climate, followed by landscape composition and configuration, as the most important drivers explaining the species abundance at the landscape level. Our innovative dual framework—combining image classification and predictive ecological modeling—can guide decision-making processes regarding effective management of invasions by prioritizing the invaded areas and tackling the primary environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the species’ abundance and spread. © 2021 by the authors.

In the past decades, a lot of studies were investigated to obtain bathymetric data in shallow waters using satellite remotely sensed data. Satellite multispectral imagery has been widely used to estimate shallow water depths based on empirical models and physics-based models. However, the in-situ water depth information is essential (as the priori) to use the empirical model in a specific area, which limits its application, especially for remote reefs. In this study, the bathymetric maps in shallow waters were produced based on empirical models with only satellite remotely sensed data (i.e., the new ICESat-2 bathymetric points and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery). The bathymetric points from the spaceborne ICESat-2 lidar were used in place of the in-situ auxiliary bathymetric points to train the classical empirical models (i.e., the linear model and the band ratio model). The bathymetric points were firstly extracted from noisy ICESat-2 raw data photons by an improved point cloud processing algorithm, and then were corrected for bathymetric errors (which were caused by the refraction effect in the water column, the refraction effect on the water surface, and the fluctuation effect on the water surface). With the trained empirical models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images, the bathymetric maps were produced for Yongle Atoll, in the South China Sea and the lagoon near Acklins Island and Long Cay, to the southeast of Bahama with four-date Sentinel-2 images. The bathymetry performance (including the accuracy and consistency of multi-date data) was evaluated and compared with the in-situ measurements. The results indicate that the bathymetric accuracy is well, and the RMSE is lower or close to 10% of the maximum depth for the two models with four-date images in two study areas. The consistency of multi-date data is well with the mean R2 of 0.97. The main novelties of this study are that the accuracy bathymetric points can be obtained from the ICESat-2 raw data using the proposed signal processing and error correction method, and using the ICESat-2 bathymetric points, the satellite multispectral imagery based on empirical models is no longer limited by local priori measurements, which were essential in previous studies.

Simple, non-invasive, practical approaches are need for monitoring soil salinity in the region and preventing further degradation of soil resources. The objective of this study was to develop regression models for soil salinity assessment in Lezíria Grande based on the relationship between multi-year crop reflectance data derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and rootzone salinity. Nine vegetation indices (VI), computed from the annual averages of the spectral bands, were tested between 2017 and 2019. The multi-year maximum from each pixel was then used for correlating the VI with the ground-truth dataset. This dataset was composed of average values of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract (ECe mean) measured in 80 sampling sites (0–1.5 m depth) located in four agricultural fields representative of the salinity gradient in the region. The Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI), which uses the blue (490 nm), green (560 nm), red (665 nm), and infrared (842 nm) bands, provided the strongest correlation with measured data (r=−0.787). Regression models further considered vegetation cover and soil type as explanatory variables, with predictions resulting in a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.63 to 0.91 and a root mean square error (RMSE) varying from 1.63 to 3.26 dS m−1. The use of remote sensing data for soil salinity assessment showed to be an interesting option to consider in future soil monitoring programs. Nevertheless, more detailed covariates are needed for improving salinity assessment models at the regional scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Portugal; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Groundwater; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Crop reflectance data; Electrical conductivity; Explanatory variables; Ground-truth dataset; Groundwater dynamics; Multi-spectral imagery; Root mean square errors; Salinity assessments; agricultural land; multispectral image; NDVI; pixel; rhizosphere; salinity; satellite data; Sentinel; vegetation cover; Soils","Canopy response salinity index; Multi-year maximum; Multiple regression analysis; Rootzone salinity; Soil-environmental covariates","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087828342"

Training deep convolutional architecture with such a dataset is still a challenging task in land cover classification due to the absence of ground truth. Also, the selection of appropriate deep architecture for handling the Sentinel-2 dataset is another challenging task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to extract the information from various combinations of bands in Sentinel-2 imagery. We use a loss function, proposed in an earlier work, to train our model in an unsupervised manner. Recent advances in deep learning allow for transferring knowledge from one data set to another. Thus, in our study, we aim at analyzing the 'transfer learning' capabilities of our proposed network to land cover classification in Sentinel-2 images. Pre-trained weights of a deep neural architecture, which is trained with very high-resolution optical satellite imagery from Aviris is transferred to a network of almost similar architecture for processing Sentinel-2 data. We used Salinas, a publicly available hyper-spectral dataset, to train this architecture in a supervised fashion and, finally, use transfer learning and fine-tuning on the architecture handling Sentinel-2 data for clustering.

The data processing is implemented with a convolutional neural network (CNN), where until a fusion layer, separate data sources are processed separately on branches. Strategies of splitting the data into branches and the effects of different fusion stages are compared, together with approaches based on sums of independent classifiers.

Short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands are less influenced by thin clouds, but usually have lower spatial resolution than visible (Vis) bands in high spatial resolution remote sensing images (e.g., in Sentinel-2A/B, CBERS04, ZY-1 02D and HJ-1B satellites). Most cloud removal methods do not take advantage of the spectral information available in SWIR bands, which are less affected by clouds, to restore the background information tainted by thin clouds in Vis bands. In this paper, we propose CR-MSS, a novel deep learning-based thin cloud removal method that takes the SWIR and vegetation red edge (VRE) bands as inputs in addition to visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) bands, in order to improve cloud removal in Sentinel-2 visible bands. Contrary to some traditional and deep learning-based cloud removal methods, which use manually designed rescaling algorithm to handle bands at different resolutions, CR-MSS uses convolutional layers to automatically process bands at different resolution. CR-MSS has two input/output branches that are designed to process Vis/NIR and VRE/SWIR, respectively. Firstly, Vis/NIR cloudy bands are down-sampled by a convolutional layer to low spatial resolution features, which are then concatenated with the corresponding features extracted from VRE/SWIR bands. Secondly, the concatenated features are put into a fusion tunnel to down-sample and fuse the spectral information from Vis/NIR and VRE/SWIR bands. Third, a decomposition tunnel is designed to up-sample and decompose the fused features. Finally, a transpose convolutional layer is used to up-sample the feature maps to the resolution of input Vis/NIR bands. CR-MSS was trained on 28 real Sentinel-2A image pairs over the globe, and tested separately on eight real cloud image pairs and eight simulated cloud image pairs. The average SSIM values (Structural Similarity Index Measurement) for CR-MSS results on Vis/NIR bands over all testing images were 0.69, 0.71, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively, which was on average 1.74% higher than the best baseline method. The visual results on real Sentinel-2 images demonstrate that CR-MSS can produce more realistic cloud and cloud shadow removal results than baseline methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Multi-spectral remote sensing (RS) data including Landsat series provides the potential for frequent surveys for soil salinization at various scales and resolutions. Additionally, the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite constellation has temporal revisiting frequency of 5 days, which has been proven to be an ideal approach to assess soil salinity. Yet, studies on detailed comparison in soil salinity tracking between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI remain limited. For this purpose, we collected a total of 64 topsoil samples in an arid desert region, the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) to compare the monitoring accuracy between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. In this study, the Cubist model was trained using RS-derived covariates (spectral bands, Tasseled Cap transformation-derived wetness (TCW), and satellite salinity indices) and laboratory measured electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC). The results showed that the measured soil salinity had a significant correlation with surface soil moisture (Pearson's r = 0.75). The introduction of TCW generated satisfactory estimating performance. Compared with OLI dataset, the combination of MSI dataset and Cubist model yielded overall better model performance and accuracy measures (R2 = 0.912, RMSE = 6.462 dS m−1, NRMSE = 9.226%, RPD = 3.400 and RPIQ = 6.824, respectively). The differences between Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI were distinguishable. In conclusion, MSI image with finer spatial resolution performed better than OLI. Combining RS data sets and their derived TCW within a Cubist framework yielded accurate regional salinity map. The increased temporal revisiting frequency and spectral resolution of MSI data are expected to be positive enhancements to the acquisition of high-quality soil salinity information of desert soils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Climate change; Landforms; Machine learning; Soil moisture; water; Cubist; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2 MSI; Soil salinization; Surface soil moisture; arid region; comparative study; desert; detection method; Landsat; machine learning; remote sensing; salinity; salinization; Sentinel; soil chemistry; soil moisture; spectral resolution; Article; China; controlled study; correlation analysis; desert; electric conductivity; environmental factor; environmental monitoring; extract; geographic mapping; image analysis; intermethod comparison; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; performance; priority journal; salinity; satellite imagery; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil property; soil salinity; soil water extract; spatial analysis; surface soil; uncertainty; Remote sensing","Cubist; Landsat-8 OLI; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2 MSI; Soil salinization; Surface soil moisture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076894158"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of satellite SAR and multispectral sensors in the detection of biogenic oil films near aquaculture farms. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data were exploited to detect the films around three aquaculture sites. The study is divided in three stages: (a) preprocessing, (b) main process and (c) accuracy assessment. The preprocessing stage includes subset, filtering, land masking and image corrections. The main process was similar for both datasets, using an adaptive thresholding method to identify dark formations, extract and classify them. Finally, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated based on the estimation of standard classification error statistics. The evaluation of the results was based on empirical photointerpretation and in situ photos. The results are successful and promising, with overall accuracy over 70%, while both sensors are proved to be effective in the detection, with Sentinel-1 SAR presenting slightly better accuracy (81%) than Sentinel-2 MSI (70%). There is no evidence of these films causing stress to the aquaculture farms or the surrounding environment; however, our knowledge on their presence, amount and dissolution is limited and further knowledge could contribute to efficient feeding management and fish welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

Hyperspectral methodologies use the radiance differential between the measurement in the plume and the corresponding measurements out of the plume to estimate plume properties. To retrieve the surface reflectance under the plume, a principal component analysis coupling hyperspectral and multispectral data class by class is achieved. The developed method aims to compare the difference between measured and estimated reflectance with a radiative transfer model accounting for plume properties (particle radius and aerosol optical thickness of the plume).

The algorithm is tested for exportability over five sites in Portugal (1), Spain (2) and Greece (2) to evaluate the performance by comparison with fire reference perimeters derived from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) database. In these sites, we estimate commission error < 0.15, omission error < 0.1 and Dice coefficient > 0.9 with accuracy in some cases greater than values obtained in the training site. Regression analysis confirmed the satisfactory accuracy levels achieved over all sites. The algorithm proposed offers the advantages of being least dependent on a priori/supervised selection for input bands (by building on the integration of redundant partial burn evidence) and for criteria/threshold to obtain segmentation into burned/unburned areas. © 2021 by the authors.

To solve the saturation problem of the NDVI in the aboveground biomass mapping of crops, the original CASA model was improved using narrow‐band red‐edge information, which is sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll vari-ation, and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), NPP, and aboveground bio-mass of winter wheat and maize were mapped in the main growing seasons. Moreover, in this study, we deeply analyzed the seasonal change trends of crops’ biophysical parameters in terms of the NDVI, FPAR, actual light use efficiency (LUE), and their influence on aboveground biomass. Finally, to analyze the uncertainty of the aboveground biomass mapping of crops, we further dis-cussed the inversion differences of FPAR with different vegetation indices. The results demonstrated that the inversion accuracies of the FPAR of the red‐edge normalized vegetation index (NDVIred‐edge ) and red‐edge simple ratio vegetation index (SRred‐edge ) were higher than those of the original CASA model. Compared with the reference data, the accuracy of aboveground biomass estimated by the improved CASA model was 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, which was 0.21 and 0.13 higher than that of the original CASA model. In addition, the analysis of the FPAR inversions of different vegetation indices showed that the inversion accuracies of the red‐edge vegetation indices NDVIred‐edge and SRred‐edge were higher than those of the other vegetation indices, which con-firmed that the vegetation indices involving red‐edge information can more effectively retrieve FPAR and aboveground biomass of crops. © 2021 by the authors.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pléiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pléaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pléiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline. © 2020 The Author(s)","Himalayas; Automation; Debris; Ice; Image resolution; Landforms; Large dataset; Remote sensing; Debris covered glaciers; High spatial resolution; Linear spectral unmixing; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing platforms; Spectral information; data set; glacial debris; glacier mass balance; ice; ice-rafted debris; mapping method; Pleiades; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; Mapping","Automated delineation; Debris-covered glaciers; Ice cliff inventory; Linear spectral unmixing; Pléiades; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial ice cliffs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097089079"

Also, the coastline does not have a well-defined length as results from the fractal-like properties of coastlines, i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension so, its representation depends to many factors like the cartographic method used, the resolution of the image and the scale of the map. On the other hand, the shoreline is general use to estimate the surface of the landmass, so is important to get a cartographic product with accuracy in a time. Taking into account these elements, this paper is focus in a surface estimation of total Cuban island and keys. To achieved, an expeditious method was used, from the application of geometric corrections to multispectral SENTINEL-2 images, followed by a band algebra using the NDWI index. After those process the automated extraction of shoreline was conducted and finally, refining the vectors by cartographic editing without compromising the accuracy of the results.

With this approach, data from images of Sentinel-2 are used by a deep convolutional network system, which will extract the necessary information to discern between different types of crops over a year after being trained with data from previous years. Following the proposed methodology, it is possible to classify crops and distinguish between several crop classes while also being computationally low-cost.

This study evaluated the potential of satellite-based remote sensing to assess the damage and the recovery time after a late frost event in 2017 in northern Italian vineyards. Several vegetation indices (VIs) normalized on a two-year dataset (2018-2019) were compared over a frost-affected area (F) and a control area (NF) using unpaired two-sample t-test. Furthermore, the must quality data (total acidity, sugar content and pH) of F and NF were analyzed. The VIs most sensitive in the detection of frost damage were Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (CARI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 1 (MTVI1) (-5.26%,-16.59%, and-5.77% compared to NF, respectively). The spectral bands Near-Infrared (NIR) and Red Edge 7 were able to identify the frost damage (-16.55 and-16.67% compared to NF, respectively). Moreover, CARI, EVI, MTVI1, NIR, Red Edge 7, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Simple Ratio (MSR) provided precise information on the full recovery time (+17.7%, +22.42%, +29.67%, +5.89%, +5.91%, +16.48%, and +8.73% compared to NF, respectively) approximately 40 days after the frost event. The must analysis showed that total acidity was higher (+5.98%), and pH was lower (-2.47%) in F compared to NF.

OC-SMART is a multi-sensor data analysis platform which supports heritage, current, and possible future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors from US, EU, Korea, Japan, and China, including SeaWiFS, Aqua/MODIS, SNPP/VIIRS, ISS/HICO, Landsat8/OLI, DSCOVR/EPIC, Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/OLCI, COMS/GOCI, GCOM-C/SGLI and FengYun-3D/MERSI2. The products provided by OC-SMART include spectral normalized remote sensing reflectances (Rrs values), chlorophyll_a (CHL) concentrations, and spectral in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) including absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton (aph), absorption coefficients due to detritus and Gelbstoff (adg) and backscattering coefficients due to particulates (bbp). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided by OC-SMART. The goal of OC-SMART is to improve the quality of global ocean color products retrieved from satellite sensors, especially under complex environmental conditions, such as coastal/inland turbid water areas and heavy aerosol loadings. Therefore, the atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean IOP algorithms in OC-SMART are driven by extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques.To simulate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances, we solve the radiative transfer equation pertinent for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. For each sensor, we have created about 13 million RT simulations and comprehensive training datasets to support the development of the machine learning AC and in-water IOP algorithms. The results, as demonstrated in this paper, are very promising. Not only does OC-SMART improve the quality of the retrieved water products, it also resolves the negative water-leaving radiance problem that has plagued heritage AC algorithms. The comprehensive training datasets created using multiple atmosphere, aerosol, and ocean IOP models ensure global and generic applicability of OC-SMART. The use of machine learning algorithms makes OC-SMART roughly 10 times faster than NASA's SeaDAS platform. OC-SMART also includes an advanced cloud screening algorithm and is resilient to the contamination by weak to moderate sunglint and cloud edges. It is therefore capable of recovering large amounts of data that are discarded by other algorithms (such as those implemented in NASA's SeaDAS package), especially in coastal areas. OC-SMART is currently available as a standalone Python package or as a plugin that can be installed in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","China; Japan; Korea; United States; Aerosols; Backscattering; Color; Data handling; Information analysis; Machine learning; NASA; Oceanography; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Satellites; Turing machines; Water absorption; Absorption co-efficient; Atmospheric corrections; Backscattering coefficients; Environmental conditions; Inherent optical properties (IOPs); Radiative transfer equations; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite ocean color sensors; absorption; aerosol; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); atmospheric correction; backscatter; Landsat; machine learning; MODIS; ocean color; satellite data; satellite sensor; SeaWiFS; Sentinel; VIIRS; Learning algorithms","Atmospheric correction; Machine learning; OC-SMART; Ocean color; Ocean IOPs; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097789181"

Sentinel-2 images provide multi-spectral information every 5 days for each location. However, the maximum spatial resolution of its bands is 10m for RGB and near-infrared bands. Increasing the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images without additional costs, would make any posterior analysis more accurate. Most approaches on super-resolution for Sentinel-2 have focused on obtaining 10m resolution images for those at lower resolutions (20m and 60m), taking advantage of the information provided by bands of finer resolutions (10m). Otherwise, our focus is on increasing the resolution of the 10m bands, that is, super-resolving 10m bands to 2.5m resolution, where no additional information is available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution and deep learning-based approaches have become the state-of-the-art for this problem on standard images. Obviously, models learned for standard images do not translate well to satellite images. Hence, the problem is how to train a deep learning model for super-resolving Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exist (Sentinel-2 images at 2.5m). We propose a methodology for learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentinel-2 image super-resolution making use of images from other sensors having a high similarity with Sentinel-2 in terms of spectral bands, but greater spatial resolution. Our proposal is tested with a state-of-the-art neural network showing that it can be useful for learning to increase the spatial resolution of RGB and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

The current study investigates the alternative use of multispectral data acquired by medium-high spatial resolution optical satellite sensors, i.e. the Landsat-8 (L8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Sentinel-2 (S2) MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI). The study analyzes the impact of the main factors influencing TRIX estimation using datasets collected in several Mediterranean ports and particularly in those of Civitavecchia and Viareggio (Central Italy). The experimental results indicate that the spectral configurations of OLI and MSI have a marginal impact on TRIX estimation, while major effects are caused by the different spatial and temporal features of the two sensors. The enhanced spatial properties of MSI are important particularly in the smaller port of Viareggio; the higher acquisition frequency of this sensor brings significant advantages for operational monitoring applications. Overall, the accuracy of TRIX estimation based on in situ spectral measurements is reduced significantly by the use of OLI images and only marginally by that of MSI images.

This was accomplished through machine learning of historical land cover information, paired with a time-series of multi-spectral satellite imagery composites spanning the growing season, to develop rulesets, which were used for real-time prediction in the current year. Specifically, a decade's worth of annual 30 m resolution crop specific maps, known as the Cropland Data Layer (CDL), provided the foundation, and prior and current year's satellite imagery from Landsat 7 and 8 and Sentinel-2a and -2b built upon it. Four modeling scenarios, all using random forests, were performed to understand the crop mapping abilities of the datasets independently and combined. They were 1) use of CDLs only (i.e. prediction based solely on crop rotation history) 2) use of Landsat 7 and 8 bottom-of-atmosphere surface reflectance imagery only, 3) use of Sentinel-2a and -2b top-of-atmosphere imagery only, and 4) integration of the CDL, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 information together in a unified effort. Furthermore, the model runs were generated monthly, beginning in April, through the growing season to provide understanding of classification performance as a function of time. The 2020 crop year, relatively normal in terms of planting and weather, was used for the test. Accuracy statistics were generated by randomly sampling 50 counties and comparing those classification outputs to the actual 2020 CDL. Pixel-level results showed that prediction by midsummer using only the CDL information provided a crop type map with corn and soybean consumer and producer agreement above 70% and winter wheat just below 50%. The early season imagery-based classifications were markedly worse. However, as Landsat or Sentinel-2 imagery accumulated through July, those classifications became significantly better than those reliant on the use of the CDL information only. Ultimately, the very best crop maps resulted from integrating the CDLs with a full season's worth of Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. At that point in late September, the corn and soybean agreements were around 85% and winter wheat near 70%. All analysis was performed within Google Earth Engine cloud-based public imagery repository and high-performance computing system. The classification outputs provide practitioners with US crop type maps in near real-time. © 2021","Corn Belt; Great Plains; United States; Glycine max; Crops; Decision trees; Forecasting; Information use; Learning systems; Sampling; Satellite imagery; Cloud-based; Data layer; Land cover; LANDSAT; Predictive; Random forests; Real- time; Sentinel-2; Type maps; Without training data; accuracy assessment; crop rotation; growing season; land cover; real time; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; vegetation classification; Classification (of information)","Classification; Cloud-based; Crop; Land cover; Landsat; Predictive; Random forest; Real-time; Sentinel-2; Without training data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109029725"

It is designed to provide systematic global acquisitions of land and coastal areas at high-spectral resolution and with high revisit frequency, generating products feeding a large range of operational applications in domains such as agriculture, ecosystems management, natural disaster monitoring or water quality monitoring. The mission is currently in its operational phase with a constellation of two satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B) launched in 2015 and 2017 respectively, each designed for a minimum lifetime of 7.25 years with consumables sized for 12 years. In order to provide a long-term service (up to 20-year of overall mission duration), two additional satellites Sentinel-2C and Sentinel-2D were funded by the European Commission and are presently under development. The main S-2 payload, the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), is a push broom instrument with 13 spectral bands covering from the visible and the near infrared (VNIR) to the short wave infrared (SWIR). Operational experience from S-2 A&B, with new applications raising up, demonstrates how crucial and valuable accurate instrument spectral characterization is becoming. In the frame of S-2 C&D development, an enhanced spectral characterization method was implemented in order to address all the pixels of the Field Of View (FOV) on all the bands of the instrument with high precision, accuracy and sampling. This paper describes this novel approach as well as the test setup used to characterize both VNIR channels operated at ambient pressure and SWIR channels operated at low temperature in vacuum conditions. The results of the spectral response of the thirteen bands obtained during the MSI-C test campaign executed between 2019 and 2020 and their associated accuracy are presented. Finally, the impact of spectral response variation on typical targets and the added value for the users from the accurate knowledge of the spectral response is addressed. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Availability of an enormous volume of data demands handling large-scale, diverse data, which have been made possible with neural network-based architectures. This article exploits the contextual information capturing ability of deep neural networks, particularly investigating multispectral band properties from Sentinel-2 image patches. Besides, an increase in the spatial resolution often leads to nonlinear mixing of land-cover types within a target resolution cell. We recognize this fact and group the bands according to their spatial resolutions, and propose a classification and retrieval framework. We design a representation learning framework for classifying the multispectral data by first utilizing all the bands and then using the grouped bands according to their spatial resolutions. We also propose a novel triplet-loss function for multilabeled images and use it to design an interband group retrieval framework. We demonstrate its effectiveness over the conventional triplet-loss function. Finally, we present a comprehensive discussion of the obtained results. We thoroughly analyze the performance of the band groups on various land-cover and land-use areas from agro-forestry regions, water bodies, and human-made structures.

That is, the pixels are assumed to all be from the same image at a single time, and the anomalies are pixels whose spectra differ from the rest of the pixel spectra in the scene. In this research we are instead interested in temporal anomalies, where we compare a single pixel against itself over time rather than against the rest of the pixels in the scene. To do this requires a large sample of registered images taken at different points in time, which is easily enabled by global-coverage constellations such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat. In doing so we can implement the same anomaly detection algorithms that are traditionally applied spatially, but draw our 'background' distribution from time instead of space. Here we present a straightforward experiment with Temporal RX, where we use the traditional RX algorithm but with a temporal background distribution.

The reduction of the availability of water resources along with the deterioration of water quality could have devastating consequences for human beings and natural environment. Therefore, ensuring the availability, quality and quantity of water resources is a key issue which has attracted the attention of researchers, governments and the public. The construction of dams constitutes a water storage solution in areas suffering from severe water shortage problems. Dams are artificial barriers, constructed across a river in order to hold back the rain water which falls during the wettest months, while a lake or reservoir is being formed behind them. In the current study, we map and monitor the existing water resources within the reservoir of a newly con-structed dam during its gradual filling. In that context, we acquired Sentinel-1 radar data and Sentinel-2 multispectral data which are provided free of charge to all users through the Copernicus programme. Our data sets are covering a period of one and a half year, from the completion of the dam construction and the beginning of the reservoir's filling until today, wherein the water level is at the highest point. Sentinel-1 data were processed using random forest classifier and dividing the area into water and land sub-parts, while Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) was calculated for Sentinel-2 data. The multi-dated water extents were integrated in an ArcGIS environment in order to evaluate them and investigate if a combined processing of radar and multispectral data of Copernicus programme could be the right choice towards a more accurate and detailed monitoring of water resources in a dam reservoir.

The ability to map the distribution of L. sinense on a property could help land managers plan and budget for control operations. We evaluated whether freely available moderate resolution multispectral imageries (Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2) and open-source GIS software (QGIS with the Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin) could be effective tools for this application. These tools are widely used by remote sensing and mapping professionals; however their adoption by field-level land managers appears limited, and their utility for mapping L. sinense invasions is untested. We evaluated how satellite type, image acquisition date, classification algorithm, and L. sinense cover affected detection accuracy. We found that Sentinel 2 imagery from March tended to produce good results, especially when analyzed using the maximum likelihood algorithm. Our best classifier obtained an overall accuracy of 92.3% for areas with ≥ 40% L. sinense cover. We recommend that land managers interested in applying this tool use an adaptive process for developing training polygons and test multiple images and classification algorithms in order to achieve optimal results. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Application programs; Budget control; Forestry; Hardwoods; Image classification; Managers; Maximum likelihood estimation; Open source software; Open systems; Personnel training; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Classification algorithm; Control operations; Detection accuracy; Hardwood forests; Maximum likelihood algorithm; Moderate resolution; Multi-spectral imagery; Overall accuracies; Mapping","Invasive species; QGIS; Satellite imagery; Supervised classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100743847"

However, it is quite a challenge to acquire the high-quality DEM, as it is very time-consuming, costly, and often confidential. This paper explores a DEM improvement scheme using an artificial neural network (ANN) that could improve the German Aerospace’s TanDEM-X (12 m resolution). The ANN was first trained in Nice, France, with a high spatial resolution surveyed DEM (1 m) and then applied on a faraway city, Singapore, for validation. In the ANN training, Sentinel-2 and TanDEM-X data of the Nice area were used as the input data, while the ground truth observation data of Nice were used as the target data. The applicability of iTanDEM-X was finally conducted at a different site in Singapore. The trained iTanDEM-X shows a significant reduction in the root mean square error of 43.6% in Singapore. It was also found that the improvement for different land covers (e.g., vegetation and built-up areas) ranges from 20 to 65%. The paper also demonstrated the application of the trained ANN on Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where the ground truth data are not available; for cases such as this, a visual comparison with Google satellite imagery was then utilized. The DEM from iTanDEM-X with 10 m resolution categorically shows much clearer land shapes (particularly the roads and buildings). © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, the obtained location and boundary of farmland together with crop types can contribute to the specific payment of planting subsidies and resource survey. Multi-source high-spatial and temporal resolution satellite images can provide an effective way to realize parcel-based crop mapping. However, some deficiencies still remain inthe extraction of farmland parcels and construction of spatiotemporal features. In this present study, a novel model was constructed to implement a parcel-based classification of crops by collaborating satellite data with high-spatial and temporal resolution. Four steps were included in a parcel-based crop mapping: 1) A D-LinkNet deep learning model was selected to extract the parcels from the 0.6m high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images; 2) Time series data set was constructed for each parcel using multi-source observations from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite, where the tiles with high cloud cover were removed from the images; 3) A weighted Double-Logistic fitting was utilized to reconstruct the parcel-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the extraction of phenological parameters, such as the duration of the growth cycle, the time of growth starting and ending, and spectral indexes were calculated from Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data; 4) A Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) indicator was used to estimate the feature importance. A field experiment was also conducted to collect the data of crop types for the training of random forest classification model in a parcel-based crop mapping. The Fusui County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China was taken as the study area. There was a relatively complex planting structure in the study area.It was cloudy and rainy with the rainfall days of about 130-220 d, as well as the diverse and complex topography. The dominated crops included sugarcane, paddy rice, banana, and orange. The results showed that the farmland parcels were well extracted by the D-LinkNet deep learning model, with an edge accuracy of 84.54% and a produce accuracy of 83.06%, compared with the conventional multi-scale segmentation. Phenological features were extracted from the reconstructed NDVI time series of the parcels. The NDVI of sugarcane and paddy rice first increased and then decreased significantly. The growth season of sugarcanes started from March to the following March. In addition, the growth season of paddy rice lasted for about 3-4 months, in which there was the most intense change in the NDVI time series. There was a relatively steady state in the reconstructed NDVI time series of evergreen eucalyptus and orange in the whole year. The eucalyptus with high vegetation cover showed high NDVI values during the observation period. The MDA indicator demonstrated that the images captured in summer and autumn were better for the crop classification in the study area. A best performance of classification was achieved to combine the phenological and spectral features. The overall accuracy reached 88%, and the accuracy of sugarcane reached over 95% in the study areas. The crop mapping indicated that sugarcane was spatially distributed around the whole study area, including plain and mountainous areas. The planting area of sugarcane accounted for nearly 70%, orange for 18.06%, and paddy rice for 7.12% of farmland. Furthermore, the paddy rice was mostly distributed near the settlement places. Consequently, the study successfully extractedphenological features by using Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 multi-source observations, and verified the importance of phenological features in the parcel-based crop mapping. The finding can provide a series of practical schemes to acquire parcel-based cropdistribution. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios. A wide range of experiments has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed OCN for ocean color remote sensing in the subarctic region. The performance of the OCN is also presented spatially by computing chl-a maps in the Barents Sea. © 2020 IEEE.","Color; Geology; Geometrical optics; Spectroscopy; Support vector regression; Ecosystem structure; Environmental change; Gaussian process regression; Multi spectral imager; Ocean color remote sensing; Primary productivity; Reflectance spectrum; Spatial and temporal variation; Remote sensing","Barents Sea; chl-a Monitoring; Ocean Color","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102014381"

Remote sensing combined with field measurements can be used to estimate biomass over large areas. This study assessed leaf biomass of Agave sisalana (sisal), a perennial crop whose leaves are grown for fibre production in tropical and subtropical regions. Furthermore, the residue from fibre production can be used to produce bioenergy through anaerobic digestion. First, biomass was estimated for 58 field plots using an allometric approach. Then, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery was used to model biomass in an 8851-ha plantation in semi-arid south-eastern Kenya. Generalised Additive Models were employed to explore how well biomass was explained by various spectral vegetation indices (VIs). The highest performance (explained deviance = 76%, RMSE = 5.15 Mg ha−1) was achieved with ratio and normalised difference VIs based on the green (R560), red-edge (R740 and R783), and near-infrared (R865) spectral bands. Heterogeneity of ground vegetation and resulting background effects seemed to limit model performance. The best performing VI (R740/R783) was used to predict plantation biomass that ranged from 0 to 46.7 Mg ha−1 (mean biomass 10.6 Mg ha−1). The modelling showed that multispectral data are suitable for assessing sisal leaf biomass at the plantation level and in individual blocks. Although these results demonstrate the value of Sentinel-2 red-edge bands at 20-m resolution, the difference from the best model based on green and near-infrared bands at 10-m resolution was rather small. © 2021 by the authors.

One category uses the vertical distance from any point to a line passing through the coordinate origin, which is perpendicular to a soil line, to monitor the dryness conditions. The most popular indices are the Perpendicular Dryness Index (PDI) and the modified perpendicular dryness index (MPDI). The other category uses the distance from any point in feature space to the coordinate origin to represent the dryness status, for instance, the soil moisture (SM) monitoring index (SMMI) and the modified soil moisture monitoring index (MSMMI). In this study, the performances and differences of these four indicators were evaluated using field-measured SM (FSM) data based on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensors. Performance evaluations were conducted in two study areas, namely an arid and semi-arid region of northwest China and a humid agricultural region of southwest Canada. We employed gradient-based structural similarity (GSSIM) to quantitatively assess the similarity of the structural information and structural characteristics among these four indicators. Monitoring SM in bare soil or low vegetation-covered areas in the semi-arid region, the SMMI, PDI, MSMMI, and MPDI from Near-Infrared (NIR)-Red had significantly negative linear correlations with the FSM at 0–5-cm depth (P < 0.01). However, SMMI was better than PDI in estimating SM in bare soil, which was better than MSMMI and MPDI for GF-1. Moreover, the PDI and SMMI had similar SM evaluation abilities, which were better than those of MPDI and MSMMI for Landsat-8. The GSSIM map of the SMMI/PDI and the MSMMI/MPDI showed that the low change areas accounted for 99.89% and 98.89% for GF-1, respectively, and 95.78% and 94.45% for Landsat-8, respectively. This result indicated that the SMMI, PDI, MSMMI, and MPDI values from NIR-Red in low vegetation cover were similar. In monitoring SM in agricultural vegetation areas, the accuracy of the four indices from Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) feature space was higher than that from NIR-Red feature space for Sentinel-2. The SM monitoring effect of MSMMI and MPDI was better than that of SMMI and PDI. Due to the lack of SWIR band, GF-1 was limited in monitoring SM in vegetation-covered areas. The SMMI and MSMMI, which do not rely on the soil line, were more suitable than PDI and MPDI for retrieving SM in the complex surface environment depending on the soil line and the number of parameters. GF-1 with 16-m resolution had higher accuracy in SM assessment than Landsat-8 with 30-m resolution and had almost the same accuracy as Sentinel-2 with 20 m. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Canada; China; Droughts; Soil; Canada; China; Varanidae; assessment method; bare soil; comparative study; drought; field of view; index method; Landsat; semiarid region; soil moisture; tensiometer; vegetation cover; agriculture; Canada; China; drought; soil","Comparative assessment; Drought monitoring indices; Geospatial techniques; Gradient-based structural similarity (GSSIM); SMMI/MSMMI, PDI/MPDI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103216304"

This has promoted several studies about the use of remote sensing data to monitor irrigated croplands, which are mostly based on statistical classification and/or regression techniques. The current paper proposes a new semi-empirical approach that relies on a water balance logic and does not require local tuning. The method stems from recent investigations which demonstrated the possibility of combining standard meteorological data and Sentinel-2 (S-2) Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) NDVI images to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of irrigated Mediterranean croplands. This ETa estimation method is adapted to drive a simplified site water balance which, for each 10-m S-2 MSI pixel, predicts the irrigation water (IW), i.e. the water which is consumed in addition to that naturally supplied by rainfall. The new method, fed with ground and satellite data from two years (2018–2019), is tested in a Mediterranean area around the town of Grosseto (Central Italy), that is covered by a particularly complex mosaic of rainfed and irrigated crops. The results obtained are first assessed qualitatively for some fields grown with known winter, spring and summer crops. Next, the IW estimates are evaluated quantitatively versus ground measurements taken over two irrigated fields, the first grown with processing tomato in 2018 and the second with early corn in 2019. Finally, the IW estimates are statistically analyzed against various datasets informative on local agricultural practices in the two years. All these analyses indicate that the proposed method is capable of predicting both the intensity and timing of the IW supply in the study area. The method, in fact, correctly identifies rainfed and irrigated crops and, in the latter case, accurately predicts the IW actually supplied. The results of the quantitative tests performed on tomato and corn show that over 50 % and 70 % of the measured IW variance is explained on daily and weekly bases, respectively, with corresponding mean bias errors below 0.3 mm/day and 2.0 mm/week. Similar indications are produced by the qualitative tests; reasonable IW estimates are obtained for all winter, springs and summer crops grown in the study area during 2018 and 2019. © 2020 The Authors","Grosseto [Tuscany]; Italy; Tuscany; Lycopersicon esculentum; Varanidae; annual variation; data set; evapotranspiration; irrigation; NDVI; remote sensing; seasonal variation; Sentinel; sustainable development","Actual evapotranspiration; Annual crops; Irrigation; NDVI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105542998"

How to integrate remote sensing image information more efficiently has always been the focus of research. In this paper, Changchun City, Jilin Province, China was selected as the experimental area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were used as experimental data, and a fusion method of SAR image and multispectral image using texture feature information was proposed. First, perform HIS transformation on the multi-spectral image to obtain the intensity image. After that, wavelet transform was used to extract the high-frequency and low-frequency detail components of the intensity image. At the same time, the principal component analysis method and the deep learning network VGG-19 were used to extract the texture features of the SAR image. The SAR texture image was used to enhance the high-frequency detail component of the intensity image, and combined with the original low-frequency detail component to perform inverse wavelet transform, then a new intensity image was obtained. Finally, the modulated intensity image was used to replace the original intensity image, and the inverse transformation (I-HIS) was performed to obtain an enhanced image fused from the multispectral image and the SAR image. Compared with the original image, the detailed features and boundary distinction were significantly improved. The fusion image was input into the support vector machine for feature classification, and the comprehensive classification accuracy reached 94.74%, which was 3.5% higher than the classification accuracy of the unfused image. © 2021 SPIE.","Classification (of information); Deep learning; Image compression; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Image texture; Principal component analysis; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Wavelet transforms; Classification accuracy; Deep learning algorithm; Feature information; High frequency HF; Intensity images; Lower frequencies; Multispectral images; Remote sensing images; SAR Images; Texture features; Learning algorithms","Deep learning algorithm; Image fusion; Multispectral image; SAR image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116960462"

The use of satellites to monitor crops and predict crop yield and estimated harvest dates is gathering attention now a days. The present study undertakes the task of finding and predicting the accurate time for the harvesting of wheat crops based on the change in the spectral signature of the field during observation and the growth timeline of the crop. For this purpose, Sentinel-2 multispectral time series data is used for which a timely ground observation is done. High emphasis is given to the selection of the optimal set of bands among 13 available bands, and after a rigorous pattern observation, Red, Blue, and NIR bands are found to be the optimal band set. Although Red and Blue bands together are able to identify various crop growth stages, using the NIR band in the band set is an added advantage because it is used to generate NDVI time series with Red band. The only contrast between Red and Blue bands for this specific study is that Red band is more aggressive towards changes in the state of the crop. The selected band set is used for the observation of the field to detect an accurate harvest period. The proposed approach is validated using Sentinel-1 SAR coherence time series and found to be accurate. ©2021 IEEE","Harvesting; Infrared devices; Observatories; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Crop harvest detection; Crop yield; Multi-spectral; Multi-spectral data; NDVI; Remote-sensing; Spectral signature; Times series; Wheat harvest; Winter wheat; Crops","Crop harvest detection; NDVI; Remote sensing; Time series","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129817150"

In recent years, however, they are being lost or exploited as croplands due to natural or man-made stressors (1.4 percent in 5 years within the USA). This decline in the extent of wetlands began legislative activity at a national scale that mandate the regulate use of wetlands. As such, the need for cost-effective, robust, and semi-automated techniques for wetland preservation is ever-increasing in the current era. In this study, we developed a workflow for wetland inventorying on a state-wide scale using optimal incorporation of dual-polarimetry Sentinel-1, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 and dual polarimetry ALOS-PALSAR with the Random Forest (RF) classifier in Google Earth Engine (GEE). A total of 45 features from a stack of multi-season/multi-year SAR and Optical imagery (included more than 5000 imagery) was extracted over Minnesota state, USA. We followed the Cowardin classification scheme for clustering the field data. The classification was performed in two levels in 5 different ecozones that cover the Minnesota state. Depending on the availability field data for each ecozone overall accuracies changed from 77% to 85%. The variable importance analysis suggests that Sentinel-2 spectral features are dominant in terms of their capability for wetland delineation. Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficient was also superior among other SAR features. Ultimately, the results of this study shall illustrate the applicability of free of charge earth observation data coupled with the advanced machine learning techniques that are available in GEE for better restoration and management of wetlands.  © Author(s) 2021.","Backscattering; Classification (of information); Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Digital storage; Ellipsometry; Laws and legislation; Learning systems; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Storage as a service (STaaS); Automated techniques; Backscattering coefficients; Classification scheme; Earth observation data; Legislative activities; Machine learning techniques; Nutrient assimilation; Variable importances; Wetlands","Classification; Geo-Big data; Google Earth Engine; Machine Learning; Minnesota; Random Forest","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113171557"

Detection of beetle infestation is a forest health monitoring (FHM) priority but is hampered by the challenges of detecting early stage (“green”) attack from the air. There is indication that green stage might be detected from vertical gradients of spectral data or from shortwave infrared information distributed within a single crown. To evaluate the efficacy of discriminating “non-infested”, “green”, and “dead” health statuses at the landscape scale in Alaska, USA, this study conducted spectral and structural fusion of data from: (1) Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral (6 cm) + structure from motion point clouds (~700 pts m−2); and (2) Goddard Lidar Hyperspectral Thermal (G-LiHT) hyperspectral (400 to 1000 nm, 0.5 m) + SWIR-band lidar (~32 pts m−2). We achieved 78% accuracy for all three health statuses using spectral + structural fusion from either UAV or G-LiHT and 97% accuracy for non-infested/dead using G-LiHT. We confirm that UAV 3D spectral (e.g., greenness above versus below median height in crown) and lidar apparent reflectance metrics (e.g., mean reflectance at 99th percentile height in crown), are of high value, perhaps capturing the vertical gradient of needle degradation. In most classification exercises, UAV accuracy was lower than G-LiHT indicating that collecting ultra-high spatial resolution data might be less important than high spectral resolution information. While the value of passive optical spectral information was largely confined to the discrimination of non-infested versus dead crowns, G-LiHT hyperspectral band selection (~400, 675, 755, and 940 nm) could inform future FHM mission planning regarding optimal wavelengths for this task. Interestingly, the selected regions mostly did not align with the band designations for our UAV multispectral data but do correspond to, e.g., Sentinel-2 red edge bands, suggesting a path forward for moderate scale bark beetle detection when paired with suitable structural data. © 2021 by the authors.

In this contribution, a simple framework based on supervised learning and automatic training data annotation is shown, which allows to map inland water bodies from Sentinel satellite data on large scale, i.e. on state level. Using the German state of Bavaria as an example and different combinations of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery as inputs, potentials and limits for the automatic detection of water surfaces for rivers, lakes, and reservoirs are investigated. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm that fully automatic large-scale inland water body mapping is generally possible from Sentinel data; whereas, the best result is achieved when all available surface-related bands of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are fused on a pixel level. The main limitation arises from missed smaller water bodies, which are not observed in bands with a resolution of about 20 m. Given the simplicity of the proposed approach and the open availability of the Sentinel data, the study confirms the potential for a fully automatic large-scale mapping of inland water with cloud-based remote sensing techniques. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bavaria; Germany; aquatic environment; automation; data processing; mapping; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; supervised learning","Copernicus data; Data fusion; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Water mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086029687"

PROSAIL model [PROpriétésSPECTrales (PROSPECT) and Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL) models] was used to simulate CCC. CCC maps were generated through an Automated Radiative Transfer Model Operator (ARTMO) using the PROSAIL model and Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) imagery. The Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry, and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model was used to simulate SIF emitted at 740 nm (SIF740), at 760 nm (SIF760), and top of canopy (SIFTOC) (640-850 nm). The SCOPE model, configured with the specification of the Sentinel-2 sensor, simulates SIF within the spectrum range of 640-850 nm. A non-linear logarithmic relationship (R2>0.9, p < 0.05) was observed between simulated SIF and simulated CCC. Simulated CCC was linearly related to observed CCC with R2 0.88, 0.92 and 0.89 and RMSE = 0.04, 0.17 and 0.09 gm/m2 at p < 0.05 for summer, post-monsoon and early winter respectively. Whereas, the simulated CCC did not capture the full range of CCC variability for the post-monsoon season. Simulated SIF (SIF760) was well correlated with SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite with R2 0.68, 0.73 and 0.73 (RMSE = <1 W/m2/sr/μm, p < 0.05) for the month of summer (April), pre-monsoon (May) and early winter season (November) respectively. Temporal SIFTOC effectively captured the seasonal variability associated with the phenology of deciduous tree species. Among various Sentinel-2 MSI derived VIs, Red Edge NDVI (RENDVI) exhibited maximum sensitivity with SIF (highest monthly average R2> 0.6, p < 0.05).

To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (~0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of >0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Algae; Debris; Infrared devices; Microplastic; Pixels; Reflection; Satellites; Sensitivity analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrum analysis; Marine debris; Microplastics; Near infrared spectral; Planetscope/DOVE; Remote detection; Remote-sensing; Resolution; Sensitivity; Sentinel-2; Spectral band; algorithm; detection method; experimental study; marine pollution; near infrared; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; visible spectrum; Remote sensing","Marine debris; Microplastics; PlanetScope/DOVE; Remote sensing; Resolution; Sensitivity; Sentinel-2; Spectral bands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103979274"

Using data collected from laboratory experiments and by the Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) satellite instruments, we conduct simulated experiments to determine the lower detection limit and discrimination limit for these two macroalgae in different water environments and under different atmospheric conditions. For OLCI, the detection limit for both macroalgae is about 0.5% of a pixel, while the discrimination limit varies between 0.8% for clear water and 2% for turbid water. For MSI, the detection limit is about 2%, while the discrimination limit is about 6% for all water types. Below these two limits, detection and discrimination of macroalgae in these regions using the two sensors are subject to large uncertainties, thus requiring additional caution when interpreting algae areas and tracing algae origins. © 2021","China; Eutrophication; Sargassum; Satellite Imagery; Ulva; China; eutrophication; Sargassum; satellite imagery; Ulva","Detection limit; Discrimination limit; East China Sea; MSI; OLCI; Remote sensing; Sargassum horneri; Ulva prolifera; Yellow sea","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102083138"

The Shiyang River Basin, an inland river basin, is one of the most prominent water resource shortage regions with intensive agriculture activities in northwestern China. However, a free crop map with high spatial resolution is not available in the Shiyang River Basin. The European Space Agency (ESA) satellite Sentinel-2 has multi-spectral bands ranging in the visible-red edge-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-RE-NIR-SWIR) spectrum. Understanding the impact of spectral-temporal information on crop classification is helpful for users to select optimized spectral bands combinations and temporal window in crop mapping when using Sentinel-2 data. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data acquired in the growing season in 2019 were applied to the random forest algorithm to generate the crop classification map at 10 m spatial resolution for the Shiyang River Basin. Four experiments with different combinations of feature sets were carried out to explore which Sentinel-2 information was more effective for higher crop classification accuracy. The results showed that the augment of multi-spectral and multi-temporal information of Sentinel-2 improved the accuracy of crop classification remarkably, and the improvement was firmly related to strategies of feature selections. Compared with other bands, red-edge band 1 (RE-1) and shortwave-infrared band 1 (SWIR-1) of Sentinel-2 showed a higher competence in crop classification. The combined application of images in the early, middle and late crop growth stage is significant for achieving optimal performance. A relatively accurate classification (overall accuracy = 0.94) was obtained by utilizing the pivotal spectral bands and dates of image. In addition, a crop map with a satisfied accuracy (overall accuracy > 0.9) could be generated as early as late July. This study gave an inspiration in selecting targeted spectral bands and period of images for acquiring more accurate and timelier crop map. The proposed method could be transferred to other arid areas with similar agriculture structure and crop phenology. © 2020 by the authors.

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques - a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images - were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods - based on different strategies and tools - have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper).

One of the methodologies applied for this purpose is precision agriculture, which, together with the technological tools and equipment (Global Navigation Satellite Systems, Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems and drones), form an integrated agricultural system based on information of crop production and evolution. Measures of the interaction response from electromagnetic radiation (ER) with soil and vegetation are a basis for the development of agricultural yields and harvest index predictors. In this research, spectral signatures and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were analyzed for maize, soybean, rice and oat crops in a growing area of 320 ha, located in the city of Tremembé (São Paulo-Brazil) for the summer harvest period from November to March of the crop cycles of 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, through the use of multi-spectral images of Sentinel-2 satellite platform (and one image from Landsat-8 to cover the missing image for December 2017). The results showed a higher spectral response (especially in the RedEdge and Near-InfraRed) for soybean crops, followed by rice and corn around the 60–90 days of sowing, and a decrease with the approach to the harvest. In addition, were found higher NDVI values to the crop cycle 2017/2018 (0.962), around 55–80 days of sowing for the soybean and rice crops.

The Iran-Iraq earthquake occurred in Kermanshah Province, Iran in November 2017. It was a 7.4-magnitude seismic event that caused immense damages and loss of life. The rapid detection of damages caused by earthquakes is of great importance for disaster management. Thanks to their wide coverage, high resolution, and low cost, remote-sensing images play an important role in environmental monitoring. This study presents a new damage detection method at the unsupervised level, using multitemporal optical and radar images acquired through Sentinel imagery. The proposed method is applied in two main phases: (1) automatic built-up extraction using spectral indices and active learning framework on Sentinel-2 imagery; (2) damage detection based on the multitemporal coherence map clustering and similarity measure analysis using Sentinel-1 imagery. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it is an unsupervised method with simple usage, a low computing burden, and using medium spatial resolution imagery that has good temporal resolution and is operative at any time and in any atmospheric conditions, with high accuracy for detecting deformations in buildings. The accuracy analysis of the proposed method found it visually and numerically comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for built-up area detection. The proposed method is capable of detecting built-up areas with an accuracy of more than 96% and a kappa of about 0.89 in overall comparison to other methods. Furthermore, the proposed method is also able to detect damaged regions compared to other state-of-the-art damage detection methods with an accuracy of more than 70%. © 2020 by the authors.

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides a library of algorithms and a powerful application programming interface (API) to produce flexible cloud-based applications that leverage Google's computing infrastructure for geospatial analysis. We introduce ”Spectral Point”, a new GUI tool developed in GEE that allows users to explore, process and extract multispectral data rapidly within a single browser window. The ability to access and measure spectral signals from surface deposits using the entire available Landsat and Sentinel 2 archive is of tremendous benefit to geomorphic research, removing the need to download and process terabytes worth of imagery. Spectral values from composite imagery collected in GEE that relate to changes in surface mineral composition agree with corresponding point values using conventional desktop Landsat processing. The ”Spectral Point” tool makes it fast and simple to extract quantitative, contrast-corrected brightness data from multispectral imagery compared conventional desktop-based approaches. At the same time, the user needs no experience developing code, proprietary third-party software or dedicated high-performance computing and only a modern web browser. The ”Spectral Point” tool has many potential applications in the remote study of Earth's surface; for example, we explore a case study from the western United States that demonstrates how the tool can be used for mapping, geochronology, and estimating weathering rates for Quaternary landforms. With increasing numbers of satellites, we are now faced with a growing deluge of geospatial data. Cloud-based solutions to mapping, field reconnaissance and image processing will be increasingly necessary to handle this valuable but untapped satellite image resource. ”Spectral Point” is an example of a new generation of web-based remote sensing tools available for Earth scientists, leveraging the revolution in cloud-based processing power and access to entire satellite image archives. © 2019","United States; Application programming interfaces (API); Cloud computing; Data handling; Data mining; Engines; Geochronology; Geomorphology; Landforms; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Web browsers; Cloud-based applications; Computing infrastructures; Geo-spatial analysis; Google earths; High performance computing; Multi-spectral data; Multi-spectral imagery; Western United States; geomorphology; GIS; image processing; Internet; Landsat; multispectral image; remote sensing; sampling; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; Image processing","Cloud computing; Geomorphology; Google Earth Engine; Image processing; Multispectral data; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076860195"

The complexity increases with urban and peri-urban forests because of the variety of features that exist in remote sensing images. The success of forest management that includes forest preservation depends strongly on the accuracy of forest-type classification. Several classification methods are used to map urban and peri-urban forests and to identify healthy and non-healthy ones. Some of these methods have shown success in the classification of forests where others failed. The successful methods used specific remote sensing data technology, such as hyper-spectral and very high spatial resolution (VHR) images. However, both VHR and hyper-spectral sensors are very expensive, and hyper-spectral sensors are not widely available on satellite platforms, unlike multi-spectral sensors. Moreover, aerial images are limited in use, very expensive, and hard to arrange and manage. To solve the aforementioned problems, an advanced method, self-organizing–deep learning (SO-UNet), was created to classify forests in the urban and peri-urban environment using multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and medium spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images. SO-UNet is a combination of two different machine learning technologies: artificial neural network unsupervised self-organizing maps and deep learning UNet. Many experiments have been conducted, and the results showed that SO-UNet overwhelms UNet significantly.

In practice, however, such vector borne diseases are notoriously difficult to predict due to their seemingly sporadic spatial and temporal outbreak patterns. Recent research has demonstrated that mosquito abundance is causally related to WNV/SLE prevalence, providing a practical starting point for developing mosquito-borne disease forecasting systems. When focusing on building mosquito population models, understanding the reproduction environment of Culex mosquitos (WNV and SLE’s primary vectors) is key: they rely on warmth, water, and vegetation to reproduce. Previous work has shown that global-coverage multispectral imagery (MSI) (i.e., Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) is a valuable resource for characterizing vegetation health as a predictor of mosquito population, but it is limited in that it may not provide the spatial resolution necessary to distinguish between, e.g., a well-fertilized lawn (poor Culex habitat) and a stand of trees (good Culex habitat). The backscatter information collected by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery provides opportunity to distinguish between broader categories of vegetation type, potentially helping to fill this gap. This research uses publicly available global-coverage MSI and SAR imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1) to explore if vegetation type, in tandem with vegetation health, improves our ability to forecast mosquito populations. Vegetation characterization is done over the Greater Toronto Area from 2014 to 2017, and we derive weekly time series from MSI, spectral indices, and SAR for this time period. We then quantify the strength of vegetation health and type as a predictor of Culex abundance. © 2021 SPIE.","Cell proliferation; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Health; Hyperspectral imaging; Image enhancement; Population statistics; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Viruses; Backscatter information; Greater Toronto Area; Mosquito populations; Mosquito-borne disease; Multi-spectral imagery; Spatial resolution; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Vector-borne disease; Radar imaging","Multispectral imagery; NDVI; Random forest; Synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108716050"

The collection of stream samples is not only time-consuming but also very costly. However, the advancements in space remote sensing has made it a suitable alternative for mapping of the geochemical elements using satellite spectral reflectance. In this research work, 407 surface stream sediment samples of the zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) elements are collected from Central Wales. Five machine learning models, namely the Support Vector Regression (SVR), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) regression, are applied for prediction of the Zn and Pb concentrations using the Sentinel-2 satellite multi-spectral images. The results obtained based on the 10 m spatial resolution show that Zn is best predicted with RF with significant R2 values of 0.74 (p < 0.01) and 0.7 (p < 0.01) during training and testing. However, for Pb, the best prediction is made by SVR with significant R2 values of 0.72 (p < 0.01) and 0.64 (p < 0.01) for training and testing, respectively. Overall, the performance of SVR and RF outperforms the other machine learning models with the highest testing R2 values. © 2021, Shahrood University of Technology.

Accurate maps of grazing lawn distribution is essential to enhance understanding of important ecosystem processes such as mega-herbivore population dynamics, nutrient cycling and plant community composition. The inherent heterogeneity of savannah landscapes however creates significant challenges for accurate discrimination of vegetation components and thus grazing lawn detection. Recent studies favour very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-spectral imagery for dealing with this challenge. However, such data are costly for use in operational management. Planet Labs, through Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), now grant free access to high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics over the tropics, with great potential for fine-scale vegetation mapping. However, the spectral characteristics of these data are limited and fail to resolve the spectral similarity of different savannah vegetation components. We address these issues using Gram-Schmidt transformation to fuse Planet Basemaps and Sentinel-2A images for grazing lawn detection within the Lower Sabie region of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The original and fused images were classified using a random forest approach. Overall, the fused image achieved the best grazing lawn detection accuracy (0.85) and general map accuracy (0.72) results compared to Sentinel-2 (0.67 and 0.62) and Planet basemap (0.64 and 0.62 respectively). Our findings provide a foundation for cost-effective and accurate high spatial resolution vegetation mapping in heterogenous savannah landscapes.

In many cases, this major threat leads to loss of arable land, reduces crop productivity, groundwater resources loss, increases economic costs for soil management, and ultimately increases the probability of soil erosion. Monitoring soil salinity distribution and degree of salinity and mapping the electrical conductivity (EC) using remote sensing techniques are crucial for land use management. Salt-effected soil is a predominant phenomenon in the Eshtehard Salt Lake located in Alborz, Iran. In this study, the potential of Sentinel-2 imagery was investigated for mapping and monitoring soil salinity. According to the satellite's pass, different salt properties were measured for 197 soil samples in the field data study. Therefore several spectral features, such as satellite band reflectance, salinity indices, and vegetation indices, were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery. To build an optimum machine learning regression model for soil salinity estimation, three different regression models, including Gradient Boost Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF), were used. The XGBoostmethod outperformed GBM and RF with the coefficient of determination (R2) more than 76%, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) about 0.84 dS m-1, and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) about 0.33 dS m-1. The results demonstrated that the integration of remote sensing data, field data, and using an appropriate machine learning model could provide high-precision salinity maps to monitor soil salinity as an environmental problem. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was used for monitoring the vigor of the study field. Next, the vigor maps from the two satellite platforms with those derived from UAV were compared by statistical analysis in order to evaluate the contribution made by each platform for monitoring onion crops. Besides, the two coverage’s classes of the field, bare soil and onions, were spatially identified using geographical object-based image classification (GEOBIA), and their spectral contribution was analyzed comparing the SAVI calculated considering only crop pixels (i.e., SAVI onions) and that calculated considering only bare soil pixels (i.e., SAVI soil) with the SAVI from the three platforms. The results showed that satellite imagery, coherent and correlated with UAV images, could be useful to assess the general conditions of the field while UAV permits to discriminate localized circumscribed areas that the lowest resolution of satellites missed, where there are conditions of inhomogeneity in the field, determined by abiotic or biotic stresses. © 2020 by the authors.

Agriculture relies on healthy soil for crop growth and animal grazing. Water retention reduces the risks of desertification and of flooding as the capacity to retain water reduces the rate of surface water flow. In addition, soil organic carbon represents the largest terrestrial carbon stock and is second only to the oceans. Yet, soil health is threatened by intensive farming practices and changes of land use such as deforestation. Thus, it is important to manage soil health to maintain food security, avoid desertification and maintain or ideally increase soil organic carbon storage. A useful tool to inform this management function would be a machine learning model that can predict soil health given land cover and parameters of the abiotic context, such as terrain elevation and historical weather data. The first step in developing such a model is to be able to identify the land cover for a chosen area. Satellites provide multi-spectral images that include the visual bands.

The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015. The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring. © 2018","NASA; Quality assurance; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Time series; Analysis Ready Data; Harmonization; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Virtual Constellation; bidirectional reflectance; data processing; data quality; data set; error analysis; harmonic analysis; Landsat; MODIS; nadir; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial resolution; surface reflectance; Distribution functions","Analysis Ready Data; Harmonization; Landsat; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Virtual Constellation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053595296"

This study presents a new AGB estimation method and demonstrates the potential of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data application as an alternative to hyperspectral data in inaccessible regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a buffer zone community forest in Parsa National Park, Nepal, using field-based AGB as a dependent variable, as well as spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model effectiveness. The effect of the input variable number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all extracted spectral information plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 25.57 t ha-1). Incorporating the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but reduced the error slightly. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in flat topography with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying altitude would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass; Conservation; Decision trees; Environmental protection; Estimation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Sustainable development; Vegetation; 10-fold cross-validation; Above ground biomass; Independent variables; Random forests; Sentinel-2; Spectral information; Spectral vegetation indices; Sustainable management; Forestry","Above-ground biomass (AGB); Medium-resolution; Random forest (RF); Sentinel-2; Sustainable management","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045969131"

While field surveys are time consuming and expensive, remote sensing techniques offer an efficient and fast alternative. The Copernicus programme provides large amounts of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data that can be used for this purpose. This study presents two methods for forest cover classification, one using a multitemporal dataset of SAR images from one orbit, and the other combining SAR images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits and almost cloud-free (<10%) multi-spectral images. The SAR-LC classification system, a rule-based decision tree which is designed to classify land cover types using radar backscatter is used to extract forest cover extent from the 2016 dataset. For the second method, Sentinel-1 images from 2017 in both ascending and descending orbits are combined with 10 m resampled almost cloud free Sentinel-2 images to form one multi-temporal dataset with 88 bands. This is then segmented into objects before forest extent is classified using a rule-based classification. The SAR-LC thresholds were optimised to include the ReNDVI values from the Sentinel-2 images for this purpose. While the final objective of this study is to produce forest cover maps for the whole of Germany, this paper will only focus on the forests around the region of Frankfurt.

The first step in finding such a solution is providing accurate information about the severity and extent of the salinity spread in affected areas; this can be done by mapping the electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil. Utilizing the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery along with remote sensing techniques is a promising method to map salinity, as it allows for large-scale monitoring and provides high accuracy and efficiency. This paper, therefore, aims at assessing soil salinity by mapping the EC of soils, using satellite imagery from the newly launched Sentinel-2 satellite as well as Landsat-8 data. A field study was carried out using those data, and various salt features were extracted that relate the EC values of field samples to satellite-derived salt features. The study used two different regression approaches MLP and SVR. Additionally, two feature selection algorithms, GA and SFS, were implemented on the data to improve model performance. The study concludes that the proposed method for modeling salinity and the mapping of soil EC can be considered an effective approach for soil salinity monitoring. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

In light of this problem, we present a systematic examination of the role of tri-band deep convolutional neural networks in flood prediction. Using Sentinel-2 data we explore the suitability of different deep convolutional architectures in a flood detection task; in particular we examine the utility of VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet50 and EfficientNet. Importantly our analysis considers the questions of different band combinations and the issue of pre-trained versus non-pre-trained model application. Our experiment shows that a 0.96 F1 score is achievable for our task through appropriate combinations of spectral bands and convolutional neural networks. For flood detection, three-band combinations of RB8aB11 and RB11B outperformed 33 other combinations when trained with pre-trained ResNet18 and other models. Our analysis further demonstrates a strong performance by pre-trained models despite the fact that these pre-trained models were originally trained on different spectral bands.

Even where practically applicable, the traditional “boots on the ground” methods are labour intensive and expensive, thus imposing burden on poor countries struggling to meet other urgent pressing daily needs, i.e., food and medicine. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide a more efficient and effective way of collecting data for coastline shift analysis. However, moderate spatio-temporal resolution RS products such as the widely used Landsat products (30 m and 16 days) may be insufficient where high accuracy is desired. In 2015, Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) remotely sensed products with higher spatio-temporal resolution (10 m and 5 days) and high spectral resolution (13 bands), which promises to improve coastline movement monitoring to high accuracy, was launched. Using two war-impacted countries (Liberia and Somalia) as case studies of regions with data deficiency or of poor quality, for the period 2015–2018, this contribution aims at (i) assessing the suitability of the new freely available high spatio-temporal Sentinel-2 products to monitor coastline shift, (ii) assessing the possibility of filling the missing Sentinel-2 gaps with Landsat 8 panchromatic band (15 m) products to provide alternative data source for mapping of coastline movements where Sentinel-2 data is unusable, e.g., due to cloud cover, and (iii), undertake a comparative analysis between Sentinel-2 (10 m), Landsat panchromatic (15 m), and Landsat multi-spectral (30 m). The results of the evaluation indicate 23% (on average) improvement gained by using Sentinel-2 compared to the traditional Landsat 30 m resolution data (i.e., 32% for Liberia and 14% for Somalia). A comparison of 100 check points from Google Earth Pro (i.e., surrogate in-situ reference data) show 91% agreement for Liberia and 85% for Somalia, indicating the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for future coastal shift studies, particularly for the data deficient regions. The results of comparative studies for Sentinel-2, Landsat panchromatic (PAN), and Landsat multi-spectral (MS) show that the percentages of Sentinel-2 and Landsat PAN that falls within 10 m threshold is much higher than Landsat MS by 35% and 26%, respectively, and for the 2016–2017 period, they provide more detailed mapping of the Liberian coastline compared to Landsat MS (30 m). Finally, panchromatic Landsat data with 15 m resolution are found to be capable of filling the missing Sentinel-2 gaps, i.e., where cloud cover hampers its usability. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Liberia [West Africa]; Somalia; accuracy assessment; cloud cover; coastal zone; Landsat; remote sensing; Sentinel; spectral resolution; World Wide Web","Coastal erosion; Coastal shift; Liberia; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Somalia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063464670"

Moreover, integrating high-resolution satellite TIR data to calibrate hydrological models is a powerful information to efficiently monitor crop water use. Conversely, no single sensor meets these combined requirements in the TIR spectral region. Data fusion approaches offer an alternative to exploit observations from multiple sensors, providing image data to meet the combined requirements on spatial and temporal resolution. A novel spatio-temporal data fusion workflow based on a multi-sensor multi-resolution algorithm was developed and applied to generate TIR synthetic image data at high temporal and spatial resolution. The workflow includes two steps: in the first step, synthetic daily radiance images at Top of Atmosphere (TOA) and 30-m spatial resolution (at the ground) are generated using TIR radiometric data at TOA collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily 1-km and Landsat 8/TIRS 16-day 30-m. This procedure is applied to two image pairs on different dates. The workflow yields an estimator to generate TIR TOA radiance data on any given date, provided a MODIS radiance image is available. The next step applies constrained unmixing of the 30 m (now considered as low-resolution) TIR images using the information about sub-pixel land-cover obtained from co-registered images at higher spatial resolution in the VNIR (Visible Near InfraRed) spectrum. In our case study, the L8/TIRS synthetic image data were unmixed to the Sentinel 2/MSI with 10 m × 10 m spatial resolution. Two geographically diverse experiments were carried out using the same procedure: one in The Netherlands to evaluate the procedure and other in Puglia (Italy) to generate a time series of the 10-m × 10-m TIR image data product.

To enhance these time series, data from multiple satellite systems need to be integrated. Landsat image data is a valuable 30-meter resolution source of spatial information to assess forest conditions over time. Together both operational Landsat satellites—7 and 8—provide a revisit frequency of 8 days at the equator. This moderate temporal frequency provides essential information to detect annual large area abrupt land cover changes. However, the ability to measure subtle and short lived intraseasonal changes is challenged by gaps in Landsat imagery at key points in time. The first Sentinel-2 satellite mission was launched by the European Space Agency in 2015. This moderate resolution data stream provides an opportunity to supplement the Landsat data record. The objective of this study is to assess the potential for integrating top of atmosphere Landsat and Sentinel 2 image data archived in the Google Earth Engine compute environment. In this paper we assess absolute and proportional differences in near-contemporaneous observations for six bands with comparable spectral response functions and spatial resolution between the Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument and Landsat Operational Land Imager and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. We assessed differences using absolute difference metrics and major axis linear regression between over 10,000 image pairs across the conterminous United States and present cross sensor transformation models. Major axis linear regression results indicate that Sentinel MSI data are as spectrally comparable to the two types of Landsat image data as the Landsat sensors are with each other. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values ranging from 0.0121 to 0.0398 were obtained between MSI and Landsat spectral values, and RMSD values ranging from 0.0124 and 0.0372 were obtained between OLI and ETM+. Despite differences in their spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics, integration of these datasets appears to be feasible through the application of bandwise linear regression corrections. © 2018","United States; Earth atmosphere; Linear regression; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space flight; Time series; Change detection; Enhanced thematic mappers; LANDSAT; Multiple satellite systems; Root mean square deviations; Sensor integration; Sentinel-2; Spectral response functions; detection method; empirical analysis; land cover; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite mission; satellite sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; time series; time series analysis; top of atmosphere; Image enhancement","Change detection; ETM+; Landsat; MSI; OLI; Sensor integration; Sentinel-2; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057001016"

For that purpose, data from 94 Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations over Europe and adjacent regions, covering a wide geographical region with a variety of climate and environmental conditions and during the period between March 2017 and December 2018 have been used. The comparison between ESA-L2A and AERONET shows a better agreement for IWV than the AOT, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 5.33% and 9.04%, respectively. This conclusion is also reflected in the values of R2, which are 0.99 and 0.65 for IWV and AOT, respectively. The study period was divided into two sub-periods, before and after 15 January 2018, when the Sentinel-2A spectral response functions of bands 1 and 2 (centered at 443 and 492 nm) were updated by ESA, in order to investigate if the lack of agreement in the AOT values was connected to the use of incorrect spectral response functions. The comparison of ESA-L2A AOT with AERONET measurements showed a better agreement for the second sub-period, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.08 in comparison with 0.14 in the first sub-period. This same conclusion was attained considering mean bias error (MBE) values that decreased from 0.09 to 0.01. The ESA-L2A AOT values estimated with the new spectral response functions were closer to the correspondent reference AERONET values than the ones obtained using the previous spectral response functions. IWV was not affected by this change since the retrieval algorithm does not use bands 1 and 2 of Sentinel-2.

Currently, the availability of the new generation of medium resolution, such as the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2 satellite, offers new opportunities for long-term high-temporal frequency for Earth's surfaces observation and monitoring. This paper focuses on the analysis and the comparison of the visible, the near-infrared (VNIR), and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the MSI for soil salinity discrimination in an arid landscape. To achieve these, a field campaign was organized, and 160 soil samples were collected with various degrees of soil salinity, including non-saline soil samples. The bidirectional reflectance factor was measured above each soil sample in a goniometric laboratory using an ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) spectroradiometer. In the laboratory work, pHs, electrical conductivity (EC-Lab), and the major soluble cations (Na+, K+, Ca2++, and Mg2+) and anions (CO3                             2-, HCO3                             -, Cl-, and SO4                             2-) were measured using extraction from a saturated soil paste, and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was calculated using a standard procedure. These parameters, in addition to the field observations, were used to interpret and investigate the spectroradiometric measurements and their relevant transformations using the continuum removed reflectance spectrum (CRRS) and the first derivative (FD). Moreover, the acquired spectra over all the soil samples were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands using the Canadian Modified Herman transfer radiative code (CAM5S) and the relative spectral response profiles characterizing the Sentinel-MSI band filters. The statistical analyses conducted were based on the second-order polynomial regression (p < 0.05) between the measured EC-Lab and the reflectances in the MSI convolved spectral bands. The results obtained indicate the limitation of VNIR bands and the potential of SWIR domain for soil salinity classes' discrimination. The CRRS and the FD analyses highlighted a serious spectral-signal confusion between the salt and the soil optical properties (i.e., color and brightness) in the VNIR bands. Likewise, the results stressed the independence of the SWIR domain vis-a-vis these soil artifacts and its capability to differentiate significantly among several soil salinity classes. Moreover, the statistical fit between each MSI individual spectral band and EC-Lab corroborates this trend, which revealed that only the SWIR bands were correlated significantly (R2 of 50% and 64%, for SWIR-1 and SWIR-2, respectively), while the R2 between the VNIR bands and EC-Lab remains less than 9%. According to the convergence of these four independent analysis methods, it is concluded that the Sentinel-MSI SWIR bands are excellent candidates for an integration in soil salinity modeling and monitoring at local, regional, and global scales. © 2018 by the authors.","Earth atmosphere; Electric conductivity; Finite difference method; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Laboratories; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Electrical conductivity; Field spectra; Laboratory analysis; Sentinel-MSI; Short wave infrared; Soil salinity; Visible near-infrared; Soil surveys","Electrical conductivity; Field spectra; Laboratory analyses; Remote sensing; Sentinel-MSI; Shortwave infrared wavelength regions; Soil salinity; Visible near infrared","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048990490"

In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our network, which we call DSen2, outperforms the best competing approach by almost 50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics.

The present study will contribute to increase the stakeholders' interest to wetlands condition and possibilities for better management aiming at improving the ecosystems services they provide. For the research of the wetland in the area of quarry lakes in Negovan village interim ecological monitoring (IEM) using remote sensing data after restoration measures have been implemented. The aim of IEM is to obtain results for the wetland actual condition and restoration process efficiency for ecosystems services assessment. Based on the generated data an interim ecological monitoring methodology (MIEM) implying different remote sensing data (different temporal intervals, spectral and spatial resolution) has been designed. The model functions entirely within Geographical Information System (GIS). It generates data for the actual environmental condition of the wetland in different temporal intervals. The obtained results for the wetland actual condition have been used for defining the values of Disturbance Index (DI), which in turn is defined based on orthogonalization of multispectral satellite data from Sentinel 2-Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat for different temporal intervals. DI rates are determined through Wetness component and Greenness component. Ecosystem services are assigned based on the correlation between vegetation and water surface area that is connected to water balance/budget. The space distribution of vegetation is specified on the base of Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI) for different temporal intervals of the research.

The Sentinel-2 missions carrying multi-spectral instrument (MSI) sensors with 13 multispectral bands are potentially useful for estimating FVC. However, the performance of these bands for FVC estimation is unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the performance of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral band reflectances on FVC estimation. The samples, including the Sentinel-2 MSI canopy reflectances and corresponding FVC values, were simulated using the PROSPECT + SAIL radiative transfer model under different conditions, and random forest regression (RFR) method was then used to develop FVC estimation models and assess the performance of various band reflectances for FVC estimation. These models were finally evaluated using field survey data. The results indicate that the three most important bands of Sentinel-2 MSI data for FVC estimation are band 4 (Red), band 12 (SWIR2) and band 8a (NIR2). FVC estimation using these bands has a comparable accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.085) with that using all bands (RMSE = 0.090). The results also demonstrate that band 12 had a better performance for FVC estimation than the green band (RMSE = 0.097). However, the newly added red-edge bands, with low scores in the RFR model, have little significance for improving FVC estimation accuracy compared with the Red, NIR2 and SWIR2 bands. © 2018 by the authors.","Decision trees; Mean square error; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Canopy reflectance; Earth surface process; Estimation models; Fractional vegetation cover; Radiative transfer model; Random forests; Root mean square errors; Variable selection; Vegetation","Fractional vegetation cover; Random forest regression; Sentinel-2 satellites; Variable selection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058894821"

And when the correlation between LAI and band reflectance were performed using data consist of three growth stages, the correlation coefficient for all tested bands reach significant level (P<0.001), and the maximum correlation coefficient was 0.943 of near-infrared narrow band B8a, which center at 865 nm with a wave width of 32 nm. The accuracy of LAI estimation at different development stages was optimized using the near-infrared band B8 which with a central wavelength of 842 nm and a wave width of 145 nm, with all RMSE smaller than 0.465. 2) for seventeen LAI related vegetation indices, including EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI2 (Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index 2), IRECI (Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index), etc., most of them were significantly (P<0.001) correlated with LAI, especially atmospheric correction index EVI, soil adjusted index MSAVI2, and red-edge index IRECI, and the coefficient of correlation were over 0.8. EVI provided the best result for LAI estimation at bud stage and boll stage, and at flowering stage it consists by MASVI2, with bud stage RMSE=0.352, and boll stage RMSE=0.367 and flowering stage RMSE=0.323, respectively. 3) LAI estimation models for whole growth stages performed better than these for one single growth stage. And the best LAI estimation models for whole growth period using single spectral band reflectance and vegetation index were respectively obtained by near-infrared narrow band B8a and IRECI, with IRECI performed slightly better, which with R2=0.908 and RMSE=0.425 for LOOCV, and R2=0.951 and RMSE=0.368 for cross validation. Additionally, when apply IRECI-LAI estimation model for whole growth stages on one single growth stage LAI estimation, the accuracy comparison between the IRECI-LAI model and single growth stage LAI models showed that the average cross validation RMSE was only 0.07 greater than the average LOOCV RMSE, indicating the good universality of LAI estimation model for whole growth stages. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Monitoring Plastic-Mulched Land-cover (PML) can provide essential information for making agricultural management decisions and reducing PML's eco-environmental impacts. However, mapping PML with remote sensing data is still challenging and problematic due to its complicated and mixed characteristics. In this study, a new Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach has been proposed to investigate the potential for combined use of Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multi-spectral data to extract PML. Based on the ESP2 tool (Estimation of Scale Parameter 2) and ED2 index (Euclidean Distance 2), the optimal Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS) result is chosen as the basis of following object-based classification. Spectral and backscattering features, index features and texture features from S1 and S2 are adopted in classifying PML and other land-cover types. Three machine-learning classifiers known as the-Classification and Regression Tree (CART), the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) are carried out and compared in this study. The best classification result with an overall accuracy of 94.34% is achieved by using spectral, backscattering, index and textural information from integrated S1 and S2 data with the SVM classifier. Texture information is demonstrated to contribute positively to PML classifications with SVM and RF classifiers. PML mapping using SAR information alone has been greatly improved by the object-based approach to an overall accuracy of 87.72%. By adding SAR data into optical data, the accuracy of object-based PML classifications has also been improved by 1-3%. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture; Backscattering; Decision trees; Environmental impact; Mapping; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; CART; Land cover; Multi resolutions; Object-based classifications; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Classification (of information)","CART; Multi-resolution segmentation (MRS); Object-based classification; Plastic-mulched landcover (PML); RF; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057135901"

It received little attention before the failure event. The fast motion of the slope posed great threats to the safety of nearby villages and the national highway G317 at the foot of the mountain. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)datasets collected by C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX), as well as optical images acquired by Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI)over the landslide site were analyzed to characterize the evolution of the slope before and after the failure event. Firstly, the surface change of the sliding area was qualitatively evaluated using the Sentinel-2 true-color images and pseudo-colored TerraSAR-X amplitude images. Next, the slow movement of the slope before the failure event was detected by interferometry using both TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 data stacks. The maximum displacement rate estimated was larger than −45 mm/year along the radar line of sight (LOS)direction. Finally, the large post-failure displacements of the landslide were successfully retrieved with meter-level accuracy from TerraSAR-X observations using adaptive amplitude offset tracking method. The maximum displacement decreased from about 30 m in 11 days in August 2017 to 1–2 m in 22 days in January 2018 in both LOS and azimuth directions. According to the recent measurements of surface displacement, the landslide body is becoming stabilized gradually, which suggests that the risk of catastrophic collapse of the slope has been largely reduced. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Geometrical optics; Landslides; Satellites; Azimuth direction; Maximum displacement; Offset tracking; Post-failure displacement; Pre-failure displacement; Satellite observations; Surface changes; Surface displacement; displacement; failure analysis; landslide; satellite imagery; Sentinel; slope failure; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; tracking; Synthetic aperture radar","Adaptive pixel offset tracking; Huangnibazi landslide; Post-failure displacement; Pre-failure displacement; Time-series InSAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065813022"

Kilimanjaro-Mountain National Park was specifically designated to protect and safeguard the highest free-standing mountain in the tropics. The park attracts thousands of national and international tourists annually because of its snow capped-summit and the altitudinal gradients, representing the different eco-climatic zones of the world. Earnings from tourism boost the country's economy while ensuring the sustainability of this unique glacial-tropical mountainous forest ecosystem park. Conventional monitoring of key biodiversity and environmental parameters are carried out by park staff, following established guidelines by Tanzania National Parks. However, given the park's geo-morphological nature of mountainous terrain, efficient implementations of the labor intensive in-situ observations are hardly feasible. This research explored the use of Remote Sensing data from the European Satellite Agency- Sentinel- 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument, in developing a state-of-the-art monitoring protocol. The developed methodology ensures that essential biodiversity parameters, including Vegetation Indices, required in monitoring the vast areas of the park and its surroundings in the short-term and long-term, using up to date, high resolutions and frequently available Remote Sensing data from the Sentinel-2 Sensors are captured. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.All rights reserved.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; System theory; Tropics; Biodiversity monitoring; Conventional monitoring; Efficient implementation; Environmental parameter; In-situ observations; Monitoring protocol; Mountainous terrain; Remote sensing data; Ecosystems","Climate-land-use Change; Kilimanjaro-Mountain National Park; Remote Sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation-indices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088386164"

Multispectral satellite data are readily available and cost-effective sources of spectral data compared to costly and technically demanding processing of hyperspectral data. Moreover, their continuous acquisition allows to develop a composite from time-series, increasing the spatial coverage of SOC maps. In this study, an evaluation of the prediction ability of models assessing SOC using real multispectral remote sensing data from different platforms was performed. The study was conducted on a study plot (1.45 km2) in the Chernozem region of South Moravia (Czechia). The adopted methods included field sampling and predictive modeling using satellite multispectral Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope data, and multispectral UAS Parrot Sequoia data. Furthermore, the performance of a soil reflectance composite image from Sentinel-2 data was analyzed. Aerial hyperspectral CASI 1500 and SASI 600 data was used as a reference. Random forest, support vector machine, and the cubist regression technique were applied in the predictive modeling. The prediction accuracy of models using multispectral data, including Sentinel-2 composite, was lower (RPD range from 1.16 to 1.65; RPIQ range from 1.53 to 2.17) compared to the reference model using hyperspectral data (RPD = 2.26; RPIQ = 3.34). The obtained results show very similar prediction accuracy for all spaceborne sensors (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and PlanetScope). However, the spatial correlation between the reference mapping results obtained from the hyperspectral data and other maps using multispectral data was moderately strong. UAS sensors and freely available satellite multispectral data can represent an alternative cost-effective data source for remote SOC mapping on the local scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Decision trees; Forecasting; Organic carbon; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soils; Support vector machines; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bare soils; Multi-spectral; Multispectral remote sensing; Multispectral satellite data; Regression techniques; Satellite multispectral data; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Data handling","Bare soil composite; Multispectral; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; UAS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077852092"

These thematic cartographies offer a first estimation of the crop irrigation requirements, and a biophysical based approach of the temporal and spatial distribution of the crop water use in the cultivated areas. This work describes the operational application of these methodologies, providing valuable information for water governance and management purposes. The basic products obtained in the whole Spanish part of the Iberian Peninsula during the period 2014-2017 were: (i) annual maps of irrigated crops based on time series of multispectral satellite imagery; and (ii) the direct remote sensing-based water accounting, by quantifying agricultural water flows (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, drainage and recharge), through a remote sensing-based soil water balance. Hence this paper provides a remote sensing based water accounting approach, which relies on dense time series of multispectral imagery acquired by the multisensor constellation arranged by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, jointly with meteorological data and agronomic knowledge. Then, based on these purpose and approach, annual and monthly maps of net irrigation water requirements have been elaborated at the most practical spatial and temporal scales for water governance purposes over big areas such river basin districts.

LAI and chlorophyll are two key variables which are desired for studying productivity, nutrient and stress status of vegetation. Studies carried out on croplands using simulated Sentinel-2 MSI and parametric approach have identified vegetation indices (VIs) with high sensitivity to LAI and chlorophyll. To test how Sentinel-2 red-edge based VIs perform for retrieval of LAI and Chlorophyll of tropical mixed forest canopies, this study has been performed. The field measurements of LAI and chlorophyll content were recorded in a total of 28 ESUs (Elementary Sampling Units) in Bhakra range in the Tarai Central Forest Division, Uttarakhand (India). The in-situ measurements were statistically correlated with Sentinel-2VIs and strength of correlation was validated using Predicted Residual Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) statistic. Field LAI corrected for foliage clumpiness effect improved correlation of VIs with LAI.

At the upper elevational limit of forest distribution, patterns of forest advance and stasis can be highly spatially variable. Reliable estimations of forest distribution shifts require assessments of forest change to account for variation in treeline advance across entire mountain ranges. Multispectral satellite remote sensing is well suited to this purpose and is particularly valuable in regions where the scope of field campaigns is restricted. However, there is little understanding of how much information about forest structure at the mountain treeline can be derived from multispectral remote sensing data. Here we combine field data from a structurally diverse treeline ecotone in the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, with data from four multispectral satellite sensors (GeoEye, SPOT-7, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) to identify spectral features that best explain variation in vegetation structure at the mountain treeline and the effect of sensor spatial resolution on the characterisation of structural variation. The green, red and short-wave infrared spectral bands and vegetation indices based on green and short-wave infrared bands offer the best characterisation of forest structure with R                             2                              values reported up to 0.723. There is very little quantitative difference in the ability of the sensors tested here to discriminate between discrete descriptors of vegetation structure (difference of R                             2                                                          MF                              within 0.09). While Landsat-8 is less well suited to defining above-ground woody biomass (R                             2                              0.12–0.29 lower than the alternative sensors), there is little difference between the relationships defined for GeoEye, SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 data (difference in R                             2                              < 0.03). Discrete classifications are best suited to the identification of forest structures indicative of treeline advance or stasis, using a simplified class designation to separate areas of old growth forest, forest advance and grassland habitats. Consequently, our results present a major opportunity to improve quantification of forest range shifts across mountain systems and to estimate the impacts of forest advance on biodiversity and ecosystem function.                          © 2019 The Authors","Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystems; Infrared radiation; Landforms; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Above-ground woody biomass; Biodiversity and ecosystem functions; Ecotone; Global environmental change; Multi-spectral; Multispectral remote sensing; Short wave infrared bands; Treeline; biomass; ecotone; forest edge; image analysis; montane forest; multispectral image; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; species diversity; treeline; Forestry","Biomass; Ecotone; Multispectral; Satellite imagery; Treeline","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060894374"

In this paper, we present a method based on a deep residual convolutional network to fuse the fine and coarse spatial resolution bands to obtain finer spatial resolution versions of the coarse bands. The benefits of the residual design are primarily that the network converges faster and it allows for deeper networks. Also, it improves the spectral consistency of the fused image.

In the context of agriculture, there are many ways to find crop health like visual interpretation, health parameter, existing vegetation indices, etc. For the purpose of monitoring and predicting, we require band values from the satellite data which may lack in providing accurate values because of the several parameters that affect it by which there is a possibility of error because they have to be calibrated. Therefore in this paper, a machine learning based calibration approach is proposed by considering multispectral drone data as in-situ data.

In this study, we used Sentinel-2, the latest multi-spectral satellite image in Europe, and Landsat satellite image, which can detect forest cover before deforestation, to find out where to restore not only the degraded area. Forest area was identified in 1970-1980s using Landsat satellite images and focused on changes in the area. Monthly Sentinel-2 images are calculated as NDVI to identify forest-related covers through phenological change of vegetation. Random forest machine learning classification is used to classify each cover. And for the impact of deforestation also quantified in terms of agriculture and water by multi-spatial model. Agro-environmental variables, agricultural water demand and forest water supply were estimated using the EPIC and InVEST-WY models, respectively. Analysis of deforestation showed that area under forests decreased by 25%, whereas that under cropland increased by 63%, and that the conversion from forest to cropland was the largest for the study period. As a result, agricultural water demand increased and forest water supply decreased, significantly. Analysis of the net impact of deforestation on water budgets using recent climate and two land covers showed that forest water supply decreased by 43% and agricultural water demand increased by 62%. In terms of agro-environment, the negative changes in organic carbon loss, water erosion, and runoff were observed, regardless of the crop type. On newly-converted agricultural lands, runoff is 1.5 times higher and water-driven erosion and soil organic loss are more than twice as high compared to older croplands. The North Korea has declined many benefits from ecosystem attributable to deforestation in recent three decades. In contrast, South Korea has experienced success in national-scale afforestation in recent decades, and North Korea can emulate this. The restoration of forests in North Korea promises more than environmental benefits; it will provide a new growth engine for the prosperity of the Korean Peninsula as a whole. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

Some land cover elements, as the vegetation and, in particular crops, are changing over seasons and over the growing cycle and may be characterized by their spectral temporal variability. In such cases, the spectral temporal variability can be used to model the crop's phenology and predict the crop type using both spatial and temporal spectral data. In this paper we aim to exploit the temporal dimension on the crop type classification using multi-temporal multispectral data and machine learning techniques. The high revisiting frequency of Sentinel-2 satellite opens new possibilities on the exploitation of high temporal resolution multispectral data.

Especially, Sentinel-2 incorporates three red-edge bands with central wavelength at 705, 740 and 783 nm, which are very sensitive to vegetation changing, heath and variations. Unfortunately, their spatial resolution is only 20 m, which is lower comparably. This spatial resolution brings difficulties for mining the potential of Sentinel-2 image in vegetation monitoring. Therefore, we focus on enhancing the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 red edge band images to 10m using the SupReME algorithm. Furthermore, the summer corn canopy leaf area index (LAI), leaves chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) were retrieved by the linear and physical models for the corn growth monitoring purpose. The results showed that the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images had been enhanced to 10m from original 20m, and the estimation accuracy (EA) was over 97% for pixels planted by summer corn. Moreover, the accuracy of summer corn canopy LAI, LCC and CCC was improved respectively using enhanced Sentinel-2 images by SupReME method. During these three parameters retrieval, the red-edge bands or SWIR bands were introduced into optimal cost function and vegetation index which the accuracy of these models was high. The SupReME algorithm provides a valuable way for Sentinel-2 images enhancement, which is of great potential to mining Sentinel-2 images and multitude its application. © 2019","Zea mays; accuracy assessment; algorithm; chlorophyll; leaf area index; maize; numerical model; radiative transfer; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral resolution; summer","Chlorophyll content; LAI; Radiative transfer model; Sentinel-2 image; SupReME algorithm","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071854270"

The results showed that direct comparisons between height and intensity data from different dates reveal even small changes related to the development of a suburban area. A major challenge in future work is to link the changes with objects that are interesting in map production. In order to effectively utilize multisource remotely sensed data in mapping in the future, we also investigated the potential of satellite images and ground-based data to complement multispectral ALS. A method for continuous change monitoring from a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed and tested. Finally, a high-density point cloud was acquired with terrestrial mobile laser scanning and automatically classified into four classes.

We adapted a deep learning generative model as a first demonstration of the potential behind deep learning for spatial pattern generation in geoscience. The purpose is to build a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) useful to establish the relationship between two loosely linked set of variables that show multitude of complex spatial features such as climate conditions to aerial image. We trained a custom cGAN to generate Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery given a set of climatic and terrain predictors.

Nitrogen deficiency can reduce the yields, while excessive nitrogen fertilization can pollute the environment and cause the economic losses. Leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is an effective indicator for assessing nitrogen content of crops and guiding nitrogen fertilization. The red edge (RE)-based and chlorophyll-related vegetation indices (VIs) have already been used to estimate LNC. However, the VI-based methods only use limited information provided by multispectral remote sensing data. The optical sensors onboard recently launched satellites, such as the WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2, have already included RE band, as well as other useful bands, for crop monitoring. To make full use of such multispectral data, the ANN-based retrieval models were constructed for LNC estimation of winter wheat using WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 imagery, respectively. Results show that the ANN-based methods can achieve better accuracies compared with the VI-based methods.

However, its limited spectral information hinders further improving the classification performance. Hyperspectral imaging enables discrimination between spectrally similar classes but its swath width from space is narrow compared to MS ones. To achieve accurate land cover classification over a large coverage, we propose a cross-modality feature learning framework, called common subspace learning (CoSpace), by jointly considering subspace learning and supervised classification. By locally aligning the manifold structure of the two modalities, CoSpace linearly learns a shared latent subspace from hyperspectral-MS (HS-MS) correspondences. The MS out-of-samples can be then projected into the subspace, which are expected to take advantages of rich spectral information of the corresponding hyperspectral data used for learning, and thus leads to a better classification. Extensive experiments on two simulated HS-MS data sets (University of Houston and Chikusei), where HS-MS data sets have tradeoffs between coverage and spectral resolution, are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Hydraulic structures; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Cross modality; HyperSpectral; Land-cover classification; Multi-spectral; Subspace learning; land classification; land cover; learning; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; Classification (of information)","Common subspace learning (CoSpace); cross-modality learning; hyperspectral; landcover classification; multispectral (MS); remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068326574"

The Level 2A product is a basic product requested by many Sentinel-2 users: it provides surface reflectance after atmospheric correction, with a cloud and cloud shadow mask. The cloud/shadow mask is a key element to enable an automatic processing of Sentinel-2 data, and therefore, its performances must be accurately validated. To validate the Sentinel-2 operational Level 2A cloud mask, a software program named Active Learning Cloud Detection (ALCD) was developed, to produce reference cloud masks. Active learning methods allow reducing the number of necessary training samples by iteratively selecting them where the confidence of the classifier is low in the previous iterations. The ALCD method was designed to minimize human operator time thanks to a manually-supervised active learning method. The trained classifier uses a combination of spectral and multi-temporal information as input features and produces fully-classified images. The ALCD method was validated using visual criteria, consistency checks, and compared to another manually-generated cloud masks, with an overall accuracy above 98%. ALCD was used to create 32 reference cloud masks, on 10 different sites, with different seasons and cloud cover types. These masks were used to validate the cloud and shadow masks produced by three Sentinel-2 Level 2A processors: MAJA, used by the French Space Agency (CNES) to deliver Level 2A products, Sen2Cor, used by the European Space Agency (ESA), and FMask, used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The results show that MAJA and FMask perform similarly, with an overall accuracy around 90% (91% for MAJA, 90% for FMask), while Sen2Cor's overall accuracy is 84%. The reference cloud masks, as well as the ALCD software used to generate them are made available to the Sentinel-2 user community. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Earth (planet); Iterative methods; Learning systems; Space flight; Active Learning; Cloud masks; Cloud shadows; FMask; MAJA; Sen2Cor; Sentinel-2; Validation; Artificial intelligence","Active learning; Cloud mask; Cloud shadow; FMask; MAJA; Sen2Cor; Sentinel-2; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062544323"

The results revealed the highest correlation relations between the parameters of the general and trunk biomass with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and transformed vegetation index (TVI) vegetative indices and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FARAP) and fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER) biophysical parameters. To generate the models of determining the forest aboveground biomass (AGB), we used both the single- and two-factor models, the most optimum of which were those containing the NDVI predictor separately and in combination with the FCOVER predictor. The predicted values of the total AGB for the mentioned models equalled 32.5 to 236.3 and 39.9 to 253.4 t·ha–1.

This expansion has caused ecological problems such as soil erosion, and it is therefore urgent to clarify the spatial distribution and area of tea plantations. In this study, we developed a simple method to accurately map tea plantations based on their unique phenological characteristics observed from VENμS high-spatiotemporal-resolution multispectral imagery. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red-green ratio index (RGRI) of time series were calculated using 40 VENμS images taken in 2018 to evaluate the phenology of tea plantations. The unique phenological period of tea plantations in northern Zhejiang is from April to May, with obvious deep pruning, which is very different from the phenological period of other vegetation. During this period, the RGRI values of tea plantations were much higher than those of other vegetation such as broadleaf forest and bamboo forest. Therefore, it is possible to identify tea plantations from the vegetation in images acquired during their phenological period. This method was applied to tea plantation mapping in northern Zhejiang. The NDVI value of the winter image was used to extract a vegetation coverage map, and spatial intersection analysis combined with maps of tea plantation phenological information was performed to obtain a tea plantation distribution map. The resulting tea plantation map had a high accuracy, with a 94% producer accuracy and 95.9% user accuracy. The method was also applied to Sentinel-2 images at the regional scale, and the obtained tea plantation distribution map had an accuracy of 88.7%, indicating the good applicability of the method. © 2019 by the authors.

In order to reduce the confusion between impervious surface and other landcover types, this paper proposed an effective urban impervious surface extraction method based on multi-features and Random Forest (RF). First, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and Luojia 1-01 images are employed to extracted multi-features, including spectral features, texture features and temporal features. Then, a feature selection method with null importance is proposed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, Probabilistic Label Relaxation (PLR) is introduced into RF to obtain the classification results and impervious surface. The main urban areas of Zhengzhou and Hangzhou are selected as study areas. The experiment results show that the integration of the multi-features can significantly improve the overall accuracy of classification and the extraction accuracy of impervious surface. And the classification accuracy can be further improved after the feature selection with null importance. Besides, the PLR method can effectively reduce the salt-and-pepper phenomenon of classification results using random forest, which presupposes the optimal number of iterations. The method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the estimation of impervious surface and provide an important reference for the extraction of impervious surface based on pixel level.

Thus, this study aims at comparing the capability of multispectral S2 and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data for SOC prediction, and at the same time, we investigated the importance of spectral and spatial resolution through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the variable importance in the prediction (VIP) models and the spatial variability of the SOC maps at field and regional scales. We tested the capability of the S2 data to predict SOC in croplands with quite different soil types and parent materials in Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium, using multivariate statistics and local ground calibration with soil samples. We split the calibration dataset into sub-regions according to soil maps and built a multivariate regression model within each sub-region. The prediction accuracy obtained by S2 data is generally slightly lower than that retrieved by airborne hyperspectral data. The ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) is higher than 2 in Luxembourg (2.6) and German (2.2) site, while it is 1.1 in the Belgian area. After the spectral resampling of the airborne data according to S2 band, the prediction accuracy did not change for four out of five of the sub-regions. The variable importance values obtained by S2 data showed the same trend as the airborne VIP values, while the importance of SWIR bands decreased using airborne data resampled according the S2 bands. These differences of VIP values can be explained by the loss of spectral resolution as compared to APEX data and the strong difference in terms of SNR between the SWIR region and other spectral regions. The investigation on the spatial variability of the SOC maps derived by S2 data has shown that the spatial resolution of S2 is adequate to describe SOC variability both within field and at regional scale. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

GAUSS is proposing the creation of a hybrid constellation of 3U and 6U Cubesats, designed using lean-satellite methodology for the reduction in the costs of the single platform’s development and manufacturing. The constellation under study will be competitively positioned in the Earth Observation scenario, generally dominated by institutional missions, in terms of data quality and fast response. The mission will make use of an advanced optical payload with sensing capabilities in the VNIR range, with seven spectral bands, some of which will be chosen from the 10m resolution bands currently in use by Sentinel-2. In particular, the proposed constellation will feature a min GSD of 5m for all the selected spectral bands, with a 20km swath at 500km of altitude, thanks to a TDI (Time Delay and Integration) CCD detector technology notably employed in low-light settings, as well as for fast-moving objects. This inclusion will increase radiometric performances, as well as multi-band enhancements and cross-sensor consistency, which are generally referred as the principal limitations of current CubeSat EO (Earth Observation) missions in orbit. The use of spectral bands currently employed by Sentinel missions will allow such observations to be integrated with publicly available Sentinel data, providing meaningful insights regarding the cooperation of existing and new EO constellations, as well as to conduct several studies on inter-calibration techniques of the space platforms. The constellation will be composed of both 3U and 6U CubeSat platforms, in SSO orbits selected and spaced as to allow interlink communications among the neighbouring CubeSats, for improved data download even when the satellites are not in visibility of a groundstation. The proposed constellation, compared to traditional missions, will have the advantage of being easily scalable, with faster access time to space, as well as reduced costs for the production of the single platform and its launch, particularly with the employment of the 3U CubeSat form factor.

For such a purpose data from active or passive sensors are used as predictor variables in combination with measures taken in the field in sampling plots. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites are equipped with a Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) capable of acquiring 13 bands in the visible and infrared domains with a spatial resolution varying between 10 and 60 m. The present study aimed at evaluating the performance of the S2-MSI imagery for estimating the growing stock volume of forest ecosystems. To do so we used 240 plots measured in two study areas in Italy. The imputation was carried out with eight k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) methods available in the open source YaImpute R package. In order to evaluate the S2-MSI performance we repeated the experimental protocol also with two other sets of images acquired by two well-known satellites equipped with multi spectral instruments: Landsat 8 OLI and RapidEye scanner. We found that S2 worked better than Landsat in 37.5% of the cases and in 62.5% of the cases better than RapidEye. In one study area the best performance was obtained with Landsat OLI (RMSD = 6.84%) and in the other with S2 (RMSD = 22.94%), both with the k-NN system based on a distance matrix calculated with the Random Forest algorithm. The results confirmed that S2 images are suitable for predicting growing stock volume obtaining good performances (average RMSD for both the test areas of less than 19%). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Italy; algorithm; forest ecosystem; forest management; Landsat; nearest neighbor analysis; prediction; RapidEye; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; stock assessment; sustainability","Forests; Growing stock volume; Multi spectral instrument; Prediction; Random forest; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047159058"

Such maps also provide information for natural resource planning and analysis of the temporal and spatial trends in crop distribution and gross production. In this work, 10 meter resolution land cover maps were generated over a 6200 km2 area of the Riverina region in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia, with a focus on locating the most important perennial crops in the region. The maps discriminated between 12 classes, including nine perennial crop classes. A satellite image time series (SITS) of freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was used. A segmentation technique grouped spectrally similar adjacent pixels together, to enable object-based image analysis (OBIA). K-means unsupervised clustering was used to filter training points and classify some map areas, which improved supervised classification of the remaining areas. The support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel gave the best results among several algorithms trialled. The accuracies of maps generated using several combinations of the multispectral and radar bands were compared to assess the relative value of each combination. An object-based post classification refinement step was developed, enabling optimization of the tradeoff between producers' accuracy and users' accuracy. Accuracy was assessed against randomly sampled segments, and the final map achieved an overall count-based accuracy of 84.8% and area-weighted accuracy of 90.9%. Producers' accuracies for the perennial crop classes ranged from 78 to 100%, and users' accuracies ranged from 63 to 100%. This work develops methods to generate detailed and large-scale maps that accurately discriminate between many perennial crops and can be updated frequently. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Disasters; Image segmentation; K-means clustering; Radial basis function networks; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Land cover classification; Multi-spectral imagery; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Radial Basis Function(RBF); Segmentation techniques; Supervised classification; Supervised classifiers; Unsupervised clustering; Radar imaging","Crop type classification; Land cover mapping; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite image time series; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080907751"

During the oil weathering process, marine spilled crude oils undergo chemical and physical changes (e.g. spreading, drifting, mixing, emulsification, evaporation, dissolution, and Photo-oxidation) to form different pollution types with various visual features. These visual features include the following: Light sheen, silver sheen, rainbow sheen, streamers, brown oil slick, and black oil, and they represent different oil amounts per unit area. Notably, different treatment methods, such as booms, skimmers, chemical dispersants, and in situ burning, can be used specifically to reduce the damage of various types of oil spill to the marine environment. Therefore, the detection, classification, and quantification of the various types can facilitate the monitoring and assessment of marine oil spills. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi/hyper spectral optical sensors onboard satellites or aircraft provide timely observation data for remote sensing of marine spilled oils based on distinctly different detection principles. Although SAR is an effective detection method which can penetrate clouds and rain, the identification and estimation of the various spilled oils are difficult. Optical remote sensing has been used for several decades and it has the capability to identify various spilled oils (i.e. oil slicks, water-in-oil (WO) or oil-in-water (OW) emulsions) and to estimate oil slick thickness or oil emulsions concentrations according to their spectral reflectance and other characteristics. Integration of the use of SAR and optical remote sensing imageries will undoubtedly improve the identification and estimation of various marine spilled oils in the future. Here we present the results of a case study of the SANCHI oil tanker collision on January 2018 in the East Sea of China, which we use to evaluate how the advantages of SAR and optical sensors for remotely identifying different marine spilled oils can be combined. SAR imageries of different polarization modes over the East Sea from 7 to 14 January 2018 were collected from the GF-3 satellite (China) for detecting spilled oils. In these different SAR imageries, the modulation of the spilled oils of surface roughness reduces Bragg backscattering, resulting in darker look-alike oils than the surrounding water. Optical data (cloud-free or less cloud) over the same area on 18 January 2018 were obtained from a multi-spectral instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 (European Space Agency, ESA) in order to identify various spilled oils. Laboratory-based measurements of the spectral reflectance of oil slicks, oil emulsions, and crude oil were used to simulate the spectral features of various spilled oils in MSI imagery under weak sunglint reflectance. The high spatial resolution of MSI images (spatial resolution of 10 m) reduces the mixing effect of clouds, and spilled oils could be identified through the gaps in the clouds. These look-alike spilled oils derived from the SAR imagery can be verified using MSI optical images. Moreover, based on the laboratory-derived spectral features of various spilled oils and the decision tree method, these different spilled oils (i.e. oil slicks, WO and OW emulsions) produced by the SANCHI oil tanker collision can be identified using MSI spectral reflectance. The results have been verified against each other, and they indicate that the various spilled oils can be identified using passive optical remote sensing. We conclude that the integrated application of multi-source remote sensing (especially optical remote sensing) can provide an important method for the detection, identification, and estimation of marine spilled oils in the near future. © 2019, Science Press.

In the presented research analysis of chosen airbases in Europe was presented. In the course of the research, image data, both electro-optical and microwave data, were pre-processed appropriately, i.e. radiometric and geometric corrections, and filtrations were applied, in order to finally analyze and evaluate interpretations. In the research radar images in the C band, which are recorded by sensors placed on the satellites of the Sentinel-1 constellation, as well as electro-optical images acquired by multispectral sensors placed on the satellites of the Sentinel-2 constellation, were used. In addition, the fusion of microwave and electro-optical data was made to verify the usefulness of data integration for reconnaissance purposes. Then the Sentinel data was combined with high-spatial-resolution data from Google Earth, in order to improve the quality and to verify the usefulness of the integration of multitemporal data in the process of imagery interpretation and object detection. The analysis consisted of assessing the interpretability of images by the possibility of distinguishing specific objects on it. The results were next evaluated using high- spatial resolution open-source imagery data from Google Earth, and open source GIS data. The conducted analyses showed that the use of Sentinel image data in recognizing objects at airports seems to be justified due to their availability, although these should be objects of considerable size. In order to detect smaller objects, multi-resolution data integration should be applied, as showed in the research. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technique can be operated in all weather, day and night circumstances. Due to the numerous advantages of SAR imaging technique over other conventional image acquisition practices, it has been used for the detection of the waterbody. Subsets of quad-pol, georeferenced (L-band) SAR imagery of UAV platform (provided by JPL, NASA) of Mondah, Gabon region and optical imagery by Sentinel-2 of the same region is used for the extraction of the water body. After preprocessing of UAV SAR image, Yamaguchi Decomposition was carried out and volume scattering image array (T33) has been used for the extraction of the waterbody. T33 array element of the coherency matrix represents volume back-scattering responses from the area of acquisition. Since the surface of the water body (either smooth or rough water surface) shows negligible volume back-scattering, water bodies can be easily delineated using thresholding and then applying the SVM classification method. The area covered by water reflects most of the radiations falling in the Green color frequency range and strongly absorbs Near-Infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Taking advantage of this unique behavior of water surface while interacting with the electromagnetic spectrum, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used for the extraction of waterbody from Sentinel-2 optical image. Finally, the SVM classified outcomes for extracted water area from both the images were compared. The harmonizing information from the, (UAV SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral) images have been used for the quick and precise recognition of waterbody. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Agricultural robots; Aircraft detection; Backscattering; Extraction; Flood control; Geometrical optics; Imaging techniques; Infrared devices; NASA; Support vector machines; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Electromagnetic spectra; NDWI; Normalized difference water index; Sentinel-2; SVM classification; Very high resolution; Waterbodies; Yamaguchi decompositions; Radar imaging","NDWI; Sentinel-2; SVM; UAV SAR; VHR; Waterbody","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080881393"

The intrinsic black-sky albedo (BSA) and white-sky albedo (WSA) values of the surface are derived at the six shortwave spectral bands of Sentinel-2A's Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI). A specific set of narrow-to-broadband conversion coefficients is derived from radiative transfer simulations and presented for the generation of broadband albedos. Initial evaluation uses well-calibrated ground-based albedo measurements by pyranometers mounted on the towers at seven sites of the Surface Radiation Network (SURFRAD). Over those sites where pyranometer measurement footprints are not spatially representative of the landscape covered by the satellite pixels (i.e., spatially nonrepresentative) at the grid scales (500 m to 1 km) of the MODIS and VIIRS products, the finer-resolution Sentinel-2A albedos manifested a pronounced decrease in root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias in the evaluation against the ground-based data as compared to the coarser resolution albedo products of MODIS and VIIRS. This decrease occurs because the 20-m Sentinel-2A albedo values are better able to resolve the spatial details of surface albedo within the ground-based instrument footprints than the coarser resolution sensors. This preliminary evaluation also demonstrates the consistency of the Sentinel-2A albedo results whether using the MODIS BRDF or the VIIRS BRDF products for the surface anisotropy information. The RMSEs and mean biases of the Sentinel-2A albedos over all the seven validation sites are both within the accuracy requirement of ±0.05 absolute albedo units for satellite derived albedo products. This study, to generate Sentinel-2A MSI albedo with either MODIS or VIIRS BRDFs, extends previous efforts of Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI albedo and enhances the continuity of finer-resolution albedo data. Such long-term and higher resolution records of surface albedo improve the investigations into the changes and drivers of local/regional surface energy balance over heterogeneous regions and increasingly fragmented landscapes across the globe due to natural and human-induced land cover changes. © 2018 The Authors","Anisotropy; Distribution functions; Mean square error; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Thermography (imaging); Albedo; BRDF; MODIS; Sentinel-2; SURFRAD; Validation; VIIRS; albedo; anisotropy; assessment method; calibration; energy balance; instrumentation; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; model validation; MODIS; radiative transfer; satellite altimetry; Sentinel; spectral resolution; surface reflectance; VIIRS; Solar radiation","Albedo; BRDF; MODIS; Sentinel-2; SURFRAD; Validation; VIIRS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052488101"

However, monitoring all these variables from space is a very challenging task, which becomes particularly difficult when dealing with cyanobacteria blooms, because in high concentrations, they form scum on the water surface, which is a concern for public health due to the production of toxins. This article describes empirical algorithms to estimate these variables using LandSat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, multi-spectral instrument data, the Landsat spatial resolution (30 m) and imagery from the Sentinel-2 sensor, with a resampled 10 m spatial resolution can be used for environmental monitoring. These images, analyzed by Wavelets Neural Networks can be very useful to estimate physico-chemical and biological parameters of water. This approach is applied in Alton water reservoir, Suffolk, UK using spatial and temporal scales. The Alton Reservoir is the largest in Suffolk, with a perimeter of over 8 miles (13 km). This article presents techniques based on wavelets neural networks and fuzzy neural networks, namely the radial basis function, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and Least Square Estimat, which are well suited to predict data sequences stemming from real-world applications techniques. The prediction behavior shows good forecasts as (NMSE = 0.00004; MARE = 0.00078, MSE =0.00013) for test data, results showed that the predicted values have good accurate.

At the same time, this data is adversely affected by fixed sensor parameters and environmental influences. Methods for increasing the quality of such data and concomitantly optimizing its information content are, thus, in high demand. In particular, single-image super-resolution (SISR) approaches aim to achieve this goal solely by observing the individual images. We propose to adapt a generic deep residual neural network architecture for SISR to deal with the special properties of remote sensing satellite imagery, especially taking into account the different spatial resolutions of individual Sentinel-2 bands, i.e., ground sampling distances of 20 m and 10 m. As a result, this method is able to increase the perceived resolution of the 20 m channels and mesh all spectral bands.

However, it may be difficult to classify these data based on a feature level while avoiding the inconsistency of data caused by multisource and multiple regions or cities. In this letter, we propose a deep learning structure called 2-branch SPL-ResNet which combines the self-paced learning with deep residual network to classify multisource MS data based on the feature-level fusion. First, a 2-D discrete wavelet is used to obtain the multiscale features and sparse representation of MS data. Then, a 2-branch SPL-ResNet is established to extract respective characteristics of the two satellites. Finally, we implement the feature-level fusion by cascading the two feature vectors and then classify the integrated feature vector. We conduct the experiments on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 MS images. Compared with the commonly used classification methods such as support vector machine and convolutional neural networks, our proposed 2-branch SPL-ResNet framework has higher accuracy and more robustness. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep learning; Image classification; Image fusion; Image retrieval; Neural networks; Classification methods; Convolutional neural network; Deep residual network (ResNet); Feature level fusion; Multi-scale features; Multi-spectral; Self-paced learning; Sparse representation; algorithm; image classification; image processing; Landsat; multispectral image; Sentinel; support vector machine; vector; wavelet analysis; Classification (of information)","Deep residual network (ResNet); image classification; image fusion; multisource multispectral (MS) data; self-paced learning (SPL)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050975707"

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a ""full optical"" approach, the ""combined"" method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Decision trees; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Tracking radar; Water management; Crop mapping; Irrigated crops; LANDSAT; Random forests; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; Mapping","Irrigated crops; Landsat-8; Random Forest; Satellite image time series; Seasonal crop mapping; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060670633"

In situ chlorophyll-a data from Ebro Delta bays (NE Spain) were coupled with several band combination and band ratio spectral indices derived from Sentinel 2A levels 1C and 2A for time-series mapping.

In this study, we apply an empirical model to estimate coffee leaf Chl with Sentinel 2 MSI data. Results showed that coffee biophysical parameters (height and canopy cover) are significantly influenced by stand age while plant water concentration and total Chl are age invariant.

The mapped rock glaciers were classified on the basis of their activity (intact or relict) and their origin (glacier-derived or talus-derived). Logistic regression models were applied to calculate the probability of permafrost distribution within transect under observation. We observed that freely available high resolution S-2A MSI L1C products are a valuable addition to the already existing freely available high resolution satellite images that can be exploited to study rock glaciers in Himalayan region. The distribution of rock glaciers in Sikkim Himalayas is found to be strongly controlled by elevation and aspect. Topoclimatic conditions above 5000 m a.s.l. are favourable for the presence of permafrost in Sikkim Himalayas. More glacier-derived rock glaciers than talus-derived rock glaciers were observed within transect under observation. Outputs from logistic regression models were capable to reasonably estimate the spatially-distributed probability of permafrost occurrence in the region. However, outputs from these models depended upon the selection of the initiation line location points of rock glaciers and topoclimatic and topographic variables used as predictors for model computation.

Different indices based on optical satellite imagery are typically used for mapping fire scars and for estimating burn severity. However, cloud cover is a major limitation for analyses using optical data over tropical landscapes. To address this pitfall, we explored the suitability of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for detecting vegetation response to fire, using experimental fires in northern Australia. Pre-and post-fire results from Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter intensity data were compared to those of optical satellite imagery and were corroborated against structural changes on the ground that we documented through terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter (VH) proved sensitive to the structural changes imparted by fire and was correlated with the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) derived from Sentinel-2 optical data. Our results suggest that C-band SAR holds potential to inform the mapping of burn severity in savannas, but further research is required over larger spatial scales and across a broader spectrum of fire regime conditions before automated products can be developed. Combining both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data will likely yield the best results for mapping burn severity under a range of weather conditions. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Fires; Optical radar; Photomapping; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Surveying instruments; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Burn Severity; Landscape management; Multi-spectral data; Optical satellite imagery; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Terrestrial laser scanning; Terrestrial lidars; Space-based radar","Burn severity; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Terrestrial LiDAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079664992"

Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10 m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available. First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored. Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales. Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2's greatest strengths. © 2018","Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; Anthozoa; Bathymetry; Bleaching; Cleaning; Image resolution; Mapping; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Coral reef; Habitat mapping; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2; Sun glint; bathymetry; benthic environment; coral bleaching; coral reef; environmental monitoring; habitat; instrumentation; Landsat; mapping; remote sensing; sensor; Sentinel; spatial resolution; WorldView; Reefs","Bathymetry; Coral reefs; Habitat mapping; Landsat; Sentinel-2; Sun glint","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051278681"

These dense Time Series (TS) of multispectral data are used for a wide range of applications enabling multi-temporal monitoring of physical phenomena. Nevertheless, one of the main challenges in their usage is related to missing information caused by cloud occlusions. In the literature, many cloud restoration approaches have been proposed. However, to properly recover missing information, sophisticated and usually computationally intensive techniques should be used. In this work, we consider the deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) classifier which is very promising for classification of dense time series of images, and investigate its robustness to the cloud presence without any cloud restoration. Indeed, this classifier has proven to be able to handle the presence of clouds. However, no work which extensively analyzes the robustness of LSTM to clouds can be found in the literature. In this study, we aim to quantitatively asses the capability of the network of handling different amount of cloud coverage under different lengths of the TS. In greater detail, we analyze the effect of the cloud coverage on the classification maps produced by the LSTM by considering: (i) simulated cloud values, (ii) detected clouds represented by zeros values, and (iii) restored images by simple linear temporal gap filling (i.e., average of the spectral values acquired in the previous and following cloud-free images in the TS). The obtained results demonstrate that the capability of the LSTM to handle the cloud cover depends on: (i) the length of the TS, (ii) the position of the cloudy images in the TS, and (iii) the cloud representation values. For example, when clouds are restored with very simple and fast linear temporal gap filling, the map agreement between the cloud-free and the cloudy map is 96% even when the 40% of images in the TS are covered with clouds, regardless of their position. © SPIE.

In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95% with official flood maps. © 2018 by the authors.","Flood control; Geomorphology; Mapping; Open source software; Open systems; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Ebro basin; Flood mapping; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite data; Normalized difference water index; Satellite data; Satellite remote sensing; Supervised classification; Floods","Ebro basin; Flood mapping; Free satellite data; Multispectral; Po basin; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057088214"

It becomes even more indispensable with the rapid increase of remote sensing data availability from numerous sensors. The assessment of the Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) is a key component of the cross-calibration method. The SBAF compensates for intrinsic differences in sensor response caused by Spectral Response Function (SRF) mismatches. Currently, Sentinel and Landsat data represent the most widely accessible medium spatial resolution multispectral satellite data. Hence, in this study, the SBAF of the Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2 and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on-board Landsat-8 was estimated over pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) located in North Africa. The SBAF depends on the hyperspectral profile of the target and the sensor SRF. Here, the hyperspectral profile was derived from the Hyperion hyperspectral imager on-board the EO-1. Finally, it is important to highlight that an estimate of the SBAF is incomplete unless accompanied with its uncertainty. The uncertainty analysis of the SBAF was implemented using Monte Carlo simulation.

Standard satellite missions could not provide such data at both high resolutions. Fusion approaches that leverage the complementary strengths in various satellite sources (e.g. MODIS/VIIRS/GOES-R's sub-daily revisiting frequency and Landsat/Sentinel-2's high spatial resolution) provide a viable means to simultaneously achieve both high resolutions in the fusion data. In this paper, we presented a novel, generic and fully-automated method, STAIR, for fusing multi-spectral satellite data to generate a high-frequency, high-resolution and cloud-/gap-free data. Building on the time series of multiple sources of satellite data, STAIR first imputes the missing-value pixels (due to cloud cover or sensor mechanical issues) in satellite images using an adaptive-average correction process, which takes into account different land covers and neighborhood information of miss-value pixels through an automatic segmentation. To fuse satellite images, it employs a local interpolation model to capture the most informative spatial information provided by the high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat) and then performs an adjustment step to incorporate the temporal patterns provided by the high-frequency data (e.g., MODIS). The resulting fused products contain daily, high spatial resolution and cloud-/gap-free fused images. We tested our algorithm to fuse surface reflectance data of MODIS and Landsat in Champaign County at Illinois and generated daily time series for all the growing seasons (Apr 1 to Nov 1) from 2000 to 2015 at 30 m resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAIR not only captures correct texture patterns but also predicts accurate reflectance values in the generated images, with a significant performance improvement over the classic STARFM algorithm. This method is computationally efficient and ready to be scaled up to continental scales. It is also sufficiently generic to easily include various optical satellite data for fusion. We envision this novel algorithm can provide effective means to leverage historical optical satellite data to build long-term daily, 30 m surface reflectance record (e.g. from 2000 to present) at continental scales for various applications, as well as produce operational near-realtime daily and high-resolution data for future earth observation applications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Champaign County [Illinois]; Illinois; United States; Adaptive optics; Fusion reactions; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Stairs; Time series; Automatic segmentations; Computationally efficient; Gap filling; High spatial resolution; LANDSAT; MODIS; Neighborhood information; Performance improvements; algorithm; GOES; growing season; Landsat; MODIS; numerical method; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite mission; segmentation; Sentinel; spatial resolution; surface reflectance; VIIRS; Satellite imagery","Fusion; Gap filling; Landsat; MODIS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047396754"

However, observational records of flowering are very sparse, limiting our understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of floral phenology from local to regional scales. Satellite remote sensing provides unique opportunities to monitor flowers through space and time in a cost-effective way. Here we developed an enhanced bloom index (EBI), based on the multispectral remotely sensed data, to quantify flowering status over almond (Prunus dulcis) orchards in Central Valley of California. Our test studies with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery at 2.6–5.2 cm demonstrated that the EBI enhanced the signals of flowers and reduced the background noise from soil and green vegetation, and agreed well with the bloom coverage derived from supervised classification, with a R2 of 0.72. Experimental tests with multi-scale remote sensing observations from CERES aerial (0.2 m), PlanetScope (3 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and Landsat (30 m) satellite imagery further showed the robustness of the EBI in capturing the flower information. We found that the relatively dense time series of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery were able to capture the bloom dynamics of almond orchards.

This paper aims to appraise the potential of the multispectral constellation Sentinel-2 of the European Commission Earth observation programme Copernicus to detect prominent features and changes in heritage sites, during both ordinary times and crisis. We test the 10 m spatial resolution of the 3 visible spectral bands of Sentinel-2 for substantiation of single local events-that is, wall collapses in the UNESCO World Heritage site of the Old City of Aleppo (Syria)-and for hotspot mapping of recurrent incidents-that is, the archaeological looting in the archaeological site of Apamea (Syria). By screening long Sentinel-2 time series consisting of 114 images for Aleppo and 57 images for Apamea, we demonstrate that changes of textural properties and surface reflectance can be logged accurately in time and space and can be associated to events relevant for conservation. VHR imagery from Google Earth was used for the validation and identification of trends occurring prior to the Sentinel-2 launch. We also demonstrate how to exploit the Sentinel-2 short revisiting time (5 days) and large swath (290 km) for multi-temporal tracking of spatial patterns of urban sprawl across the cultural landscape of the World Heritage Site of Cyrene (Libya), and the three coastal ancient Greek sites of Tocra, Ptolemais, and Apollonia in Cyrenaica.

However, most previously widely-adopted water index methods are developed from 30-m resolution Landsat imagery, with low-albedo commission error (e.g., shadow misclassified as water) and threshold instability being identified as the primary issues. Besides, since the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral band (band 11) on Sentinel-2 is 20 m spatial resolution, current SWIR-included water index methods usually produce water maps at 20 m resolution instead of the highest 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 bands, which limits the ability of Sentinel-2 to detect surface water at finer scales. This study aims to develop a water index from Sentinel-2 that improves native resolution and accuracy of water mapping at the same time. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to exploit the 10-m spectral bands among Sentinel-2 bands of three resolutions (10-m; 20-m; 60-m). The new Multi-Spectral Water Index (MuWI), consisting of the complete version and the revised version (MuWI-C and MuWI-R), is designed as the combination of normalized differences for threshold stability. The proposed method is assessed on coincident Sentinel-2 and sub-meter images covering a variety of water types. When compared to previous water indexes, results show that both versions of MuWI enable to produce native 10-m resolution water maps with higher classification accuracies (p-value < 0.01). Commission and omission errors are also significantly reduced particularly in terms of shadow and sunglint. Consistent accuracy over complex water mapping scenarios is obtained by MuWI due to high threshold stability. Overall, the proposed MuWI method is applicable to accurate water mapping with improved spatial resolution and accuracy, which possibly facilitates water mapping and its related studies and applications on growing Sentinel-2 images. © 2018 by the authors.","Image enhancement; Image resolution; Infrared radiation; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Surface waters; AWEI; LANDSAT; MNDWI; MuWI; NDWI; Sentinel-2; Shadow; Sunglint; Water index; Water mapping; Photomapping","AWEI; Landsat; Machine learning; MNDWI; Multi-spectral water index; MuWI; NDWI; OSH; Sentinel-2; Shadow; Sunglint; SVM; Water classification; Water index; Water mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055454538"

This study illustrates an initial evaluation of parameters for purposes of urban generation studies using optical multi-spectral satellite imagery from Landsat-5, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 missions. The changes in land occupation and urban density are the first aspects chosen to be examined for the period 1985–2020. The focus was given on possible modifications occurred in occasion of Milano Expo 2015. The paper firstly explores the known best band combination for observation of urban fabric. Suggestions derived have then been calibrated with reference to ground truth data, while the image pairs over the 35 years span were then build with selected bands. Finally, all image pairs have been processed for Principal Component Analysis in order to identify possible “hot-spots” of significant changes. The results found on the image pair 2006–2015 have been explored in detail and checked upon official orthophotos. Monitoring of changes in urban fabric using multispectral optical imagery can provide valuable insights for further evaluation of single urban generation interventions. Such contributions could be considered in the processes of urban planning policies in a more systematic manner. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate models; Satellite imagery; Urban planning; Band combinations; Evaluation of parameters; Geo-spatial data; Ground truth data; Multispectral optical imagery; Natural environments; Operating models; Planning policies; Climate change","Copernicus programme; Earth Observation; Geospatial open data; Landsat; Milan; PCA; Urban planning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092257131"

Therefore, multi-spectral analysis of remote sensing data today represents an efficient tool for monitoring vegetation in a Mediterranean environment, where spatial resolution often represents a limiting factor due to high fragmentation and spatial distribution of forest stand. The aim of this study has been to map the health conditions of the Castelporziano coastal pinewood forest (Roma). To this aim, we used a diachronic NDVI index, provided by ESA Sentinel-2 images and field observations, to monitor the health status in a historic pinewood forest that has recently been affected by a rapid diffusion of pests (Tomicus destruens Woll.). The monitoring performed allowed us to map the pinewood forest in risk classes and at the same time to provide data concerning the localization of areas showing a strong decline. Thus, we provide information useful for the correct management and planning of forestry thinning to preserve those areas of the pinewood forest not involved in the decline process. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Forestry; Geodetic satellites; Image resolution; Space optics; Spectrum analysis; Vegetation; Enhanced thematic mappers; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean forest; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Multi-spectral analysis; NDVI; Remote sensing data; Sentinel-2; Remote sensing","Mediterranean forest; NDVI; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047978894"

We investigated the effects of classifiers and used time series imagery-images acquired within and across seasons-on the accuracy of plant species maps. The study site was a grazed savanna in southern Kenya. We used Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery due to its high spatial (10-20 m) and temporal (five days) resolution with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The species mapped were important for grazing livestock and wildlife (three grass species), indicators of land degradation (one tree genus and one invasive shrub), and a fig tree species. The results show that increasing the number of images, including dry season imagery, results in improved classification accuracy regardless of the classifier (average increase in overall accuracy (OA) = 0.1632). SVM consistently outperformed RF, and the most accurate model and was SVM with a radial kernel using imagery from both wet and dry seasons (OA = 0.8217). Maps showed that seasonal grazing areas provide functionally different grazing opportunities and have different vegetation characteristics that are critical to a landscape's ability to support large populations of both livestock and wildlife.

Private forests are a part of social forestry which becomes a tool for the Indonesian government to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 26% by 2030. The United Nations Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation has encouraged the Indonesian government to establish a forest monitoring system by estimating forest carbon stock using a combination of forest inventory and remote sensing. This study is aimed at assessing the potential of vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) of private forests. We used 45 sample plots and 7 vegetation indices to evaluate the ability of Sentinel-2 in estimating AGB on private forests. Normalised difference index (NDI) 45 exhibited a strong correlation with AGB compared to other indices (r = 0.89; R2 = 0.79). Stepwise linear regression fitted for establishing the model between field AGB and vegetation indices (R2 = 0.81). We also found that AGB in the study area based on spatial analysis was 72.54 Mg/ha. A root mean square error (RMSE) value from predicted and observed AGB was 27 Mg/ha. The AGB value in the study area is higher than the AGB value from some of forest types, and it indicates that private forests are good for biomass storage. Overall, vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide a good result in terms of reporting the AGB on private forests. © 2018 Askar et al.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Aboveground biomass; Carbon dioxide emissions; Continuous degradations; Forest monitoring systems; Multi-spectral imagery; Root mean square errors; Stepwise linear regression; Strong correlation; Ecosystems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062613848"

To assure that information products have the highest possible spatial, temporal and thematic resolutions, it is critical to be able to simultaneously analyse data from a large variety of satellite sensors. In this contribution, we present a solution to rapidly extract water bodies from Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI and Sentinel-2 for up-to-date situational awareness during emergency response. A convolutional neural network is used to segment water extent in these images, while clouds, cloud shadows and snow / ice are specifically handled by the network to remove potential bias from any downstream analysis. Atmospheric correction, post-processing and ancillary data are not required. To distinguish flood from permanent water we present a reference water mask that is derived by means of time-series analysis of archive imagery. Compared to widely-used mono-temporal reference water masks, it can be adapted to any area and time of interest. This study builds up on previous work of the authors and presents new results from recent flood disasters in Germany, Peru, China, India and Mozambique, as well as a flood monitoring application centred on the Indian state of Kerala. The processing chain produces very high overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient (>0.87) and shows consistent performance throughout a monitoring period of 12 months that covers 143 Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 images. © Authors 2019.

Over open ocean waters, the atmospheric contribution is relatively easy to correct as it can be assumed that water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared (NIR) is equal to zero and it can be performed by applying a relatively simple dark-pixel-correction-based type of algorithm. Over inland and coastal waters, this assumption cannot be made since the water-leaving radiance in the NIR is greater than zero due to the presence of water components like sediments and dissolved organic particles. The aim of this study is to determine the most appropriate atmospheric correction processor to be applied on Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imagery over several types of inland waters. Retrievals obtained from different atmospheric correction processors (i.e., Atmospheric correction for OLI 'lite' (ACOLITE), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour (here called C2RCC), Case 2 Regional Coast Colour for Complex waters (here called C2RCCCX), Image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), Polynomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (Polymer) and Sen2Cor or Sentinel 2 Correction) are compared against in situ reflectance measured in lakes and reservoirs in the Valencia region (Spain). Polymer and C2RCC are the processors that give back the best statistics, with coefficients of determination higher than 0.83 and mean average errors less than 0.01. An evaluation of the performance based on water types and single bands-classification based on ranges of in situ chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi disk depth values- showed that performance of these set of processors is better for relatively complex waters. ACOLITE, iCOR and Sen2Cor had a better performance when applied to meso- and hyper-eutrophic waters, compare with oligotrophic. However, other considerations should also be taken into account, like the elevation of the lakes above sea level, their distance from the sea and their morphology. © 2019 by the authors.","Infrared devices; Lakes; Sea level; Spectroscopy; Atmospheric contributions; Atmospheric correction algorithm; Atmospheric corrections; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Inland waters; Sentinel-2 MSI; Water types; Water-leaving radiances; Reservoirs (water)","Atmospheric correction; Complex inland water; Sentinel-2 MSI; Water type classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068150026"

Eight aerial missions were conducted in midsummer 2015 over the same area, which consisted of 50 plots with various cultivars of wheat, barley and rye. The vegetation indices were calculated for both datasets. Vegetation indices calculated from the NIR sensor highly correlated with plant chlorophyll and plant LAI, and revealed satisfactory correlation with plant fresh mass. Vegetation indices derived from onboard RGB camera did not reveal the significant correlation with any of plant growth parameter. The NDVI values calculated from NIR data demonstrated high correlation with the ones, which were derived from the Sentinel-2 high-resolution satellite multispectral images. The values of UAV-derived NDVI were lower than Sentinel-2-derived NDVI, and the regression slope of this relationship varied in different plant species.

The new method retrieves the ancillary information on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total water vapor (TWV) from the multi-spectral information. The AOD and TWV obtained from the retrieval are used to optimize the DOS model. The experiment is carried out using data of Sentinel-2, which carries a Multispectral Instrument (MSI). The simulation results show that the visual effects, image clarity and image contrast of the remote sensing images are obviously improved; the atmospheric corrected reflectance curve is closer to measured typical objects reflectance curve in the terms of both spectral shape and reflectance value, indicating that the effect of atmosphere have been successfully removed by using the proposed algorithm.

Initial work aims to compare deforestation detection in small areas across North-East Rondônia, Brazil with previous deforestation studies. Subsequently, a deforestation analysis of the Sentinel 2 MSI using PCA in Sub-Saharan Africa is presented. Standardised PCA is applied through the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of channel standardised, resampled input imagery. First, cropped sub-areas of input imagery are considered, termed local PCA. Local PCA is applied to images separately (separate rotation) and to two-year image composites (merged rotation). Both approaches were found to detect forest cover changes, with separate rotation allowing for the generation of time-series data. The change detection resolution of both approaches is relatively low; being able to detect only if change has occurred in the general area and not the exact location of greatest change. In order to improve change detection resolution and identify the sub-areas of greatest change, separate rotation PCA is applied on a pixel scale. A simple statistical threshold is used to implement bi-temporal change detection, demonstrating the ability of this approach to detect forest cover changes at a higher resolution.

Generalized additive models (GAMs) were used to fit forest cover measures to Sentinel-2A spectral band values modified using different topographic correction methods. Canopy closure (calculated from upward-looking fisheye photographs taken be-neath forest canopy) was the best forest cover measure accounted for by the Sentinel-2 spectral data that were topographically corrected using the Min-naert Correction (R2 = 0.882). Spectral bands best explaining canopy closure were Band 3 (Green), Band 8 (NIR) and Band 12 (SWIR). Our model is able to reasonably detect spatial and temporal changes in canopy closure, even in highly rugged terrain and diverse vegetation cover, and it has potential to be improved to the extent that it can be applied by managers of natural re-sources.

The amount of growing stock volume (GSV) is a forest biophysical parameter with great importance in issues like economy, environmental protection, and adaptation to climate change. Thus, accurate and unbiased estimation of GSV is also crucial to be pursued across the Hyrcanian. Our goal was to investigate the potential of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1's polarimetric features in combination with Sentinel-2 multi-spectral features for the GSV estimation in a portion of heterogeneously-structured and mountainous Hyrcanian forests. We used five different kernels by the support vector regression (nu-SVR) for the GSV estimation. Because each kernel differently models the parameters, we separately selected features for each kernel by a binary genetic algorithm (GA). We simultaneously optimized R2 and RMSE in a suggested GA fitness function. We calculated R2, RMSE to evaluate the models. We additionally calculated the standard deviation of validation metrics to estimate the model's stability. Also for models over-fitting or under-fitting analysis, we used mean difference (MD) index. The results suggested the use of polynomial kernel as the final model. Despite multiple methodical challenges raised from the composition and structure of the study site, we conclude that the combined use of polarimetric features (both dual and full) with spectral bands and indices can improve the GSV estimation over mixed broadleaf forests. This was partially supported by the use of proposed evaluation criterion within the GA, which helped to avoid the curse of dimensionality for the applied SVR and lowest over estimation or under estimation. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecosystems; Estimation; Evaluation; Forestry; Forests; Iran; Models; Optimization; Iran; Climate change; Ecosystems; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Optimization; Polarimeters; Adaptation to climate changes; Binary genetic algorithm; Curse of dimensionality; Multi-spectral; Nu SVR; Polarimetery; Support vector regression (SVR); Uneven-aged; accuracy assessment; ALOS; broad-leaved forest; estimation method; mountain region; multispectral image; optimization; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Frequency estimation","GSV; Multi-spectral; Nu SVR; Optimization; Polarimetery; Uneven-aged mountainous","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070547834"

Here, one part of the spectrum is transmitted while the other is reflected. Typical goal requirements are broadband high transmittance and high reflectance without local minima combined with a steep transition zone. These requirements drive the complexity of the coating design. Beside the coating design also the deposition technology has an impact on the feasibility of the coating. In this contribution, we address manufacturing challenges for manufacturing of an ideal beam splitter and compare Ion Assisted Deposition (IAD) and Plasma Enhanced Magnetron Sputtering (PARMS) technology by presenting examples of VIS-NIR beam splitters manufactured at Optics Balzers Jena GmbH (OBJ). These examples reach from beam splitters manufactured by IAD with a total coating thickness of about 3.5 μm to the beam splitter of Sentinel 2 multi-spectral instrument with more than 100 layers a and a coating thickness of about 13 μm. An example which overcomes the limitations of the IAD process is the dichroic plate of ESAs Euclid telescope manufactured by OBJ by means of PARMS process. This dichroic plate shows a reflectance of over 99% in the VIS spectral range and a transmittance of more than 98% in the NIR spectral range.

In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes (“shadow”, “cloud”, “water”, “land” and “snow/ice”). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model's generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data. The rule-based Fmask method takes significantly longer (277.8 s/megapixel) and produces results with an accuracy of 0.75, Kappa of 0.60 and Dice coefficient of 0.72. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Clouds; Convolution; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Neural networks; Semantics; Statistical tests; Cloud shadows; Convolutional neural network; LANDSAT; Multispectral satellite image; Random forest classifier; Segmentation performance; Sentinel-2; State-of-the-art methods; artificial neural network; cloud cover; disaster management; image analysis; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite sensor; segmentation; Sentinel; testing method; training; Image segmentation","Cloud; Cloud shadow; Convolutional neural network; Landsat; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065926004"

In this study, we developed an efficient approach for UELC mapping by coupling Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery and Google Earth high-resolution imagery. In contrast with the conventional single-source and multi-source imagery-based classification methods, the proposed method respectively achieved the highest overall accuracies of 91.50% and 94.05% in the UELC mapping for two test sites (i.e. Shanghai and Seoul). The proposed method is used for urban surface mapping among six world-class cities. For an in-depth analysis of the landscape structures for inner urban regions, seven landscape metrics are introduced for the quantification of the UELC structure based on the obtained high-precision UELC maps. The result shows that London appears to have the best UELC-induced ecological quality, that is, with high percentage of landscape, area-weighted mean fractal dimension, edge density, Shannon's evenness index values and a low contagion index value, while Tokyo is exactly the opposite. Several common characteristics found through the statistical analysis are: 1) all the inner-city regions have small UELC coverage (< 50%) and low shape complexity; 2) green space generally contributes more to urban eco-environment than the urban surface water; and 3) all cities show high landscape consistency in the inner urban region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]; detection method; greenspace; image analysis; land cover; metropolitan area; remote sensing; Sentinel; surface water; urban area","Google earth; Green space; Landscape metric; Metropolitan cities; Sentinel-2; Surface water","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063032083"

To cover the 20-year overall mission duration, two additional satellites Sentinel-2C and Sentinel-2D were founded by the European Commission and are under development. Some modifications were implemented for the two new satellites: (1) on the technical side, modifications to improve further the instrument performance up to End of Life (thermal improvements to reduce the focal plane temperature, optimization of MTF at detector and instrument level) (2) added in orbit activities to improve interinstrument calibration with the Moon calibration.

In a major environmental disaster, the marshes of Iraq were drained, especially during the 1990s. Since then, droughts and the decrease in water imports from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers from Turkey and Iran have prevented them from regaining their former extent. The aim of this research is to extract the values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the period 1977-2017 from Landsat 2 MSS (multispectral scanner), Landsat 8 OLI (operational land imager) and Sentinel 2 MSI (multi-spectral imaging mission) satellite images and use supervised classification to quantify land and water cover change. The results from the two satellites (Landsat 2 and Landsat 8) are compared with Sentinel 2 to determine the best tool for detecting changes in land and water cover. We also assess the potential impacts of climate change through the study of the annual average maximum temperature and precipitation in different areas in the marshes for the period 1981-2016. The NDVI analysis and image classification showed the degradation of vegetation and water bodies in the marshes, as vast areas of natural vegetation and agricultural lands disappeared and were replaced with barren areas. The marshes were influenced by climatic change, including rising temperature and the diminishing amount of precipitation during 1981-2016. © 2019 by the authors.","","Climate change; Iraqi marshes; Satellites data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066468463"

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

Generating a spatio-temporal resource inventory of the small waterbodies has immense potential in evidence-based fisheries development planning, so as to enhance the fish production (quantity) and productivity (quantity per unit area). The present study provides a framework for mapping these waterbodies using high resolution Cartosat 1 PAN and IRS ResourceSAT LISS IV merged imagery, determining the spatio-temporal water spread area and effective water spread area available for fish culture using Sentinel 2 Multi Spectral Imagery, for the years 2016–18. It provides an approach for determining the number of fingerlings required and estimating the production potential under standard production parameters, based on the extent of water available for fish culture in the waterbodies. The framework was piloted in Chhattisgarh, a landlocked State in Central India, which has a large number of inland waterbodies. A total of 121,529 waterbodies, with an area of 202,016 ha were mapped, of which 97% had an extent less than 5 ha. The total extent of waterbodies was 37% higher than the most recent estimate by Government of India. Availability of water in the waterbodies of the state, for a duration of at least 8 and 11 months in a year, was found to be 74% (149,484 ha) and 50% (102,167 ha) respectively, which indicates the vast scope for promotion of intensive aquaculture in the state. Minimum number of fingerlings required for stocking the available water was estimated as 403 million. This framework can be replicated across the country and other regions with poor in-situ data, for effective management of inland waterbodies through location-specific data-driven intervention planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Aquaculture; Fish production potential; Inland fisheries; Normalized difference water index; Water spread area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074864779"

There are a number of differences between the sensor data that need to be considered before the data can be used together reliably. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data for approximately 10° × 10° of southern Africa acquired in two summer (December and January) and in two winter (June and July) months of 2016 were compared. The data were registered and each orbit projected into 30 m fixed non-overlapping tiles defined in the sinusoidal equal area projection. Only corresponding sensor observations of each 30 m tile pixel that were both not cloudy, shadow, saturated, or cirrus contaminated, and that were acquired within one-day of each other, were compared. Both the Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data were atmospherically corrected using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) and were also corrected to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR). Top of atmosphere (TOA), surface reflectance, and NBAR, for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) MSI and OLI bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (from the narrow NIR band for MSI), were compared and their sensor differences quantified by regression analyses. Atmospheric contamination and bi-directional reflectance differences were evident in the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI observations considered. The MSI surface reflectance was greater than the OLI surface reflectance for all the bands except the green, red, and the broad MSI NIR bands, and the MSI surface NDVI was greater than the OLI surface NDVI. This pattern was also found in the NBAR sensor comparisons except for the red bands. Simulated MSI and OLI reflectance derived using the sensor spectral response functions and laboratory spectra showed similar results in the red, NIR and SWIR bands as the real data comparisons. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions of the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI data for the three processing levels had good fits (r2 > 0.87 for the TOA data comparisons, r2 > 0.89 for the atmospherically corrected data comparisons, r2 > 0.90 for the NBAR data comparisons; p-values < 0.0001).

The Copernicus programme developed by the European Space Agency provides, with missions such as Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), radar and optical (multi-spectral) imagery, respectively, at 10 m spatial resolution with revisit time around 5 days. Such high temporal resolution allows to collect Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) that support a plethora of Earth surface monitoring tasks. How to effectively combine the complementary information provided by such sensors remains an open problem in the remote sensing field. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture to combine information coming from S1 and S2 time series, namely TWINNS (TWIn Neural Networks for Sentinel data), able to discover spatial and temporal dependencies in both types of SITS. The proposed architecture is devised to boost the land cover classification task by leveraging two levels of complementarity, i.e., the interplay between radar and optical SITS as well as the synergy between spatial and temporal dependencies.

Multiresolution segmentation, a bottom-up multi-scale segmentation algorithm, is one of the most widely used and successful algorithms. The algorithm requires image band weights, scale parameter, shape, and compactness values to be specified prior to segmentation. The persistent challenge is how to identify these values, which are often determined by trial and error experimentation. This paper aimed at determining pre-segmentation image analyses that can inform the specification of the multiresolution segmentation parameter values, in order to optimise mapping of savannah vegetation community boundaries on high spatial resolution images. The vegetation boundaries in the 56 land types of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, were targeted for segmentation. Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery acquired during the peak vegetation vigour period was used. The high (10 m) spatial resolution green, red, and near-infrared bands were selected for use. The KNP’s large size required a mosaic of successively acquired image frames. Multiresolution segmentation was performed using eCognition Developer 9. Pre-segmentation principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that none of the bands had superior data dimensionality. Therefore, equal band weights of 1 were specified. The original 16-bit top-of-atmosphere reflectance data showed that the vegetation communities had high within-community variance. Texture enhancement of the reflectance data using 3 × 3 kernel variance showed that the vegetation communities were more distinguishable by texture than the untransformed reflectance data. A heterogeneity-based scale parameter value of 388, and a high shape (‘texture’) value of 0.9 at the expense of the reflectance (‘colour’) value of 0.1, were specified. The scale parameter value was determined by averaging object coefficient of variation values on the texture image bands. Pre-segmentation fieldwork revealed transitional vegetation boundaries, necessitating the low compactness value of 0.1 (i.e. high smoothness value of 0.9). From the segmented objects, samples per respective vegetation community were specified for k-nearest neighbour (kNN) classification (k = 1). All of the 100 land type polygons were subsequently delineated, with overall mapping accuracy of 86.2%. Fuzzy membership of border objects successfully reproduced the transitional vegetation boundaries. The successful delineation of the savannah vegetation communities indicated that pre-segmentation PCA and analysis of potential objects’ variance-based texture can provide guidance on parameter values to specify for the inherently iterative multiresolution segmentation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Kruger National Park; South Africa; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Iterative methods; Mapping; Nearest neighbor search; Number theory; Parameter estimation; Principal component analysis; Reflection; Scales (weighing instruments); Vegetation; Coefficient of variation values; Data dimensionality; High spatial resolution images; K nearest neighbours (k-NN); Multiresolution segmentation; Multiscale segmentation; Texture enhancement; Vegetation community; accuracy assessment; algorithm; image analysis; image classification; principal component analysis; savanna; Sentinel; spatial resolution; vegetation mapping; Image segmentation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053035985"

The use of remote sensing data is therefore of high importance to identify and assess their potential hazards. However, the persistence of cloud cover, particularly in high mountain areas such as the Himalayas, limits the temporal resolution of optical satellite data with which we can monitor potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs). The ability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites to collect data, irrespective of weather and at day or night, facilitates monitoring of PDGLs by without compromising temporal resolution. In this study, we present a semi-automated approach, based on a radar signal intensity threshold between water and non-water feature classes followed by post-processing including elevations, slopes, vegetation and size thresholds, to delineate glacial lakes in Sentinel-1 SAR images in Bhutan Himalaya.

The reprocessing software and quality control tool developed for the reprocessing present new features aimed at improving the radiometric and geometric accuracy, image data recovery and including additional quality assurance information. An accurate geometric and radiometric accuracy evaluation across the over 40-years long operative life of Landsat is vital for the exploitation of long time series analysis and for the future development of multi-mission Analysis Ready Data (ARD). This paper proposes to evaluate the geometric accuracy and the radiometric calibration accuracy of the Landsat Level 1 products delivered by ESA. It is obvious that across Landsat historical mission the accuracy is not the same; data are acquired with the MSS, the TM and the ETM+ sensors with improved characteristics for the most recent ones. All these differences between remote sensing systems, did not preclude to engineer processing algorithms with one main objective to harmonize physical measurement and ensure interoperability with the ongoing missions such as Landsat 8 - OLI / Sentinel 2 - MSI. This approach is a key aspect for the future development of multi mission ARD. The geometric quality assurance parameters are exposed in the Level 1 products. These scene based parameters allows to filter out and select, for a given region, if needed the most accurate products. Also, to demonstrate that these parameters are consistent is fundamental. Because of the ageing of missions, specifically for MSS missions, the processing cannot solely rely on information coming from telemetry. It is mandatory to apply ground model and to estimate both external and internal orientation parameters for what concerned the geometric model. Furthermore, for some parameters, the use of single scene for calibration of geo referencing model is not sufficient and the estimate of parameters becomes more robust when considering, instead of one scene, all data recorded in the acquisition period and downlinked to the receiving station. Also, the proposed methodology herein validates the stability of geometric accuracy for a long period of time within the orbit. The product quality assurance parameters are compared with the same ones but inferred from an image matching methods comparing disparity between two geometric grids; the input ESA image and geometric reference image (Global Land Survey data). A comparison with relative USGS products is also performed. © 2019 SPIE.","Calibration; Geometry; Image enhancement; Interoperability; Quality assurance; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space optics; Time series analysis; Calibration/validation; Data preservations; Enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+); LANDSAT; Orientation parameter; Processing algorithms; Radiometric calibrations; Remote sensing system; Quality control","ARD; Bulk processing; Calibration / Validation; Data preservation; Geometry; Landsat; MSS; Quality Control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078193152"

However, it is a very challenging task, which becomes particularly difficult when dealing with cyanobacteria blooms. Water limnology, satellite imagery and neural networks can be used as an ensemble of remote sensing and machine learning technologies in order to estimate the concentration of algal blooms from space. This paper describes empirical algorithms to this end, which incorporate information from the multi-spectral instrument of Sentinel-2 satellite. This approach is applied to the Cefni Reservoir (Anglesey, U.K.), by using spatial and temporal scales.

To date, only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time. The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents, but the high variability of near-surface soil moisture during the snow-free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose. We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C-band SAR data acquired in winter (close to zero liquid water content). To test our hypothesis, we used C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44 cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 54 cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TC). Retrieval from C-band SAR shows similar performance, but C-VV is more suitable than C-HH to derive vegetation height (RMSEs of 48 and 56 cm respectively). An exponential relationship with in situ height was evident for all tested parameters (NDVI, TC, C-VV and C-HH) suggesting that the C-band SAR and multi-spectral approaches possess similar capabilities including tundra biomass retrieval. Errors might occur in specific settings as a result of high surface roughness, high photosynthetic activity in wetlands or high snow density. We therefore introduce a method for combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to address the ambiguities related to Arctic wetlands and barren rockfields. Snow-related deviations occur within tundra fire scars in permafrost areas in the case of C-VV use. The impact decreases with age of the fire scar, following permafrost and vegetation recovery. The evaluation of masked C-VV retrievals across different regions, tundra types and sources (in situ and circumpolar vegetation community classification from satellite data) suggests pan-Arctic applicability to map current conditions for heights up to 160 cm. The presented methodology will allow for new applications and provide advanced insight into changing environmental conditions in the Arctic. © 2019 The Authors","Arctic; Biomass; Climate change; Forestry; Permafrost; Radar; Snow; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Environmental conditions; Multispectral indices; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical; Photosynthetic activity; Shrubs; Tasseled cap wetness; Tundra; biomass; climate change; environmental conditions; feasibility study; NDVI; permafrost; satellite data; Sentinel; shrub; soil moisture; soil-vegetation interaction; synthetic aperture radar; tundra; vegetation type; Vegetation","Optical; Radar; Shrubs; Tundra; Vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076042309"

Soil salinization is often characterized with significant spatiotemporal dynamics. The salt-affected soil is predominant in the Ebinur Lake region in the Northwestern China. However, detailed local soil salinity information is ambiguous at the best due to limited monitoring techniques. Nowadays, the availability of Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2, offers unprecedented perspectives for the monitoring and mapping of soil salinity. The use of MSI data is an innovative attempt for salinity detection in arid land. We hypothesize that field observations and MSI data and MSI data-derived spectral indices using the partial least square regression (PLSR) approach will yield fairly accurate regional salinity map. Based on electrical conductivity of 1:5 soil:water extract (EC) of 72 ground-truth measurements (out of 116 sample sites) and various spectral parameters, such as satellite band reflectance, published satellite salinity indices, red-edge indices, newly constructed two-band indices, and three-band indices from MSI data, we built a few inversion models in an attempt to produce the regional salinity maps. Different algorithms including Pearson correlation coefficient method (PCC), variable importance in projection (VIP), Gray relational analysis (GRA), and random forest (RF) were applied for variable selection. The results suggest that both the newly proposed normalized difference index (NDI) [(B12 − B7) / (B12 + B7)] and three-band index (TBI4) [(B12 − B3) / (B3 − B11)] show a better correlation with validation data and could be applied to estimate the soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region. The established models were validated using the remaining 44 independent ground-based measurements. The RF-PLSR model performed the best across the five models with R2 V, RMSEV, and RPD of 0.92, 7.58 dS m−1, and 2.36, respectively. The result from this model was then used to map the soil salinity over the study area. Our analyses suggest that soil salinization changes quite significantly in different seasons. Specifically, soil salinity in the dry season was higher than in the wet season, mostly in the lake area and nearby shores. We contend that the results from the study will be useful for soil salinization monitoring and land reclamation in arid or semi-arid regions outside the current study area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ebinur Lake; Xinjiang Uygur; Arid regions; Correlation methods; Decision trees; Lakes; Land reclamation; Land use; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Water quality; Normalized difference indices; Partial least square regression; Pearson correlation coefficients; Red edge; Sentinel-2; Soil salinity; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Spectral indices; dry season; environmental monitoring; lacustrine environment; remote sensing; salinity; Sentinel; spectral analysis; water quality; wet season; Soils","Red-edge; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Soil salinity; Spectral indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068520510"

However, due to the imaging mechanism of SAR and the speckle noise, untrained people are difficult to recognize the land cover types visually from SAR images. Inspired by the excellent image-to-image translation performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a supervised Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (S-CycleGAN) was proposed to generate large optical images from the SAR images. When the optical RS data are unavailable or partly unavailable, the generated optical images can be alternative data that aid in land cover visual recognition for untrained people. The main steps of SAR-to-optical image translation were as follows. First, the large SAR image was split to small patches. Then S-CycleGAN was used to translate the SAR patches to optical image patches. Finally, the optical image patches were stitched to generate the large optical image. A paired SAR-optical image dataset which covered 32 Chinese cities was published to evaluate the proposed method. The dataset was generated from Sentinel-1 (SEN-1) SAR images and Sentinel-2 (SEN-2) multi-spectral images. S-CycleGAN was applied to two experiments, which were SAR-to-optical image translation and cloud removal, and the results showed that S-CycleGAN could keep both the land cover and structure information well, and its performance was superior to some famous image-to-image translation models. © 2013 IEEE.","Flow visualization; Geometrical optics; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; Adversarial networks; Cloud contamination; Cloud removal; Multispectral images; Optical image; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel; Structure information; Radar imaging","cloud removal; GAN; SAR-to-optical image translation; Sentinel; visualization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078034428"

Two-stream DL architectures split and process them separately. However, the fusing of the output of the two streams is a challenging task. 3D-CNN processes spatial and spectral information together at the cost of a large number of parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel DL data structure that re-organizes the spectral and spatial information in remote-sensing (RS) images and process them together. Representing a RS image I as a data cube, we handle the spatial and spectral information by reducing the spectral bands from N to M, where M can drop out to one. The spectral information is projected in the spatial dimensions and re-organized in 2-dimensional B blocks. The proposed approach analyzes the spectral information of each block by using 2-dimensional convolutional kernels of appropriate size and stride. The output represents the relationship between the spectral bands of the input image and preserves the spatial relationship between its neighboring pixels. The spatial relationships are analyzed by processing the output of the previous layer with standard 2D-CNNs. Experiments by using images acquired by Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data and the labels of the LUCAS database released in 2018 provide promising results. © SPIE.

Moreover the synoptic view captured by satellite imagery over volcanoes can benefit hazard monitoring efforts. By monitoring, we mean both following the changing styles and intensities of the eruption once it has started, as well as nowcasting and eventually forecasting the areas potentially threatened by hazardous phenomena in an eruptive scenario. Here we demonstrate how the diversity of remote sensing data over volcanoes and the mutual interconnection between satellite observations and numerical simulations can improve lava flow hazard monitoring in response to effusive eruption. Time-averaged discharge rates (TADRs) obtained from low spatial/high temporal resolution satellite data (e.g. MODIS, SEVIRI) are complemented, compared and fine-tuned with detailed maps of volcanic deposits with the aim of constraining the conversion from satellite-derived radiant heat flux to TADR. Maps of volcanic deposits include the time-varying evolution of lava flow emplacement derived from multispectral satellite data (e.g. EO-ALI, Landsat, Sentinel-2, ASTER), as well as the flow thickness variations, retrieved from the topographic monitoring by using stereo or tri-stereo optical data (e.g. Pléiades, PlanetScope, ASTER). Finally, satellite-derived parameters are used as input and validation tags for the numerical modelling of lava flow scenarios. Our strategy is applied to the first historic eruption of Nabro volcano (Eritrea), occurred in June 2011. This eruptive event was characterized by the extraordinary quantity of SO2 emitted into the atmosphere and the extent of the long lava flows, which had a significant impact on the inhabitants of the Eritrea-Ethiopia border region despite the low population density. Because of its remote position, little was known about this eruption regarding the quantity of volcanic deposits and the timing and mechanisms of their emplacement. We found that the total volume of deposits, calculated from differences of digital elevation models (DEMs), is about 580 × 106 m3, of which about 336 × 106 m3 is the volume of the main lava flow that advanced eastward beyond the caldera. Multi-spectral satellite observations indicate that the main lava flow had reached its maximum extent (~16 km) within about 4 days of the eruption onset on midnight 12 June. Lava flow simulations driven by satellite-derived parameters allow building an understanding of the advance rate and maximum extent of the main lava flow showing that it is likely to have reached 10.5 km in one day with a maximum speed of ~0.44 km/h. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Eritrea; Ethiopia; Nabro Volcano; Southern Red Sea; Deposits; Hazards; Heat flux; Monitoring; Numerical models; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Stereo image processing; Volcanoes; Digital elevation model; HOTSAT; Lava flow emplacements; MAGFLOW; Multispectral satellite data; Satellite observations; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite remote sensing data; advance rate; border region; emplacement; hazard assessment; heat flux; lava; lava flow; nowcasting; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; volcanic eruption; volcano; Remote sensing","HOTSAT; Lav@Hazard; MAGFLOW; Numerical modelling; Satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074704067"

Mapping annual current-year SBW defoliation is challenging because of the large landscape scale of infestations, high temporal/spatial variability, and the short period of time when detection is possible. We used Landsat-5 and Landsat-MSS data to develop a method to detect and map SBW defoliation, which can be used as ancillary or alternative information for aerial sketch maps (ASMs). Results indicated that Landsat-5 data were capable of detecting and classifying SBW defoliation into three levels comparable to ASMs. For SBW defoliation classification, a combination of three vegetation indices, including normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were found to provide the highest accuracy (non-defoliated: 77%, light defoliation: 60%, moderate defoliation: 52%, and severe defoliation: 77%) compared to using only NDMI (non-defoliated: 76%, light defoliation: 40%, moderate defoliation: 43%, and severe defoliation: 67%). Detection of historical SBW defoliation was possible using Landsat-MSS NDVI data, and the produced maps were used to complement coarse-resolution aerial sketch maps of the past outbreak. The method developed for Landsat-5 data can be used for current SBW outbreak mapping in North America using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Overall, the work highlights the potential of moderate resolution optical remote sensing data to detect and classify fine-scale patterns in tree defoliation. © 2018 by the authors.","Defoliation; Forestry; Mapping; Plants; Remote Sensing; Satellites; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Choristoneura fumiferana; Antennas; Forestry; Image classification; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Acadian region; Defoliation; Forest pest; Maine; Multi-spectral; Quebec; Spruce budworm; defoliation; detection method; disease severity; image classification; image resolution; Landsat; Landsat multispectral scanner; NDVI; pest species; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Classification (of information)","Acadian region; Defoliation; Forest pests; Maine; Multi-spectral remote sensing; Quebec; Spruce budworm","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048559670"

The satellite-equipped MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument) sensor provides multi-spectral imagery with spatial resolutions of up to 10 m, which marks a new source of data for dynamic monitoring of crop growth. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm for winter wheat leaf area index (LAI) inversion is proposed. First, the winter wheat canopy spectra were generated based on the PROSAIL model in multiple sets of single solar zenith angles (SZA). Then, the corresponding broad-band reflectance is obtained by integrating with the MSI spectral response as the ANN training data. For 10-m resolution LAI retrieval, the surface reflectance of blue (B2), green (B3), red (B4) and near-infrared (B8) bands are used as the inputs of the ANN training. In the LAI inversion process, two nearest SZA values in network collection will be searched out for each pixel first, and the LAI will be estimated by these two networks, separately. The final LAI estimation result will be the linear interpolation of the retrieval outcomes based on their SZA value. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated and validated by using the simulated data generated by the PROSAIL model and the ground measured data afterwards. The evaluation based on simulated data demonstrated that the ANN model proposed by this paper performs better than the traditional ANN inversion method, with RMSE decreasing from 0.37 to 0.20. Validation against ground LAI observation on Sentinel-2 imageries achieves an acceptable accuracy, with R2=0.90 and RMSE=0.73, which will benefit the agriculture applications. Future study for LAI estimation will focus on the use of extra red edge bands of Sentinel-2 imagery in order to achieve a higher accuracy. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Crops; Infrared devices; Neural networks; Orbits; Plants (botany); Reflection; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Agriculture applications; Leaf Area Index; Linear Interpolation; Multi-spectral imagery; Sentinel-2; Solar zenith angle; Surface reflectance; Winter wheat; Remote sensing","Leaf area index; Neural network; Sentinel-2; Solar zenith angle; Winter wheat","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071840835"

Towards addressing this issue, we propose an unsupervised mine-site detection technique using multi-modal remotely sensed data from Sentinel missions. We use Sentinel-1's dual polarized SAR data, and Sentinel-2's multi-spectral data for this purpose. An initial set of seed pixels is sampled using spectral slopes based rules on multi-spectral images, which are tailored to capture mining area pixels that exhibit common characteristics. Then, we generate features using multi-spectral image indices and dual polarized SAR data Stokes' parameters. These features over locations sampled by slope based rules are used to train a one-class support vector machine to detect the land anomalies (mine activities). As observed from the experiments, multi-spectral features are efficient in separating mine region and built-up region from the rest of the land surface, and SAR image features discriminate built-up region from the rest of the image.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing poses an enormous threat to the conservation and management of the dwindling fish stocks, causing multiple adverse consequences for fisheries, coastal and marine ecosystems and for the people who depend on these resources. The Integrated System for Surveillance of Illegal, Unlicensed and Unreported Fishing (INSURE) is an efficient and inexpensive system that has been developed for the monitoring of IUU fishing in Ghanaian waters. It makes use of fast-delivery Earth observation data from the synthetic aperture radar instrument on Sentinel-1 and the Multi Spectral Imager on Sentinel-2, detecting objects that differ markedly from their immediate background using a constant false alarm rate test. Detections are matched to, and verified by, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which provide the location and dimensions of ships that are legally operating in the region. Matched and unmatched data are then displayed on a web portal for use by coastal management authorities in Ghana. The system has a detection success rate of 91% for AIS-registered vessels, and a fast throughput, processing and delivering information within 2 h of acquiring the satellite overpass. However, over the 17-month analysis period, 75% of SAR detections have no equivalent in the AIS record, suggesting significant unregulated marine activity, including vessels potentially involved in IUU. The INSURE system demonstrated its efficiency in Ghana's exclusive economic zone and it can be extended to the neighbouring states in the Gulf of Guinea, or other geographical regions that need to improve fisheries surveillance. © 2019 by the authors.","Automation; Crime; Ecosystems; Errors; Fisheries; Fishing vessels; Geographical regions; Image resolution; Object detection; Observatories; Portals; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; Automatic identification system; Constant false alarm rate; Earth observations; Unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU); Vessel detection; Space-based radar","Automatic identification system (AIS); Constant false alarm rate (CFAR); Earth observation; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU); Vessel detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061350523"

In most previous studies, a single empirical model (global model) was calibrated for the entire water body under study. Our analysis shows that the performance of a global model is limited for optically complex inland waters. We discovered that the global model tends to overestimate in some regions and underestimate in other regions, and that the model residuals (errors) display an apparent spatial autocorrelation pattern. To address the inadequacy of the global empirical model, this paper presents regionally or locally adaptive models to better estimate Chl-a concentrations for the first time. We collected two dense sets of Chl-a measurements over Harsha Lake in Ohio during a Sentinel-2A satellite overpass and a dedicated airborne hyperspectral flight. Based on the atmospherically corrected multispectral and hyperspectral images and concurrent in situ measurements, we implemented and evaluated the performance of regionally and locally adaptive models in comparison with the single global model. Among a number of candidate empirical algorithms, the two-band algorithm produces the best global model for Chl-a retrievals for both the multispectral and hyperspectral image sources. By subdividing the water body under investigation into several regions or a set of local areas, we demonstrate that regionally and locally adaptive models can improve Chl-a estimate accuracy by 13%-28% for the multispectral image and by 33%-47% for the hyperspectral image, in comparison with the best global Chl-a model. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Ohio; United States; algae; Chlorophyll; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Adaptive models; Chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Hyper-spectral imageries; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Spatial autocorrelations; airborne sensing; autocorrelation; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); model; remote sensing; Sentinel; spectral analysis; Image enhancement","Airborne hyperspectral; chlorophyll-a (Chl-a); regionally and locally adaptive models; Sentinel-2 multispectral","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068269730"

Currently, several new generation sensors provided with similar channel characteristics have been operated onboard different satellite platforms, including Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. Joint use of the observations by different sensors offers an opportunity to meet the demands for emergency requirements. For example, through the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, the land can be observed every 2-3 days at medium spatial resolution. However, differences are expected in radiometric values (e.g., channel reflectance) of the corresponding channels between two sensors. Spectral response function (SRF) is taken as an important aspect of sensor settings. Accordingly, between-sensor differences due to SRFs variation need to be quantified and compensated. The comparison of SRFs shows difference (more or less) in channel settings between Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Effect of the difference in SRF on corresponding values between MSI and OLI was investigated, mainly in terms of channel reflectance and several derived spectral indices. Spectra samples from ASTER Spectral Library Version 2.0 and Hyperion data archives were used in obtaining channel reflectance simulation of MSI and OLI. Preliminary results show that MSI and OLI are well comparable in several channels with small relative discrepancy (<5%), including the Costal Aerosol channel, a NIR (855-875 nm) channel, the SWIR channels, and the Cirrus channel. Meanwhile, for channels covering Blue, Green, Red, and NIR (785-900 nm), the between-sensor differences are significantly presented. Compared with the difference in reflectance of each individual channel, the difference in derived spectral index is more significant. In addition, effectiveness of linear transformation model is not ensured when the target belongs to another spectra collection. If an improper transformation model is selected, the between-sensor discrepancy will even largely increase. In conclusion, improvement in between-sensor consistency is possibly a challenge, through linear transformation based on model (s) generated from other spectra collections. © Authors 2018.

We present a generic processing chain that covers all modules required for operational flood monitoring from multi-spectral satellite data. This includes data search, ingestion and preparation, water segmentation and mapping of flooded areas. Segmentation of the water extent is done by a convolutional neural network that has been trained on a global dataset of Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI and Sentinel-2 images. Clouds, cloud shadows and snow/ice are specifically handled by the network to remove potential biases from downstream analysis. Compared to previous work in this direction, the method does not require atmospheric correction or post-processing and does not rely on ancillary data. Our method achieves an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.93, Kappa of 0.87 and Dice coefficient of 0.90. It outperforms a widely used Random Forest classifier and a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) threshold method. We introduce an adaptable reference water mask that is derived by time-series analysis of archive imagery to distinguish flood from permanent water. When tested against manually produced rapid mapping products for three flood disasters (Germany 2013, China 2016 and Peru 2017), the method achieves ≥ 0.92 OA, ≥ 0.86 Kappa and ≥ 0.90 Dice coefficient. Furthermore, we present a flood monitoring application centred on Bihar, India. The processing chain produces very high OA (0.94), Kappa (0.92) and Dice coefficient (0.97) and shows consistent performance throughout a monitoring period of one year that involves 19 Landsat OLI (μKappa = 0.92 and σKappa = 0.07) and 61 Sentinel-2 images (μKappa = 0.92, σKappa = 0.05). Moreover, we show that the mean effective revisit period (considering cloud cover) can be improved significantly by multi-sensor combination (three days with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat OLI). © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Decision trees; Emergency services; Image segmentation; Mapping; Monitoring; Neural networks; Satellites; Time series analysis; Convolutional neural network; Disaster response; Flood monitoring; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2; Floods","Convolutional neural network; Disaster response; Flood monitoring; Landsat; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073429760"

Such dependencies between landscapes and the environment have been noted since the beginning of Earth sciences and cast into conceptual models describing the interdependencies of climate, geology, vegetation and geomorphology. Here, we ask whether landscapes, as seen from space, can be statistically predicted from pertinent environmental conditions. To this end we adapted a deep learning generative model in order to establish the relationship between the environmental conditions and the view of landscapes from the Sentinel-2 satellite. We trained a conditional generative adversarial network to generate multispectral imagery given a set of climatic, terrain and anthropogenic predictors. The generated imagery of the landscapes share many characteristics with the real one. Results based on landscape patch metrics, indicative of landscape composition and structure, show that the proposed generative model creates landscapes that are more similar to the targets than the baseline models while overall reflectance and vegetation cover are predicted better. We demonstrate that for many purposes the generated landscapes behave as real with immediate application for global change studies. We envision the application of machine learning as a tool to forecast the effects of climate change on the spatial features of landscapes, while we assess its limitations and breaking points. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate change; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Pattern recognition; Vegetation; Adversarial networks; Conceptual model; Ecological units; Environmental conditions; Generative model; Landscape composition; Multi-spectral imagery; Spatial features; Climate models","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076136395"

Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing cycle. The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface albedo (α) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather information. For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM). The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management). The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall and air temperature patterns. The net estimated IWR from satellite observations for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Specifically, red-edge (RE) satellite images can be used in this context to reduce the influence of soil background at early stages as well as saturation due to crop leaf area index (LAI) at later stages. However, the availability of high-resolution RE satellite image products for research and application globally remains limited. This study uses the weight-and-unmixing algorithm as well as the SUPer-REsolution for multi-spectral Multi-resolution Estimation (Wu-SupReME) approach to combine the advantages of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial resolution and generate a high-resolution RE product. The resultant fused image is highly correlated (R2 > 0.98) with Sentinel-2 image and clearly illustrates the persistent advantages of such products. This fused image was significantly more accurate than the originals when used to predict heterogeneous wheat LAI and therefore clearly illustrated the persistence of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial advantage, which indirectly proved that the fusion methodology of generating high-resolution red-edge products from Planet and Sentinel-2 images is possible.

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring.Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost. The overall accuracy achieved by our proposed Pixel R-CNN was 96.5%, which showed considerable improvements in comparison with existing mainstream methods. This study showed that Pixel R-CNN based model offers a highly accurate way to assess and employ time-series data for multi-temporal classification tasks. © 2019 by the authors.","","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Pixel-based crops classification; Recurrent neural networks; Satellite imagery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079233685"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of remote sensing techniques for quantification of aboveground grass biomass (BM) and crude protein (CP) in a temperate European climate such as Ireland. The experiment was conducted on 64 plots and 53 paddocks with varying quantities of nitrogen applied. Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and multispectral imagery (MSI) were analyzed to develop the prediction models. The MSI data used in this study were captured using an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) and the satellite Sentinel-2, while the HSI data were obtained using a handheld hyperspectral camera. The prediction models were developed using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and stepwise multi-linear regression (MLR). Eventually, the spatial distribution of grass biomass over plots and paddocks was mapped to assess the within-field variability of grass quality metrics. An excellent accuracy was achieved for the prediction of BM and CP using HSI (RPD > 2.5 and R2 > 0.8), and a good accuracy was obtained via MSI-UAV (2 < RPD < 2.5 and R2 > 0.7) for the grass quality indicators. The accuracy of the models calculated using MSI-Sentinel-2 was reasonable for BM prediction and insufficient for CP estimation. The red-edge range of the wavelengths showed the maximum impact on the predictability of grass BM, and the NIR range had the greatest influence on the estimation of grass CP. Both the PLSR and MLR techniques were found to be sufficiently robust for spectral modelling of aboveground BM and CP. The PLSR yielded a slightly better model than MLR. This study suggested that remote sensing techniques can be used as a rapid and reliable approach for near real-time quantitative assessment of fresh grass quality under a temperate European climate. © 2019 by the authors.","Agronomy; Biomass; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Proteins; Quality control; Spectroscopy; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Crude proteins; Fertilization; Grass biomass; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing","Crude protein; Fertilization; Grass biomass; Hyperspectral; Multispectral","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070446736"

The intertidal topography is poorly mapped worldwide due to the high cost of associated field campaigns. Here we present a combination of remote-sensing and hydrodynamic modeling to overcome the lack of in situ measurements. We derive a digital elevation model (DEM) by linking the corresponding water level to a sample of shorelines at various stages of the tide. Our shoreline detection method is fully automatic and capable of processing high-resolution imagery from state-of-the-art satellite missions, e.g., Sentinel-2. We demonstrate the use of a tidal model to infer the corresponding water level in each shoreline pixel at the sampled timestamp. As a test case, this methodology is applied to the vast coastal region of the Bengal delta and an intertidal DEM at 10mresolution covering an area of 1134 km2 is developed from Sentinel-2 imagery. We assessed the quality of the DEM with two independent in situ datasets and conclude that the accuracy of our DEM amounts to about 1.5 m, which is commensurate with the typical error bar of the validation datasets. This DEM can be useful for high-resolution hydrodynamic and wave modeling of the near-shore area. Additionally, being automatic and numerically effective, our methodology is compliant with near-real-time monitoring constraints. © 2019 by the authors.","Digital instruments; Geomorphology; Hydrodynamics; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Topography; Water levels; Bengal Delta; Digital elevation model; High resolution imagery; In-situ measurement; Intertidal region; Multi-spectral imagery; Near-real-time monitoring; Sentinel-2; Surveying","Bengal delta; Digital elevation model; Intertidal region; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077868034"

However, these hydrologic features remain poorly studied mainly because they are too narrow (typically <30 m) to be reliably delineated in conventional moderate-resolution satellite images (e.g., 30 m Landsat-8 imagery). This study demonstrates the utility of 10 m Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument images to map supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap, covering a total area of ∼10,000 km2. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 both capture overall supraglacial drainage patterns, but Sentinel-2 images are superior to Landsat-8 images for delineating narrow and continuous supraglacial rivers. Sentinel-2 mapping across the three study areas reveals a variety of supraglacial drainage patterns. In northwest Greenland near Inglefield Land, subparallel supraglacial rivers up to 55 km long drain meltwater directly off the ice sheet onto the proglacial zone. On the Devon and the Barnes ice caps, shorter supraglacial rivers (up to 15–30 km long) are commonly interrupted by moulins, which drain internally drained catchments on the ice surface to subglacial systems. We conclude that Sentinel-2 offers strong potential for investigating supraglacial meltwater drainage patterns and improving our understanding of the hydrological conditions of ice masses globally. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Barnes Ice Cap; Canada; Canada; Devon Ice Cap; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Nunavut; catchment; glacial hydrology; image analysis; Landsat; meltwater; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Greenland Ice Sheet; Landsat-8; River remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial River; Surface hydrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062844448"

There are critical stages of crop development, in which water deficit could have a detrimental effect on crop functioning and yield. Facing the challenges related to climate changes and rapidly depleting water resources, it is of utmost importance for agriculture, biologically optimal water status of different crops, at different stages of ontogeny to be determined. In order to achieve this aim, it is necessary a continuous monitoring of crops and assessment of their functioning during each of the growth stages and in different environmental conditions to be conducted.

Despite of satellite based synoptic measuring schema, the quality of glacier anomaly estimate is always on debate. The advancement in Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers the potential future of glacier measurement in UIB. Therefore, this study assesses the quality of OLI and MSI in mapping the glacier anomaly for glaciers of Hunzza in UIB. The methodology is based on acquisition of OLI Level 2 data, while for Sentinel MSI Level 2A data was derived using Level 1C, however, considering Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) is motivation to support the sensors for their calibrated data with uncertainty of 3% as compare to 5% of the raw ETM+. Glacier outlines extracted from the Randolph Glacier Inventory and the snow line altitude (SLA) demarcated through contour generation from Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) to differentiate permanent snow and clear ice in the overall glacier polygon. Reflectance of each band was derived and Normalized Snow Differential Index (NDSI) calculated. Statistics applied in spectral quality assessment for glacier parameters. Overall glacier surface exhibited range of reflectance about 0.08 to 1.39, 0.07 to 1.39 and 0.04 to 1.44 at visible bands of OLI that was differed about 27%, 29% and 25% than that of MSI. Where, for SWIR band both sensors agreed by the mean reflectance of 0.10. Reflectance correlation between both sensors derived as 0.73 to 0.80 at visible band and 0.31 to 0.38 at SWIR which, allows clear discrimination between the clear ice and snow. But the overlap of reflectance within 0.20 to 0.35 in infrared bands of MSI may led to erroneous identification. To complement the results, NDSI of OLI with -0.01 to 0.95 becomes good indicator to distinguish different glacier features with disadvantage of inconsistent in MSI. These results clearly show that OLI and MSI have promising capability to map glacier anomaly and both variants can be synergized for better interpretation in climacterically intrinsic high-altitude zone of UIB. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Glaciers; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Reflection; Snow; Space optics; Contour generation; Digital elevation model; Enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+); Glacier inventory; Multi-spectral; Operational land imager; Sen2Core; Upper Indus Basin; Remote sensing","Glaciers; Multi Spectral Instrument; Operational Land Imager; Sen2Core; Upper Indus Basin","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071845168"

In the eastern parts South Africa, the American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius) has been identified as one of the major threats to social and ecological systems. Optimal management and mitigation of American bramble spread requires reliable and cost effective approaches to determine invaded spatial extents. In this study, we test the value of the recently launched, freely available Sentinel-2 (S2), as opposed to conventional Landsat 8 imagery in mapping the American bramble. Using the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm, we seek to identify the optimal season for mapping the American bramble as well as the most influential bands in the classification process. Results show that Sentinel-2 out-performed Landsat 8 in all seasons, with summer providing the highest classification accuracy (77% accuracy). The study also shows that strategically placed Sentinel-2 bands of Near Infrared, Red edge and Short Wave Infrared significantly contribute to an increase in overall bramble mapping accuracy.

Reliable atmospheric correction is essential to support routine retrieval of optically active substance concentration from water-leaving reflectance. In this study, six publicly available atmospheric correction algorithms (Acolite, C2RCC, iCOR, l2gen, Polymer and Sen2Cor) are evaluated against above-water optical in situ measurements, within a robust methodology, in two optically diverse coastal regions (Baltic Sea, Western Channel) and from 13 inland waterbodies from 5 European countries with a range of optical properties. The total number of match-ups identified for each algorithm ranged from 1059 to 1668 with 521 match-ups common to all algorithms. These in situ and MSI match-ups were used to generate statistics describing the performance of each algorithm for each respective region and a combined dataset.

Identifying and monitoring yellow rust is of great importance for guiding agricultural production over large areas. Compared with traditional crop disease discrimination methods, remote sensing technology has proven to be a useful tool for accomplishing such a task at large scale. This study explores the potential of the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), a newly launched satellite with refined spatial resolution and three red-edge bands, for discriminating between yellow rust infection severities (i.e., healthy, slight, and severe) in winter wheat. The corresponding simulative multispectral bands for the Sentinel-2 sensor were calculated by the sensor’s relative spectral response (RSR) function based on the in situ hyperspectral data acquired at the canopy level. Three Sentinel-2 spectral bands, including B4 (Red), B5 (Re1), and B7 (Re3), were found to be sensitive bands using the random forest (RF) method. A new multispectral index, the Red Edge Disease Stress Index (REDSI), which consists of these sensitive bands, was proposed to detect yellow rust infection at different severity levels. The overall identification accuracy for REDSI was 84.1% and the kappa coefficient was 0.76. Moreover, REDSI performed better than other commonly used disease spectral indexes for yellow rust discrimination at the canopy scale. The optimal threshold method was adopted for mapping yellow rust infection at regional scales based on realistic Sentinel-2 multispectral image data to further assess REDSI’s ability for yellow rust detection. The overall accuracy was 85.2% and kappa coefficient was 0.67, which was found through validation against a set of field survey data. This study suggests that the Sentinel-2 MSI has the potential for yellow rust discrimination, and the newly proposed REDSI has great robustness and generalized ability for yellow rust detection at canopy and regional scales. Furthermore, our results suggest that the above remote sensing technology can be used to provide scientific guidance for monitoring and precise management of crop diseases and pests. © 2018 by the authors.

This study presents a new method for AGB estimation and demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data as an alternative to other costly remotely sensed data, such as hyperspectral and LiDAR data in unapproachable regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a forest in Kurdistan province, west of Iran, using in-situ measured AGB as a dependent variable and spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm. The influence of the input variables number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all spectral bands plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 Combining double low line 0.87 and RMSE Combining double low line 10.75 t ha-1). Including the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but slightly reduced the error. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in different topographical conditions with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying conditions would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2. © 2019 H.

However, huge volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery produced every 5 days need a fast and accurate classifier for impervious mapping. In this paper, a novel spectral spatial residual convolution neural network (SSRCNN) has been designed to deal with the massive imagery for impervious classification with high speed and accuracy.

The extent of peridotite and dunite units mapped using both approaches is consistent with geological map, whereas pyroxenite abundance maps show different patterns in their distribution as compared to the geological map. The results suggest that EnGeoMAP method has a better performance than ISMA method for mapping the dunite unit, whilst ISMA performs better for mapping peridotite and pyroxenite rocks. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Several spectral indices have proven to be valuable tools in describing crop spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, a detailed analysis and comparison of vineyard multispectral imagery, provided by decametric resolution satellite and low altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms, is presented. The effectiveness of Sentinel-2 imagery and of high-resolution UAV aerial images was evaluated by considering the well-known relation between the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and crop vigour. After being pre-processed, the data from UAV was compared with the satellite imagery by computing three different NDVI indices to properly analyse the unbundled spectral contribution of the different elements in the vineyard environment considering: (i) the whole cropland surface; (ii) only the vine canopies; and (iii) only the inter-row terrain. The results show that the raw s resolution satellite imagery could not be directly used to reliably describe vineyard variability. Indeed, the contribution of inter-row surfaces to the remotely sensed dataset may affect the NDVI computation, leading to biased crop descriptors. On the contrary, vigour maps computed from the UAV imagery, considering only the pixels representing crop canopies, resulted to be more related to the in-field assessment compared to the satellite imagery. The proposed method may be extended to other crop typologies grown in rows or without intensive layout, where crop canopies do not extend to the whole surface or where the presence of weeds is significant. © 2019 by the authors.","Antennas; Crops; Image analysis; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Decision viticulture; Effective management; Multi-spectral imagery; Normalised difference vegetation index; Remotely sensed data; Spatial and temporal variability; Spectral contribution; Spectral indices; Satellite imagery","Decision viticulture; Precision agriculture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; UAV","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062560583"

Sentinel-2 is European based satellite equipped with the state of the art multispectral imager which offers high spectral resolution (13- spectral bands), high spatial resolution (up to 10m pixel-1) and good temporal resolution (6 to 10days). Considering these features, time series of multispectral images of sentinel-2 has been used to establish temporal pattern of spectral vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI, SAVI, EVI, RVI) of crops to monitor the phenological behavior over time. In addition, the influence of various atmospheric variables (such as temperature in the air and precipitation ) on the derived spectral vegetation indices has also been investigated in this work. Land use and coverage area frame survey (LUCAS-2015) has been used as ground reference data for this study. This study shows that by using sentinel-2, understanding relation between atmospheric conditions and crops phenological behavior can be useful to manage agricultural activities. © 2018 IEEE.","Antennas; Crops; Forestry; Image resolution; Information management; Land use; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectral resolution; Surveys; Time series; Vegetation; Weed control; Agricultural activities; Agricultural practices; High spatial resolution; High spectral resolution; Image time-series; Multi-spectral; Spatial resolution; Spectral vegetation indices; Pattern recognition","Crops phenology; image time series; Multispectral; spatial resolution; spectral resolution; spectral vegetation indices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065988096"

Bi-temporal change detection method is unable to indicate the continuous change occurring over a long period of time and thus to achieve this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral satellite images of same geographical region over a period of 2015 to 2018 are obtained and analyzed. SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multispectral image data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 are used. Statistical composite hypothesis technique is used for estimating pixel-based change detection. The well-established likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic is used for determining the pixel-wise change in a series of complex covariance matrices of multilooked polarimetric SAR data. In case of multispectral images, the approach used is to estimate a statistical model from series of multispectral image data over a long period of time, assuming there is no considerable change during that time period and then compare it with the multispectral image data obtained at a later time. The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used to detect the target (changed pixel) from probabilistic estimated model of the corresponding background clutter (non-changed pixels). To minimize error due to co-registration, 8- neighborhood pixels around the pixel under test are also considered. There are different challenges in both the cases. SAR images have the advantage of being insensitive to atmospheric and light conditions, but it suffers the presence of speckle phenomenon. In case of multispectral, challenge is to get quite large number of datasets without cloud coverage in region of interest for multivariate distribution modelling. Due to imperfect modelling there will be high probability of false alarm. Co-registration is also an important criterion in multitemporal image analysis. © SPIE.

This traditional expression is centered on the theory that absorption of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) follow a bell-shaped function skewed to the upper canopy. However, the validity of this theory has remained untested for a suite of canopy traits in a temperate forest ecosystem across multiple seasons using multispectral imagery. In this study, we examined the effect of canopy traits expression in modelling canopy traits using Sentinel-2 multispectral data across the growing season in Bavaria Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. To achieve this, we measured leaf mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll (Cab), nitrogen (N) and carbon content and LAI from the exposed upper and shaded lower canopy respectively over three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Subsequently, we estimated canopy traits using two expressions, i.e. the traditional expression-based on the product of LAI and leaf traits content of samples collected from the sunlit upper canopy (hereinafter top-of-canopy expression) and the weighted expression - established on the proportion between the shaded lower and sunlit upper canopy LAI and their respective leaf traits content. Using a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we separately modelled canopy traits estimated from the two expressions using Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. Our results showed that dry matter related canopy traits (LMA, N and carbon) estimated based on the weighted canopy expression yield stronger correlations and higher prediction accuracy (NRMSECV < 0.19) compared to the top-of-canopy traits expression across all seasons. In contrast, canopy chlorophyll estimated from the top-of-canopy expression demonstrated strong fidelity with Sentinel-2 bands and vegetation indices (RMSE < 0.48 µg/cm2) compared to weighted canopy chlorophyll (RMSE > 0.48 µg/cm2) across all seasons. We also developed a generalized model that explained 52.57–67.82% variation in canopy traits across the three seasons. Using the most accurate Random Forest model for each season, we demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 data to map seasonal dynamics of canopy traits across the park. Results presented in this study revealed that canopy trait expression can have a profound effect on modelling the accuracy of canopy traits using satellite imagery throughout the growing seasons. These findings have implications on model accuracy when monitoring the dynamics of ecosystem functions, processes and services. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this paper, we propose an automatic glacier discrimination approach named MSSUnet to address several key research issues. First, a spatial-spectral module is used to adaptively learning the feature from different spectral band and neighboring pixels, which can better learn spatial-spectral features and reduce the impact of noise. Second, a band fusion method is applied to achieve fusion of different resolution bands in Sentinel-2 and reduce the interference of additional information. Furthermore, the proposed MSSUNet is compared with several existing neural networks on Sentinel-2 imagery to justify the advantage and improvement of the proposed approach.

Thus, spatial and temporal monitoring of SOC is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspective. In this regard, the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the Sentinel-2 data can be exploited for monitoring SOC contents in the topsoil of croplands. In this study, we aim to test the effect of the threshold for a spectral index linked to soil moisture and crop residues on the performance of SOC prediction models using the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Sentinel-2 and the European Land Use/cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) topsoil database. The LUCAS spectral data resampled according to MSI/Sentinel-2 bands, which were used to build SOC prediction models combining pairs of the bands. The SOC models were applied to a Sentinel-2 image acquired in North-Eastern Germany after removing the pixels characterized by clouds and green vegetation. Then, we tested different thresholds of the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) index in order to mask moist soil pixels and those with dry vegetation and crop residues. The model accuracy was tested on an independent validation database and the best ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) was obtained using the average between bands B6 and B5 (Red-Edge Carbon Index: RE-CI) (RPD: 4.4) and between B4 and B5 (Red-Red-Edge Carbon Index: RRE-CI) (RPD: 2.9) for a very low NBR2 threshold (0.05). Employing a higher NBR2 tolerance (higher NBR2 values), the mapped area increases to the detriment of the validation accuracy. The proposed approach allowed us to accurately map SOC over a large area exploiting the LUCAS spectral library and, thus, avoid a new ad hoc field campaign. Moreover, the threshold for selecting the bare soil pixels can be tuned, according to the goal of the survey. The quality of the SOC map for each tolerance level can be judged based on the figures of merit of the model. © 2019 by the authors.","Agricultural wastes; Crops; Database systems; Land use; Pixels; Soil moisture; Surveys; System-on-chip; Vegetation; Economic perspective; Multi-spectral; Normalized Burn Ratio 2; North-eastern germany; Sentinel-2; Soil organic carbon; Spectral libraries; Statistical survey; Organic carbon","LUCAS spectral library; Multispectral; Normalized Burn Ratio 2; Sentinel-2; SOC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072633132"

Hyderabad’s urbanisation with drivers such as rapid industrialisation, surge in IT industry, housing for different classes of population, real estate boom, etc., have exerted tremendous pressure on the tank systems. The present study taken up in Sangareddy district, Telangana, with a prime objective to bring out effects of urbanisation on tank systems and map the spatial and temporal changes of tank catchments, submergence and command area using the Remote sensing techniques. Multi Spectral LANDSAT series and Sentinel 2 data from 2004 to 2016 are used to study the change pattern and understand the changes in terms of plotting, construction and other uncultivated areas. The Satellite data analysed supported by ground truth and relevant secondary data indicates that the tank systems are prone to severe degradation affecting the inflows, storage, irrigation, groundwater recharge and other indirect livelihoods like fisheries.

They are globally important components of the biogeochemical carbon cycle and have potential feedback effects on climate. These northern waters are mostly small lakes and ponds, and although they may be mapped using very high-resolution satellites or aerial photography, these approaches are generally not suitable for monitoring purposes, due to the cost and limited availability of such images. In this study we evaluated the potential use of widely available high-resolution imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2) for the characterization of the spectral reflectance of thermokarst lakes and ponds. Specifically, we aimed to define the minimum lake area that could be reliably imaged, and to identify challenges and solutions for remote sensing of such waters in the future. The study was conducted in subarctic Canada, in the vicinity of Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik (Nunavik, Québec), an area in the sporadic permafrost zone with numerous thermokarst waterbodies that vary greatly in size. Ground truthing lake reflectance data were collected using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) fitted with a multispectral camera that collected images at 13 cm resolution. The results were compared with reflectance from Sentinel-2 images, and the effect of lake area on the reflectance response was assessed. Our results show that Sentinel-2 imagery was suitable for waterbodies larger than 350 m2 once their boundaries were defined, which in the two test sites would allow monitoring from 11% to 30% of the waterbodies and 73% to 85% of the total lake area. Challenges for remote sensing of small lakes include the confounding effects of water reflection (both direct radiation and diffuse), wind and shadow. Given the small threshold area and frequent revisit time, Sentinel-2 provides a valuable approach towards the continuous monitoring of waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes such as those found in thermokarst landscapes. UASs provide a complementary approach for ground truthing and boundary definition. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Permafrost; Ponding; Ponds; Radiation effects; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Small satellites; Continuous monitoring; High resolution imagery; Multi-spectral cameras; Sentinel-2; Spectral reflectances; Subarctic; Unmanned aerial systems; Very high resolution; Lakes","Lakes; Permafrost; Ponds; Reflectance; Satellite; Sentinel-2; Subarctic; Unmanned Aerial Systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065042534"

The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring.

In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth.

To meet this challenge requires effective algorithms for combining heterogeneous data to identify subtle but important changes among the intrinsic data variation. The major obstacle to using heterogeneous satellite data to monitor anomalous changes across time is this: subtle but real changes on the ground can be overwhelmed by artifacts that are simply due to the change in modality. Here, we implement a joint-distribution framework for anomalous change detection that can effectively ""normalize"" for these changes in modality, and does not require any phenomenological resampling of the pixel signal. This flexibility enables the use of satellite imagery from different sensor platforms and modalities. We use multi-year construction of the Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park (in Inglewood, CA) as our testbed, and exploit synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 and multispectral imagery from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8.

On January 6, the tanker collided with a cargo ship in the East China Sea, caught fire and drifted southeast before the explosion on January 14. The influence of wind and currents found from satellite data on the drift and shape of oil spots is considered. The approximate correspondence of condensate drift models with satellite observation data is noted. The correlation of the PALSAR-2 SAR and MSI images obtained with a time difference of 1 hour 13 minutes is shown. The contrasts of oil against the rough water surface are determined. Several gradations of contamination were distinguished, apparently differing in the degree of uniformity and films thickness. The difference between the clean sea NRCS and NRCS with a condensate film in a strip of ~1.5 km was 2-2.5 dB. The contrast of the dark gray films (with a small percentage of clean water) was approximately 1.5-2 dB. PALSAR-2 SAR image with light gray films has a contrast about 1 dB. The condensate contrasts at λ = 5.6 cm were greater and varied from 6-7 to 2-3 dB with a change in the film tone from black to gray with a wind of 5 m/s.

CNES, the French Space Agency, was involved in the commissioning of both Sentinel-2 satellites and is currently working in collaboration with ESA on their long-term monitoring. This paper reviews all the techniques used to ensure an absolute calibration of the 13 spectral bands to better than 5% (the target is 3%) at TOA level. After a brief description of the mission and its related radiometric calibration scheme, we show how standard vicarious calibration methods based on acquisitions over natural targets (oceans, deserts, and Antarctica during winter) are used to check and improve the accuracy of the absolute calibration coefficients.

The S2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) features two distinct arrays of 12 detectors mounted on each focal plane covering VNIR and SWIR channels respectively, in order to cover the whole instrument field of view. The configured operation of the 12 detectors introduces bidirectional reflectance effects on the S2 satellite images, which are more distinct over water bodies due to water inherent optical properties. In this study, three methods for the elimination of the bidirectional reflectance effects are evaluated: i) The c-factor approach along with the Ross-Li model, that simulates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for calculating the Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR), ii) an image-based method, which encompasses the acrosstrack reflectance variances, using for each column, the deviation between the column mean value and a polynomial trendline which is constructed to fit all the column mean values, and iii) a method which adjusts the reflectance values of each detector to those originated from the detector with the closest to nadir view zenith. Furthermore, the ACOLITE atmospheric correction software was evaluated in terms of reflectance variance elimination when S-2 images are processed. A mosaic of S2 images presenting the Ionian Sea, southwest of Greece has been used for the evaluation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NBAR methodology over ocean scenes proving that physical models adequately describe bidirectional causes and effects. The other two methods smooth variances between the detectors, however, they do not eliminate the BRDF effects. ACOLITE software did not achieve to reduce reflectance variances in S-2 images. © 2019 SPIE.

However, certain context-dependent classes, such as urban areas, remain challenging to classify correctly with pixel-based methods. Including contextual information into the classification can either be done at the feature level with texture descriptors or object-based approaches, or in the classification model itself, as is done in Convolutional Neural Networks. This improves recognition rates of these classes, but sometimes deteriorates the fine-resolution geometry of the output map, particularly in sharp corners and in fine elements such as rivers and roads. However, the quality of the geometry is difficult to assess in the absence of dense training data, which is usually the case in land cover mapping, especially over wide areas. This work presents a framework for measuring the geometric precision of a classification map, in order to provide deeper insight into the consequences of the use of various contextual features, when dense validation data is not available. This quantitative metric, named the Pixel Based Corner Match (PBCM), is based on corner detection and corner matching between a pixel-based classification result, and a contextual classification result. The selected case study is the classification of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral image time series, with a rich nomenclature containing context-dependent classes. To demonstrate the added value of the proposed metric, three spatial support shapes (window, object, superpixel) are compared according to their ability to improve the classification performance on this challenging problem, while paying attention to the geometric precision of the result. The results show that superpixels are the best candidate for the local statistics features, as they modestly improve the classification accuracy, while preserving the geometric elements in the image. Furthermore, the density of edges in a sliding window provides a significant boost in accuracy, and maintains a high geometric precision. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Edge detection; Geometry; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Spectroscopy; Superpixels; Textures; Time series; Classification performance; Contextual classification; Contextual feature; Convolutional neural network; Land cover mapping; Pixel based classifications; Satellite images; Superpixel segmentations; Mapping","Contextual features; Image processing; Image segmentation; Land cover mapping; Satellite image time series; Superpixel segmentation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071588830"

Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is an effective supplement to the ship-based echo sounder, especially for bathymetric measurement in the area that is difficult to reach. Accurate SDB in the Arctic waters is more complex by weak light, cloud, mist, floating ice and so on than in middle or lower latitude clean waters. This paper performs SDB based on Support vector regression (SVR) from multi-spectral imagery of Sentinel-2 in shallow water (0-20 m) of Pomorskiy Proliv of Northern Russia, and corrects the estimated water depth with the interpolation of residuals. The results indicate that the highest accuracy of SDB based on SVR is achieved by employing radial basis function on the full feature inputs, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.5 m and the mean relative error of 44.9 %. After the residual interpolation correction, the overall MAE reduces to 2.0 m, and the root mean square errors decrease by at least 0.3 m among different depth ranges. The approach provides technical support for obtaining a wide range and relatively high spatial resolution of bathymetric data in the Arctic region.  © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","","Arctic; residual interpolation; Satellite-derived bathymetry; support vector regression","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087173223"

In this study we propose a method for early season Wheat area mapping using the combined use of temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 observations. Further, we propose a method to estimate the crop phenology parameter viz. sowing date using the early time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Few districts from Haryana and Punjab have been selected. The Wheat sowing starts in month of Oct.-Nov. Considering the sowing window, images available during Oct.-Dec. 2017 have been chosen for early season Wheat area mapping. The field data for Wheat, other crops, forest, water and settlements classes is gathered using human participatory sensing and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and used for data analysis. We have assessed the performance of random forest classifier using 1. NDVI derived from Sentinel-2, 2. VV and VH backscatter obtained from Sentinel-1 and 3. Both NDVI and VV-VH backscatter. Results show the maximum classification accuracy of 88.31 % when using combination of NDVI, VV and VH. However, accuracy drops to 87.19 % and 79.16 % while using NDVI and VV-VH respectively. Further, to estimate the sowing date we have considered the NDVI time-series during Oct.-Dec. for Wheat pixels. A method based on NDVI compositing is used with gradual increase of 0.1-0.15 at every 12 days for subsequent two images. We have found a good agreement between the estimated sowing dates and actual sowing dates. © Authors 2019.

Original spectral bands, spectral indices, first-order statistics, Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture measures, and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), based on the multi-seasonal and single-date Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, were used for GSV model development using the bagging LASSO algorithm.

Also, models based on texture were more efficient than the spectral models. The GLCM measures derived from July image, provided the most accurate single-date estimate of GSV (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 35.21), while their multi-seasonal counterparts improved slightly the accuracy (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 32.77).

The model is set-up using 2 m resolution hyperspectral data. Next, it is upscaled to the city level, using multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data with 20 m resolution.We identify the total impervious area, the vegetation cover and the leaf area index as important metrics to derive a timeseries of spatially distributed net rainfall, runoff and infiltration from rainfall data. For the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration we use the potential evapotranspiration and the available water storage based on the interception, the depression storage and the infiltration. Additionally, we route the runoff to the outlet of selected sub-catchments. An important metric for the routing is the timing to the outlet which is approximated using the total impervious area and the hydrological distance to the outlet. We compare our approach to WetSpa model simulations and reach R2 values of 98% for net rainfall, 95% for surface runoff, 99% for infiltration and 97% for cumulative evapotranspiration. The routing in the Watermaelbeek catchment is evaluated with discharge observations and reaches NSE values of 0.89 at a 2 m resolution and 0.88 at a 20 m resolution using an hourly timestep. At the timestep of 10 min and a 20 m resolution the NSE is reduced to 0.76. For the Roodebeek catchment we reach an NSE of 0.73 at a spatial resolution of 20 m and an hourly timestep.

Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantifies the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 × 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation >0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in different orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution. © 2018 The Authors","South Africa; Characterization; Data visualization; Statistics; European Space Agency; LANDSAT; Least squares adjustments; Registration; Registration precision; Sentinel-2; Sub-pixel registrations; Universal Transverse Mercator; algorithm; data acquisition; data processing; Landsat; least squares method; pixel; precision; satellite data; Sentinel; wavelength; Pixels","Characterization; Landsat; Least-squares adjustment; Registration; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046143432"

Firstly, a simple differencing scheme is employed for dry/wet snow mapping, where the snow cover area is derived using the Normalized Differenced Snow Index (NDSI). In the second framework, the ratio images are stacked with the multispectral bands and this stack is used for supervised and unsupervised classification using support vector machines for dry/wet snow mapping. We also investigate the potential of a state of the art backscatter model for the identification of dry/wet snow using Sentinel-1 data. The results are validated using a reference map derived from RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. A good agreement was observed between the results and the reference data with an overall accuracy greater than 0.78 for the different blending techniques examined.

Participatory mapping on landslide incidents were conducted in three villages, i.e., Kareko, Pintu Kota, and Pasir Panjang. Data used include digital elevation model from SRTM, multispectral imageries from Sentinel 2, and precipitation from CHIRPS. Terrain modelling was done to DEM to come up with elevation, slope, curvature, and aspect. A cloud free mosaic of Sentinel Images was created using the median reducer and then NDVI was calculated. Precipitation data from CHIRPS was sampled and interpolated using kriging and reduced to maximum and mean. Each algorithm was trained using 70% participatory mapping data and then the prediction was tested for accuracy using the last 30%. Results showed that Random Forest, SVM, CART, and GMO Maxent gave 0.98 testing accuracy and Naïve Bayes only 0.90. The map showed that due to the terrain condition, Lembeh Island is prone to Landslide and even though previously BNPB already provide a landslide hazard risk map, there were many areas not included on that map. Therefore, the map could become an input for BNPB and the Bitung City for developing a mitigation and adaptation strategy. Machine learning and cloud computing along with participatory mapping could also complement mechanistic or multi-criteria analysis using GIS model for landslide susceptibility mapping. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Chirp modulation; Cloud computing; Decision trees; Earth (planet); Landslides; Learning algorithms; Mapping; Maps; Surveying; Adaptation strategies; Digital elevation model; Earth observation data; Landslide susceptibility; Landslide susceptibility mapping; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-spectral imagery; Terrain conditions; Machine learning","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077471375"

Current land cover products tend to underestimate the extent of mountain shrublands dominated by Ericaceae (Vaccinium spp. (species) and Rhododendron ferrugineum). In addition, mountain shrubs are often confounded with grasslands. Here, we examined the potential of anthocyanin-responsive vegetation indices to provide more accurate maps of mountain shrublands in a mountain range located in the French Alps. We relied on the multi-spectral instrument onboard the Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites and the availability of red-edge bands to calculate a Normalized Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (NARI). We used this index to quantify the autumn accumulation of anthocyanin in canopies dominated by Vaccinium spp. and Rhododendron ferrugineum and compared the effectiveness of NARI to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a basis for shrubland mapping. Photointerpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery, intensive field campaigns, and floristic surveys provided complementary data to calibrate and evaluate model performance. The proposed NARI-based model performed better than the NDVI-based model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 against 0.58. Validation of shrub cover maps based on NARI resulted in a Kappa coeffcient of 0.67, which outperformed existing land cover products and resulted in a ten-fold increase in estimated area occupied by Ericaceae-dominated shrublands. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 red-edge band provides novel opportunities to detect seasonal anthocyanin accumulation in plant canopies and discuss the potential of our method to quantify long-term dynamics of shrublands in alpine and arctic contexts. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Anthocyanins; Biodiversity; Forestry; Mapping; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing; Landforms","Anthocyanin; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076564830"

Sentinel-2 provides global coverage, whereas VENμS covers selected regions, including parts of Israel. To facilitate the combination of these sensors into a unified time-series, a transformation model between them was developed using imagery from the region of interest. For this purpose, same-day acquisitions from both sensor types covering the surface reflectance over Israel, between April 2018 and November 2018, were used in this study. Transformation coefficients from VENμS to Sentinel-2 surface reflectance were produced for their overlapping spectral bands (i.e., visible, red-edge and near-infrared). The performance of these spectral transformation functions was assessed using several methods, including orthogonal distance regression (ODR), the mean absolute difference (MAD), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). Post-transformation, the value of the ODR slopes were close to unity for the transformed VENμS reflectance with Sentinel-2 reflectance, which indicates near-identity of the two datasets following the removal of systemic bias. In addition, the transformation outputs showed better spectral similarity compared to the original images, as indicated by the decrease in SAM from 0.093 to 0.071. Similarly, the MAD was reduced post-transformation in all bands (e.g., the blue band MAD decreased from 0.0238 to 0.0186, and in the NIR it decreased from 0.0491 to 0.0386). Thus, the model helps to combine the images from Sentinel-2 and VENμS into one time-series that facilitates continuous, temporally dense vegetation monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Calibration; Electric power factor correction; Image segmentation; Infrared devices; Orthogonal functions; Time series; Vegetation; Band transformation; BRDF; High resolution multi-spectral imagery; Mean absolute differences; Sentinel-2; Spectral transformations; Transformation coefficients; Transformation functions; Reflection","Band transformation; BRDF; Calibration; Correction; Sentinel-2; VENμS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071589383"

Wildfires weaken the shear strength of the soil, forming a layer of soil that is vulnerable to landslides. It is important to identify the severity of a wildfire as well as the burned area to sustainably manage the forest. Although satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map wildfire severity, it is often difficult to determine the severity using only the temporal change of satellite-derived indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). In this study, we proposed an approach for determining wildfire severity based on machine learning through the synergistic use of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar-C data and Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument data. Three wildfire cases-Samcheok in May 2017, Gangreung · Donghae in April 2019, and Gosung · Sokcho in April 2019-were used for developing wildfire severity mapping models with three machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine). The results showed that the random forest model yielded the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy of 82.3%. The cross-site validation to examine the spatiotemporal transferability of the machine learning models showed that the models were highly sensitive to temporal differences between the training and validation sites, especially in the early growing season. This implies that a more robust model with high spatiotemporal transferability can be developed when more wildfire cases with different seasons and areas are added in the future. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

However, coastal areas, especially the interior of mangroves, are often difficult to access. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), equipped with a multispectral sensor, affords an opportunity to improve upon satellite imagery for coastal management because of the very high spatial resolution, multispectral capability, and opportunity to collect real-time observations. Despite the recent and rapid development of UAV mapping applications, few articles have quantitatively compared how much improvement there is of UAV multispectral mapping methods compared to more conventional remote sensing data such as satellite imagery. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively demonstrate the improvements of a multispectral UAV mapping technique for higher resolution images used for advanced mapping and assessing coastal land cover. We performed multispectral UAV mapping fieldwork trials over Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida. Ground Control Points (GCPs) were collected to generate a rigorous geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery and support comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also acquired to map land cover for the same region. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were used for comparison between UAV and satellite mapping capabilities. Compared with aerial images acquired from Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the UAV multi-spectral mapping method used in this study provided advanced information of the physical conditions of the study area, an improved land feature delineation, and a significantly better mapping product than satellite imagery with coarser resolution. The study demonstrates a replicable UAV multi-spectral mapping method useful for study sites that lack high quality data. © 2019 by the authors.

However, most of these methods neglect the spatial information when they are used in image clustering. The spatial information and spectral indices are useful in remote-sensing data classification. Thus, determining how to integrate them into IT2FCM to improve the quality and accuracy of the classification is very important. This paper proposes an enhanced IT2FCM* (EnIT2FCM*) algorithm by combining spatial information and spectral indices for remote-sensing data classification. First, the new comprehensive spatial information is defined as the combination of the local spatial distance and attribute distance or membership-grade distance. Then, a novel distance metric is proposed by combining this new spatial information and the selected spectral indices; these selected spectral indices are treated as another dataset in this distance metric. To test the effectiveness of the EnIT2FCM* algorithm, four typical validity indices along with the confusion matrix and kappa coefficient are used. The experimental results show that the spatial information definition proposed here is effective, and some spectral indices and their combinations improve the performance of the EnIT2FCM*. Thus, the selection of suitable spectral indices is crucial, and the combination of soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEIsh) is the best choice of spectral indices for this method. © 2017 by the authors.","Clustering algorithms; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy sets; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Attribute distances; Interval type-2 fuzzy; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing data classification; Sentinel-2; Spatial informations; Classification (of information)","Classification; Fuzzy clustering; Interval type-2 fuzzy set; Multi-spectral remote sensing; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029691883"

It is developed in partnership between the European Commission and the European Space Agency. The Sentinel-2 mission is based on a satellites constellation deployed in polar sun-synchronous orbit. It will offer a unique combination of global coverage with a wide field of view (290km), a high revisit (5 days with two satellites), a high resolution (10m, 20m and 60m) and multi-spectral imagery (13 spectral bands in visible and shortwave infra-red domains). CNES is involved in the instrument commissioning in collaboration with ESA. This paper reviews all the techniques that will be used to insure an absolute calibration of the 13 spectral bands better than 5% (target 3%), and will present the first results if available. First, the nominal calibration technique, based on an on-board sun diffuser, is detailed. Then, we show how vicarious calibration methods based on acquisitions over natural targets (oceans, deserts, and Antarctica during winter) will be used to check and improve the accuracy of the absolute calibration coefficients. Finally, the verification scheme, exploiting photometer in-situ measurements over Lacrau plain, is described.

The aerosol and water vapor parameters used in the 6SV model were obtained from the AERONET data. The evaluation results showed that for the visible bands, the Sen2Cor BOA reflectance was lower than the 6SV BOA reflectance, with a maximum relative bias of -36.5%, due to an overestimation of the aerosol optical depth retrieved by Sen2Cor. The bias of the BOA reflectance could also affect the vegetation index (VI) calculation. Four VIs were calculated and compared using the different BOA reflectance.

In order to test for and quantify differences between these sensors, a large set of coincident imagery was assembled for the Australian landscape. Comparisons were carried out in terms of surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical quantities estimated from the reflectances. Small but consistent differences were found, and suitable adjustment equations fitted to enable transformation of Sentinel-2A reflectance values to more closely match Landsat-7 or Landsat-8 values. This is useful if trying to take models and thresholds fitted from Landsat and use them with Sentinel-2.

To achieve this objective, the Copernicus Program features two main components: In- Situ Measurement component, devoted to the provision of Copernicus Services and the Space Segment component. This latter is responsible for the operational provision of Earth Observation data, achieved by a series of ‘Sentinels’ spacecraft and Instruments. Six different families of Sentinels mission have been defined, comprising: a C-band interferometry radar mission (Sentinel-1), a multispectral optical imaging mission (Sentinel-2), a mission with a wide-swath, low medium resolution optical and infrared radiometers and a radar altimeter package (Sentinel-3), two families of atmosphere chemistry monitoring missions (Sentinel-4,- 5), a Sentinel-5 precursor comprising a single satellite mission planned in order to reduce data gaps between Envisat and Sentinel-5 and finally, a Sentinel-6 family to provide high accuracy altimetry for measuring global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and for climate studies. Sentinels 1A and 2A have been successfully Launched in April 2014 and June 2015 respectively and are already in the Operational phase. The Launch of Sentinel 3A took place in February 2016, consolidating the first lot of Sentinels Launches. In 2016 and 2017 Sentinel-1B, Sentinel-5P, Sentinel-2B and Sentinel-3B should follow, completing the first part of the Copernicus constellation. All the Sentinels missions are regarded as operational missions and as such require a high degree of reliability and availability also at the level of the ground segment while minimizing the operational effort associated to the routine mission phase. This in turn calls for implementation of an advanced on-board autonomy functionality and definition of an innovative operational concept aimed at minimizing ground intervention both in nominal and contingency situations. The Copernicus/Sentinels Ground Segment is composed of the Core Ground Segment, the Collaborative Ground Segment and the Copernicus contributing missions' ground segments. The Core Ground Segment monitors and controls the Sentinel spacecraft, ensures the measurement data acquisition, processing, archiving and dissemination to the final users. In addition, it is responsible for performing conflict-free mission planning according to a predefined operational scenario, and ensures the quality of data products and performance of the space-borne sensors by continuous monitoring, calibration and validation activities, guaranteeing the overall performance of the mission Within the Core Ground Segment, the FOS main responsibility encompasses the spacecraft monitoring and control, including execution of all platform activities and the commanding of the payload schedules. ESOC-Darmstadt was responsible for the design of the Sentinels FOS during the development phase, and will be in charge of operating the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P families during LEOP, Commissioning and Routine phase; of the Sentinel-3 LEOP and Commissioning, before handover to EUMETSAT; and of Sentinel-6 during LEOP before handover to EUMETSAT. This paper describes the assumptions and constraints that were taken when starting the definition of a “Common” Copernicus-Sentinels Flight Operations Segment. The paper will then present how the selected architecture has allowed for an incremental FOS design where new Sentinels missions can re-use the Common components and be “plugged” within ESOC FOS infrastructure, reducing testing, integration and validation time. The resulting Operational Concept applied across the Sentinels’ families operated by ESOC will be summarized, highlighting the innovative aspects and the lessons learnt. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Owing to a relatively large-swath with high-spatial resolution (10 m), ocean surface roughness mapping capabilities, changes in ocean wave energy, and propagation direction can be precisely quantified at very high resolution, across spatial distances of 10 km and more. This provides unique opportunities to study ocean wave refraction induced by spatial varying surface currents. As expected and demonstrated over the Grand Agulhas current area, the mesoscale variability of near-surface currents, documented and reconstructed from satellite altimetry, can significantly deflect in-coming south-western swell systems. Based on ray-tracing calculations, and unambiguously revealed from the analysis of Sentinel-2 MSI SSGI measurements, the variability of the near-surface current explains significant wave-current refraction, leading to wave-trapping phenomenon and strong local enhancement of the total wave energy. In addition to its importance for wave modeling and hazard prediction, these results open new possibilities to combine different satellite measurements and greatly improve the determination of the upper ocean mesoscale vorticity motions. © 2017.

Astrium Toulouse will supply the Multi-Spectral imaging Instrument (MSI), and Astrium Spain will be in charge of the satellite's structure and will produce its thermal equipment and cable harness. The industrial core team also comprises Jena Optronik (Germany), Boostec (France), Sener and GMV (Spain). Sentinel-2 is intended to image the Earth's landmasses from its orbit for at least 7.25 years. In addition, its onboardresources will be designed so that the mission can be prolonged by an extra five years. From 2012 onwards, the 1.1-metric-ton satellite will circle the Earth in a sun-synchronous, polar orbit at an altitude of 786kilometres, fully covering the planet's landmasses in just ten days. The multi-spectral instrument (MSI) will generate optical images in 13 spectral channels in the visible and shortwave infrared range down to a resolution of 10 metres with an image width of 290 kilometres. The instrument is composed of two main parts: • The telescope assembly, combining in one instrument both VNIR and SWIR channels, is mounted on the upper plate of the Bus • The Video and Compression Electronic Units mounted inside the Bus. This telescope is based on a Three Mirror Anastigmat optical concept. This three mirror optical combination is corrected from spherical aberration, coma and astigmatism. It provides a large field of view with very good optical quality. The telescope mirrors and structural baseplate are made of Silicon Carbide material in order to minimise thermo-elastic distortions. Isostatic mounts decouple the instrument from potential deformations of the platform upper plate. The optical beam is spectrally separated thanks to a dichroic filter towards two different focal planes with different detector technologies: Silicon is used for the VNIR domain whereas Mercury Cadmium Telluride is required for the SWIR spectral domain. The VNIR detector is a CMOS device. The SWIR detector is a hybridised component where the MCT photosensitive arrays are hybridised on top of a CMOS circuit. The separation of the individual spectral bands(10 spectral bands, for the VNIR detectors and 3 spectral bands for the SWIR detectors) is performed by specific strip filters mounted on top of the detectors. The telescope is thermally decoupled from the external environment and the platform thanks to a thermal enclosure. A calibration and shutter mechanism avoids direct sun incidence inside the telescope during launch, specific platform manoeuvres and safe mode. The video signals coming out of the VNIR and SWIR focal planes are digitised and compressed inside the Video and Electronic Units prior to be sent to the bus. © 2017 ESA and CNES.","Cadmium telluride; CMOS integrated circuits; Deforestation; Disasters; Earth (planet); Focusing; Forestry; Geometrical optics; Infrared radiation; Integration testing; Light polarization; Mercury compounds; Mirrors; Orbits; Plates (structural components); Population statistics; Satellites; Silicon carbide; Spectroscopy; Telescopes; Volcanoes; External environments; Mercury cadmium telluride; Multispectral imaging; Multispectral instruments; Satellite integration; Silicon carbide materials; Spherical aberrations; Three mirror anastigmats; Aberrations","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039057849"

Compatibility in multitemporal, multiple sensor image data would facilitate the monitoring. The decommissioning of SPOT 5 (Système Pour l’Observation de la Terre 5) left a void in multispectral imagery at the 10 m spatial resolution of its high-resolution geometric (HRG) sensor. The subsequent launch of Sentinel 2 presented an opportunity for data continuity to monitor the savannah woody cover, using equivalent 10 m resolution multispectral instrument (MSI) bands. This study examined the integration potential of Sentinel 2 MSI with the longer archive HRG and Landsat 8 (Land Satellite 8) Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery, in assessing savannah woody cover. Images of three semi-arid savannah sites acquired on same season dates that excluded herbaceous vegetation from the spectral signature were used: November 2014 (HRG) and December 2015 (MSI, OLI). Using equivalent green (G), red (R), and near infrared (NIR) bands at 10 m (MSI, HRG) and 30 m (OLI) resolution, the woody cover was mapped through subpixel classification. The mapped woody cover was compared for statistical differences using χ2 analysis at 10 m resolution (MSI, HRG) and at a degradation of the MSI and HRG images to the 30 m OLI pixel size. Conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance values facilitated inter-sensor correlation of G, R, and NIR reflectance for field sampling sites where woody cover was quantified. Inter-sensor regression functions in G, R, and NIR band MSI and HRG images were developed. The 10 m resolution classifications of woody cover were not statistically different. Due to spatial resolution similarity, SPOT 5 HRG multispectral imagery was established as suitable for integration with equivalent band MSI imagery in mapping the woody cover in a multitemporal analysis. For dense woody cover, Landsat 8 OLI imagery was more suitable for integration with MSI than HRG images due to higher radiometric sensitivity, which can permit monitoring physiology-related woody reflectance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image resolution; Infrared devices; Integration; Monitoring; Pixels; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Herbaceous vegetation; Multi-spectral imagery; Multi-temporal analysis; Multispectral instruments; Operational land imager; Radiometric sensitivity; Statistical differences; Sub-pixel classification; imagery; land cover; Landsat; monitoring; savanna; semiarid region; Sentinel; SPOT; Image analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046280200"

This paper presents a remote sensing based method to observe calcite precipitation over large areas, which are an important prerequisite for a systematic monitoring and evaluation of restoration measurements. We use globally archived satellite remote sensing data for a retrospective systematic assessment of past multi-temporal calcite precipitation events. The database of this study consists of 205 data sets that comprise freely available Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1998 and 2015 covering the Northeast German Plain. Calcite precipitation is automatically identified using the green spectra and the metric BGR area, the triangular area between the blue, green and red reflectance value. The validation is based on field measurements of CaCO3 concentrations at three selected lakes, Feldberger Haussee, Breiter Luzin and Schmaler Luzin. The classification accuracy (0.88) is highest for calcite concentrations ≥0.7 mg/L. False negative results are caused by the choice of a conservative classification threshold. False positive results can be explained by already increased calcite concentrations. We successfully transferred the developed method to 21 other hardwater lakes in Northeast Germany. The average duration of lakes with regular calcite precipitation is 37 days. The frequency of calcite precipitation reaches from single time detections up to detections nearly every year. False negative classification results and gaps in Landsat time series reduce the accuracy of frequency and duration monitoring, but in future the image density will increase by acquisitions of Sentinel-2a (and 2b). Our study tested successfully the transfer of the classification approach to Sentinel-2 images. Our study shows that 15 of the 24 lakes have at least one phase of calcite precipitation and all events occur between May and September. At the lakes Schmaler Luzin and Feldberger Haussee, we illustrated the influence of ecological restoration measures aiming at nutrient reduction in the lake water on calcite precipitation. Our study emphasizes the high variance of calcite precipitation in hardwater lakes: each lake has to be monitored individually, which is feasible using Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series. © 2017 by the authors.","Germany; Calcium; Calcium carbonate; Ecology; Lakes; Reflection; Remote sensing; Restoration; Time series analysis; Ecological restoration; Hardwater; Landsat time series; Northeast German Plain; Sentinel 2; accuracy assessment; calcite; concentration (composition); data set; database; environmental monitoring; image classification; lake water; Landsat; remote sensing; restoration ecology; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial distribution; time series analysis; Calcite","Calcium-rich hardwater lakes; Evaluation of ecological restoration measures; Landsat Time series analysis; Northeast German Plain; Sentinel 2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011309023"

An accurate atmospheric correction requires good knowledge of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and of the aerosol type. As a first step, this study compares the performances of two kinds of AOT estimation methods applied to FormoSat-2 and LandSat time series of images: a multi-spectral method that assumes a constant relationship between surface reflectance measurements and a multi-temporal method that assumes that the surface reflectances are stable with time. In a second step, these methods are combined to obtain more accurate and robust estimates. The estimated AOTs are compared to in situ measurements on several sites of the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network). The methods, based on either spectral or temporal criteria, provide accuracies better than 0.07 in most cases, but show degraded accuracies in some special cases, such as the absence of vegetation for the spectral method or a very quick variation of landscape for the temporal method. The combination of both methods in a new spectro-temporal method increases the robustness of the results in all cases. © 2015 by the authors.","Atmospheric aerosols; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Time series; Aerosol optical thickness; Aerosol robotic networks; Atmospheric corrections; Formosat-2; High resolution image; LANDSAT; Optical remote sensing; Surface reflectance; Aerosols","Aerosols; Atmospheric correction; FormoSat-2; LandSat; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2,VENμS; Surface reflectance; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926382691"

If the ship is moving, its velocity can also be determined from its Kelvin waves. The 13 spectrally different visual and infrared images taken using multispectral imagery (MSI) are ""fingerprints"" that allow for the recognition and identification of ships. Furthermore, the multispectral image profiles along the ship allow for discrimination between the ship, its turbulent wakes, and the Kelvin waves, such that the ship's length and breadth can be determined more accurately even when sailing.

All satellite images are affected at some level by lightwave scattering and absorption from aerosols, water vapor and particulates in the atmosphere. For generating high-quality scientific data, atmospheric correction is required to remove atmospheric effects and to convert digital number (DN) values to surface reflectance (SR). Every optical satellite in orbit observes the earth through the same atmosphere, but each satellite image is impacted differently because atmospheric conditions are constantly changing. A physics-based detailed radiative transfer model 6SV requires a lot of key ancillary information about the atmospheric conditions at the acquisition time. This paper investigates to achieve the simultaneous acquisition of atmospheric radiation parameters based on the multi-spectral information, in order to improve the estimates of surface reflectance through physics-based atmospheric correction. Ancillary information on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total water vapor (TWV) derived from the multi-spectral information based on specific spectral properties was used for the 6SV model. The experimentation was carried out on images of Sentinel-2, which carries a Multispectral Instrument (MSI), recording in 13 spectral bands, covering a wide range of wavelengths from 440 up to 2200 nm. The results suggest that per-pixel atmospheric correction through 6SV model, integrating AOD and TWV derived from multispectral information, is better suited for accurate analysis of satellite images and quantitative remote sensing application. © 2018 SPIE.","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Orbits; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellites; Space optics; Water absorption; Water vapor; Atmospheric corrections; Multi-spectral; Quantitative remote sensing; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing","Atmospheric correction; Multi-spectral information; Quantitative remote sensing; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045138461"

Although recent advances have been obtained with the use of empirical approaches for estimating chlorophyll-a in these environments, the understanding of the relationship between spectral reflectance and chlorophyll-a is based mainly on temperate and subtropical estuarine systems. The potential to apply standard NIR-Red models to productive tropical estuaries remains underexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of several approaches based on multispectral data to estimate chlorophyll-a in a productive tropical estuarine-lagoon system, using in situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance, Rrs. The possibility of applying algorithms using simulated satellite bands of modern and recent launched sensors was also evaluated. More accurate retrievals of chlorophyll-a (r2 > 0.80) based on field datasets were found using NIR-Red three-band models. In addition, enhanced chlorophyll-a retrievals were found using the two-band algorithm based on bands of recently launched satellites such as Sentinel-2/MSI and Sentinel-3/OLCI, indicating a promising application of these sensors to remotely estimate chlorophyll-a for coming decades in turbid inland waters.

Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 400–2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging is one of the most promising tools for topsoil property mapping. The aim of this study was to test the sensitivity of soil property prediction results to coarsening image spectral resolution. This may offer an analysis of the potential of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors, e.g., HYPerspectral X IMagery (HYPXIM) or Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), and existing multispectral sensors, e.g., SENTINEL-2 Multispectral Sensor Instrument (MSI) or LANDSAT-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), for soil properties mapping. This study used VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral airborne data acquired by the AISA-DUAL sensor (initial spectral and spatial resolutions of approximately 5 nm and 5 m, respectively) over a 300 km2 Mediterranean rural region. Ten spectral configurations were built and divided in the following two groups: i) six spectral configurations corresponding to simulated sensors with regular spectral resolution from 5 nm to 200 nm (i.e., the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) remains constant throughout the considered spectral domain; this includes the simulation of the forthcoming HYPXIM and EnMAP hyperspectral satellites) and ii) four spectral configurations corresponding to existing multispectral sensors with irregular spectral resolution (i.e., the FWHM differs from spectral sampling interval; Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), SENTINEL-2 MSI, LANDSAT-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and LANDSAT-8 OLI). The soil property studied in this paper is the clay content, defined as the percentage of granulometric fraction finer than 2 μm by weight of the soil, which will be estimated using the partial least squares regression method. Our results showed that i) spectral configurations with regular spectral resolutions from 5 to 100 nm provided similar and good clay content prediction performances (R2val > 0.7 and RPIQ > 3) and allowed clay mapping with correct short-scale variations, ii) the spectral configuration with a regular spectral resolution of 200 nm provided unsatisfactory clay content prediction performance (R2val ≃ 0.01 and RPIQ ≃ 1.65) and iii) the ASTER sensor was the only existing multispectral sensor that provided both correct performance of clay content estimation (R2val ≃ 0.8 and RPIQ ≃ 3.72) and correct clay mapping. Therefore, clay mapping by the ASTER multispectral data should be pursued while awaiting the launch of forthcoming hyperspectral satellite sensors (e.g., HYPXIM and EnMAP), which will be good candidates for future large clay mapping campaigns over bare soils. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Mediterranean Region; Clay; Forecasting; Full width at half maximum; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Least squares approximations; Mapping; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil surveys; Soil testing; Soils; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; Advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer; Digital soil mappings; Enhanced thematic mappers; Multi-spectral imagery; Operational land imager; Partial least squares regression; PLSR; Soil spectroscopies; ASTER; bare soil; clay soil; data acquisition; digital mapping; Landsat thematic mapper; mapping method; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; scenario analysis; Sentinel; shortwave radiation; spatial resolution; spectral reflectance; spectral resolution; spectroscopy; topsoil; Photomapping","Clay; Digital soil mapping; Hyperspectral and multispectral imagery; PLSR; Satellite; Soil spectroscopy; Spectral resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033602515"

However, the standard geolocated Landsat-8 OLI L1T and Sentinel-2A MSI L1C data products are currently found to be misaligned. An approach for automated registration of Landsat-8 OLI L1T and Sentinel-2A MSI L1C data is presented and demonstrated using contemporaneous sensor data. The approach is computationally efficient because it implements feature point detection across four image pyramid levels to identify a sparse set of tie-points. Area-based least squares matching around the feature points with mismatch detection across the image pyramid levels is undertaken to provide reliable tie-points. The approach was assessed by examination of extracted tie-point spatial distributions and tie-point mapping transformations (translation, affine and second order polynomial), dense-matching prediction-error assessment, and by visual registration assessment. Two test sites over Cape Town and Limpopo province in South Africa that contained cloud and shadows were selected. A Landsat-8 L1T image and two Sentinel-2A L1C images sensed 16 and 26 days later were registered (Cape Town) to examine the robustness of the algorithm to surface, atmosphere and cloud changes, in addition to the registration of a Landsat-8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C image pair sensed 4 days apart (Limpopo province). The automatically extracted tie-points revealed sensor misregistration greater than one 30 m Landsat-8 pixel dimension for the two Cape Town image pairs, and greater than one 10 m Sentinel-2A pixel dimension for the Limpopo image pair. Transformation fitting assessments showed that the misregistration can be effectively characterized by an affine transformation. Hundreds of automatically located tie-points were extracted and had affine-transformation root-mean-square error fits of approximately 0.3 pixels at 10 m resolution and dense-matching prediction errors of similar magnitude. These results and visual assessment of the affine transformed data indicate that the methodology provides sub-pixel registration performance required for meaningful Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A MSI data comparison and combined data applications. © 2016 by the authors.","Conformal mapping; Errors; Feature extraction; Image matching; Mapping; Mean square error; Photomapping; Pixels; Feature based matching; LANDSAT; Least-squares matching; Registration; Sentinel-2; Image processing","Area-based least squares matching; Feature based matching; Landsat-8; Registration; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982278329"

Yet, unlike in agriculture and inland land uses, the use of Sentinel imagery has not been evaluated for biomass retrieval in mangrove forest and the non-forest land uses that replaced mangroves. In this study, we evaluated the ability of Sentinel imagery for the retrieval and predictive mapping of above-ground biomass of mangroves and their replacement land uses. We used Sentinel SAR and multispectral imagery to develop biomass prediction models through the conventional linear regression and novel Machine Learning algorithms. We developed models each from SAR raw polarisation backscatter data, multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and canopy biophysical variables. The results show that the model based on biophysical variable Leaf Area Index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 was more accurate in predicting the overall above-ground biomass. In contrast, the model which utilised optical bands had the lowest accuracy. However, the SAR-based model was more accurate in predicting the biomass in the usually deficient to low vegetation cover non-forest replacement land uses such as abandoned aquaculture pond, cleared mangrove and abandoned salt pond. These models had 0.82–0.83 correlation/agreement of observed and predicted value, and root mean square error of 27.8–28.5 Mg ha−1. Among the Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, the red and red edge bands (bands 4, 5 and 7), combined with elevation data, were the best variable set combination for biomass prediction. The red edge-based Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index had the highest prediction accuracy among the vegetation indices. Overall, Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide satisfactory results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of the above-ground biomass of mangroves and the replacement non-forest land uses, especially with the inclusion of elevation data. The study demonstrates encouraging results in biomass mapping of mangroves and other coastal land uses in the tropics using the freely accessible and relatively high-resolution Sentinel imagery. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Sentinel-2 MSI provides spectral bands with different resolutions, including RGB and Near-Infra-Red (NIR) bands in 10 m and Short-Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) bands in 20 m, which are closely related to surface water information. It is necessary to define a pan-like band for the Sentinel-2 image sharpening process because of the replacement of the panchromatic band by four high-resolution multi-spectral bands (10 m). This study, which aimed at urban surface water extraction, utilised the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) at 10 m resolution as a high-resolution image to sharpen the 20 m SWIR bands. Then, object-level Modified NDWI (MNDWI) mapping and minimum valley bottom adjustment threshold were applied to extract water maps. The proposed method was compared with the conventional most related band- (between the visible spectrum/NIR and SWIR bands) based and principal component analysis first component-based sharpening.

Remote sensing technology provides a useful and effective means for detecting and mapping cotton root rot infestations in cotton fields. This research assessed the potential of 10-m Sentinel-2A satellite imagery for cotton root rot detection and compared it with airborne multispectral imagery using unsupervised classification at both field and regional levels. Accuracy assessment showed that the classification maps from the Sentinel-2A imagery had an overall accuracy of 94.1% for field subset images and 91.2% for the whole image, compared with the airborne image classification results. However, some small cotton root rot areas were undetectable and some non-infested areas within large root rot areas were incorrectly classified as infested due to the images' coarse spatial resolution. Classification maps based on field subset Sentinel-2A images missed 16.6% of the infested areas and the classification map based on the whole Sentinel-2A image for the study area omitted 19.7% of the infested areas.

This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains.

Directional effects were examined by considering two ten day periods of Sentinel-2A data acquired close to the solar principal and orthogonal planes over approximately 20° × 10° of southern Africa. More than 6.6 million (January 2016) and 10.6 million (April 2016) pairs of reflectance observations sensed 3 or 7 days apart in the forward and backscatter directions in overlapping Sentinel-2A orbit swaths were considered. The Sentinel-2A data were projected into the MODIS sinusoidal projection but first had to be registered due to a misregistration issue evident in the overlapping orbits. The top of atmosphere reflectance data were corrected to surface reflectance using the SEN2COR atmospheric correction software. Only pairs of forward and backward reflectance values that were cloud and snow-free, unsaturated, and had no significant change in their 3 or 7 day separation, were considered. The maximum observed Sentinel-2A view zenith angle was 11.93°. Greater BRDF effects were apparent in the January data (acquired close to the solar principal plane) than the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) and at higher view zenith angle. For the January data the average difference between the surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges increased with wavelength from 0.035 (blue), 0.047 (green), 0.057 (red), 0.078 (NIR), to about 0.1 (SWIR). These differences may constitute a significant source of noise for certain applications. The suitability of a recently published methodology developed to generate Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) was examined for Sentinel-2A application. The methodology uses fixed MODIS BRDF spectral parameters and is attractive because it has little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance and can be derived in a computationally efficient manner globally. It was applied to the southern Africa Sentinel-2A data and shown to reduce Sentinel-2A BRDF effects. The average difference between the reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the Sentinel-2A scan edges was smaller in the NBAR data than in the corresponding surface reflectance data. Residual BRDF effects in the Sentinel-2A NBAR data occurred likely because of atmospheric correction and sensor calibration errors and inadequacies in the NBAR derivation approach. These issues are discussed with recommendations for future research including global and red-edge Sentinel-2A NBAR derivation that were not considered in this study. © 2017 The Authors","Africa; Anisotropy; Distribution functions; Radiometers; Africa; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; LANDSAT; MODIS; NBAR; Sentinel-2; anisotropy; atmospheric correction; calibration; Landsat; methodology; MODIS; multispectral image; nadir; observational method; parameterization; scattering; Sentinel; surface reflectance; top of atmosphere; zenith angle; Reflection","Africa; Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); Landsat; MODIS; NBAR; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023617940"

The method builds on direct determination of the imaging transfer function from the large-scale smoothed shape of sun glitter. Observed brightness modulations are then converted into sea surface elevations to perform directional spectral analysis. The method is applied to the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) measurements. Owing to the specific instrumental configuration of MSI (which has a primary mission dedicated to mapping of land surfaces), a physical angular difference between channel detectors on the instrument focal plane array can be used to efficiently determine the surface brightness gradients in two directions, i.e., in sensor zenith and azimuthal directions. In addition, the detector configuration of MSI means that a small temporal lag between channel acquisitions exists. This feature can be exploited to detect surface waves and infer their space-time characteristics using cross-channel correlation. We demonstrate how this can be used to remove directional ambiguity in 2-D detected wave spectra and to obtain information describing local dispersion relation of surface waves. Directional spectra derived from Sentinel-2 MSI SSGI are compared with in situ buoy measurements.

Multispectral data, such as ASTER, Landsat, SPOT, Sentinel-2, typically allow to determine qualitative estimates of what minerals are in a pixel, while hyperspectral data allow to quantify this. As input to most image classification or spectral processing approach, endmembers are required. An alternative approach to classification is to derive absorption feature characteristics such as the wavelength position of the deepest absorption, depth of the absorption and symmetry of the absorption feature from hyperspectral data. Two approaches are presented, tested and compared in this paper: the ‘Wavelength Mapper’ and the ‘QuanTools’. Although these algorithms use a different mathematical solution to derive absorption feature wavelength and depth, and use different image post-processing, the results are consistent, comparable and reproducible. The wavelength images can be directly linked to mineral type and abundance, but more importantly also to mineral chemical composition and subtle changes thereof. This in turn allows to interpret hyperspectral data in terms of mineral chemistry changes which is a proxy to pressure-temperature of formation of minerals.

This spatial resolution should be at least decametric. Aquatic color data processing associated with these environments requires specific atmospheric corrections (AC) suitable for the spectral characteristics of high spatial resolution sensors (HRS) as well as the high range of atmospheric and marine optical properties. The objective of the present study is to develop and demonstrate the potential of a ground-based AC approach adaptable to any HRS for regional monitoring and security of littoral systems. The in Situ-based Atmospheric CORrection (SACOR) algorithm is based on simulations provided by a Successive Order of Scattering code (SOS), which is constrained by a simple regional aerosol particle model (RAM). This RAM is defined from the mixture of a standard tropospheric and maritime aerosol type. The RAM is derived from the following two processes. The first process involved the analysis of a 6-year data set composed of aerosol optical and microphysical properties acquired through the ground-based PHOTONS/AERONET network located at Arcachon (France). The second process was related to aerosol climatology using the NOAA hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Results show that aerosols have a bimodal particle size distribution regardless of the season and are mainly represented by a mixed coastal continental type. Furthermore, the results indicate that aerosols originate from both the Atlantic Ocean (53.6%) and Continental Europe (46.4%). Based on these results, absorbing biomass burning, urban-industrial and desert dust particles have not been considered although they represent on average 19% of the occurrences. This represents the main current limitation of the RAM. An assessment of the performances of SACOR is then performed by inter-comparing the water-leaving reflectance (ρw ) retrievals with three different AC methods (ACOLITE, MACCS and 6SV using three different standard aerosol types) using match-ups (N = 8) composed of Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes and field radiometric measurements. Results indicate consistency with the SWIR-based ACOLITE method, which shows the best performance, except in the green channel where SACOR matches well with the in-situ data (relative error of 7%). In conclusion, the study demonstrates the high potential of the SACOR approach for the retrieval of ρw . In the future, the method could be improved by using an adaptive aerosol model, which may select the most relevant local aerosol model following the origin of the atmospheric air mass, and could be applied to the latest HRS (Sentinel-2/MSI, SPOT6-7, Pleiades 1A-1B). © 2017 by the authors.","Adaptive optics; Data handling; Image resolution; Optical properties; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Photons; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Aerosol modeling; Atmospheric corrections; Bimodal particle size distribution; Coastal waters; High spatial resolution sensors; Radiometric measurements; Spatial resolution; Water-leaving reflectance; Aerosols","Aerosol model; Aquatic color radiometry; Atmospheric corrections; Coastal waters; hHigh spatial resolution; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028323581"

MSI red-edge BRDF effects have not been investigated.

Non-negligible MSI red-edge BRDF effects up to 0.08 (reflectance units) across the 290 km wide MSI swath are documented. A recently published MODIS BRDF parameter c-factor approach to adjust MSI visible, near-infrared, and short wave infrared reflectance to nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) is adapted for application to the MSI red-edge bands. The red-edge band BRDF parameters needed to implement the algorithm are provided. The parameters are derived by a linear wavelength interpolation of fixed global MODIS red and NIR BRDF model parameters. The efficacy of the interpolation is investigated using POLDER red, red-edge, and NIR BRDF model parameters, and is shown to be appropriate for the c-factor NBAR generation approach. After adjustment to NBAR, red-edge MSI BRDF effects were reduced for the January data (acquired close to the solar principal where BRDF effects are maximal) and the April data (acquired close to the orthogonal plane) for all the MSI red-edge bands. © 2017 by the author.","Distribution functions; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Interpolation; Radiometers; Superconducting materials; Africa; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; LANDSAT; MODIS; NBAR; POLDER; Red edge; Sentinel-2; Reflection","Africa; Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); Landsat; MODIS; NBAR; POLDER; Red-edge; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038209270"

As a result, noise in Sentinel-2 Level-1C data distributed to users becomes processed. We demonstrate that processed noise variance model is bivariate: noise variance depends on image intensity (caused by signal-dependency of photon counting detectors) and signal-To-noise ratio (SNR; caused by filtering/compression). To provide information on processed noise parameters, which is missing in Sentinel-2 metadata, we propose to use blind noise parameter estimation approach. Existing methods are restricted to univariate noise model. Therefore, we propose extension of existing vcNI+fBm blind noise parameter estimation method to multivariate noise model, mvcNI+fBm, and apply it to each band of Sentinel-2A data. Obtained results clearly demonstrate that noise variance is affected by filtering/compression for SNR less than about 15. Processed noise variance is reduced by a factor of 2 - 5 in homogeneous areas as compared to noise variance for high SNR values. Estimate of noise variance model parameters are provided for each Sentinel-2A band. Sentinel-2A MSI Level-1C noise models obtained in this paper could be useful for end users and researchers working in a variety of remote sensing applications. © 2017 SPIE.","Image compression; Image denoising; Image processing; Parameter estimation; Remote sensing; Signal analysis; Signal detection; Signal processing; Spectroscopy; Spurious signal noise; Analysis of signal; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Noise variance; Photon counting detectors; Processed noise; Remote sensing applications; Sentinel-2; Signal to noise ratio","Blind noise parameter estimation; Image compression; Image denoising; Multi spectral instrument; Multivariate noise variance model; Processed noise; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Signal-dependency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041079527"

Possible filter coating techniques and masking concepts were considered in the frame of trade-off studies. The selected deposition concept is based on self-blocked all-dielectric multilayer band pass filter. Band pass and blocking characteristic is deposited on the space side of a single filter substrate whereas the detector side of the substrate has an antireflective coating. The space- and detector side masking design is realized by blades integrated in the mechanical parts including the mechanical interface to the filter assembly support on the MSI focal plane. The feasibility and required performance of the VNIR Filter Assembly and SWIR Filter Assembly were successfully demonstrated by breadboarding. Extensive performance tests of spectral and optical parameters and environmental tests (radiation, vibration, shock, thermal vacuum cycling, humidity) were performed on filter stripe- and filter assembly level.

Scope of this paper is to present the Ground Prototype Processor (GPP) that will be in charge of Level-1 production during Sentinel-2 In Orbit Acceptance phase. GPP has been developed by a European industrial consortium composed of Advanced Computer Systems (ACS), Magellium and DLR on the basis of CNES technical specification of Sentinel-2 data processing and under the joint management of ESA-ESTEC and CNES.

With high spatial resolution and novelty in band design, the recently launched Sentinel-2A satellite provides a new opportunity for moderate spatial resolution burned area mapping. This study examines the performance of the Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) bands and derived spectral indices to differentiate between unburned and burned areas. For this purpose, five pairs of pre-fire and post-fire top of atmosphere (TOA reflectance) and atmospherically corrected (surface reflectance) images were studied. The pixel values of locations that were unburned in the first image and burned in the second image, as well as the values of locations that were unburned in both images which served as a control, were compared and the discrimination of individual bands and spectral indices were evaluated using parametric (transformed divergence) and non-parametric (decision tree) approaches. Based on the results, the most suitable MSI bands to detect burned areas are the 20 m near-infrared, short wave infrared and red-edge bands, while the performance of the spectral indices varied with location. The atmospheric correction only significantly influenced the separability of the visible wavelength bands. The results provide insights that are useful for developing Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithms. © 2016 by the authors.","Conformal mapping; Decision trees; Fires; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Location; Reflection; Atmospheric corrections; Burned areas; Burned-area mapping; High spatial resolution; Sentinel-2; Separability analysis; Short wave infrared; Surface reflectance; Mapping","Burned area; Fire; Sentinel-2; Separability analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019674484"

The MACCS (Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening)-ATCOR (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction) Joint Algorithm, called MAJA, is a numerical tool designed to perform cloud detection and atmospheric correction. For the correction of aerosols effects, MAJA makes an estimate of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) based on multi-temporal and multi-spectral criteria, but there is insufficient information to infer the aerosol type. The current operational version of MAJA uses an aerosol type which is constant with time, and this assumption impacts the quality of the atmospheric correction. In this study, we assess the potential of using an aerosol type derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational analysis. The performances, with and without the CAMS information, are evaluated. Firstly, in terms of the aerosol optical thickness retrievals, a comparison against sunphotometer measurements over several sites indicates an improvement over arid sites, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) reduced by 28% (from 0.095 to 0.068), although there is a slight degradation over vegetated sites (RMSE increased by 13%, from 0.054 to 0.061). Secondly, a direct validation of the retrieved surface reflectances at the La Crau station (France) indicates a reduction of the relative bias by 2.5% on average over the spectral bands. Thirdly, based on the assumption that surface reflectances vary slowly with time, a noise criterion was set up, exhibiting no improvement over the spectral bands and the validation sites when using CAMS data, partly explained by a slight increase in the surface reflectances themselves. Finally, the new method presented in this study provides a better way of using the MAJA processor in an operational environment because the aerosol type used for the correction is automatically inferred from CAMS data, and is no longer a parameter to be defined in advance. © 2017 by the author.","Atmospheric aerosols; Cams; Mean square error; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Time series; Atmospheric corrections; MACCS; MAJA; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Aerosols","Aerosols; Atmospheric correction; CAMS; MACCS; MAJA; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Surface reflectance; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038210948"

In recent years, many experiments aiming to estimate bathymetry in optically shallow water with the use of remote optical observations have been presented. In this paper, optimal models of satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) for relatively turbid waters of the South Baltic Sea were presented. The obtained results were analysed in terms of depth error estimation, spatial distribution, and overall quality. The models were calibrated based on sounding (in-situ) data obtained by a single-beam echo sounder, which was retrieved from the Maritime Office in Gdynia, Poland. The remote observations for this study were delivered by the recently deployed European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite observation system. A detailed analysis of the obtained results has shown that the tested methods can be successfully applied for the South Baltic region at depths of 12-18 meters. However, significant limitations were observed. The performed experiments have revealed that the error of model calibration, expressed in meters (RMSE), equals up to 10-20% of the real depth and is, generally, case dependent. To overcome this drawback, a novel indicator of determining the maximal SDB depth was proposed. What is important, the proposed SDB quality indicator is derived only on the basis of remotely registered data and therefore can be applied operationally. © 2017 Andrzej Chybicki, published by De Gruyter Open.","Acoustic devices; Satellites; Space flight; Bathymetry estimations; derived; Multi-spectral imagery; multispectra; observation; Satellite observation systems; Sentinel; Single beam echo sounders; Bathymetry","bathymetry; derived; multispectra; near-shorel satellite; observation; Sentinel","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031821969"

Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced the LiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45 m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65 m for > 20 m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for < 5 m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 5–10 m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11–17 m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover ≥ 18 m.

The HTM method is substantially improved by employing the 1.38-μ m cirrus band. The top-of-atmosphere reflectance cirrus band is used as an additional source of information. The method restores the information in highly inhomogeneous surfaces attenuated by a low-altitude haze and high-altitude cirrus, improving the interpretation of the scene content while preserving the shape of the spectral signatures.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from ground-based hyperspectral and multispectral sensors were compared with NDVI products derived from Sentinel-2A and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The influence of different spatial and temporal resolutions was assessed. High correlations and similar phenological patterns between in situ and satellite-based NDVI time series demonstrated the reliability of satellite-based phenological metrics.

The Multi-Spectral Imager on board the Sentinel-2's of the Copernicus program offers optimized bands for this task and delivers unprecedented amounts of data regarding spatial sampling, global coverage, spectral coverage, and repetition rate. Efficient algorithms are needed to process, or possibly reprocess, those big amounts of data. Techniques based on top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectra for single-pixels without exploitation of external data or spatial context offer the largest potential for parallel data processing and highly optimized processing throughput. Such algorithms can be seen as a baseline for possible trade-offs in processing performance when the application of more sophisticated methods is discussed. We present several ready-to-use classification algorithms which are all based on a publicly available database of manually classified Sentinel-2A images. These algorithms are based on commonly used and newly developed machine learning techniques which drastically reduce the amount of time needed to update the algorithms when new images are added to the database. Several ready-to-use decision trees are presented which allow to correctly label about 91% of the spectra within a validation dataset. While decision trees are simple to implement and easy to understand, they offer only limited classification skill. It improves to 98% when the presented algorithm based on the classical Bayesian method is applied. This method has only recently been used for this task and shows excellent performance concerning classification skill and processing performance. A comparison of the presented algorithms with other commonly used techniques such as random forests, stochastic gradient descent, or support vector machines is also given. Especially random forests and support vector machines show similar classification skill as the classical Bayesian method. © 2016 by the authors.","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Clouds; Data handling; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Learning systems; Optimization; Pixels; Remote sensing; Snow; Spectroscopy; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Bayesian classification; Classification algorithm; Cloud detection; Machine learning techniques; Parallel data processing; Sentinel-2 MSI; Shadow detections; Stochastic gradient descent; Image processing","Bayesian classification; Cirrus detection; Cloud detection; Decision trees; Machine learning; Sentinel-2 MSI; Shadow detection; Snow detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983755378"

The Sentinel-2 mission comprises a constellation of two twin polar-orbiting satellites following the same ground-track, and separated by an argument of latitude difference of 180°. The mission carries on board of each satellite a Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), intended to monitor variability in land surface conditions. Its wide swath width and high revisit time (10 days at the equator with one satellite, and 5 days with 2 satellites under cloud-free conditions which results in 2-3 days at mid-latitudes) will support the monitoring of changes to vegetation within the growing season. The geographical coverage in latitude ranges from 56° south to 84°. Sentinel-2B was launched by a Vega rocket from Europe’s Spaceport near Kourou in French Guiana. Sentinel 2 Launch and Early Orbit Operations (LEOP) activities are conducted at the European Space Control Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, on behalf of the European Space Agency and European Commission. This paper gives an update of the status of the Sentinel 2 Project with focus on the operational aspects of the LEOP activities, where the orbit insertion into a constellation imposes additional constraints for the reference orbit acquisition strategy. The selection of the injection orbit is driven by the VEGA Launcher dispersion specifications, in order to mitigate the risk of collision with the satellite already in orbit and to ease the acquisition of its final position within the constellation. The reference orbit acquisition manoeuvre plan is designed to guarantee on one side fast acquisition of the target orbit position, but also a robust operational strategy which account for all uncertainties linked to a satellite platform not yet commissioned. The size of the manoeuvres are also limited to ensure the ground station acquisitions under all conditions, like contingencies during manoeuvre execution, which may preclude a nominal acquisition of the signal (AOS) form the satellite. All these trade-off are analysed in order to ensure a robust reliable acquisition. The paper will also present the real scenario in which the spacecraft was injected and the final risk assessment and decision-making process. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The goal of this study is to develop remote sensing techniques for accurate estimation of canopy Chl during the entire growing season without re-parameterization of algorithms for two contrasting crop species, maize and soybean. These two crops represent different biochemical mechanisms of photosynthesis, leaf structure and canopy architecture. The relationships between canopy Chl and reflectance, collected at close range and resampled to bands of the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2, were analyzed in samples taken across the entirety of the growing seasons in three irrigated and rainfed sites located in eastern Nebraska between 2001 and 2005. Crop phenology was a factor strongly influencing the reflectance of both maize and soybean. Substantial hysteresis of the reflectance vs. canopy Chl relationship existed between the vegetative and reproductive stages. The effect of the hysteresis on vegetation indices (VI), applied for canopy Chl estimation, depended on the bands used and their formulation. The hysteresis greatly affected the accuracy of canopy Chl estimation by widely-used VIs with near infrared (NIR) and red reflectance (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and simple ratio (SR)). VIs that use red edge and NIR bands (e.g., red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), red edge NDVI and the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI)) were minimally affected by crop phenology (i.e., they exhibited little hysteresis) and were able to accurately estimate canopy Chl in two crops without algorithm re-parameterization and, thus, were found to be the best candidates for generic algorithms to estimate crop Chl using the surface reflectance products of MSI Sentinel-2. © 2017 by the authors.","Biology; Chlorophyll; Computer programming; Crops; Forestry; Hysteresis; Infrared devices; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Canopy chlorophyll; Crop phenology; Enhanced vegetation index; Meris terrestrial chlorophyll indices (MTCI); Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing techniques; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; Parameter estimation","Canopy chlorophyll content; Crop phenology; Reflectance; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017661010"

The proposed VISible-to-thermal IR micro-SATellite (VISIR-SAT) mission addresses many of these limitations, providing multi-spectral imaging data with medium-to-high spatial resolution (80m GSD from 800 km altitude) in the thermal infrared (up to 6 TIR bands, between 8 and 11μm) and in the mid infrared (1 or 2 MIR bands, at 4μm). These MIR/TIR bands will be co-registered with simultaneously acquired high spatial resolution (less than 30 m GSP) visible and near infrared multi-spectral imaging data. To enhance the spatial resolution of the MIR/TIR multi-spectral imagery during daytime, data fusion methods will be applied, such as the Multi-sensor Multi-resolution Technique (MMT), already successfully tested over agricultural terrain. This image processing technique will make generation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) EO products with a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m2 possible. For high temperature phenomena such as vegetation-and peat-fires, the Fire Disturbance Essential Climate Variables (ECV) ""Active fire location"" and ""Fire Radiative Power"" will be retrieved with less than 100 m spatial resolution. Together with the effective fire temperature and the spatial extent even for small fire events the innovative system characteristics of VISIR-SAT go beyond existingand planned IR missions. The comprehensive and physically high-accuracy products from VISIR-SAT (e.g. for fire monitoring) may synergistically complement the high temperature observations of Sentinel-3 SLSTR in a unique way. Additionally, VISIR-SAT offers a very agile sensor system, which will be able to conduct intelligent and flexible pointing of the sensor's line-of-sight with the aim to provide global coverage of cloud free imagery every 5-10 days with only one satellite (using near real time cloud cover information). VISIRSAT may be flown in convoy with Sentinel-3 and/or Sentinel-2.","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric temperature; DNA sequences; Fires; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Micro satellites; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sensor data fusion; Small satellites; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Convoy missions; Fire detection; High spatial resolution; Image processing technique; Multi-resolution techniques; Multi-spectral imagery; Thermal infrared remote sensing; Visible and near infrared; Land surface temperature","Convoy missions; Fire detection and characterization; Land surface temperature; Small satellites; Thermal infrared remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930404292"

The water-leaving radiance can be difficult to observe due to the reflection of direct sunlight on the air-water interface (sunglint) in the direction of the satellite field of view. The viewing geometry of Sentinel-2 satellite (European Space Agency) makes it vulnerable to sunglint contamination. In this paper, an original method is proposed to correct Sentinel-2-like imagery for sunglint contamination. The sunglint contribution is first estimated from the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) part of the spectrum and then extrapolated toward the near-infrared and visible bands. The spectral variation of the sunglint signal is thus revisited for a wide spectral range (from 350 to 2500 nm). The bidirectional reflectance distribution function related to the sunglint is shown to vary by > 28% from the SWIR to the blue bands of Sentinel-2. The application of the proposed algorithm on actual Sentinel-2 data demonstrates that sunglint patterns are satisfactorily removed over the entire images whatever the altitude of the observed target. Comparison with in situ data of water-leaving radiances (AERONET-OC) showed that our proposed algorithm significantly improves the correlation between satellite and in situ data by 55% (i.e., from R2 = 0.56 to R2 = 0.87). In addition, the discrepancies between satellite and in situ measurements are reduced by 60%. It is also shown that the aerosol data provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) can be safely used within the proposed algorithm to correct the Sentinel-2-like satellite data for both sunglint and atmospheric radiances. Improvements of the proposed method potentially rely on simultaneous retrievals of the aerosol optical properties. The proposed method is applicable to any satellite sensor which is able to measure in SWIR spectral bands over aquatic environments. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Aerosols; Air; Cams; Distribution functions; Infrared devices; Optical properties; Phase interfaces; Remote sensing; Satellites; Seawater; AERONET; Atmospheric corrections; Ocean color; Sentinel-2; Sunglint; Water color; AERONET; bidirectional reflectance; color; error correction; inland sea; instrumentation; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; seawater; Sentinel; shortwave radiation; solar radiation; spectral analysis; top of atmosphere; Infrared radiation","AERONET; AERONET-OC; Atmospheric correction; CAMS data; Ocean color; Sentinel-2; Sunglint; Water color","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032927034"

In fact, South Africa is the only country in Africa that managed to completely build satellites within its own country borders. This resulted in three successful operational earth observation systems (SunSat, O1 and Sumbandila). They are the forerunners of the present 450Kg EO-Sat1 satellite being developed at present, as part of the ARMC (African Resources Management Constellation). The present EO-Sat1 satellite is designed to provide a sub set of the Sentinel-2 bands, excluding the water vapor and SWIR bands of Sentinel-2, but including the yellow band of World View 3. The purpose is vegetation health state observation on a routinely two weekly basis for any specific tasked area. The EO-Sat1 satellite narrow swath imager has 2 correlated bands (red and yellow) at 2.5m-GSD as well as an 8 subset of the Sentinel bands at 10m-GSD, all implemented by means of TDI sensors. The wide swath imager has the same 10 bands, but with two bands at 15m-GSD and the other 8 bands at 60m-GSD. The satellite has high enough slew rate to do a 60 degree forward looking observation of the target area, followed by nadir imaging and followed by a 60 degree backward observation of the same area, to characterize aerosols above and the anisotropy of the vegetation surface being observed. A possible follow up enhanced satellite's conceptual design is presented in this paper, which use the present EO-Sat1 satellite buss with a drastically enhanced earth observation payload, increasing the total satellite mass to approximately 600Kg. It will have double the swath width to decrease latency time of critical observation areas. The design change the operational orbit away from the present high debris density, high collision risk orbit height of 700Km to a lower orbit where end of life will be shorter than 25 years natural orbit decay, allowing the satellite to be designed without an active failure prone de-orbiting mechanism. A number of additional spectral bands are also added namely the XAN band between blue and green to increase the bathymetry capabilities of the satellite, as well as adding a 900nm vapor band, and the SWIR bands that are needed for cloudy imagery improvements.
