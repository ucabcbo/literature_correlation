Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice-water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence. The sea ice-related loss function is designed to provide more detailed sea ice information of the network to improve super-resolution performance and further benefit finer Arctic SIC results. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDRnet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art MISR methods and can generate super-resolved SIC products with finer texture features and much sharper sea ice edges.

Due to the longer revisit time of homologous spaceborne satellites, only an average velocity can be determined. For longer time intervals, velocities due to short-duration events such as storms are lost. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different sources make it easy to construct image sequences with short time intervals. However, the resolution and noise level between non-homologous SAR image pairs often differ greatly. When there is a relatively large resolution difference between image pairs, the areal features between image pairs are very different, which increases the difficulty of feature registration. In this paper, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to solve the problem of resolution difference between image pairs for sea ice drift. This method can significantly improve the quality of feature registration of image pairs from different SAR sensors. We demonstrate through several examples the effectiveness of the method in feature matching of large resolution difference images from different SAR sensors. © 2021 IEEE.","Image enhancement; Intelligent computing; Ocean currents; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Average velocity; Difference images; Feature matching; Image sequence; Short duration events; Short time intervals; Super resolution reconstruction; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","Feature matching; Image registration; Sea ice drift tracking; Super-resolution reconstruction; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105539755"

Accurately tracking sea ice motions is essential to validate or even improve sea ice models for ice hazard forecasts at a fine scale. Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a significant benefit. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved fine-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image super-resolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure.

Unexpected melting of sea ice, which is considered as one of the climate change effects, has become a potential threat to the Earth’s climate. The regular monitoring of sea ice and its extent has become very important towards understanding of sea ice temporal dynamics. In this study, we present an operational technique of generation of sea ice images and sea ice area (derived from the images) using level-4 data from Indian Scatterometer SCATSAT-1. Using hierarchical classification rules, the threshold-based technique has been developed and applied to generate super-resolution (2.25 km) daily sea ice images over the Antarctic for the years 2017 and 2018. The technique uses four SCATSAT-1 data products, i.e. Gamma0 [Horizontal (H) and Vertical (V)] and Brightness Temperature (H and V) to classify sea ice, open water and other classes. Classification accuracy has been assessed by comparing SCATSAT-1 sea ice images with those obtained from AMSR2 sea ice concentration data. The comparison shows that there is around 96.1% matching of sea ice classification between SCATSAT-1 and AMSR-2 SIC derived sea ice images. Hence, it indicates that the super-resolution data of SCATSAT-1 is well capable of distinguishing sea ice from water. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Antarctica; accuracy assessment; climate change; image resolution; methodology; open water; satellite data; scatterometer; sea ice; seawater","AMSR-2; SCATSAT-1; Scatterometer; Sea ice; Sea ice concentration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110721735"

In this study, we propose an optical flow and super-resolution approach to accurately estimate motion from remote sensing images at a higher spatial resolution than the original data. First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical flow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector field with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical flow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientific and operational applications. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation. The SIC network with an encoder-decoder structure and atrous convolution, is employed to accurately perform the SIC retrieval by considering the characteristics of passive microwave images in the Arctic sea ice region. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Aided SIC estimation approach can generate accurate SIC with more detailed sea ice textures and much sharper sea ice edges. With respect to MODIS SIC products distributed in Arctic scale, the proposed model achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.94% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.04%, whereas the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) SIC results have three and two times greater values of RMSE and MAE.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Decoding; Frequency estimation; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Integrated circuits; Mean square error; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Timing circuits; Arctic sea ice; Arctic sea ice concentration; Convolutional neural network; Microwave FET; Microwave FET integrated circuit; Microwave images; Microwave imaging; Microwave theory and techniques; Passive microwave image; Passive microwaves; Sea ice concentration; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; Sea ice","Arctic sea ice concentration; convolutional neural networks; passive microwave image; super resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146252936"
