To achieve this goal, we combined both passive and active remote-sensing techniques to provide a 3D view of local aerosol levels and regional to long-range pollution transport. We studied aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm at 1-km spatial resolution along with active multiwavelength polarization lidar observations of vertical aerosol profiles in Haifa, Israel, Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun photometer observations at the lidar site, and local-network observations of aerosol concentrations (PM2.5). This comprehensive dataset enabled analyzing the performance of the MAIAC AOD retrieval in cases of complex aerosol layering and mixing states which are typical of the Eastern Mediterranean. While satellite-derived and ground-based AOD measurements generally showed good agreement, 35 out of 100 measurements showed low correspondence. Analysis of those cases revealed that overestimation of AOD was mostly related to cloud-contaminated pixels and aerosol water-uptake effects in moist, cloud-free air at cloud level. Furthermore, AOD over- and underestimations were related to the presence of complex aerosol mixture and layering conditions, especially when dust was mixed with aged anthropogenic aerosol pollution and marine aerosols with lofted anthropogenic pollution. In these cases 50–70% of measurements were outside of the expected error limit. Perhaps these conditions are not considered in the MAIAC retrieval. Finally, we investigated the link between AOD spatial variability and the MAIAC AOD bias, and performed a cluster analysis corroborating the strong impact of cloud contamination on MAIAC AOD quality. Our observation-based results raise the importance of carefully analyzing the uncertainties in satellite AOD measurements that are used as an important input variable in numerous health-related exposure studies and climate models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Haifa [Israel]; Israel; Aerosols; Climate models; Cluster analysis; Complex networks; Marine pollution; Mixing; Optical properties; Optical radar; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellites; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Anthropogenic pollution; Ground based measurement; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Remote sensing techniques; Spatial and temporal variability; Vertical distributions; aerosol composition; algorithm; anthropogenic source; cluster analysis; lidar; optical depth; photometer; polarization; spatial resolution; three-dimensional modeling; aerosol; air pollution; Article; climate; cluster analysis; controlled study; environmental monitoring; Israel; optical depth; particulate matter 2.5; polarization; pollution transport; priority journal; Air pollution","Aerosol optical depth (AOD); AOD spatial Variance; Cluster analyses; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC); Polly-lidar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099848230"

However, most of these existing studies conclude assessments based only on a few/single stereo-images lacking a systematic evaluation on how robust DL methods are on satellite stereo-images with varying radiometric and geometric configurations. This paper provides an evaluation of four DL stereomatching methods through hundreds of multi-date multi-site satellite stereopairs with varying geometric configurations, against the traditional well-practiced Census-semi-global matching (SGM), to comprehensively understand their accuracy, robustness, generalisation capabilities, and their practical potential. The DL methods include a learning-based cost metric through convolutional neural networks (MC-CNN) followed by SGM, and three end-to-end (E2E) learning models using Geometry and Context Network (GCNet), Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet), and LEAStereo. Our experiments show that E2E algorithms can achieve upper limits of geometric accuracies, while may not generalise well for unseen data. The learning-based cost metric and Census-SGM are rather robust and can consistently achieve acceptable results. All DL algorithms are robust to geometric configurations of stereopairs and are less sensitive in comparison to the Census-SGM, while learning-based cost metrics can generalise on satellite images when trained on different datasets (airborne or ground-view). © 2022 The Authors.

However, conditions that mediate the partitioning of black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) formation, as well as the spatial and temporal factors that drive particle evolution, are not understood adequately for many climate and air-quality related modeling applications. In situ observations provide considerable detail about aerosol microphysical and chemical properties, although sampling is extremely limited. Satellites offer the frequent global coverage that would allow for statistical characterization of emitted and evolved smoke, but generally lack microphysical detail. However, once properly validated, data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Observing System's Multi-Angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument can create at least a partial picture of smoke particle properties and plume evolution. We use in situ data from the Department of Energy's Biomass Burning Observation Project (BBOP) field campaign to assess the strengths and limitations of smoke particle retrieval results from the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) retrieval algorithm. We then use MISR to characterize wildfire smoke particle properties and to identify the relevant aging factors in several cases, to the extent possible. The RA successfully maps qualitative changes in effective particle size, light absorption, and its spectral dependence, when compared to in situ observations. By observing the entire plume uniformly, the satellite data can be interpreted in terms of smoke plume evolution, including size-selective deposition, new-particle formation, and locations within the plume where BC or BrC dominates. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerosols; Air quality; Biomass; Bromine compounds; Carbon; Digital storage; Earth (planet); Fires; Fluid dynamics; Light absorption; NASA; Particle size; Remote sensing; Aerosol particles; BBOP; Biomass-burning; MISR; Multi angle; Multi-spectral; Smoke plume; Wildfire; Smoke","Aerosol particle properties; Aerosols; BBOP; Biomass burning; MISR; Multi-angle; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing; Smoke plumes; Wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081917320"

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosol are the main factors contributing to global warming and atmospheric environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic emissions; thus, they are the core detection targets of satellite remote sensing platforms. Compared with traditional single-target satellites, the collaborative monitoring of GHGs and aerosol on the same airborne platform, ""Greenhouse gases and Aerosol Collaborative Observation Constellation"" (GACOC), could significantly improve the accuracy of CO2 and CH4 retrieval. This way could improve the ability to estimate the carbon source and sink via the ""top-down"" method, as well as the ability to distinguish anthropogenic/natural sources of CO2, CH4, and atmospheric particulate matters. The GACOC has become an important spatial detection approach actively developed by aerospace agencies of various countries.This study introduces the satellites launched by the European Union, Japan, China, and the United States that can monitor GHGs and aerosol in one space-borne platform. These satellites are further divided into two categories according to their missions. The first one is the comprehensive atmospheric sounding satellites that independently detect GHGs and aerosol. These satellites can provide the temporal and spatial distribution of columnar CO2 or CH4 concentration and aerosol properties in the global context. The representative satellites of this category include ENVISAT, Sentinel-5P, FY-3D, and GF-5, as well as GF-5(02), DQ-1, DQ-2, and MetOp-SG-A that are about to launch in 1-3 years. The second category is the GHG monitoring satellites. Synchronous aerosol and cloud observations on the same platform provide necessary information for high-precision inversion of GHGs. The typical GHG satellites include GOSAT, GOSAT-2, OCO-2, OCO-3, TanSat, and the ESA-planned CO2M series.Focusing on the significant national demands such as assessment of carbon neutrality pathways and atmospheric environmental governance, this study also discusses the development tendencies of monitoring GHGs and aerosol within the framework of a collaborative observation constellation.(1) Identification and quantitative monitoring of large anthropogenic emission sources. The anthropogenic CO2/CH4 and aerosol particles (and other tracers such as NO2) emitted from large-scale industrial areas or cities have some similarities in source, environment, and meteorological condition. Therefore, the high-resolution GHGs and aerosol observation by collaborative satellites can be employed to improve the ability to identify, track, and monitor large-scale, fixed, anthropogenic sources more efficiently.(2) High-precision joint inversion of atmospheric GHGs and aerosol. The scattering of aerosol and cloud greatly impact the inversion accuracy of CO2/CH4 satellite products. The advanced spaceborne technology that combines multi-angle, multi-band, and polarimetric measurements obtain high-precision aerosol optical and microphysical parameters. These parameters can be used to generate observation-based aerosol models when dealing with aerosol scattering during GHG's inversion, and these models are more appropriate than the traditional models from modeling data.(3) Active-passive satellite networking. No single satellite can acquire a daily, global-coverage GHG or aerosol product due to the issues such as limited swath width, large number of cloudy pixels, and strict data quality criteria. Therefore, active-passive satellite networking is an essential approach to satisfy the demands of operationally observing the earth. The GACOC could fill in the data gap effectively and generate a spatially-temporally continuous global dataset of GHGs and aerosol. These data can provide a solid foundation for scientific research such as accurate assessments of climate change and dynamic monitoring of the atmospheric environment. © 2022, Science Press.

However, detecting aircraft effectively is still a problem due to the diversity of the pose, size, and position of the aircraft and the variety of objects in the image. At present, the target detection methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) lack the sufficient extraction of remote sensing image information and the post‐processing of detection results, which results in a high missed detection rate and false alarm rate when facing complex and dense targets. Aiming at the above questions, we proposed a target detection model based on Faster R‐CNN, which combines multi‐angle features driven and majority voting strategy. Specifi-cally, we designed a multi‐angle transformation module to transform the input image to realize the multi‐angle feature extraction of the targets in the image. In addition, we added a majority voting mechanism at the end of the model to deal with the results of the multi‐angle feature extraction. The average precision (AP) of this method reaches 94.82% and 95.25% on the public and private datasets, respectively, which are 6.81% and 8.98% higher than that of the Faster R‐CNN.

The SRON Remote Sensing of Trace gas and Aerosol Products (RemoTAP) full retrieval algorithm is applied to DPC measurements to retrieve aerosol properties including the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), the fine/coarse mode AOD and the SSA (Single Scattering Albedo). Measurements of the global ground-based AERONET network between December 2019 and April 2020 have been used for the validation of the DPC retrievals. According to the average Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) of the selected AERONET stations, the stations are divided into urban stations (FMF ≥ 0.5) and dust stations (FMF < 0.5). For the total AOD validation, DPC retrievals show better performance over urban stations than over dust stations, with average biases of 0.055 and 0.106, and RMSEs of 0.151 and 0.228, respectively. Regarding the fine mode AOD, the retrieval also performs better over urban stations. Compared with the total AOD validation, both the relatively lower bias (0.021 and 0.065) and the higher Gfrac (Fraction of Good retrieval, 63.8% and 47.3%, respectively) further indicate that DPC performs better when fine mode aerosols dominate. For the land SSA validation, most of our SSA retrievals (~71%) show differences with AERONET SSA retrievals lower than 0.05. Case studies over fire spots and dust over northern China demonstrate the encouraging application potential of DPC aerosol products. The difference between fine and coarse AOD can provide more aerosol source information compared with the total AOD alone. Since the SSA retrievals are particularly sensitive to absorbing fine particles, they can be easily used in the tracking of biomass burning aerosol. © 2022 by the authors.","Aerosols; Cameras; Dust; Optical properties; Optical remote sensing; Polarimeters; Aerosol product; Aerosol retrieval; Directional polarization camera; Gas product; GF-5 satellite; Multi angle; Multi-angle polarimeter; Optimized retrieval algorithm; Remote sensing of trace gas and aerosol product; Remote-sensing; Retrieval algorithms; Trace gas; Polarization","aerosol retrieval; directional polarization camera; GF-5 satellite; multi-angle polarimeter; optimized retrieval algorithm; RemoTAP","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138702288"

In this study, we investigated the possibility of using Landsat imagery to develop high-resolution AOD estimations at 30 m based on machine learning algorithms. We assessed the performance of six machine learning algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Cascade Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Multiple Linear Regression. To obtain accurate AOD estimations, we used prior knowledge from multiple sources as inputs to the machine learning models, including the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) albedo, the 1-km AOD product from MODIS data using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, and meteorological and surface elevation data. A total of 13,624 AOD measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites were used for model training and validation. We found that all six algorithms exhibited good performance, with R2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.78 and AOD root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.089 to 0.098. The extremely randomized trees algorithm, however, demonstrated marginally superior performance as compared to the other algorithms; hence, it was used to produce AOD estimates at a 30 m resolution for one Landsat scene coving Beijing in 2013–2019. Through a comparison with overlapping AERONET observations, a high level of accuracy was achieved, with an R2 = 0.889 and an RMSE = 0.156.

Remote sensing of ambient air pollution using data derived from satellites has the potential to better inform management decisions that address environmental disparities by providing increased spatial coverage, at high-spatial resolutions, compared to air pollution exposure estimates based on ground-based monitors alone. Daily PM2.5 estimates for 2015–2018 were estimated at a 1 km2 resolution, derived from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm in order to assess the utility of highly refined spatiotemporal air pollution data in 92 California cities and in the 13 communities included in the California Community Air Protection Program. The identification of pollution hot-spots within a city is typically not possible relying solely on the regulatory monitoring networks; however, day-to-day temporal variability was shown to be generally well represented by nearby ground-based monitoring data even in communities with strong spatial gradients in pollutant concentrations. An assessment of within-ZIP Code variability in pollution estimates indicates that high-resolution pollution estimates (i.e., 1 km2) are not always needed to identify spatial differences in exposure but become increasingly important for larger geographic areas (approximately 50 km2). Taken together, these findings can help inform strategies for use of remote sensing data for air quality management including the screening of locations with air pollution exposures that are not well represented by existing ground-based air pollution monitors. © 2022 by the authors.","California; United States; Air quality; Monitoring; Pollution detection; Quality management; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Air pollution exposures; Air pollution models; Air quality management; California; Exposure assessment; Ground based; High resolution; Management IS; Monitoring network; Satellite remote sensing; air quality; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; estimation method; MODIS; particulate matter; pollution exposure; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; NASA","Air pollution models; Air quality management; Exposure assessment; Monitoring networks; Satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123049760"

In this paper, we present the spatiotemporal variability of satellite-measured aerosol components (such as, black carbon, brown carbon, iron oxides contained in mineral dust etc.) over North China Plain (36–41°N, 113–123°E) for a heavily haze-polluted case, to demonstrate the first successful retrievals of aerosol component content and optical property directly from the DPC/GF-5 instrument measurements. We also reveal the relationship between absorbing/scattering component mass ratio and aerosol absorption based on the multi-angle polarimetric satellite measurements, which presents comparable agreement with previous laboratory studies and field studies for an indirect validation of aerosol component retrievals. In addition, the feasibility, stability and uncertainty of the aerosol optical property and component content retrievals from DPC multi-angle polarimetric observations were evaluated and assessed by sensitivity tests. The distributions of DPC/GF-5 aerosol optical depth (AOD) are in line with satellite-observed MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD and ground-based CARSNET (China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network) AOD products. Therefore, the multi-angle polarimetric satellite measurements show an encouraging potential for the comprehensive inversion of aerosol optical, microphysical and chemical properties.

We report results of data analyses for the geothermal area in the Hakone Volcano (Owakudani) using visible and infrared (IR) images from STIC. The STIC's IR cameras quantitatively estimated the surface structures (DSM) using Structure from Motion and Multi-View Stereo (SfM/MVS) processing with errors of ±4 to 12m in the horizontal direction and 30m in the vertical direction (10m or less excluding local sites). Using the result from this processing, we obtained multi angle (observation angle of 0 to ± 9.5°) orthorectified ground-surface brightness temperature 20 images of the 15-1 crater in Owakudani from the 20 continuous images of STIC's IR camera images. We estimated the maximum brightness temperature and heat radiation rate of the 15-1 crater using a square area of 30x30m including the 15-1 crater in these 20 consecutive thermal IR images (measurement interval 0.5s). Those estimated values fluctuated by ± 50% during the observation for a total of 9.5s because of large amounts of fumarolic gas. These results suggest that STIC's IR cameras can be used to detect ground-surface brightness temperature distribution that is affected by fumarolic gas in a volcanic geothermal area more accurately than conventional one-shot observation. © 2020 IEEE.","Cameras; Geology; Geothermal fields; Infrared imaging; Remote sensing; Stereo image processing; Temperature distribution; Volcanoes; Air-borne sensors; Brightness temperature distribution; Brightness temperatures; Measurement interval; Multi-angle observations; Observation angle; Structure from motion; Vertical direction; Luminance","Airborne imager; Geothermal activity; Infrared; Multi-angle observation; Thermal distribution; Volcano","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101963886"

Precise prediction of the spatial-temporal variation of tidal flats’ moisture content is an important foundation of surface bio-geophysical information research by remote sensing. In this paper, we first measured the multi-angle reflectance of soil samples obtained from tidal flats in the northeastern Dongtai, Jiangsu Province, China, in the laboratory. Then, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we retrieved the photometric characteristics of the soil surface by employing the SOILSPECT bidirectional reflectance model. Finally, the soil moisture content was retrieved by introducing the equivalent water thickness of the soil. The results showed that: (i) A significant correlation existed between the retrieved equivalent water thickness and the measured soil moisture content. The SOILSPECT model is capable of estimating soil moisture with high precision by using multi-angle reflectance. (ii) Retrieved values of single scattering albedo (ω) were consistent with the variation of soil moisture content. The roughness parameter (h) and the asymmetry factor (Θ) were consistent with the structure and particle composition of the soil surface in dry soil samples. (iii) When the soil samples were soaked with water, the roughness parameter (h) and the type of scattering on the soil surface both showed irregular changes. These results support the importance of using the measured soil particle size as one of the parameters for the retrieval of soil moisture content, which is a method that should be used cautiously, especially in tidal flats. © 2021 by the authors.

Currently, routine visual assessments provide subjective information, with the resulting estimate of fuel hazard varying due to observer experience and the rigor applied in making assessments. Terrestrial remote sensing techniques have been demonstrated to be capable of capturing quantitative information on the spatial distribution of biomass to inform fuel hazard assessments. This paper explores the use of image-based point clouds generated from imagery captured using a low-cost compact camera for describing the fuel hazard within the surface and near-surface layers. Terrestrial imagery was obtained at three distances for five target plots. Subsets of these images were then processed to determine the effect of varying overlap and distribution of image captures. The majority of the point clouds produced using this image-based technique provide an accurate representation of the 3D structure of the surface and near-surface fuels. Results indicate that high image overlap and pixel size are critical; multi-angle image capture is shown to be crucial in providing a representation of the vertical stratification of fuel. Terrestrial image-based point clouds represent a viable technique for low cost and rapid assessment of fuel structure. © 2020 by the authors.

The method is applied to observations of the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) obtained during two NASA aircraft campaigns, namely the Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) and the Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex). All aerosol retrievals are statistically evaluated using in situ data. Volume water fraction is inferred from the retrieved ambient real part of the refractive index, assuming a dry refractive index of 1.54 and by applying a volume mixing rule to obtain the effective ambient refractive index. The uncertainties in inferred volume water fraction resulting from this simplified model are discussed and estimated to be lower than 0.2 and decreasing with increasing volume water fraction. The daily mean retrieved volume water fractions correlate well with the in situ values with a mean absolute difference of 0.09. Polarimeter-retrieved ambient effective radius for daily data is shown to increase as a function of volume water fraction as expected. Furthermore, the effective variance of the size distributions also increases with increasing effective radius, which we show is consistent with an external mixture of soluble and insoluble aerosol. The relative variations of effective radius and variance over an observation period are then used to estimate the soluble fraction of the aerosol. Daily results of soluble fraction correlate well with in situ-observed sulfate mass fraction with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Subsequently, inferred water and soluble fractions are used to derive dry fine-mode size distributions from their ambient counterparts. While dry effective radii obtained in situ and from RSP show similar ranges, in situ values are generally substantially smaller during the ACTIVATE deployments, which may be due to biases in RSP retrievals or in the in situ observations, or both. Both RSP and in situ observations indicate the dominance of aerosol with low hygroscopicity during the ACTIVATE and CAMP2Ex campaigns. Furthermore, RSP indicates a high degree of external mixing of particles with low and high hygroscopicity. These retrievals of fine-mode water volume fraction and soluble fraction may be used for the evaluation of water uptake in atmospheric models. Furthermore, the framework allows us to estimate the variation in the concentration of fine-mode aerosol larger than a specific dry radius limit, which can be used as a proxy for the variation in cloud condensation nucleus concentrations. This framework may be applied to multi-angle, multi-spectral satellite data expected to be available in the near future. © 2022 Bastiaan van Diedenhoven et al.","Philippines; aerosol; atmospheric modeling; cloud condensation nucleus; correlation; hygroscopicity; refractive index; remote sensing; satellite data; size distribution; solubility; water uptake","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145551206"

Optical images can directly reflect the information of ground objects and provide people a real and intuitive feeling. Earthquake areas are often hit with inclement weather after the occurrence of earthquakes. Effective optical images are difficult to obtain in the presence of clouds and fog, thus leading to the incomplete recognition of landslide information. Given that SAR satellite technology is not affected by clouds and breaks through the limitations of optics, SAR data have gradually become the mainstream data for earthquake disaster response and assessment. With the development of SAR sensors, SAR has developed into a multiband, multi-polarization, multi-angle, and variable working model from the first single mode of operation. SAR data guarantee flexibility in its application to seismic landslide identification. Existing SAR image landslide identification methods mainly use single characteristics of texture features or polarization features of landslide information in SAR images. Multi-source features in SAR images have not been fused, especially the characteristics of multi-polarization SAR image data. Thus, landslide survey accuracy is low and cannot meet actual application needs. Taking the Jiuzhaigou earthquake as an example, this study adopts the first C-band multi-polarization GF-3 satellite data with a resolution of 1 m as the data source. Polarization and texture features of the image are extracted based on an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of multi-polarization image data. Afterward, GF-2 satellite data obtained post-earthquake are carefully registered with the GF-3 satellite data. Typical landslide samples are selected from the GF-2 images, which are used as training samples for classification. Finally, back propagation neural network is used to extract the landslide in the whole area through the comprehensive utilization of polarization characteristics, texture, and terrain feature information based on the training samples. To meet the urgency of the disaster, identification accuracy can be improved as much as possible while meeting the efficiency of information identification. The findings can provide a reference for the restoration, reconstruction, and scientific exploration of the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. A comparison of the results of visual interpretation of GF-2 optical images and the unmanned aerial vehicle images revealed that the overall extraction accuracy of the landslide is 92.8% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.715. The scattering characteristics of the ridge on the image are easily confused with the bright spots formed by the landslide because these characteristics are more obvious. The spatial distribution feature of the slope can eliminate partial landslide information and eliminate the influence of the ridge. Taking the Jiuzhaigou earthquake as an example and using the homemade GF-3 full polarization SAR satellite data, this study proposes a fully polarimetric data seismic landslide automatic recognition method based on integrated polarization features, texture features, and terrain features. The method is used for a general investigation of landslides in the entire earthquake area of Jiuzhaigou. The extraction results meet the requirements of earthquake emergency, post-earthquake recovery, and reconstruction. The method also promotes the application of GaoFen satellites in the earthquake prevention and disaster reduction industry. © 2019, Science Press.

Arctic-wide maps that represent spatial patterns of sea ice roughness can be used to better characterize spatial patterns of ice convergence and divergence processes. Sea ice surface roughness can also control and quantify turbulent exchange between sea ice surface and atmosphere and therefore influence surface energy balance at the basin scale. We have developed a data processing system that produces georeferenced sea ice roughness rasters that can be mosaicked to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness. This approach starts with Top-of-Atmosphere radiance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We used red-band angular data from three MISR cameras (Ca, Cf, An). We created a training data set in which MISR pixels were matched with co-located and concurrent lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We used a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with the training data to calibrate the multi-angle data to values of surface roughness and then applied the algorithm to Arctic-wide MISR data for two 16-day periods in April (spring) and July (summer). After georeferencing the roughness rasters, we then mosaicked each 16-day roughness dataset to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness for spring and summer. Assessment of the results shows good agreement with independent ATM roughness data, not used in model development.

We also quantitatively evaluate the effects of polarization measurements and the number of viewing angles on ALH retrieval under different conditions (aerosol model, aerosol optical depth, etc.). By comparing the different degree of freedom for signal (DFS) results of ALH caused by the theoretical retrieval error changes in different microphysical parameters in the aerosol and surface model, we identify the key factors affecting ALH retrieval. The results show that the extended ultraviolet band provides important information for ALH retrieval and is closely related to the scattering and absorption characteristics of aerosol models. The polarization measurements in fine mode reduce the posterior error of ALH retrieval by 6–39%; however, this is relatively small for coarse mode. In particular, when it is applied to the transported dust and background dust aerosol types, the posterior error is only reduced by 1–8% after adding polarization measurements. For these two aerosol types with weak absorption at the ultraviolet band, increasing the number of angles observed in addition to increasing the polarization channel will more effectively improve ALH inversion. Compared with other aerosol and surface model parameters, the retrieval errors for the total volume column, effective variance, real part of the complex refractive index, and surface reflectance are the main factors affecting ALH retrieval. Therefore, reducing the theoretical retrieval error of these parameters will be helpful. © 2022 by the authors.","Aerosols; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dust; Optical remote sensing; Polarization; Refractive index; A posteriori error; Aerosol layer height; Aerosol layers; Information content analysis; Multi angle; Multiangle polarimetric remote sensing; Optimal estimation inversion; Optimal estimations; Polarimetric remote sensing; Posteriori error; Errors","a posteriori error; aerosol layer height; information content analysis; multiangle polarimetric remote sensing; optimal estimation inversion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144818167"

However, most researches collect hyperspectral data from the vertical angle, always leading to the inaccurate estimation of crop nitrogen. Studies have found that using multi-angle spectral data could improve the accuracy in estimating crop leaf nitrogen content (LNC). In this study, the LNC at different leaf positions of winter wheat under five nitrogen treatments was measured and the multi-angle spectral reflectance of leaves were collected. The results showed that the top third leaf were the most sensitive to nitrogen application rate. Correlation analysis showed that the correlation between LNC and spectral reflectance obtained at 0° was the highest, followed by that between LNC and spectral reflectance obtained at 10°, 30°, 40°, and 20°. Moreover, a model based on the multi-angle composite vegetation index (MACVI) for LNC estimation was constructed through combining the difference vegetable index (DVI), the normalized difference vegetable index (NDVI), and the ratio vegetable index (RVI) and using the spectral data obtained from multiple leaf inclination angles, finding that this model could improve the estimation accuracy. The accuracy of the model based on the spectral reflectance obtained at 0°, 10°, and 20° was higher than the others, and the coefficient of determination (R 2) for the MACVID,R-based model was the highest.

It allows for accurate characterization of liquid water cloud droplet sizes using the rainbow structure in the polarized reflectance. RSP's observations also provide constraints on the cumulus cloud's 2D cross section, yielding estimates of its geometric shape. In this study for the first time we evaluate the possibility to retrieve vertical profiles of microphysical characteristics along the cloud side by combining these micro- and macrophysical retrieval methods. First we constrain cloud's geometric shape, then for each point on the bright side of its surface we collect data from different scans to obtain the multi-angle polarized reflectance at that point. The rainbow structures of the reflectances from multiple points yield the corresponding droplet size distributions (DSDs), which are then combined into vertical profiles. We present the results of testing the proposed profiling algorithm on simulated data obtained using large eddy simulations and 3D radiative transfer computations. The virtual RSP measurements were used for retrieval of DSD profiles, which then were compared to the actual data from the LES-model output.

This represents 85% of the climatological accumulation over this period. To illustrate the available data, measurements corresponding to the four precipitation events with the largest accumulation are presented. The synoptic situations of these events were contrasted and influenced the precipitation type and accumulation. The hydrometeor classifications reveal that aggregate snowflakes were dominant and that some events featured significant riming.

Due to the difficulty and variability in obtaining various necessary parameters of BBM, a new method is needed to quickly and accurately calculate the trace gas emissions fromwildfires. Here, we used satellite data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to calculate CO2 emissions from wildfires (the OCO-2 model). Four active wildfires in Siberia were selected in which OCO-2 points intersecting with smoke plumes identified by Aqua MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images. MODIS band 8, band 21 and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) data were used to identify the smoke plume area, burned area and smoke plume height, respectively. By contrast with BBM, which calculates CO2 emissions based on the bottom-top mode, the OCO-2 model estimates CO2 emissions based on the top-bottom mode. We used a linear regression model to compute CO2 concentration (XCO2) for each smoke plume pixel and then calculated CO2 emissions for each wildfire point. The CO2 mass of each smoke plume pixel was added to obtain the CO2 emissions from wildfires. After verifying our results with the BBM, we found that the biases were between 25.76% and 157.11% for the four active fires. The OCO-2 model displays the advantages of remote-sensing technology and is a useful tool for fire-emission monitoring, although we note some of its disadvantages. This study proposed a new perspective to estimate CO2 emissions from wildfire and effectively expands the applied range of OCO-2 satellite data. © 2019 by the authors.","Siberia; Carbon dioxide; Fires; Fluid dynamics; Orbits; Pixels; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Smoke; Spectrometers; CO2 emissions; MINX; MISR; OCO-2; Wildfire; accuracy assessment; Aqua (satellite); biomass burning; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); MODIS; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; trace gas; wildfire; Gas emissions","CO<sub>2</sub> emission; MINX; MISR; OCO-2; Wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074100845"

Therefore, atmospheric monitoring is of considerable importance. The polarization sensitivity of atmospheric aerosol scattering radiation provides a new idea for the application of optical polarization remote sensing technology for atmospheric detection. Combining the technical development of China's aerial remote sensing system and the demand for environmental atmospheric remote sensing monitoring, an aerial atmospheric multi-angle polarization detection method is proposed. The key technologies include a cluster polarization optics system design, polarization calibration, etc. The atmospheric multi-angle polarimetric radiometer was developed. First, the polarization detection principle of this radiometer is introduced. Thereafter, the optical system solution design is discussed. The influence of multi-angle detection and calibration accuracy of the radiometer on the posterior error of atmospheric aerosol column concentration retrieval was analyzed. Next, using the standard polarized light generator and the absolute radiometric calibration system, the polarization measurement accuracy of the radiometer was verified, and the absolute radiometric calibration uncertainty was obtained. Next, the special multi-angle and multi-spectral polarization detection data processing system was developed for radiometer airborne remote sensing mode. Finally, the field experimental analysis was conducted. The specifications of the radiometer were verified via aerial flight campaigns and ground-based synchronous observation experiments. The results show that the absolute radiation calibration uncertainty of the radiometer is better than 4%. The polarization measurement error was less than 0. 5%, and the aerosol optical thickness retrieval error at the synchronous comparison site was less than 0. 05. The polarization data measured by the radiometer can be retrieved to obtain atmospheric aerosol optical thickness and other parameters, which can meet the application requirements of regional environmental atmospheric monitoring. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Yet, the accurate estimation of leaf water content using multi-angular reflectance measurements across different plant species is still challenging. This study aims to propose a generic spectral index for accurately estimating equivalent water thickness (EWT) when multi-angular spectral reflection is considered. The index was selected to have the format of a difference ratio using three reflectance factors. The reflectance factor at 410 nm was used to reduce the specular reflection from the leaf surface in the 400–2500 nm range, and the ratio of the wavelengths in the 1268–1285 nm range (at non-water absorption wavelengths) to the wavelengths in the 1339–1346 nm range (at water absorption wavelengths) strengthened the relationship with EWT for all of the sampled plant species. The modified difference ratio (MDR) index, (R1271-R410)/(R1342-R410), was linearly proportional to EWT, with R2 > 0.90, when the leaves reflection data were collected from various viewing angles. However, the relationships between some existing indices (simple difference, simple ratio, normalized difference, double difference index and difference ratio indices) and EWT at the leaf level were weak and unstable for all of the 18 plant species (including 14 broadleaf, 3 shrub, and 1 liana species) at different angles under laboratory and field conditions. Moreover, validation results from six independent datasets (n = 1800) and one modeled dataset (n = 2375) further confirmed that the algorithm derived from the proposed index (based on multi-angular reflectance factors of leaves) was not only effective for EWT estimation across a diverse set of plant species with widely variable leaf structure and water content, but also insensitive to different measurement conditions (leaf clip, integrating spheres or multi-angle measurements). The algorithm developed from this new index is generic, does not require reparameterization for each species, and can be accurately used for nondestructive EWT estimations using a simple handheld laboratory or field instrument, and thus, is convenient for agricultural and ecological studies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural robots; Plants (botany); Reflection; Absorption wavelengths; Biogeochemical process; Different growth stages; Equivalent water thickness; Linearly proportional; Measurement conditions; Net primary production; Normalized differences; algorithm; growth form; leaf; reflectance; remote sensing; spectral analysis; water content; Water absorption","Angle-insensitive spectral indices; Equivalent water thickness (EWT); Leaf water content estimation; Multi-angular spectral reflectance factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097336094"

The boundary of a lake can be extracted from the remote sensing satellite image or the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) orthophoto, but the information of the lake and its surroundings, which is supposed to be three-dimensional, is recorded in two dimensions in this way. When the tall and dense vegetation are projected on the lake, the extracted lake boundary from orthophoto would be smaller than reality, which results in lower value of the lake water storage. UAV oblique photogrammetry can solve this problem by recording multi-angle images of the lake and its surroundings. Based on aerial photogrammetry theory, a real 3D model of the lake can be constructed by combing UAV oblique photogrammetric images. The model can accurately present the actual scene of the lake, and the extracted lake boundary can be very close to reality. In this study, UAV and Unmanned Surface Boats (USB) have been employed to collect UAV oblique photogrammetric images and lakebed terrain data, respectively. The lake boundary has been extracted based on the UAV real 3D model. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of lakebed terrain has been built based on lakebed terrain data collected by USB. Finally, the water storage of the lake is estimated based on the boundary and DEM.

Most of the existing pBRDF models include a Lambertian constant diffuse scattering component that the scattering and absorption of light inside the material is completely ignored. In this paper, a modified microfacet pBRDF model is proposed for material surface with considering specular reflection and diffuse scattering based on the combination of the microfacet and Kubelka–Munk (K–M) theory. In this model, a scaling parameter is introduced into specular reflection component to adjust the model which contains all the polarization information, and the diffuse scattering component is depolarization modeled following the K–M theory. The expression of DoP is developed from the new pBRDF model that includes the scattering and absorption effects in bulk of material, which makes more reasonable with physical interpretation. Several experiment groups of DoP for coating samples (rough yellow and black paint) are measured by the multi-angle polarization instrument, and then, the model parameters are fitted by least square method based on the experimental data. The results show that the DoP values calculated by the modified microfacet pBRDF model are found to be consistent with the measured DoP values, and can significantly improve the modeling accuracy, which provides theoretical support for polarization remote sensing and object recognition. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Depolarization; Distribution functions; Least squares approximations; Light absorption; Object recognition; Polarization; Remote sensing; Surface properties; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Degree of polarization; Diffuse scattering; Material surface; pBRDF; Physical interpretation; Scattering and absorption; Specular reflections; Surface scattering","Degree of polarization; Diffuse scattering; Material surface; pBRDF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071633334"

Aiming at the lack of short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands in ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images resulting in the poor detection effect, considering the obvious differ-ence in geographic height between cloud and ground surface objects, this paper proposes a thick and thin cloud detection method combining spectral information and digital height model (DHM) based on multi-scale features-convolutional neural network (MF-CNN) model. To verify the importance of DHM height information in cloud detection of ZY-3 multi-angle remote sensing images, this paper implements cloud detection comparison of the data set with and without DHM height information based on the MF-CNN model. The experimental results show that the ZY-3 multi-angle image with DHM height information can effectively improve the confusion between highlighted surface and thin cloud, which also means the assistance of DHM height information can make up for the disadvantage of high-resolution image lacking short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands. © 2022 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Image enhancement; Infrared radiation; Neural network models; Object detection; Remote sensing; Actual use; Cloud detection; Convolutional neural network; Digital height models; Multi-angle remote sensing; Multi-scale features; Neural network model; Remote sensing images; Short wave infrared; Thermal infrared bands; artificial neural network; detection method; image processing; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; ZiYuan; Convolutional neural networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147330204"

This includes the U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System ReAnalysis version 1 (NAAPS-RA v1), the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ReAnalysis (CAMSRA). Spaceborne remote-sensing retrievals of AOD are considered from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Ground-based data include sun photometer data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites and oceanic Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. Aerosol reanalysis AODs and spaceborne retrievals show consistent climatological spatial patterns and trends for both spring and summer seasons over the lower Arctic (60-70N). Consistent AOD trends are also found for the high Arctic (north of 70° N) from reanalyses. The aerosol reanalyses yield more consistent AOD results than climate models, can be verified well with AERONET, and corroborate complementary climatological and trend analysis. Speciated AODs are more variable than total AOD among the three reanalyses and a little more so for March-May (MAM) than for June-August (JJA). Black carbon (BC) AOD in the Arctic comes predominantly from biomass burning (BB) sources in both MAM and JJA, and BB overwhelms anthropogenic sources in JJA for the study period. AOD exhibits a multi-year negative MAM trend and a positive JJA trend in the Arctic during 2003-2019, due to an overall decrease in sulfate/anthropogenic pollution and a significant JJA increase in BB smoke. Interannual Arctic AOD variability is significantly large, driven by fine-mode and, specifically, BB smoke, with both smoke contribution and interannual variation larger in JJA than in MAM. It is recommended that climate models should account for BB emissions and BB interannual variabilities and trends in Arctic climate change studies. © 2022 Peng Xian et al.","aerosol composition; aerosol formation; climate modeling; optical depth; polarization; summer; trend analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135626010"

However, unlike on-satellite observations, the spatio-temporal characteristics of MILS_BRF data have rarely been explicitly and comprehensively analysed. Results from 5-yr (2011–2015) of MILS_BRF dataset from a typical region in central Northeast Asia as the study area showed that the monthly area coverage as well as MILS_BRF data quantity varies significantly, from the highest in October (99.05%) through median in June/July (78.09%/75.21%) to lowest in January (18.97%), and a large data-vacant area exists in the study area during four consecutive winter months (December through March). The data-vacant area is mainly composed of crop lands and cropland/natural vegetation mosaic. The amount of data within the principal plane (PP) ±30° (nPP) or cross PP ±30° (nCP), varies intra-annually with significant differences from different view zeniths or forward/backward scattering directions. For example, multiple off-nadir cameras have nPP but no nCP data for up to six months (September through February), with the opposite occurring in June and July. This study provides explicit and comprehensive information about the spatio-temporal characteristics of product coverage and observation geometry of MILS_BRF in the study area. Results provide required user reference information for MILS_BRF to evaluate performance of BRDF models or to compare with other satellite-derived BRF or albedo products.

The technologies of polarimetric and interferometric synthetic-aperture radar, high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing, spaceborne lidar, and multi-angle satellite remote sensing can effectively obtain forest structure regionally. However, it is challenging to obtain structural parameters on a single-tree scale using these technologies. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently provides a new means to obtain forest structures. The ground images can be obtained using UAV ordinary cameras, and the ground point cloud can be obtained using structure from motion photogrammetry technology for 3D reconstruction, generating digital surface model, digital elevation model (DEM), and canopy height model (CHM). The local maximum algorithm is used to process CHM data. The key to the local maximum algorithm is to select an appropriate window size and find the largest grid value (seed point) in the window as the highest point of the tree crown to represent the tree. However, it is challenging to calculate the window size. One solution is to use the variable window method. In this study, the height and crown diameter of 49 Populus euphratica trees were measured in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, Xinjiang, China. The Populus euphratica were counted in a 251 hm2 grid, and a DJI Phantom 4 Pro was used to acquire the image data. The DJI Phantom 4 Pro is a consumer-grade UAV using oblique and ortho photogrammetry, respectively. An adaptive window maxima algorithm was proposed to analyze and process CHM data, obtaining the structural parameters of the Populus euphratica forest in the study area, such as tree height, crown diameter, and number of trees. The structural parameters extracted using oblique and ortho photogrammetry were compared and analyzed with field-measured data. The results and conclusions are (1) the adaptive window maxima algorithm and fixed window maximum algorithm (1.5-, 2.0-, 2.5-, and 3.0- m fixed windows, respectively) were used to process CHM data obtained using oblique photogrammetry to generate Populus euphratica seed points. The data are compared with the statistical data of 25 sample plots. The R2 of fixed window values vary widely from 0.7834 to 0.8261, indicating that we should choose an appropriate window size to achieve higher accuracy according to the actual situation of the region. While the R2 of the adaptive window maxima algorithm is the highest (0.8341), it can achieve higher accuracy because the algorithm reduces the window size dependence. (2) The tree height measured using oblique and ortho photogrammetry is overestimated, and the crown diameter is underestimated. The mean, median, and distribution of tree height and crown diameter obtained using ortho photogrammetry are closer to the field-measured values, indicating that oblique photogrammetry could achieve more accurate results than ortho photogrammetry. (3) The oblique photogrammetry and field-measured data were compared to determine the coefficients (R2) of tree height, crown diameter, and tree numbers per hectare (0.9002, 0.8403, and 0.9405, respectively). The root means squared error was 0.4457, 0.6815, and 4.2500, respectively. The results prove that it is effective to use a consumer-grade UAV to obtain forest structure parameters on a single-tree scale using an appropriate measurement method and processing algorithm. © 2021 Science Press (China).

Until now, there are no clear studies on circumstances that necessitate the ground reflectance correction, and which bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is used for correction. Due to the high accuracy of medium-resolution image spectrometer (MODIS), MODIS images are analyzed. First, using six sets of unmanned aerial vehicle multi-angle observation data under different sun zenith angles at the Dunhuang site in September 2020, 36 different BRDF models are established by six different kernel function combinations. For the images under different observation angles, we calculated the apparent reflectance before and after the BRDF correction and compared the relative deviation with the measured apparent reflectance of the satellite. By considering the observation angle of 28° as the boundary, the experimental results show that the relative deviation is greater when the angle is greater than 28°, which is a significant consequence of the BRDF correction. Among the BRDF models established above, the BRDF model established using multi-angle observation data measured close to the time of satellite transit has a better correction effect. Furthermore, the relative deviation between the apparent reflectance calculated by the BRDF model using the kernel function combination of Rossthick-Lidense or RossThick-LiSparseR or Rossthin-LisparseR and the satellite observation value are small. © 2022 Universitat zu Koln.

Available PM10 datasets have coarse spatial resolutions, limiting their applications, especially at the city level. A tree-based ensemble learning model, which accounts for spatiotemporal information (i.e., space-time extremely randomized trees, denoted as the STET model), is designed to estimate near-surface PM10 concentrations. The 1-km resolution Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol product and auxiliary factors, including meteorology, land-use cover, surface elevation, population distribution, and pollutant emissions, are used in the STET model to generate the high-resolution (1 km) and high-quality PM10 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM10) from 2015 to 2019. The product has an out-of-sample (out-of-station) cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.86 (0.82) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 24.28 (27.07) μg/m3, outperforming most widely used models from previous related studies. High levels of PM10 concentration occurred in northwest China (e.g., the Tarim Basin) and the Northern China Plain. Overall, PM10 concentrations had a significant declining trend of 5.81 μg/m3 per year (p < 0.001) over the past five years in China, especially in three key urban agglomerations. The ChinaHighPM10 dataset is potentially useful for future small- and medium-scale air pollution studies by virtue of its higher spatial resolution and overall accuracy. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; China; Land use; Mean square error; Aerodynamic diameters; Atmospheric environment; Coefficient of determination; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Northern China Plains; Root mean square errors; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal information; aerodynamics; aerosol; concentration (composition); data set; optical depth; particulate matter; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; article; China; controlled study; cross validation; human; land use; learning; meteorology; population distribution; randomized controlled trial; remote sensing; respirable particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Air pollution","1-km resolution; AOD; ChinaHighPM<sub>10</sub>; PM<sub>10</sub>; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097637177"

The common method of ice model inference is based on intensity (total reflectivity) measurements, which is generally not applicable to optically thin ice clouds (i.e., cirrus clouds) where single scattering dominates. The new approach is able to infer an ice model in clouds with optical thicknesses smaller than 5. The improvement is made by first assuming the optical thickness retrieved using total reflectivity. Sub-sequently, the polarized reflectivity is calculated based on look‐up tables generated from simulated polarized reflectances computed for cirrus clouds in conjunction with eight ice particle models. The ice particle model that leads to the closest fit to the measurements is regarded as the optimal ice particle model. Additionally, an alternative method is applied that does not consider polarized re-flectivity. These two methods are applied to a data sample as a proof‐of‐concept study where AirMSPI observed a single cirrus layer. In this case study, the hexagonal column aggregate model works for most pixels both with and without considering polarized reflectivities. The retrieval cost function is high when the camera pairs with large zenith angles are included in the retrievals. This result suggests that further studies will be necessary to have a better understanding of all eight selected ice particle models at scattering angles smaller than 100°. © 2021 by the authors.

So, near the year of 2020, a number of satellites loading multi-angle and polarized camera would be launched in different countries. As a high quantitative sensor, its in-flight calibration has always been attractive. Due to the lack of onboard calibration instrument and the low spatial resolution, the natural scenery targets are selected to be vicarious optic references for the calibration. Multi-angel polarized camera has several parameters to be calibrated. The radiometric calibration of polarized camera includes intensity and polarization parameters. Different calibration parameters are calibrated using many natural targets by many methods which are developed in parallel. The Gaofen-5 launched in 2018 is the first satellite loading polarized sensor of China, also the only operational satellite in the world this time. In view of many new polarized camera aerospace plans in European and American countries and China, the vicarious calibration for polarized camera is necessary to overview. In this paper, the optical structure and the spectral settings of the large view, polarized and multispectral camera are presented. The optical transfer model of camera is introduced. The in-flight calibration theory and method of each camera parameter is classified into three categories including absolute radiometric intensity, relative radiometric intensity and polarization. For a specified calibration coefficient, the natural target and calibration flow are introduced for the in-flight calibration. The method system is formed for the in-flight radiometric calibration of the large view, polarized and multispectral camera. Also, the general validation methods of calibration are concluded. The in-flight calibration of the new large view, polarized and multispectral camera will inherit the original research and use special natural scenery to carry out calibration. In the same kind of future remote sensing camera, new style in-flight radiometric calibration will be based on the instruments and its calibrator onboard the same satellite platform, ground-based artificial optical source and others. China, Europe and America have planned some future polarized camera, jointly considering the research basis of authors, preliminary design and prospects for the future on-orbit calibration method are given. A polarized multispectral camera mainly serves the remote sensing monitoring of atmospheric particulate matter, which is very important for the atmospheric environment problems currently concerned in China. A continuous in-flight calibration can ensure the accuracy of satellite remote sensing retrieved products. This overview of in-flight calibration research and the preliminary design for the future calibration method will provide method and model references for the remote sensing application system of the planned satellite. © 2020, Peking University Press.

However, processing multi-angle remote-sensing images presents new challenges. Owing to the multi-angle sensors used to obtain multi-angle images, there are major differences in the spatial and spectral information between each angle in these images. Data from the Compact High-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) on Project for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA) should be pre-processed to extract the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions). Given the limitations of the pre-processing software currently available for CHRIS/PROBA images, and the lack of metadata and auxiliary origin schedules, some CHRIS multi-angle images cannot be pre-processed correctly. In the study, to promote the application of multi-angle data, a formula for calculating key parameters according to in-orbit geometric imaging relationships is derived to design a multi-angle image process flow including image rollovers, bad-line repairs, orthorectification and atmospheric corrections accounting for terrain effects.

In medical imaging, it is extensively used for diagnostics via X-ray computed tomography (CT). We define and derive a tomography of cloud droplet distributions via passive remote sensing. We use multi-view polarimetric images to fit a 3D polarized radiative transfer (RT) forward model. Our motivation is 3D volumetric probing of vertically-developed convectively-driven clouds that are ill-served by current methods in operational passive remote sensing. Current techniques are indeed based on strictly 1D RT modeling and applied to a single cloudy pixel, where cloud geometry defaults to that of a plane-parallel slab. Incident unpolarized sunlight, once scattered by cloud droplets, changes its polarization state according to droplet size. Therefore, polarimetric measurements in the rainbow and glory angular regions can be used to infer the droplet size distribution. This work defines and derives a framework for a full 3D tomography of cloud droplets for both their mass concentration in space and their distribution across a range of sizes. This gridded 3D retrieval of key microphysical properties is made tractable by our novel approach that involves a restructuring and partial linearization of an open-source polarized 3D RT code to accommodate a special two-step iterative optimization technique. Physically-realistic synthetic clouds are used to demonstrate the methodology with rigorous uncertainty quantification, while a real-world cloud imaged by AirMSPI is processed to illustrate the new remote sensing capability.  © 2021 SPIE.","Angular distribution; Clouds; Computerized tomography; Diagnosis; Drops; Imaging systems; Interferometry; Inverse problems; Iterative methods; Medical imaging; Open source software; Open systems; Optical radar; Polarimeters; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; 3d vector radiative transfer; 3D vectors; Aerosol plume; AirMSPI; Cloud droplets; Cloud microphysics; Convective clouds; Droplets sizes; Remote-sensing; Vector radiative transfer; Polarization","3D vector radiative transfer; aerosol plumes; AirMSPI; cloud microphysics; convective clouds; inverse problems; polarization; remote sensing; tomography","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116073610"

In situ data from surface observation sites and aircraft field campaigns offer deep insight into the optical, chemical, and microphysical traits of biomass burning (BB) smoke aerosols, such as single scattering albedo (SSA) and size distribution, but cannot by themselves provide robust statistical characterization of both emitted and evolved particles. Data from the NASA Earth Observing System’s Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument can provide at least a partial picture of BB particle properties and their evolution downwind, once properly validated. Here we use in situ data from the joint NOAA/NASA 2019 Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments Experiment-Air Quality (FIREX-AQ) field campaign to assess the strengths and limitations of MISR-derived constraints on particle size, shape, light-absorption, and its spectral slope, as well as plume height and associated wind vectors. Based on the satellite observations, we also offer inferences about aging mechanisms effecting downwind particle evolution, such as gravitational settling, oxidation, secondary particle formation, and the combination of particle aggregation and condensational growth. This work builds upon our previous study, adding confidence to our interpretation of the remote-sensing data based on an expanded suite of in situ measurements for validation. The satellite and in situ measurements offer similar characterizations of particle property evolution as a function of smoke age for the 06 August Williams Flats Fire, and most of the key differences in particle size and absorption can be attributed to differences in sampling and changes in the plume geometry between sampling times. Whereas the aircraft data provide validation for the MISR retrievals, the satellite data offer a spatially continuous mapping of particle properties over the plume, which helps identify trends in particle property downwind evolution that are ambiguous in the sparsely sampled aircraft transects. The MISR data record is more than two decades long, offering future opportunities to study regional wildfire plume behavior statistically, where aircraft data are limited or entirely lacking. © 2020 by the authors.

Mixed canopy structure under different lighting and observation geometries can affect the remote sensing observations of the PRI, leading to some errors in estimating vegetation photosynthesis. Multi-angle observation is an effective method for resolving differences in observation geometry. Fitting multi-angle observations to a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) can normalize PRI to a common solar-observation target position, resulting in a significant increase in the correlation between canopy PRI and LUE, and has been well used in forest ecosystems. However, studies on the standardization of multi-angle PRI by BRDF models on crop canopies are still not well developed. To investigate the ability of the improved PRI by BRDF model to estimate the LUE of rice canopies, this paper used multi-angle rice canopy reflection data and contemporaneous flux data from the National Meteorological Station in Shouxian, Anhui, a semi-empirical, kernel-driven BRDF model was used to standardize the multi-angle PRI for each half-hourly from 09:00 to 15:00 during the observation period. This paper explored the BRDF model simulated PRI values and the model parameter characteristics under different physiological and non-physiological conditions. The results showed that the BRDF model fitting was poorly at low Clearness Index (CI) and became better as the CI increased, with the best performance at CI = 0.9 (R2 = 0.41). The parameters of the BRDF model are influenced by light conditions and vegetation status, where the isotropic weights (ki) correlated well with LUE for different CI ranges (linear regression coefficients R2 > 0.3 for all CI ranges), with the best correlation at 0.6 ≤ CI < 0.7 (R2 = 0.63); the daily variation of volume scattering weights (kv) showed a ""U-shape"" during the observation period, which was consistent with the daily variation of LUE. After correction by the BRDF model, the R2 of the exponential regression between PRI and LUE increased from 0.46 (P<0.05) to 0.8 (P<0.01). Compared with the PRI from simple multi-angle remote sensing observations, the angular correction by the BRDF model improved the ability of PRI estimating LUE; this study also demonstrated the feasibility that multi-angle canopy spectral observations can use the BRDF model to improve vegetation indices tracking plant physiological activity. This study has reference value for processing multi-angle vegetation remote sensing observation data and for remote sensing estimation of physiological activities related to photosynthesis in regional vegetation. The BRDF model can be practiced in multi-angle satellite observations to achieve the monitoring of photosynthetic capacity in a large area of farming area. Subsequent experiments in different farming areas will be carried out to calibrate the wider band spectral observations available from satellite data to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between LUE variation and spectral reflectance in lutein and fluorescence-related absorption characteristics, and to provide some reference for the calibration of parameters in agricultural areas in the global productivity model. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

As the South China Sea has a wide spatial coverage, remote sensing technology with wide monitoring scope and strong timeliness is increasingly becoming an important means to monitor this part of the ocean. The current monitoring trend is to combine different data sources, including common synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical image and thermal image by image fusion method, and monitor the marine environment jointly by multiple methods, but there still exist many problems. Using a systematic means of meta-analysis, this paper undertook a literature review about the South China Sea Environment Monitoring with Remote Sensing Techniques, mainly analysing related articles in recent ten years. The current researches show several limitations, thus putting forward a comprehensive multi-angle remote sensing monitoring method is important for ecological and environmental protection in South China Sea. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.","Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; environmental monitoring; image analysis; literature review; marine environment; meta-analysis; optical property; radar altimetry; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar","environment monitoring; remote sensing; South China Sea","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085526073"

The rapid development of deep learning technology provides a new way to extract cultivated land information. However, there are many parameters involved in deep learning, so it is time-consuming to find the optimal parameters. In order to simplify the complex parameter tuning process and explore the main parameters that affect the classification accuracy of deep learning, this study uses Gaofen-2 images as data support and based on U-Net semantic segmentation model to carry out an experiment of cultivated land extraction in Henan Province, China. This study designs model training in different scenarios based on four bands(near-infrared (Nir), red, green, and blue), three backbone models, and six patch sizes (pixel resolution), and analyzes the training model and classification results from multiple perspectives such as model training time, sample size, epoch, and classification categories and quantity. After analysis and evaluation, we conducted cultivated land extraction experiments in three years and different phenological periods, and finally tested the performance of U-Net, PSPNet, Deeplab, and Random Forest in cultivated land extraction. The results show that: (1) the patch size in the model has the greatest influence on the classification accuracy, which is affected by image resolution, geographic objects and batch size. When the patch size was smaller than 112 × 112 pixels, the model recall and F1 decreased substantially, with a decrease of 23.91% and 22.64%, respectively. (2) For U-Net model, after setting reasonable band combination, backbone model, patch size, epoch and sample category, the segmentation and classification accuracy of predicted results increased by 3.27% (Intersection over Union, IoU), 2.62%(overall accuracy, OA), 3.89%(F1) and 7.89%(Kappa) on average. (3) We also determined the optimal band combination (Nir, Red, and Green), patch size (224 × 224 pixels), and backbone (Resnet34) for cultivated land extraction from Gaofen-2 images. The appropriate patch size of cultivated land extraction in the study is between 224 × 224 and 256 × 256 pixels. (4) For cultivated land extraction, relying only on binary classification is not as effective as multi-classification. © 2022 The Authors","China; Henan; Agriculture; Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Extraction; Food supply; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Infrared devices; Land use; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Semantics; Classification accuracy; Cultivated land extraction; Cultivated lands; Deep learning; Gaofen-2; High resolution remote sensing imagery; Model training; Near-infrared; Patch size; U-net; cultivation; extraction; remote sensing; resolution; Pixels","Cultivated land extraction; Deep learning; Gaofen-2; High-resolution remote sensing imagery; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132876922"

In this study, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) V23 aerosol products and the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectance (POLDER) GRASP “high-precision” archive were evaluated with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations over China.

Polarization is a ubiquitous optical phenomenon which has commercial and technological applications. After decades of development, polarization remote sensing has become a widely applied technology in Earth observation. Depending on intensity information, traditional optical remote sensing has many disadvantages on target identification and information extraction, but it could be modified by appending polarization information to it, so that, the features and characteristics of the targets could be obtained from polarization information. Soil is a complex substance that plays an important role in the ecosystem. Hence itself is helpful to apply remote sensing on the soil to monitor the environment and treat pollution. Ideally, the soil do not obviously reflect or absorb electromagnetic waves in any range of wavelength, while the moisture, organic matters and roughness usually influences the spectrum characteristic of soil. According to recent studies, it is significant that petroleum an influences the polarized spectrum characteristics of the soil. Especially in the red and infrared spectral regions, the spectral response of petroleum is so pretty obvious, that the pollution on the Earth's surface could be detected by remote sensing of a wide range and multiple periods. In addition, it is reasonable for us to assume thatthe influence on viewing effect of petroleum might vary in different soil types. In this paper, the petroleum-polluted soils were respectively sampled from a wetland and a cropland in Zhenlai Petroleum Factory, located in Jilin Petroleum Field. By multiangle measurement, we managed to compare the polarized spectrum characteristics of each kind of soil sample and analyze the influences on themwith quantitative and qualitative methods. The results suggest it is obvious the polarized spectrum characteristics of wetland soil differ from another one, because of the difference in moisture and structure, together with the existence of petroleum, for which the measured polarized reflectance value has a significant shift from the predicted polarized reflectance value. © 2022 Science Press.

Satellite remote sensing is presented as a feasible means in order to monitor these forests. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is amongst major tools for studying this region. Nevertheless, MODIS operative surface variable retrieval was reported to be impacted by cloud contamination effects. A proper cloud masking is a major consideration in order to ensure accuracy when analysing Amazonian tropical forests current and future status. In the present study, the potential of supervised machine learning algorithms in order to overcome this issue is evaluated. In front of global operative MODIS cloud masking algorithms (MYD35 and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC)) these algorithms benefit from the fact that they can be optimized to properly represent the local cloud conditions of the region. Models considered were: Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms are able to provide a continuous measure of cloud masking uncertainty (i.e. a probability estimate of each pixel belonging to clear and cloudy class) and therefore can be used for probabilistic cloud masking. Truth reference dataset (a priori knowledge) requirement was satisfied by considering the collocation of Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations with MODIS sensor. Model performance was tested using three independent datasets: 1) collocated CPR/CALIOP and MODIS data, 2) MODIS manually classified images and 3) in-situ ground data. For satellite image and in-situ testing results were additionally compared to current operative MYD35 (version 6.1) and MAIAC cloud masking algorithms. Satellite image and in-situ testing results show that machine learning algorithms are able to improve MODIS operative cloud masking performance over the region. MYD35 and MAIAC tend to underestimate and overestimate the cloud cover over the study region, respectively. Amongst the models considered, probabilistic algorithms (LDA, GNB and in less extent QDA) provided better performance than RF, SVM and MLP machine learning algorithms as they were able to better deal with the viewing conditions limitation that resulted from collocating MODIS and CPR/CALIOP observations. In particular, best performance was obtained for LDA with a difference in Kappa coefficient (model minus MODIS operative algorithm) of 0.293/0.155 (MYD35/MAIAC, respectively) considering satellite image testing validation. Worst performance was obtained for MLP with a difference in Kappa coefficient of 0.175/0.037. For in-situ testing, models overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient values are higher than MYD35/MAIAC respective values. Models are computationally efficient (swath image calculation time between 0.37 and 9.49 s) and thus being able to be implanted for remote-sensing vegetation retrieval processing chains over the Amazonian tropical forests. LDA stands out as the best candidate because of its maximum accuracy and minimum computational associated. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Amazonia; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Optical radar; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarizations; Computationally efficient; Linear discriminant analysis; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Satellite remote sensing; Supervised machine learning; algorithm; cloud cover; computer simulation; evergreen forest; machine learning; MODIS; satellite data; satellite imagery; support vector machine; tropical forest; Learning algorithms","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068638824"

The sensor records a 2D frequency of occurrence matrix of the velocity and power at the mode of each spectrum measured over 1 min. The centroid of the distribution of these modes, along with other spectral parameters, defines a data vector input to a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) for classification of the precipitation type. This requires the a priori determination of a training set for different types, particle size distributions (PSDs), and wind speed conditions. A software model combines POSS system parameters, a particle scattering cross section, and terminal velocity models, to simulate the real-time Doppler signal measured by the system for different PSDs and wind speeds. This is processed in the same manner as the system hardware to produce bootstrap samples of the modal centroid distributions for the MDA training set. MDA results are compared to images from the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) at the MASCRAD site near Easton, Colorado, and to the CSU– CHILL X-band radar observations from Greeley, Colorado.

However, traditional RA-retrieval methods from satellites or the ground are constrained due to the low spatial resolution, illumination conditions, and instrument-associated limitations. In this study, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based oblique photography technology is applied to RA retrieval, aiming to explore the feasibility of UAV to obtain spatially continuous RA data with high spatial resolution and high accuracy. The Monte Carlo method is used to select and optimize the combination of multi-angle observation data of a variety of ground objects obtained by UAV-based oblique photogrammetry. The accuracy and applicability of two BRDF inversion models, namely the linear semi-empirical kernel-driven (LSEKD) model and the non-linear Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) model, are analyzed, and the effects of different sampling window sizes on the BRDF results of various ground objects are compared. The main conclusions are: 1) Oblique photogrammetry is a highly efficient method for RA measurement at the centimeter-level resolution for spatially continuous regions, because it enables cameras with a narrow field of view (FOV) to obtain observation data with a wider viewing angle and more directions, ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the BRDF inversion model, with RMSE in the visible and near-infrared bands are about 0.003 and 0.019 (8–14%); 2) Both the LSEKD and the RPV model are suitable for the inversion of the BRDF with comparable accuracy, but the kernel functions for the LSEKD need to be carefully chosen in advance according to the characteristics of the ground object, while the RPV is adaptive for most objects; 3) The Monte Carlo method can ensure that the multi-angle observation data is distributed evenly in the hemisphere, thus providing the optimal dataset for a high-accuracy BRDF inversion; and 4) The RA of ground objects may change with the change of spatial resolution; the extremely high-resolution RA provides the ability to study ground objects at a finer scale. This study expands the methods for obtaining high-spatial resolution, high-accuracy, and spatially continuous RA. It has significant application potential in areas such as quantitative remote sensing, calibration of high-accurate remote-sensing products, and bridging the scale gap between satellite and ground-collected RA data. © 2021 The Authors","Satellites; image analysis; image resolution; photogrammetry; reflectance; satellite data; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle","BRDF; Reflectance anisotropy; Scale effect; Semi-empirical model; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120686600"

Compared with vertical observation angles, multi-angle remote sensing provides more information on mid to lower parts of the wheat canopy, thereby improving estimates of physical and chemical indicators of the entire canopy. In this study, multi-angle spectral reflectance and the WUE of the wheat canopy were obtained at different growth stages based on field experiments carried out across 4 years using three wheat varieties under different water and nitrogen fertilizer regimes. Using appropriate spectral parameters and sensitive observation angles, the quantitative relationships with wheat WUE were determined. The results revealed that backward observation angles were better than forward angles, while the common spectral parameters Lo and NDDAig were found to be closely related to WUE, although with increasing WUE, both parameters tended to become saturated. Using this data, we constructed a double-ratio vegetation index (NDDAig/FWBI), which we named the water efficiency index (WEI), reducing the impact of different test factors on the WUE monitoring model. As a result, we were able to create a unified monitoring model within an angle range of −20–10°. The equation fitting determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the model were 0.623 and 0.406, respectively, while an independent experiment carried out to test the monitoring models confirmed that the model based on the new index was optimal, with R2, RMSE, and relative error (RE) values of 0.685, 0.473, and 11.847%, respectively. These findings suggest that the WEI is more sensitive to WUE changes than common spectral parameters, while also allowing wide-angle adaptation, which has important implications in parameter design and the configuration of satellite remote sensing and UAV sensors. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Liu, Feng, Song, Li, Liu, Wang and Feng.","","angle adaptability; hyperspectral remote sensing; monitoring model; water use efficiency; winter wheat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104148622"

Therefore, the capability of estimating PM2.5 concentrations at high spatiotemporal resolutions, particularly in places with no ground stations, would be invaluable. Although several studies have involved the estimation of PM2.5, few have estimated PM2.5 concentrations at high spatial resolutions. In this study, we leverage the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and random forest (RF) algorithm to estimate daily 1-km PM2.5 concentrations over Texas from 2014 to 2018. For this purpose, we use collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To address the different sources and speciation of PM2.5 over Texas, we use several important control parameters. As a result, the accuracy of RF remains consistent throughout the study area. After estimating ground-level PM2.5 levels, we apply a ten-fold cross-validation approach to obtain a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.83–0.90 and a mean absolute bias (MAB) of 1.47–1.77 μg/m3. Our results show that RF is highly capable of estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. In addition to the RF model, we also compare the capability of commonly used models, including multiple linear regression (MLR) and mixed effects model (MEM), for estimating the PM2.5 concentrations of global regions. Results indicate that RF, compared to the other models, has the highest accuracy, MEM the second-highest, and MLR the third. We also leverage the USEPA Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) to estimate the impact of changes in PM2.5 levels on the number of respiratory-related premature mortalities in Texas in 2014–2018.

Though considerable progress has been made, for practical settings, there still exist challenges for rotating objects with large aspect ratio, dense distribution and category extremely imbalance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end refined single-stage rotation detector for fast and accurate object detection by using a progressive regression approach from coarse to fine granularity. Considering the shortcoming of feature misalignment in existing refined single-stage detector, we design a feature refinement module to improve detection performance by getting more accurate features. The key idea of feature refinement module is to re-encode the position information of the current refined bounding box to the corresponding feature points through pixel-wise feature interpolation to realize feature reconstruction and alignment. For more accurate rotation estimation, an approximate SkewIoU loss is proposed to solve the problem that the calculation of SkewIoU is not derivable. Experiments on three popular remote sensing public datasets DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD as well as one scene text dataset ICDAR2015 show the effectiveness of our approach.

The multi-angle polarization information is helpful to obtain the spatial distribution of target radiation, and multiple data fusion relies on the non-uniformity calibration of image plane. The non-uniformity consists of many factors such as lens, detector assembly, spatial stray light, etc. The single correction method can not distinguish the error source effectively. In consideration of the in-flight operation mode of DPC based on the adjustment of exposure time, the non-uniformity correction method of the detector based on multi parameters is proposed. Through the electro-optical performance measurement system of the CCD detector, the sensitive factors such as temperature, dark current, exposure time and spectral response are obtained. After a series of preprocessing of the image including removal of dark signal, removal of smearing effect and temperature compensation, the non-uniformity calibration based on multi-parameters is imposed on the detector. The low-frequency unbalanced response difference of the image surface is eliminated, and the high-frequency difference is effectively suppressed. The experimental results show that the photo response non-uniformity of 95% full well single frame data is reduced from 2.86% to 0.36%. After correction, the data noise is shown as shot noise, and the detector has good ability of dynamic range adjustment. The non-uniformity calibration by the proposed method can offer data support for the instrumental calibration and in-flight fast calculation, and provide effective reference for the subsequent polarization remote sensing instruments. © 2021 Optical Society of America.","Calibration; Cameras; Dark currents; Data fusion; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Polarimeters; Polarization; Remote sensing; Stray light; Dynamic range adjustment; Electro optical performance; Nonuniformity correction; Photo response non-uniformity; Polarization sensors; Remote sensing instruments; Temperature compensation; Unbalanced response; Shot noise","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099784474"

A polarization measurement performance test is conducted prior to launching the instrument in the laboratory and outfield. To meet the requirement of an on-orbit measurement, an on-orbit detection method is designed to assess the polarization detection performance of the optical polarization remote sensing instrument with a large field of view. The rapid evaluation of polarization detection performance in full field of view is achieved by analyzing the polarization rainbow data of ocean flares and water clouds in a wide range of complex environments, and the data processing effectiveness of ground application system is verified. The on-orbit polarization detection performance of DPC is consistent with the laboratory and outfield data, which provides an important basis for aerosol and cloud inversion applications.

The equatorial rainforests of Central Africa are the second largest and least disturbed of the biodiversly-rich and highly productive rainforests on Earth. Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge about the phenological behavior and long-term changes that these forests are experiencing. Thus, this study reports on leaf area seasonality and its time trend over the past two decades as assessed from multiple remotely sensed datasets. Seasonal variations of leaf area in Congolese forests derived from MODIS data co-vary with the bimodal precipitation pattern in this region, with higher values during the wet season. Independent observational evidence derived from MISR and EPIC sensors in the form of angular reflectance signatures further corroborate this seasonal behavior of leaf area. The bimodal patterns vary latitudinally within this large region. Two sub-seasonal cycles, each consisting of a dry and wet season, could be discerned clearly. These exhibit different sensitivities to changes in precipitation. Contrary to a previous published report, no widespread decline in leaf area was detected across the entire extent of the Congolese rainforests over the past two decades with the latest MODIS Collection 6 dataset. Long-term precipitation decline did occur in some localized areas, but these had minimal impacts on leaf area, as inferred from MODIS and MISR multi-angle observations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Central Africa; Climate change; Forestry; Radiometers; Changing climate; Congolese rainfor; DSCOVR EPIC; Leaf area; Long-term trend; MISR; Photosynthetic capacity; Remote-sensing; Temporal and spatial variation; Tropical rain forest; forest ecosystem; leaf area index; MISR; MODIS; rainforest; seasonality; Remote sensing","Congolese rainforests; DSCOVR EPIC; Leaf area; Long-term trends; MISR; MODIS; Phenology; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119011081"

Advanced retrieval algorithms have been developed to obtain multiple geophysical parameters in the atmosphere–ocean system. Theoretical pixel-wise retrieval uncertainties based on error propagation have been used to quantify retrieval performance and determine the quality of data products. However, standard error propagation techniques in high-dimensional retrievals may not always represent true retrieval errors well due to issues such as local minima and the nonlinear dependence of the forward model on the retrieved parameters near the solution. In this work, we analyze these theoretical uncertainty estimates and validate them using a flexible Monte Carlo approach. The Fast Multi-Angular Polarimetric Ocean coLor (FastMAPOL) retrieval algorithm, based on efficient neural network forward models, is used to conduct the retrievals and uncertainty quantification on both synthetic HARP2 (Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter 2) and AirHARP (airborne version of HARP2) datasets. In addition, for practical application of the uncertainty evaluation technique in operational data processing, we use the automatic differentiation method to calculate derivatives analytically based on the neural network models. Both the speed and accuracy associated with uncertainty quantification for MAP retrievals are addressed in this study. Pixel-wise retrieval uncertainties are further evaluated for the real AirHARP field campaign data. The uncertainty quantification methods and results can be used to evaluate the quality of data products, as well as guide MAP algorithm development for current and future satellite systems such as NASA’s Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission. © Author(s) 2022.","aerosol; algorithm; atmosphere-ocean system; Monte Carlo analysis; remote sensing; uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137835066"

The Qingyijiang River is the longest branch of lower Yangtze River, the water quality of rivers is influenced by human activities in variety of ways. Taking the Qingyijiang River basin as the research objective, this paper adopted the redundancy analysis (RDA) and Spearman correction analysis to initially explore the impacts of the land utilization and landscape pattern on the water quality, which based on the Google Earth remote sensing data and water quality measurement data. The results are: (1) Among the five buffer scales of 100, 200, 500,1000 and 2000 m established based on sampling point, the landscape composition of the 500 m radius circular buffer zone had the highest interpretation rate of water quality, and the interpretation rates of the low flow period and the high flow period were 46.30% and 43.10%, respectively. (2) In land use types, farmland area and building land area were positively correlated with ammonia nitrogen (NH+4-N), total phosphorus (TP) and electrical conductivity (EC) and produced negative effect on water quality. However, forest land area was positively related to dissolved oxygen (DO), which played a vital role in purifying pollutants. Comprehensive index of the land use was positively related to the polluted indicator, which meant the water quality was increasingly deteriorating in the area with highly intensive human activities. (3) The landscape pattern indexes suggested that patch richness density (PRD) was negatively related to the density of the NH+4-N and TP. The relative indexes were -0.656 and -0.540 respectively, which indicated that the watershed ecosystem became more stable with the increase of PRD. The density of the largest patch index (LPI) was negatively associated with the density of DO in the low flow period, the relative index was -0.656, while area-weighted mean shape index (SHAPE_AM) was positively related to the density of the NH+4-N and TP. The above-mention demonstrated that the growing intensity of human activities would result in the deterioration of water. The relationship between area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension (FRAC_ AM) and water quality can not be well described.Through multi-angle analysis, this study revealed the eco-hydrological processes in the Qingyijiang River watershed, and thus is beneficial to land use management and water quality protection, and sustainable use of resources.

Algorithms for the retrieval of albedo usually require multi-angle measurements due to surface anisotropy. However, most of the satellites cannot currently provide sufficient and well-distributed observations; therefore, the accuracy of remotely sensed albedo is constrained. Based on the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and albedo product (MCD43A1), this study proposed a method to further subdivide reflectance anisotropy and build an updated database of BRDF archetype, using both the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) and Perpendicular Anisotropic Flat Index (PAFX). The BRDF archetypes were used to fit the corresponding MODIS BRDF, and the optimal number of BRDF archetype categories was determined according to the tendency of fitting error. The effect of surface anisotropy and observation noise on albedo retrieval were explored based on simulated MODIS reflectance. Finally, the BRDF archetype A2P2 was taken as prior knowledge to retrieve albedo from a different number of MODIS observations, and the result was validated by the high-quality MODIS albedo product. The results show that the fitting error between BRDF archetypes and MODIS BRDF shows a rapid decline when introducing the PAFX in the classification process. A 3-by-3 matrix of BRDF archetypes, which occupy 73.44% and 70.13% of the total decline in the red and NIR band, can be used to represent the characteristics of reflectance anisotropy.

It can help the demonstration of new satellite missions and the promotion of its application in Earth system science. The comprehensive remote sensing experiment of water cycle and energy balance in the Shandian River (the upper stream of Luan River) integrates the space, airborne and ground based remote sensing technologies to conduct a full-band and active-passive observation of typical elements related to water cycle and energy balance processes of the Earth system. It is aimed to study the spatial-temporal variability and observation strategy of those hydro-thermal elements at various remote sensing scales, to study the remote sensing methodologies of those elements and their application in land surface and hydrology models, and to support the design and feasibility studies of new satellite missions (Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite, Energy Budget Observation Mission) in China.The paper describes the general design of this experiment, its scientific objectives and main compositions including the airborne missions, ground sampling strategies, ground-based observation experiments and key variables measurement through wireless sensor networks. Airborne experiments were conducted to obtain multi-resolution, multi-angle observations of both active and passive microwave together with infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral data. It enables us to explore the remote sensing of various parameters and the impacts of scaling issues, as well as the incidence angle effects associated with the synthetic aperture radiometer system. Ground-based synchronous observation experiments were carried out based on microwave radiometer, radar and spectroradiometer. Concurrent ground data included soil moisture, ground temperature, vegetation water content and surface roughness, etc. are sampled based on large-medium-small quadrats to cover a wide range of land surface conditions. Moreover, ground observation networks were established to monitor meteorological parameters, soil temperature and moisture, surface radiation, evapotranspiration, and precipitation, etc.This experiment provides a unique platform to explore the synergy of active, passive microwave and optical data for water cycle and energy balance remote sensing at improved accuracy and resolution. The experiment overview and preliminary analysis of remote sensing and ground data have confirmed that the data set will help to address a variety of science questions of land-atmosphere energy and water exchanges under global change. © 2021, Science Press.

The campaign took place in October-November 2017 over the western part of the United States. During ACEPOL six different instruments were deployed on the NASA ER-2 high-altitude aircraft, including four multi-angle polarimeters (MAPs): SPEX airborne, the Airborne Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), the Airborne Multi-angle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Also, two lidars participated: the High Spectral Resolution Lidar-2 (HSRL-2) and the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL). Flights were conducted mainly for scenes with low aerosol load over land, but some cases with higher AOD were also observed. We perform aerosol retrievals from SPEX airborne, RSP (410-865nm range only), and AirMSPI using the SRON aerosol retrieval algorithm and compare the results against AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) and HSRL-2 measurements (for SPEX airborne and RSP). All three MAPs compare well against AERONET for the aerosol optical depth (AOD), with a mean absolute error (MAE) between 0.014 and 0.024 at 440nm. For the fine-mode effective radius the MAE ranges between 0.021 and 0.028μm. For the comparison with HSRL-2 we focus on a day with low AOD (0.02-0.14 at 532nm) over the California Central Valley, Arizona, and Nevada (26 October) as well as a flight with high AOD (including measurements with AOD&gt;1.0 at 532nm) over a prescribed forest fire in Arizona (9 November). For the day with low AOD the MAEs in AOD (at 532nm) with HSRL-2 are 0.014 and 0.022 for SPEX and RSP, respectively, showing the capability of MAPs to provide accurate AOD retrievals for the challenging case of low AOD over land. For the retrievals over the smoke plume a reasonable agreement in AOD between the MAPs and HSRL-2 was also found (MAE 0.088 and 0.079 for SPEX and RSP, respectively), despite the fact that the comparison is hampered by large spatial variability in AOD throughout the smoke plume. A good comparison is also found between the MAPs and HSRL-2 for the aerosol depolarization ratio (a measure of particle sphericity), with an MAE of 0.023 and 0.016 for SPEX and RSP, respectively. Finally, SPEX and RSP agree very well for the retrieved microphysical and optical properties of the smoke plume. © 2020 SPIE.

A two-step retrieval approach is developed to retrieve total precipitable water vapor (PWV) abundance: a) the first step is a fast estimate of water vapor obtained by comparing the ratio of observed radiance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands L935nm/L865nm at multiple view angles against pre-calculated lookup table values as a function of PWV abundance, on the assumption of no aerosols and a moderately bright land surface; (b) the second step refines the estimated solution by accounting for aerosol loading, particle properties, and surface reflection, which are retrieved from AirMSPI measurements in its ultraviolet to NIR aerosol bands. Our retrieval is tested using 27 AirMSPI datasets with low to moderately high aerosol loadings and PWV up to about 3.5 cm, acquired during four NASA field campaigns plus one AirMSPI engineering test flight. Comparison of the retrieved total PWV amount against AERONET reference data shows a mean percentage difference 8.6%. The quantities that inform the second step of the PWV retrieval—namely, aerosol optical depth (AOD), aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), and aerosol effective radius—are also compared to the AERONET reference data. The mean absolute differences (MADs) are less than 0.0253 and less than 0.036 for AOD and SSA in the visible, respectively. The MADs are 0.036 μm and 1.232 μm for the effective radius of fine and coarse mode aerosols, respectively.

This produces a positive longwave feedback and has a substantial impact on the Earth's response to warming. This effect is well established by theory, but is poorly constrained by observations, and there is large spread in the feedback strength between climate models. We use the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to examine changes in Cloud-Top-Height (CTH). MISR uses a stereo-imaging technique to determine CTH. This approach is geometric in nature and insensitive to instrument calibration and therefore is well suited for trend analysis and studies of variability on long time scales. In this article we show that the current MISR record does have an increase in CTH for high-altitude cloud over Southern Hemisphere (SH) oceans but not over Tropical or the Northern Hemisphere (NH) oceans. We use climate model simulations to estimate when MISR might be expected to detect trends in CTH, that include the NH. The analysis suggests that according to the models used in this study MISR should detect changes over the SH ocean earlier than the NH, and if the model predictions are correct should be capable of detecting a trend over the Tropics and NH very soon (3–10 years). This result highlights the potential value of a follow-on mission to MISR, which no longer maintains a fixed equator crossing time and is unlikely to be making observations for another 10 years. © 2022.

The biophysical and biochemical parameters of vegetation retrieved from satellite observations have been extensively used in global vegetation monitoring and Earth system modeling. So far, most of the remote sensing data used for vegetation-related applications are from sensors onboard American or European satellites. From the users’ perspective, it would be beneficial to have well-calibrated science-quality Earth observation data from a diverse sources that can not only secure data continuity in case of sensor retirement or failure, but also enable multi-sensor research opportunities such as data fusion or multi-angle remote sensing. In this regard, it is worth exploring the usefulness of the Chinese Earth Observation Satellites (CEOSs) for remote sensing of vegetation. Here we reviewed the recent progress in using the CEOSs data for retrieving key vegetation parameters. We focused on the uncertainty and limitation in using the CEOSs by critically examining the available studies conducted on different vegetation types. We also made recommendations on research opportunities in combining CEOSs data with the existing data from other space agencies. The hope is to offer the community an up-to-date overview of what could be useful to their specific applications by leveraging the orbiting and the planned CEOSs sensors. In addition, critical evaluations from the community are expected to feed back and lead to improved CEOSs data in the future. © 2022 The Author(s)","Earth (planet); Observatories; Orbits; Satellites; Sensor data fusion; Vegetation; Data continuity; Earth observation satellites; Earth system dynamic; Earth systems; Global change; Multi-sensor fusion; Remote sensing of vegetation; Remote-sensing; Satellite data; System Dynamics; EOS; global change; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite sensor; vegetation type; Remote sensing","Data continuity; Earth system dynamics; Global change; Multi-sensor fusion; Remote sensing of vegetation","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145667675"

The effect of these climate changes on the forest remains unresolved, because field observations on functional traits are sparse in time and space, and the results from remote sensing analyses are divergent. Then, we analyzed the drought response in a ‘terra firme’ forest fragment in the southwestern Amazonia, during an extreme drought event influenced by ENSO episode (2015/2017), focusing on stem growth, litter production, functional traits and forest canopy dynamics. We use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), corrected by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) to generate the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and green chromatic coordinate (Gcc) vegetation indices. We monitor stem growth and measure the functional traits of trees in situ, such as the potential at which the plant loses 50% of hydraulic conductivity (P50 ), turgor loss point (πTLP), hydraulic safety margin (HSM) and isohydricity. Our results suggest that: (a) during the dry season, there is a smooth reduction in EVI values (browning) and an increase in the wet season (greening); (b) in the dry season, leaf flush occurs, when the water table still has a quota at the limit of the root zone; (c) the forest showed moderate resistance to drought, with water as the primary limiting factor, and the thickest trees were the most resistant; and (d) a decline in stem growth post-El-Niño 2015/2016 was observed, suggesting that the persistence of negative rainfall anomalies may be as critical to the forest as the drought episode itself. © 2022 by the authors.

The increasing availability of finer-resolution (≤ 30 m) remote sensing data makes this possible. However, data from different satellites have large differences in spatial resolution, spectral response function, and so on, making joint use difficult. Herein, we showed that the vegetation index (VI)-based mixture model with the appropriate VI values of pure vegetation (Vv) and bare soil (Vs) from the MODIS BRDF product via the multi-angle VI method (MultiVI) was feasible to estimate FVC with multiple satellite data. Analyses of the spatial resolution and spectral response function differences for MODIS and other satellites including Landsat 8, Chinese GF 1, and ZY 3 predicted that (1) the effect of Vv and Vs downscaling on FVC estimation uncertainty varied from satellite to satellite due to the positioning differences, and (2) after spectral normalization, the uncertainty (RMSDs) for FVC estimation decreased by ~2.6% compared with the results without spectral normalization. FVC estimation across multiple satellite data will help to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of FVC products, which is an important development for numerous biophysical applications.

However, passenger aircraft may be an alternative remote sensing platform in emergency response due to the high revisit rate, dense coverage and low cost. This paper introduces a volunteered passenger aircraft remote sensing method (VPARS) for emergency response. It uses the images captured by the passenger volunteers during flight. Based on computer vision algorithms and geocoding procedures, these images can be processed into a mosaic orthoimage for rapid ground disaster mapping. Notable, due to the relatively low flight latitude, small clouds can be easily removed by stacking multi-angle tilt images in the VPARS method. A case study on the 2019 Guangdong flood monitoring validates these advantages. The frequent aircraft revisit time, intensive flight coverage, multi-angle images and low cost of the VPARS make it a potential way to complement traditional remote sensing methods in emergency response. © 2019 by the authors.

With respect to the multi-angle features of object orientation in HSRIs object detection, this paper presents a novel HSRIs object detection method based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with adaptive object orientation features. First, an adaptive object orientation regression method is proposed to obtain object regions in any direction. In the adaptive object orientation regression method, five coordinate parameters are used to regress the object region with any direction. Then, a CNN framework for object detection of HSRIs is designed using the adaptive object orientation regression method. Using multiple object detection datasets, the proposed method is compared with some state-of-the-art object detection methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method can more accurately detect objects with large aspect ratios and densely distributed objects than some state-of-the-art object detection methods using a horizontal bounding box, and obtain better object detection results for HSRIs. © 2022 by the authors.

Remote sensing indices are constructed from individual bands depending on special characteristics to enhance the typical spectral features for the identification or distinction of surface land covers. With the development of quantitative remote sensing, there is a rapidly increasing require-ment for accurate data processing and modeling. It is well known that the geometry-induced variation observed on surface reflectance is not ignorable, but the situation of uncertainty thereby introduced into these indices still needs further detailed understanding. We adopted the ground multi-angle hyperspectrum, spectral response function (SRF) of Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS), and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) optical sensors and simulated their sensor-like spectral reflectance; then, we investigated the potential angle effect uncertainty on optical indices that have been frequently involved in vegetation monitoring and examined the for-ward/backward effect over both the ground-based level and the actual Landsat TM/ETM+ overlapped region. Our results on the discussed indices and sensors show the following: (1) Identifiable angle effects exist with a more elevated influence than that introduced by band difference among sensors; (2) The absolute difference of forward and backward direction can reach up to-0.03 to 0.1 within bands of the TM/ETM+ overlapped region; (3) The investigation at ground level indicates that there are different variations of angle effect transmitted to each remote sensing index. Regarding cases of crop canopy at various growth phases, most of the discussed indices have more than a 20% relative difference in nadir value except Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), at less than 10%, and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) at less than 16%. For the case of wax maturity stage, the relative difference in nadir value of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Char Soil Index (CSI), NBR, Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and SWIR2/NIR exceeded 50%, among which the values for NBR and NDMI reached up to 115.8% and 206.7%, re-spectively; (4) Various schemes of index construction imply different developments of angle effect uncertainty. The “difference” indices can partially suppress the directional influence, while the “ratio” indices show high potential to amplify the angle effect. This study reveals that the angle-induced uncertainty of these indices is greater than that induced by the spectrum mismatch among sensors, especially under the senescence period. In addition, based on this work, indices with a suppressed potential of angle effect are recommended for vegetation monitoring or information retrieval to avoid unexpected effects. © 2021 by the authors.

Through the methods of field experiments, remote sensing image, radiation transfer model and mathematical models, this study established the LAI inversion model of random forest model based on PROSPECT+SAIL (scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model-PROSAIL model and multi-angle PROBA/CHRIS (project for on-board autonomy/compact high resolution imaging spectrometer) remote sensing data. The sensitivity analysis and applicability evaluation of PROSAIL model were carried out, and the optimal LAI inversion model was also determined. The accuracies were verified and evaluated by the ground measured LAI values.【Result】The sensitivity of input parameters of the PROSAIL model was LAI>Cab (chlorophyll a and b content)>Cm (leaf dry matter content)>SL (hotspot parameters)>N (blade internal structure parameters)>Cw (equivalent water thickness). The accuracy of the canopy reflectance simulated by the PROSAIL model was 0°> 36°>-36°>55°>-55°. In the single angle LAI inversion models, the accuracy of forward observation angle 55° was the highest, and the R2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE(root mean square error) and MAPE(mean absolute percentage error) were 0.915 7, 0.235 7 and 0.042 6, respectively. Compared with the traditional vertical observation, the R2 of the 55° model increased by 0.75%, and the RMSE and MAPE decreased by 3.76% and 5.12%, respectively. Compared with the nonlinear regression model, the R2 of the 55° model increased by 0.7%, and the RMSE and MAPE decreased by 15.40% and 11.98%, respectively. The accuracy of single angle inversion models was 55°>36°>0°>-55°>-36°. In the LAI inversion models based on the multi-angle data, the three angles combination of 0°, 36° and 55° had the highest accuracy with the R2, RMSE and MAPE of 0.918 4, 0.231 9 and 0.041 5, respectively. Compared with single angle 55°, the R2 of the three angles combination model increased by 0.29%, and the RMSE and MAPE decreased by 1.61% and 2.58%, respectively. Compared with the traditional vertical observation, the R2 of the three angles combination model increased by 1.05%, and the RMSE and MAPE decreased by 5.31% and 7.57%, respectively. Compared with the nonlinear regression model, the R2 of the three angle combination model increased by 0.79%, and the RMSE and MAPE increased by 6.72% and 9.19%, respectively. The LAI in the western region of Mount Zijin was between 0.44 and 6.70, and the average LAI of forest was 3.04. The spatial distribution pattern of LAI in the western woodland of Mount Zijin showed ""high in the north and south and low in the middle"" as a whole. 【Conclusion】The optimal LAI inversion model was the random forest LAI inversion model based on three angles combination (0°, 36°, 55°). On the one hand, increasing the observation angle can provide more information about vegetation crown structure, and the inversion accuracy of LAI will increase with the increase of observation angle. However, on the other hand, too many observation angles will lead to more uncertainty in pixel space resampling, leaf shadow, soil shadow and so on, and the accuracy of LAI inversion will decrease. No matter single angle and multi-angle data, the accuracy of random forest LAI inversion model was higher than that of nonlinear regression model, which indicated that the random forest model can obviously improve the inversion accuracy of LAI and was suitable for the inversion of LAI on the regional scale. Multi-angle remote sensing data can reflect the three-dimensional structure information of vegetation and the characteristics of multi-dimensional spatial structure of ground objects, and significantly improve the low accuracy of LAI inversion by traditional vertical observation, thus effectively improve the inversion accuracy of vegetation LAI. © 2021, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

Over the last two decades, solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations from remote sensing have been used to evaluate the distribution of GPP over a range of spatial and temporal scales. However, both PRI and SIF observations have been decoupled from photosynthesis under a variety of non-physiological factors, i.e., sun-view geometry and environmental variables. These observations are important for estimating GPP but rarely reported in the literature. In our study, multi-angle PRI and SIF observations were obtained during the 2018 growing season in a maize field. We evaluated a PRI-based LUE model for estimating GPP, and compared it with the direct estimation of GPP using concurrent SIF measurements. Our results showed that the observed PRI varied with view angles and that the averaged PRI from the multi-angle observations exhibited better performance than the single-angle observed PRI for estimating LUE. The PRI-based LUE model when compared to SIF, demonstrated a higher ability to capture the diurnal dynamics of GPP (the coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.71) than the seasonal changes (R2 = 0.44), while the seasonal GPP variations were better estimated by SIF (R2 = 0.50). Based on random forest analyses, relative humidity (RH) was the most important driver affecting diurnal GPP estimation using the PRI-based LUE model. The SIF-based linear model was most influenced by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The SIF-based linear model did not perform as well as the PRI-based LUE model under most environmental conditions, the exception being clear days (the ratio of direct and diffuse sky radiance > 2). Our study confirms the utility of multi-angle PRI observations in the estimation of GPP in LUE models and suggests that the effects of changing environmental conditions should be taken into account for accurately estimating GPP with PRI and SIF observations. © 2020 by the authors.

The hotspot signature is an important characteristic of the BRDF shapes and is commonly quantified by two degrees of freedom: the hotspot height and width near the hotspot direction. This research aimed to correct the hotspot effect of the Ross-Li BRDF model for potential users by correcting the Ross and Li kernels with an exponential function of two hotspot parameters (C1/C2). This method has been developed in previous studies, but it was comprehensively applied to other kernel functions in the current study. Given the gap between leaves in the canopy, we corrected the overlap function of GO kernel with hotspot function. We analyzed the two hotspot parameters for the Ross-Li model by using the entire archive of POLDER BRDF database. First, we used six combinations of Ross and Li kernels to fit a typical single POLDER data for a specific analysis. We also analyzed the sensitivity of C1/C2 for these model combinations using the single POLDER pixel. Second, we used the entire POLDER dataset and acquired the optimum values of the hotspot parameters by using the root mean square error (RMSE) method. Finally, we analyzed the sensibility of the hotspot parameter in each model using 2D contour plots that distinctly show the variations in RMSEs as functions of C1 and C2. (1) The proposed hotspot parameterization method could be used to various combination models of Ross and Li kernels. The model with such a hotspot correction method improved the fitting ability of the hotspot signature better than the original model. (2) The optimum values of two hotspot parameters were significantly different between models, especially for the two geometric optical kernels, namely, LiSparseRChen (LSRC) and LiDenseRChen (LDRC). The value of C1 parameters in the LDRC models was generally smaller than that in the LSRC models. The possible reason could be that the LDRC kernel function modeled the hotspot effect on the canopy scale accurately, such that the role of the hotspot parameters (especially for C1) was secondary in this situation. (3) In general, the value of the C1 parameter in a single model was more sensitive to the variation in hotspot effect than the C2 parameter. This study comprehensively corrects the hotspot effect of the Ross-Li model for various applications for potential users who pay attention to the hotspot signatures of their applications. This study is also valuable for domestic multi-angle satellites in accurately reconstructing future hotspot signatures from multi-angle observations. © 2019, Science Press.

This study attempted to retrieve ALH using the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), a single passive imager onboard Himawari-8 and -9. ALH retrieval using geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites is advantageous for monitoring diurnal changes in ALH and understanding long-range transport. Before retrieving the ALH, the aerosol optical properties (AOPs) are retrieved using the green-near infrared (NIR) band, which is relatively insensitive to aerosol height. The retrieved AOPs are used as input to the radiative transfer calculation to compute the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of a highly sensitive band (the blue band in this study). Then, the ALH is retrieved using the observed and calculated TOA reflectances. Since the retrieval accuracy of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is better over the ocean, the retrieval was performed only over the ocean during the Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) campaign period.

Molecular oxygen A-band (758–778 nm) and water vapor absorption band (758–880 nm) are two bands with similar wavelengths, and the hyperspectral remote sensing information of these two bands can be exploited to invert the vertical profile of aerosol and water vapor. In this paper, a double-grating spectrometer system (DGSS) was developed. DGSS uses a telescope system and fiber to introduce multi-angle, double-band sunlight, and it splits light synchronously (non-sequentially) to different positions of the detector through a slit plate and two gratings. The DGSS was calibrated in the laboratory and observed in the external field. The results indicated that the spectral resolution reached 0.06 nm (molecular oxygen A-band, 758–778 nm) and 0.24 nm (water vapor absorption band, 758–880 nm). Meanwhile, the spectra of the two bands (three angles in each band) are not aliased on the detector. Besides, the multi-angle simultaneous observation of the high-resolution spectra of the two bands is realized, which proves the effectiveness of this method. This study will provide a scientific basis for the observation of aerosol, water vapor, and cloud ground-based networks. © 2022 by the authors.

China has been experiencing dramatic changes in air pollution over the past two decades. Statistically deriving ground-level PM2.5 from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been an emerging attempt to provide such PM2.5 data for environmental monitoring and PM2.5-related epidemiologic study. However, current countrywide datasets in China have generally lower accuracies with lower spatiotemporal resolutions because surface PM2.5 level was rarely recorded in historical years (i.e., preceding 2013). This study aimed to reconstruct daily ambient PM2.5 concentrations from 2000 to 2018 over China at a fine scale of 1 km using advanced satellite datasets and ground measurements. Taking advantage of the newly released Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) 1-km AOD dataset, we developed a novel statistical strategy by establishing an advanced spatiotemporal model relying on adaptive model structures with linear and non-linear predictors. The estimates in historical years were validated against surface observations using a strict leave-one-year-out cross-validation (CV) technique. The overall daily leave-one-year-out CV R2 and root-mean-square-deviation values were 0.59 and 27.18 μg/m3, respectively. The resultant monthly (R2 = 0.74) and yearly (0.77) mean predictions were highly consistent with surface measurements. The national PM2.5 levels experienced a rapid increase in 2001-2007 and significantly declined between 2013 and 2018. Most of the discernable decreasing trends occurred in eastern and southern areas, while air quality in western China changed slightly in the recent two decades. Our model can deliver reliable historical PM2.5 estimates in China at a finer spatiotemporal resolution than previous approaches, which could advance epidemiologic studies on the health impacts of both short- and long-term exposure to PM2.5 at both a large and a fine scale in China.

The satellite-based AOD datasets have been typically used in many studies for the estimation of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentration in the tropospheric region. The prime focus of this study is to review the past studies to analyze the performance of various satellite-based AOD datasets and models used for PM estimation. The review results suggest that every satellite sensors data have some specific capabilities as well as some drawbacks. Multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) datasets showed better consistency in AOD and PM estimation in comparison to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets. In the context of PM estimation models’ accuracy, the mixed-effect model (MEM) has been extensively used and found to be more consistent in general, whereas, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model outperforms other statistical regression models in regional scale. Incorporation of land use parameters along with meteorological parameters improves the PM estimation accuracy at various spatial scale. The review suggests that in the near future, high resolution (spatial and temporal) satellite data with the improved algorithms will be highly appreciable for accurate estimation of AOD and PM. © 2020, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.","","Aerosol optical depth (AOD); Particulate matter (PM); Remote sensing; Satellite data","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090304502"

Deep CNN-based models showed great advantages over many traditional methods, even so, there are still many specific problems in the application of certain scenarios. In very high resolution (VHR) remote-sensing image datasets, the uncertainty of the object direction angle causes big trouble to the learning of the detector. Although the pooling operation can slightly alleviate the deviation caused by small angle, the feature learning of the objects with larger angle rotation still relies mainly on the sufficiency of sample data or effective data augmentation, which means the insufficiency of the training instances may cause serious performance degradation of the detector. In this paper, we propose a multi-angle box-based rotation insensitive object detection structure (MRI-CNN), which is an extended exploration for typical region-based CNN methods. On the one hand, we defined a set of directionally rotated bounding boxes before learning, and restricted the classification scene in a small angular range by rotated RoI (Region of Interest) pooling. On the other hand, we proposed a more effective screening method of bounding boxes, enabling the detector to adapt to diverse ground truth annotation methods and learn more accurate object localization. We trained our detector with different datasets containing different amount of training data, and the test results showed that the method proposed in this paper performs better than some mainstream detection methods when limited training data are provided in VHR remote-sensing datasets. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Rotation; Annotation methods; Convolutional neural network; Limited training data; Object localization; Performance degradation; Region of interest; Remote sensing images; Very high resolution; artificial neural network; data set; detection method; remote sensing; resolution; satellite imagery; ship technology; Object detection","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077509999"

However, the spatial resolution of retrieved LSTs are relatively coarse, and most of them are mixed pixel. The spatiotemporal variability and angle effects of LSTs limit the accuracy of many scientific studies, including land surface process study. The ENVI-met model is coupled with the RAPID model to quantitatively evaluate the effects of three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous scenes on brightness temperature and brightness temperature distribution. The key to model coupling is to maintain the consistency of the scene. The component temperature output of the ENVI-met model is used as the component temperature input parameter of the RAPID model. The surface temperature distribution of the 3D scene is simulated on the basis of the reanalysis data. The global numerical forecast product called NCEP is used to provide the boundary conditions required by ENVI-met, and the horizontal temperature distribution and the thermal radiation directionality simulation test of heterogeneous scenes were carried out. In the horizontal distribution simulation study, the onboard G-LiHT data (optical imagery, Lidar data, LST observation) provides 3D scene construction input parameters and temperature field verification data. Six different heterogeneity scenes in a certain wetland area in the United States were taken as examples for the simulation and verification in this study. Moreover, the impact of broadcast direction, road, and spatial heterogeneity on the simulation results were analyzed. In the simulation study of thermal radiation directivity, a three-dimensional scene is constructed on the basis of airborne WiDAS multiangle, multispectral data. Moreover, two heterogeneous scenes in Heihe region are taken as examples for simulation and verification. Results show that the bright temperature value from the vertical observation angle obtained by simulation is close to the LST bright temperature value of G-LiHT (RMSE is 1.1K), indicating that the coupled model can effectively simulate the bright temperature distribution under different spatial heterogeneities. Bare soil simulation error is the largest (2.31K), broadcast direction has minimal effect on the simulation (less than 1.2K), and the road width affects the simulation results (approximately 1 K). The simulation accuracy of the coupled model will decrease with the increase in spatial heterogeneity. The multi-angle simulation results of the coupled model are consistent with the variation of the directional brightness temperature in the WiDAS dataset with the viewing angle, but differences in the rate and magnitude of the change are observed. The simulation method used in this work can be utilized to predict the thermal radiation directionality of the land surface during satellite transit. © 2020, Science Press.

The fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AODf) is an important parameter for estimating the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter little than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Compared to the ground-based observations, AODf products from satellite remote sensing have an advantage of high spatial coverage, which is suitable for monitoring the air quality at a regional or global scale. Up to now, AODf products have been released by several sensors, such as the single-angle multi-spectral intensity sensor MODIS and multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensor POLDER, then what're the different performances of AODf products from them? In this study, the different spatial resolution AODf products respectively from MODIS latest Collection 6.1 (C6.1, 3 and 10 km) and POLDER latest level 2 version 1.01 (L2, 18 km) were firstly compared with each other in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) domains. Then those products were validated against the ground-based AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements, where has been suffering the severe air pollution since decades ago. The comparison of yearly averaged AODf products between MODIS and POLDER shows a good consistency on the spatial distribution, the higher spatial resolution products of MODIS show more details, both low values of AODf appeared in the northwest area with small population and industry, high values appeared in the southeast area with lots of cities, industries, and large population. However, the whole yearly AODf average values of MODIS are higher than that of POLDER. The results of validation against AERONET show that the accuracy of AODf products at 865 nm from POLDER (R Combining double low line 0.94, RMSE Combining double low line 0.05) is high than that at 550 nm of MODIS (3 km: R Combining double low line 0.69, RMSE Combining double low line 0.32; 10 km: R Combining double low line 0.76, RMSE Combining double low line 0.3). In this study, the performance of different spatial resolutions AODf products retrieved from the intensity (MODIS 3 and 10 km) and polarized sensors (POLDER 18 km) were evaluated. Those results not only have a great significance to provide users amore appropriate choice of the AODf products in the BTH region but also display that the accuracy and spatial resolution of MODIS and POLDER AODf products need to be improved. © 2020 Authors.","Aerosols; Air quality; Image resolution; Optical properties; Remote sensing; AERONET; Aerosol optical depths; Comparison; MODIS; POLDER; Tianjin; Validation; Radiometers","AERONET; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; Comparison; Fine-mode Aerosol Optical Depth; MODIS; POLDER; Validation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081543999"

However, the spatiotemporal relationship between AODs and PM2.5 still lacks a comprehensive investigation, especially in some regions with severe pollution within China. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal relationships between several satellite AODs and the near-surface PM2.5 concentration across China and its 14 representative regions during 2016–2018 using the correlation coefficient (R), the PM2.5/AOD ratio (η), the geo-detector (q), and the different aerosol-dominated regimes. The results showed that the MODIS AOD from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm strongly correlates with PM2.5 (R > 0.6) in China, particularly in the Chengyu (CY), Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions. The close correlations (R = 0.7) exist between PM2.5 and MODIS and VIIRS AOD from the deep blue (DB) algorithm in the CY, BTH, and YRD regions. Under the key aerosols affecting China (e.g., sulfate and dust), there is a strong correlation (R > 0.5) between the PM2.5 and MODIS and VIIRS AODs from the MAIAC and DB algorithms, with the higher concentration of ground-level PM2.5 per unit of these AODs (η > 130). The MAIAC AOD (Terra/Aqua) can better explain the spatial distribution (q > 0.4) of PM2.5 than those of AODs from the dark target (DT) and DB algorithms applied to the MODIS over China and its specific regions across seasons. The performance of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) AOD (R > 0.5, q > 0.3) was close to that of the MAIAC AOD during the spring and summer; however, it was far less than the MAIAC AOD in the autumn and winter seasons.

Previous studies using remote sensing to model Arctic vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties have generally involved empirical modelling with nadir looking broadband sensors and have typically been conducted at the field scale in one study area. Satellite hyperspectral remote sensing has not been previously investigated for retrieving leaf and canopy biochemical and biophysical properties of Arctic vegetation across multiple sites using either empirical or physically-based modelling approaches. Furthermore, multi-angle hyperspectral sensors (CHRIS/PROBA), which can provide insight into vegetation reflectance anisotropy and potentially improve vegetation parameter estimation, have also not been investigated for this purpose. In this study, three modelling approaches previously investigated with field spectroscopy data (Kennedy et al., 2020) were used with CHRIS Mode-1 imagery to predict leaf chlorophyll content, plant area index and canopy chlorophyll content across a bioclimatic gradient in the Western Canadian Arctic. Modelling approaches included: parametric linear regression based on vegetation indices (VI), non-parametric machine learning Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using a look-up table approach (LUT). CHRIS imagery was acquired with −55◦, −36◦, 0◦, +36◦, +55◦ view zenith angles (VZA) between 2011 and 2014 over three field sites extending from the Richardson Mountains in central Yukon, Canada to the north end of Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Field measurements were acquired within several weeks of satellite acquisitions. GPR had the best model fit (mean cross-validated (cv ) coefficient of determination, r2 cv = 0.61 across all vegetation variables, sites and VZAs vs. 0.59 for the simple ratio, SR) and predictive performance (normalized root mean square error, NRMSEcv = 0.13 vs. 0.14 for SR). The revised optimized soil adjusted VI (ROSAVI) performance was slightly poorer (r2 cv = 0.51; NRMSEcv = 0.15). The physically-based PROSAIL model performed poorer than all empirical models (r2 = 0.50; NRMSE = 0.18). This ranking of model performance is similar to that found in the previous field spectroscopy study, where empirical model fits and predictive performance were only slightly worse. With respect to view angle performance, NRMSE varied only slightly, indicating no distinct advantage for any one VZA. Overall, strong potential has been demonstrated for empirical modelling of Arctic vegetation chlorophyll and plant area index using hyperspectral data combined with band selection/optimization procedures in the Arctic.

In the inversion of soil moisture using passive microwave remote sensing technology, soil roughness is the most critical factor restricting the accuracy of the inversion algorithm. Multi-angle remote sensing data has certain advantages in obtaining surface roughness information. Therefore, multi-angle passive microwave observation data has greater application potential in soil moisture inversion. At present, there are few studies on how to use multi-angle passive microwave data to reduce the effect of roughness on soil moisture inversion. Therefore, this study explored the application method of multi-angle passive microwave remote sensing data in soil moisture inversion by analyzing the multi-angle simulated data of soil microwave emissivity. In this study, the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) was used to simulate the multi-angle microwave radiation of the soil with different Soil Moisture Content (SMC) and roughness. The Brewster angle was calculated based on the trend of the V polarized emissivity with observation angle. The calculation results of Brewster angle showed that Brewster angles of soils with different moisture content distributed in the range of 60°-80°. Based on analysis of the simulated data, Brewster angle had a good consistency with SMC while Brewster angle was not sensitive to parameters such as soil temperature, soil bulk density, and soil roughness. The Brewster angle would change by 15° with SMC changed from 0.05 cm3/cm3 to 0.40 cm3/cm3. When the root mean square height of soil roughness increased from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm, the Brewster angle value increased with the increase of roughness, but the maximum change in angle did not exceed 2°. When the bulk density of the soil changed from 0.9 g/cm3 to 1.4 g/cm3, the Brewster angle value increased by no more than 1°. The soil temperature changed from 10℃ to 35℃, and the Brewster angle changed with the increase of soil temperature. When the root mean square height of the soil roughness and the soil bulk density were combined with different values, the maximum change of Brewster angle did not exceed 2°. This showed that the total influence of soil roughness and soil bulk density on Brewster angle had no obvious accumulation of errors. This study presented an algorithm for inversion of SMC by using the Brewster angle information of soil microwave radiation. Through the analysis of simulated data, a good linear relationship between the tangent value of Brewster angle and SMC was found. The regression results based on simulated data showed that the coefficient of linear fitness between the tangent of Brewster angle and SMC was 0.94, and the root mean square error was 0.027 cm3/cm3. The verification results based on simulated data showed that the coefficient of determination between predicted value of SMC and theoretical value was 0.95, and the root mean square error was 0.024 cm3/cm3. The inversion algorithm proposed here had robust characteristics for different types of soil roughness autocorrelation functions. The prediction accuracy of the algorithm for SMC was little affected by the roughness autocorrelation functions. For different types of roughness autocorrelation functions, the root mean square error between the predicted value of SMC and the theoretical value was 0.023-0.027 cm3/cm3. The SMC inversion algorithm based on Brewster angle utilized the relative change of multi-angle soil emissivity rather than its absolute value and this research provided a novel research idea for the inversion of SMC by using multi-angle passive microwave remote sensing data. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Multi-angle remote sensing allows us to exclude the skipping of objects masked and laid at an angle and to separate the soil containing anomaly objects from ordinary soil and surface irregularities. The concept of an optical-digital complex for minefield mapping is given, the main basis of which is a hyperspectral device that receives data from two optical channels with divided them into the tens spectral channels in the longwave infrared range. One optic channel scans the nadir and the second channel scans at an angle to the soil surface. The complex also includes a camera of the visible range, receiving a series of images in different spatial planes for further three-dimensional reconstruction. A method for obtaining and combining segmented hyperspectral data with a reconstructed digital terrain model is described for solving the problems of detection of hidden ground and subsurface objects, reconnaissance, and planning of humanitarian demining missions on terrain with different slopes of relief.

The atmospheric up- and downwelling radiances and transmittance can be accurately modelled using radiative transfer models and profiles of relative humidity and temperature, either measured by radiosonde probes or retrieved from assimilating weather models. The estimation of ∊ is a large source of uncertainty in the resulting LST product, and there are various approaches using multi-angle observations, multispectral optical or multispectral thermal infrared imagery. In this paper, the estimation of LST from the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on board Landsat 8 is evaluated using more than 6 years of in situ temperature measurements from a network of 14 Autonomous Weather Stations (AWS) in Belgium. ∊ is estimated from concomitant atmospherically corrected imagery from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) using two new neural network approaches trained on ECOSTRESS spectra, and an established NDVI based method. Results are compared to using ∊=1 and the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset. LST retrievals from L8/TIRS perform well for all emissivity data sources for >500 matchups with AWS subsoil temperature measurements: Mean Differences 0.8–3.7 K and unbiased Root Mean Squared Differences of 2.9–3.5 K for both B10 and B11. The use of unity emissivity gives the best results in terms of MD (0.8 K) and unb-RMSD (3 K). Similar ranges of unb-RMSD are found for >500 matchups with broadband radiometer temperatures (2.6–3.1 K), that have lower absolute MD values (−2.2–0.6 K). For the radiometer temperatures, both the neural net approaches gave lowest MD, in the best case ±0.1 K. The present investigation can hence recommend the neural nets to derive ∊ for the retrieval of LST over the AWS in Belgium. Using published matchup results from other authors however, no single source of ∊ data performed better than ∊=1, but this could be due to their low number of matchups. Further efforts for estimating representative pixel average emissivities are needed, and establishing a denser in situ measurement network over varied land use, with rather homogeneous land cover within a TIRS pixel, may aid further validation of a per pixel and per scene ∊ estimates from multispectral imagery. AWS data seems valuable for evaluation of satellite LST, with the advantage of a much lower cost and higher potential matchup density compared to conventional radiometers. © 2020","Belgium; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Electromagnetic wave emission; Infrared detectors; Infrared radiation; Land use; Neural networks; Pixels; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Soils; Surface measurement; Temperature measurement; Atmospheric parameters; Multi-angle observations; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral thermal infrared imagery; Operational land imager; Radiative transfer model; Relative humidity and temperatures; Thermal infrared sensors; ASTER; emissivity; estimation method; land cover; land surface; multispectral image; NDVI; pixel; radiometer; relative humidity; remote sensing; satellite; satellite imagery; soil temperature; subsoil; Land surface temperature","Atmospheric correction; Emissivity; Landsat 8; Neural network; OLI; Surface temperature; Thermal infrared; TIRS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087592299"

The in-flight cross calibration is data transmission through time matching, space matching, and spectral matching of two polarization instruments on the same platform, and this method can not only complete the data transfer without considering the surface type to reduce the calibration cycle but also can obtain huge and rich calibration data. The radiometer is the particulate observing scanning polarimeter (POSP), which takes multi-angle, photo-polarimetric measurements in several spectral channels. The POSP measurements in the bands of 670nm and 865nm used in this work are simultaneously measured by the simultaneous imaging polarization camera (SIPC), which is on the same aircraft. The POSP is designed to provide high precision measurements of the atmospheric or earth surface radiation polarization with a substantial along-track spatial coverage, while the SIPC can provide large spatial coverage and high-resolution measurements. Through radiometer-to-imager in-flight cross calibration, the high-precision calibration coefficient of the POSP is transmitted to the SIPC, which can effectively improve the measurement accuracy of the SIPC, and realizes the remote sensing monitoring of atmospheric fine particles with large spatial coverage and high detection precision. First, we deduce the polarization models of the POSP and the SIPC, respectively, and express them in the form of Mueller matrixes, which describe the transformation from incoming polarized radiation to measured signals. Then, we deduce the in-flight cross calibration model of the POSP and the SIPC. Finally, the in-flight experiments have been carried out to validate the radiometer-to-imager in-flight cross calibration model. The results have shown the possibility to minimize the SIPC polarization degree errors with a roughly 0.01 bias relative to POSP on the land. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","Aircraft; Data transfer; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Atmospheric fine particles; High-precision calibration; High-precision measurement; High-resolution measurements; Measurement accuracy; Polarimetric measurements; Remote sensing monitoring; Simultaneous imaging; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083290649"

However, a large amount of the AOD data obtained by satellite remote sensing are missing due to cloud cover and other factors. To obtain AOD data with continuous distribution in space, this study considers the spatial and temporal correlation of AOD and proposes a spatio-temporal weighted filling method based on a sliding window to supply the missing AOD data blocks. The method uses the semivariogram and autocorrelation function to judge the spatial and temporal correlation of AOD and uses the AOD spatial autocorrelation threshold as the sliding window size, and then it builds a spatio-temporal weighted model for each window to fill in the missing values. We selected the area with full values for simulation. The results show that the accuracy of this method has been significantly improved compared with the mean filling method. The R2 reaches 0.751, the RMSE is 0.021, and the filling effect is smoother. Finally, this method was used to fill in the missing values of the MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region in 2019, and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD was used as the true value for testing. The results show that the filled AOD has a high correlation with AERONET AOD, the R2 is 0.785, and the RMSE is 0.120.

Further, to correct the effects of aerosols, a correction formula for TOA polarization was proposed; the t test was used to verify the significance of the new quadratic term of the correction formula. Finally, the correction coefficient lookup table for solar zenith angles was established to calculate the simulated degree of polarization. Using polarization data obtained from the radiance observed by POLDER 3, the relative error was verified to be less than 2%.

To ensure the validity of the DPC on-orbit multiangle and multispectral polarization data, high-precision image registration and geolocation are vital. High-precision geometric model parameters are a prerequisite for on-orbit image registration and geolocation. Therefore, on the basis of the multiangle imaging characteristics of DPC, an on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration method without ground reference data is proposed. The method includes three steps: (1) preprocessing the original image of the DPC and the satellite attitude and orbit parameters; (2) scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm to match homologous points between multiangle images; (3) optimization of geometric model parameters on-orbit using least square theory. To verify the effectiveness of the on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration method, the image registration performance and relative geolocation accuracy before and after DPC on-orbit geometric calibration were evaluated and analyzed using the SIFT algorithm and the coastline crossing method (CCM). The results show that the on-orbit autonomous geometric calibration effectively improves the DPC image registration and relative geolocation accuracy. After on-orbit calibration, the multiangle image registration accuracy is better than 1.530 km, the multispectral image registration accuracy is better than 0.650 km, and the relative geolocation accuracy is better than 1.275 km, all reaching the subpixel level (<1.7 km). © 2022 by the authors.","Atmospheric aerosols; Calibration; Geometry; Image enhancement; Image registration; Least squares approximations; Orbits; Polarization; Remote sensing; Directional polarimetric camera; Geolocation accuracy; Geolocations; Geometric calibrations; Geometric models; High-precision; Images registration; Multi angle; On orbit; Remote-sensing; Cameras","directional polarimetric camera; geolocation accuracy; geometric calibration; image registration; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138805999"

It is urgent to develop a practical method to correct the angle effect for the products. More and more attention has been paid to the thermal infrared kernel-drive model because of its simplicity and accuracy. For natural surface, there are widely used eight kernel-driven models. Their fitting abilities over continuous and discrete canopies is well-known, however, no report discussed their performances over the important row-planted stage. The objective of this study is to assess the fitting abilities of all existing eight thermal infrared kernel-driven models over row-planted canopies based on airborne measured datasets.Two multi-angle directional anisotropy datasets over row-planted vineyards were obtained through the airborne observation in several flights. The experiment sites were located at Château Talbot, Médoc region, 30 km north of Bordeaux, France. All the measurements were combined and corrected from nadir temperature to derive the directional anisotropy at 1° steps for view zenith angle (0°-60°) and view azimuth angle (0°-360°). The multi-angle directional anisotropy values were used as input to estimate the kernel coefficients of two 3-parameter models within the traditional visible and near infrared framework (Ross-Li and LSF-Li), two 3-parameter models within the new thermal infrared framework (Vinnikov and RL), and four 4-parameter models within the new thermal infrared framework (Vinnikov-RL, Vinnikov-Chen, LSF-RL, LSF-Chen). Then, the forward simulated directional anisotropy values of all models were compared taking the airborne measured values as reference.Results show that all eight kernel-driven models cannot simulate the row-structure signatures (i.e., axisymmetric feature). They have an overall large RMSE about 2 K and a low R2 less than 0.7. In addition, the RMSE differences between the models are small. For the east-west canopy, RMSE is between 1.930 K and 2.153 K, R2 is between 0.616 and 0.691. For the south-north canopy, RMSE is between 2.005 K and 2.353 K, R2 is between 0.600 and 0.670. Therefore, developing a new specific kernel for row-structure to improve the fitting ability is demanded in the thermal infrared band currently. © 2021, Science Press.

When the target variable is available at a resolution that matches the remote sensing observations, standard algorithms, such as neural networks, random forests, or the Gaussian processes, are readily available to relate the two. However, we often encounter situations where the target variable is only available at the group level, i.e., collectively associated with a number of remotely sensed observations. This problem setting is known in statistics and machine learning as multiple instance learning (MIL) or distribution regression (DR). This article introduces a nonlinear (kernel-based) method for DR that solves the previous problems without making any assumption on the statistics of the grouped data. The presented formulation considers distribution embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and performs standard least squares regression with the empirical means therein. A flexible version to deal with multisource data of different dimensionality and sample sizes is also presented and evaluated. It allows working with the native spatial resolution of each sensor, avoiding the need for matchup procedures. Noting the large computational cost of the approach, we introduce an efficient version via random Fourier features to cope with millions of points and groups. Real experiments involve the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) vegetation optical depth (VOD) data for the estimation of crop production in the U.S. Corn Belt and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) reflectances for the estimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD).

Remote sensing has been widely used to examine and analyze marine oil spills. Refractive index is an important parameter for monitoring, evaluating, and mitigating marine oil spills, but its quantitative detection through remote sensing is still in the exploratory stages. In this study, we developed a quantitative inversion model at a pixel-scale to determine the equivalent refractive index (ERI) of the sea surface. The proposed model involved two important steps. First, we performed simulation experiments and found that the multi-angle Fresnel reflection coefficient ratio is not sensitive to the refractive index, which was further verified via real image geometry. Second, we proposed a sun glitter (SG) correction method by reanalyzing wind data and seawater refractive index in the background seawater area as constraints. High-resolution multi-angle sun glitter (MSG) images of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer sensor were used to estimate the ERI. The ERI images with the resolution same as that of the original images (15 m) exhibited significant spatial variability. The estimated ERI exhibited a reasonable range as compared to the existing oil spill refractive index data in relevant literature, which were derived from laboratory measurements and through remote sensing inversion. Finally, the sensitivities of the SG correction model and multi-angle Fresnel ratio model were discussed. The results show that the MSG images can estimate high-resolution ERI of sea surface that plays a significant role in the observations of marine oil spills. © 2022 The Authors","Atlantic Ocean; Gulf; Gulf of Mexico; Mexico; Papua New Guinea; Image acquisition; Marine pollution; Oil spills; Reflection; Remote sensing; Seawater; Surface waters; ASTER; Equivalent refractive index; Fresnel reflection coefficient; Marine oil spills; Marine spilled oil; Multi angle; Multi-angle sun glitte; Remote-sensing; Spilled oil; Sun glitter; ASTER; correction; image analysis; refractive index; remote sensing; sea surface; seawater; Refractive index","ASTER; Equivalent refractive index; Fresnel reflection coefficient; Marine spilled oils; Multi-angle sun glitter","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127516576"

Many satellite-based multi-spectral, -angle and -polarization instruments have been launched in recent years, and it is unclear how these observations can be used to improve the understanding of ice cloud properties. This study discusses the impacts of multi-spectral, -angle and -polarization observations on ice cloud property retrievals by performing a theoretical information content (IC) analysis. Ice cloud properties, including the cloud optical thickness (COT), particle effective radius (Re) and particle habit (defined by the aspect ratio (AR) and the degree of surface roughness level (σ)), are considered. An accurate polarized radiative transfer model is used to simulate the top-of-atmosphere intensity and polarized observations at the cloud-detecting wavelengths of interest. The ice cloud property retrieval accuracy should be improved with the additional information from multi-spectral, -angle and -polarization observations, which is verified by the increased degrees of freedom for signal (DFS). Polarization observations at spectral wavelengths (i.e., 0.87 and 2.13 μm) are helpful in the improvement of ice cloud property retrievals, especially for small-sized particles. An optimal scheme to retrieve ice cloud properties is to comprise radiance intensity information at the 0.87, 1.24, 1.64 and 2.13 μm channels and polarization information (the degree of linear polarization, DOLP) at the 0.87 and 2.13 μm channels. As observations from multiple angles added, DFS clearly increases, while it becomes almost saturated when the number of angles reaches three. Besides, the retrieval of Re exhibits larger uncertainties, and the improvement in total DFS by adding multi-spectral, -angle and -polarization observations is mainly attributed to the improvement of Re retrieval. Our findings will benefit the future instrument design and the improvement in cloud property retrieval algorithms based on multi-spectral, -angle, and -polarization imagers. © 2020 by the authors.","Aspect ratio; Budget control; Clouds; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Image enhancement; Optical properties; Polarization; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Surface roughness; Atmospheric studies; Cloud optical thickness; Degree of linear polarization; Ice cloud properties; Information contents; Intensity information; Polarization observations; Radiative transfer model; Ice","DFS; Ice cloud properties; Multi-angle; Multi-polarization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090088698"

The subject of photogrammetry has also followed the tide of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and developed rapidly into the brand-new generalized photogrammetry and entered the era of integrated intelligent photogrammetry. Its carrier platform, instruments and data processing theories as well as application fields have also changed significantly. The multi-sensor and multi-level integrated stereo observation technologies from spaceborne, airborne and terrestrial platforms have been greatly developed. In this paper, the novel concept of generalized photogrammetry is first put forward, and its subject connotation, development characteristics and some key technologies and applications are discussed in details. Under the brand-new generalized photogrammetry framework, data acquisition presents the characteristics of multi-angle imaging, multi-modal collaboration, multi-time integration, multi-scale linkage, while data processing presents the trends of multi-feature coupling, multi-control constraints, multi architecture processing, and multi-disciplinary intersection. The all-round development and intelligent service of the general photogrammetry still need to make greater breakthroughs in the aspects of spaceborne, airborne and terrestrial multi perspective or multi-modal image processing, intelligent information extraction and monitoring, combined 3D modeling with point cloud and image, autonomous control of unmanned system, visual inspection of intelligent manufacturing system, etc. Finally, new theories and technologies from real-time or quasi real-time intelligent geometric processing of multi-source remote sensing datasets to information extraction and intelligent service need to be established, which will make a well foundation to meet the new eara of intelligent surveying and mapping. © 2021, Surveying and Mapping Press.

This study explored the effect of angle changes on satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval using 2016–2018 Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data in the Yangtze River Delta. The Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance determined by the MODIS V5.2 algorithm and MODIS BRDF data are used to obtain MISR surface reflectance at different angles after a spectral conversion between MODIS and MISR, and then MISR AOD with different angles were retrieved based on the MISR surface reflectance at different angles. Moreover, the errors and their formation mechanism in retrieving AOD using MISR remote sensing data at different angles were analyzed based on the Global Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground observations. We used six indicators, including correlation coefficient (R), significant level (P value), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) root mean square error (RMSE) and relative mean bias (RMB), and AERONET AOD is used to verify the MISR AOD. The results show that at Taihu and Xuzhou stations, the highest R values are 0.81 (Aa AOD) and 0.75 (An AOD), and the minimum RMSE values at Taihu and Xuzhou-CUMT stations are 0.11 (Aa AOD) and 0.20 (An AOD), respectively. Incorrect surface reflectance measurement is the root cause of the angle effect in MISR AOD retrieval. With the same surface reflectance deviation, the larger the MISR observation angle, the closer the retrieved MISR AOD is to the AOD observed by AERONET. The AOD retrieval of the forward observation angle is closer to AERONET AOD than that of backward observation angle, and the retrieved error is greatest at the vertical angle (nadir). Therefore, sensors for vertical ground observation are not suitable for AOD retrieval, and sensors in non-vertical directions, especially forward to the ground, are more favorable to MISR AOD retrieval. © 2021 The Author(s).

Directonal information on cloud detection comes from BRDF of surface combined with atmospheric effects. Although determing certain view angles in local area by analytic solution is possible, considering the complexities of application the traverse calculation for whole angles is still carried out in POLDER officer products. Due to the redundant information existed on close neighbours of angler layer, averaged joint information entropy and K-L information divergence can form a feature basis for selection of angle subset. Two algorithms of optimal and idel solutions on Pareto multi-objectives front are proposed. Experiments of cloud detection were taken on two POLDER datasets firstly, then on a dataset of directional polarimetric camera (DPC) on board GF-5 satellite. The experimental results demonstrated that the overall accuracy of cloud detection by proposed method based on 2 angle- layers combinations is 89.36%, Kappa equals 0.7845 The validation on DPC dataset also showed that in comparison with GF-5 remote sensing synthetic image the similarity among them is 86%. The computation efficiency was raised to 7 times. Thus the proposed method takes advantages on computational cost saving and retaining multi-angle image's intrinsic information.

But reliable MODIS detection of seasonal and interannual leaf phenology patterns has also been questioned and is generally not validated with field observation. Here we compare inter-annual patterns of local-scale upper canopy leaf phenology and demography derived from tower-mounted phenocams at two upland forest sites in the Central Amazon, to corresponding satellite vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS-MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction). We focus on forest response to an unprecedented drought caused by the El Niño of 2015-16. At both sites, multi-year phenocam data showed post-drought shifts in leaf demography. These were consistent with MODIS-MAIAC anomalies in two vegetation indices. Specifically, a precocious leaf flush at both sites during the first two post-drought months, Feb-Mar 2016, caused (1) an anomalous decrease in flushing trees in Jun–Jul of 2016 and (2) an increase of trees with early mature stage leaves (2-4 mo age) in Apr-May-Jun of 2016. At both sites, these two phenological anomalies showed up in MODIS-MAIAC as, respectively, (1) a strong negative anomaly in Gcc (Green chromatic coordinate), which prior work has shown to be sensitive to the abundance of leaves 0-1 mo old, and (2) a strong positive anomaly in EVI, which is sensitive to abundance of leaves 2-4 mo age. A shift to sub-optimal seasonal leaf age mix is expected to change the ecosystem-scale intrinsic photosynthetic capacity for ~18 month after the drought. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Drought; Population statistics; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Tropics; Vegetation; Green-up; Leaf demography; MODIS-MAIAC; Phenocam; Seasonality; demographic survey; detection method; drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; leaf; MODIS; phenology; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; seasonality; tropical forest; vegetation index; Forestry","Amazon green-up; El Niño; EVI seasonality; Leaf demography; MODIS-MAIAC; Phenocam","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075447037"

According to the reflectance extracted from the BRDF model, the dependences of 16 commonly-used VIs on observation angles are analyzed, and the SPAD values of maize and soybean canopy are predicted by using the 16 VI values at different observation angles and their combinations as input parameters. The results show that the 16 VIs have different sensitivity to angle in the principal plane: green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIRE), and modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (MCARI/OSAVI) are very sensitive to angles, among which MCARI/OSAVI of maize fluctuated the most (138.83 %); in contrast, the green optimal soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) hardly change with the observation angles. In terms of SPAD prediction, the accuracy of different VI is different, the mean absolute error (MAE) showed that MCARI1 provided the highest accuracy of retrieval for soybean (MAE=1.617), while for maize it was MCARI/OSAVI (MAE=2.422). However, when using the same VI, there was no significant difference in the accuracy of the predicted results, whether the VI from different angles was used or the combination of multi-angles was used.

With the emergence of high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and the demand for high-precision surface temperature products, the effect of thermal radiation anisotropy cannot be ignored. Now it has become one of the hottest issues concerned widely in the thermal infrared field. The thermal anisotropy is more obvious for the urban surface with diverse surface features and complex geometric structure. This article describes three observational experiments, including ground observation experiment, airborne observation experiment, and space observation experiment. These three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and can be used in different situations. The observation data that represents the reality of urban radiation directionality often shows obvious thermal radiation anisotropy in urban areas during the daytime. In addition, a series of forward models of thermal radiation anisotropy carried out in urban areas are categorized and analyzed. These models can be divided into three categories: geometric three-dimensional model, radiative transfer model, and parameter model. According to existing academic papers, in-situ observation data are usually used to estimate the coefficients and verify the simulation accuracy of forward models. By combining these two approaches, observations and models, some scholars have made some achievements in this field. The purpose of studying thermal radiation anisotropy in urban areas is to obtain land surface parameters with higher accuracy. So, the exploration of true values of urban surface temperature are also included in this study. Furthermore, the impact factors of thermal radiation anisotropy are summarized, such as observation season and time, surface geometry, physical properties of surface materials, observation angle, FOV of sensor, etc. which influence the spatial and temporal patterns of intensity of thermal radiation anisotropy. At last, for the ultimate goal of improving the retrieval accuracy of urban surface temperature, five prospects are put forward: using high-resolution thermal infrared sensors to get the data of urban thermal background field, carrying out more thermal infrared multi-angle remote sensing experiments from different platforms, improving understanding of the mechanism of thermal radiation of non-isothermal heterogeneous pixels, performing validation of urban surface temperature, applying the research results into practice such as angle correction of satellite temperature products. ©2022, Science Press.

The results show that: ① From the in-situ observed daily average concentration of PM2.5, good or mild to moderate pollution occurred in January, February, October, November, and December every year, and the rest of the time was excellent. ② Based on the annual average PM2.5 concentration obtained by satellite for the past 20 years, the spatial characteristics showed that the external radiation is centered on Guangzhou and Foshan. The time evolution shows the characteristics of an Ω shape, which increases gradually from 2000 to 2009, is highest in 2008, and then gradually decreases. ③ The monthly average aerosol optical thickness (AOT) value from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer satellite reversion every 10 years for a period (2000-2009 for a period, 2010-2018 for a period) was used to see the monthly variation.

Currently, for the difficulty of calculating gap fraction from discrete LiDAR Point Cloud Data (PCD), LiDAR Penetration Index (LPI) is used as the alternative of gap fraction to estimate LAI. However, LPI ignores the target spectral difference which is an important factor affecting the number of canopy and background echoes. Therefore, the backscattering coefficient of the background and canopy, μ=ρ_g/ρ_v, is required to correct the LPI to GF. We extracted μ from intensity of the PCD data, which achieved by using a linear regression between the intensity of background and that of canopy in each pulse intensity groups, then the mean μ of all valid groups was used to transform LPI to gap. Given there was a dominant species of vegetation in study area, the light extinction coefficient (k) was extracted using constrained optimization method to obtain the ellipsoidal model parameter χ from multi-angle gap fraction at the large spatial scale (tile scale) under the assumption that the leaf angle distribution can be modeled by a ellipsoidal model and the leaf mean tilt angle is constant through study area. Finally, LiDAR LAI was estimated using retrieved gap fraction and extinction coefficient. Meanwhile, the impact of tile scale (Rxy_Tile), sample scale Rxy_Plot and height threshold (Ht) were also investigated. The results showed that the μ value was close to unit, and it is contributed by the extensive coverage of lichen vegetation in the area, which is consistent with the actual field characteristics. The gap fraction corrected by μ has a good ability to reflect the field measured data (R2=0.78, RMSE=0.09), and the leaf angle distribution parameter χ, is affected mainly by the large gap between the crowns for areas with dominant species. In terms of size of tile, the retrieval χ, the parameter of ellipsoidal model, was sensitive to the spatial size of tile, which means that attention should be paid to select tile size. An ill-suited tile size would result in a systematic underestimation of LAI. For the target parameter of LAI, the result revealed that it was highly consistent with the ground measurement (R2=0.84, RMSE=0.51) under the condition of Rxy_Tile, Rxy_Plot and Ht of 950 m, 10 m and 2.6 m respectively. It was concluded that the retrieved LAI was more sensitive to the choice of H_t, and it was noted that more attention would be paid to select appropriate Ht to ensuring the consistent result of LiDAR LAI and field measurements in the further work direction. We conclude that it is feasible to retrieve μ and further to produce LAI using ALS PCD data only. The significance of the proposed method is that it can produce reliable remotely sensed LAI from ALS PCD even with no ancillary spectral data. © 2020, Science Press.

This data is useful for investigating cloud distribution and cloud – radiation – climate interactions. This paper uses the French multi-angle polarization load POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectance) cloud detection algorithm as a reference, and combines DPC multi-band reflectivity, polarization reflectivity, apparent pressure and other information to develop a cloud detection algorithm for DPC measurement. The algorithm is mainly divided into three parts: First, the threshold method is used to detect cloud pixels, and the apparent pressure is introduced to further restrict the conditions of clouds (such as cirrus, stratocumulus, etc.) at different heights, and then use the 865nm band polarization reflectance to identifies the sun glare area reflected by the sea surface, and corrects the sun glare interference when the reflectance threshold is used to identify cloud pixels. In order to verify the accuracy of the algorithm, this study verified the cloud pixel coincidence of MODIS's MOD06 cloud mask product and the cloud detection algorithm results on October 1, 2018. The results showed that the cloud pixel and clear pixel coincidence of the cloud detection results in this study and MOD06 cloud mask product was 78% and 70% respectively. It can be seen from visual interpretation that the cloud detection results in this study are closer to the real cloud distribution, while the observation time of MOD06 cloud mask product is slightly different from that of DPC, resulting in poor consistency with the cloud distribution of DPC RGB composite. Above results indicate that cloud detection algorithm proposed in this study can provide important data support for subsequent DPC research on cloud parameters, water vapor, and aerosols. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

Nowadays, with video satellites coming into service, obtaining imageries of the same scene from a more-or-less continuous array of angles has become a reality. In this paper, we analyze the differences between the traditional RS data and continuous multi-angle remote sensing (CMARS) data, and unravel the characteristics of the CMARS data. We study the advantages of using CMARS data for classification and try to capitalize on the complementarity of multi-angle information and, at the same time, to reduce the embedded redundancy. Our arguments are substantiated by real-life experiments on the employment of CMARS data in order to classify urban land covers while using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. They show the superiority of CMARS data over the traditional data for classification. The overall accuracy may increase up to about 9% with CMARS data. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of directly using the CMARS data, and how such data can be better utilized through the extraction of key features that characterize the variations of spectral reflectance along the entire angular array.

The spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation canopy results in the complicated Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) distribution which brings great difficulties to the high-resolution vegetation remote sensing research. The 3D radiation transmission model can accurately describes the interaction between heterogeneous vegetation canopy and solar radiation, which is important for modeling and application of vegetation quantitative remote sensing using high-resolution optical data. In this work, the probabilistic plants with statistical properties similar to actual plants are used to construct a 3D vegetation canopy. Combining Monte Carlo ray tracing technology and canopy porosity calculation, a 3D canopy radiation transmission model is constructed by rationally designing the random transmission process of optical particles in the canopy. Using probabilistic plants to build the canopy not only accurately describes the canopy’s heterogeneity but also takes into account the non-uniform spatial distribution of leaves. The model considers light to be a particle with the dual properties of frequency and energy. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the transmission behavior of light particles in the canopy, and the canopy porosity is calculated to improve the model’s calculation stability. Taking the corn canopy with a typical ridge planting structure as an example, the bidirectional reflectance function of the corn canopy in different growth periods is simulated and compared with the multi-angle observation data. The comparison results illustrate that the model has good simulation accuracy for the optical BRF of corn canopy in different growing periods. The RMSE between the model simulation value and the measured value is 0.0085 at the red band, and the R2 is 0.96. At the near-infrared band, the RMSE and R2 are 0.013 and 0.96, respectively. For the homogeneous canopy, the comparison between the model developed in this work and the SAIL model shows that the model of this paper perfectly describes the transport path and energy transfer of the light particles. The model proposed in this paper can accurately simulate the BRF of the canopy with the centrosymmetric statistical characteristics, and it offers great convenience in constructing inhomogeneous canopy scenes as well as high simulation stability.

We present a simultaneous retrieval algorithm, coupled with a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model centered on the water’s Inherent Optical Property (IOP), to retrieve AOD and bidirectional reflectance based on multi-angle measurements from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor. The algorithm was evaluated through retrievals performed in the proximity of four AERONET sites characterized by various water types. Consistency was observed between the results and in situ measurements. Accurate AODs can be retrieved, and atmospheric overcorrection can be avoided when obtaining remote sensing reflectance. Furthermore, the normalized remote sensing reflectance derived from our results showed a good correlation with the AERONET-OC products derived using the IOP-based correction approach.

The application of UAV-based multi-angle remote sensing in fine vegetation classification was studied by combining a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model for multi-angle remote sensing and object-oriented classification methods. This method can not only effectively reduce the classification phenomena that influence different objects with similar spectra, but also benefit the construction of a canopy-level BRDF. Then, the importance of the BRDF characteristic parameters are discussed in detail. The results show that the overall classification accuracy (OA) of the vertical observation reflectance based on BRDF extrapolation (BRDF_0°) (63.9%) was approximately 24% higher than that based on digital orthophoto maps (DOM) (39.8%), and kappa using BRDF_0° was 0.573, which was higher than that using DOM (0.301); a combination of the hot spot and dark spot features, as well as model features, improved the OA and kappa to around 77% and 0.720, respectively. The reflectance features near hot spots were more conducive to distinguishing maize, soybean, and weeds than features near dark spots; the classification results obtained by combining the observation principal plane (BRDF_PP) and on the cross-principal plane (BRDF_CP) features were best (OA = 89.2%, kappa = 0.870), and especially, this combination could improve the distinction among different leaf-shaped trees. BRDF_PP features performed better than BRDF_CP features. The observation angles in the backward reflection direction of the principal plane performed better than those in the forward direction. The observation angles associated with the zenith angles between ??10° and ??20° were most favorable for vegetation classification (solar position: zenith angle 28.86°, azimuth 169.07°) (OA was around 75%-80%, kappa was around 0.700-0.790); additionally, the most frequently selected bands in the classification included the blue band (466 nm-492 nm), green band (494 nm-570 nm), red band (642 nm-690 nm), red edge band (694 nm-774 nm), and the near-infrared band (810 nm-882 nm). Overall, the research results promote the application of multi-angle remote sensing technology in vegetation information extraction and provide important theoretical significance and application value for regional and global vegetation and ecological monitoring. © 2019 by the authors.","Distribution functions; Infrared devices; Reflection; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; BRDF; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Multi-angle observations; Object-oriented segmentation; Vegetation classification; Remote sensing","BRDF; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Multi-angle observation; Object-oriented segmentation; Vegetation classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076556253"

Central Asia is one of the most important sources of dust aerosols in the world and produces a significant portion of global aerosols. Central Asia is also a scarce aerosol-data area, so it is of great significance to obtain and verify new aerosol data from this region. In this study, based on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from remote sensing (MYD04_L2) and ground-based observations (AERONET and Microtops II), the applicability of multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) AOD in Central Asia was comprehensively analyzed, and the variation in AOD in Central Asia over the last 20 years was analyzed by the information entropy method. The results indicate that MAIAC AOD has good application prospects in Central Asia and can effectively compensate for the lack of observational data from Central Asia. MAIAC AOD exhibits excellent spatiotemporal consistency with MYD04 deep blue (DB) AOD and has a better ability than MYD04 DB AOD to describe local fine-scale features. Furthermore, MAIAC AOD demonstrates high consistency with ground-based AOD observations, showing high R (0.737) and low RMSE (0.067) values and having 65.2% of samples falling within the expected error (EE) envelope. When employing the ground-based AOD observations as a bridge, MAIAC exhibits superiority to MYD04 DB in both the richness number of valid high-quality retrievals and the retrieval accuracy of various evaluation indicators. The annual variation in AOD in Central Asia exhibits a unimodal distribution, with AOD being largest in April, followed by March and May, and comparable rangeability. Based on information entropy, interannual variation in AOD exists in most areas of Central Asia, with AOD in the Taklimakan Desert area being significantly increased and that in northern Central Asia (Kazakhstan) showing a downward trend. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","China; Kazakhstan; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Remote sensing; Supercomputers; Aerosol optical depths; Global climate system; Ground-based observations; Information entropy method; Interannual variation; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Spatio-temporal consistencies; Unimodal distribution; aerosol; annual variation; atmospheric correction; environmental change; global climate; optical depth; remote sensing; aerosol; article; desert; entropy; human; information retrieval; Kazakhstan; optical depth; remote sensing; Aerosols","AOD; Central Asia; DB; MAIAC; Spatiotemporal variation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101858847"

Studies point out that apparent uncertainty can be introduced into albedo retrieval without consideration of surface anisotropy, which is a challenge to albedo estimation especially from observations with fewer angular samplings. Researchers have begun to introduce smoothed anisotropy prior knowledge into albedo estimation to improve the inversion efficiency, or for the scenario of observations with signal or poor angular sampling. Thus, it is necessary to further understand the potential influence of smoothed anisotropy features adopted in albedo estimation. We investigated the albedo variation induced by BRDF smoothing at both temporal and spatial scales over six typical landscapes in North America using MODIS standard anisotropy products with high quality BRDF inversed from multi-angle observations in 500 m and 5.6 km spatial resolutions. Components of selected typical landscapes were assessed with the confidence of the MCD12 land cover product and 30 m CDL (cropland data layer) classification maps followed by an evaluation of spatial heterogeneity in 30 m scale through the semi-variogram model. High quality BRDF of MODIS standard anisotropy products were smoothed in multi-temporal scales of 8 days, 16 days, and 32 days, and in multi-spatial scales from 500 m to 5.6 km. The induced relative and absolute albedo differences were estimated using the RossThick-LiSparseR model and BRDFs smoothed before and after spatiotemporal smoothing. Our results show that albedo estimated using BRDFs smoothed temporally from daily to monthly over each scenario exhibits relative differences of 11.3%, 12.5%, and 27.2% and detectable absolute differences of 0.025, 0.012, and 0.013, respectively, in MODIS near-infrared (0.7–5.0 μm), short-wave (0.3–5.0 μm), and visible (0.3–0.7 μm) broad bands. When BRDFs of investigated landscapes are smoothed from 500 m to 5.6 km, variations of estimated albedo can achieve up to 36.5%, 37.1%, and 94.7% on relative difference and absolute difference of 0.037, 0.024, and 0.018, respectively, in near-infrared (0.7–5.0 μm), short wave (0.3–5.0 μm), and visible (0.3–0.7 μm) broad bands. In addition, albedo differences caused by temporal smoothing show apparent seasonal characteristic that the differences are significantly higher in spring and summer than those in autumn and winter, while albedo differences induced by spatial smoothing exhibit a noticeable relationship with sill values of a fitted semi-variogram marked by a correlation coefficient of 0.8876. Both relative and absolute albedo differences induced by BRDF smoothing are demonstrated to be captured, thus, it is necessary to avoid the smoothing process in quantitative remote sensing communities, especially when immediate anisotropy retrievals are available at the required spatiotemporal scale. © 2022 by the authors.

Compared with the traditional single-angle and only intensity detection signal loads, multi-angle with/or polarized remote sensing observation instruments provide new ideas for detecting aerosol parameters. Nowadays, multi-angle detection technology and the development of advanced detection loads have become one of the main directions in the field of remote sensing. From the perspective of aerosol characterization from remote sensing measurements, this paper first summarized the information of typical instruments among the development of airborne, space-borne and ground-based detections in various countries. Second, taking the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectraRadiometer (MISR) aboard on Terra, Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from a LiDAR (PARASOL)/POLDER and Directional Polarized Camera aboard on Gaofen-5 (GF-5/DPC) respectively as representatives of the multi-angle only intensity signal (MAOI, hereafter) and multi-angle polarized signal (MAPS, hereafter), using AERONET/CE-318 as the representative of ground-based remote sensing observations, respectively introduced the current research status of their aerosol characteristics in recent years from three perspectives of data set accuracy evaluation, inversion algorithm improvement and product application. To be specific, 1) the improvements based on MAOI are mainly reflected in the optimization of the aerosol model, and the difficulty lies in how to express the surface contribution by using the empirical orthogonal function. The narrow swath and coarse temporal resolution of MISR determine the rarely popular as MODIS. A higher resolution at 4.4km×4.4 km provide data support for investigating the evolution trends of regional aerosol properties at the regional scale. 2) In addition to establish more approximate aerosol models and acute surface reflectance functions by MAPS, the method of optimal estimation and multi-variate statistical optimal data have been developed to retrieve fine AOD, particle distribution, polarized phase function and etc. Finally, based on the above investigation, it is found that, 1) the planned payloads not only add polarization signal, but also take the importance of multi-spectral into consideration, particularly in near-infrared and short-wave infrared channels, which makes more contributions to improve the retrieval information for coarse particles. 2) The Lookup table-based inversion methods require to refine more appropriate aerosol types and precise surface reflectance relationship, but for the rich information content of hyperspectral load, the inversion efficiency of this method needs to be improved. 3) In addition, the complement of MAOI and MAPS and the fusion of inversion algorithms is also a way to improve the overall inversion accuracy of aerosol characteristics. 4) While improving load performance and enhancing matching inversion algorithms, it is also necessary to vigorously develop calibration techniques for polarized loads, and stable and high-precision calibration coefficients provide the basis for the development of secondary products and the application of tertiary products. 5) domestic MAPS instrument as well as polarization lidar need to be put on the agenda. © 2020","Aerosols; Calibration; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Optical projectors; Optical radar; Orthogonal functions; Polarization; Reflection; Space optics; Table lookup; Aerosol characterization; Current research status; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Ground-based remote sensing; High-precision calibration; Polarized phase functions; Polarized remote sensing; Surface reflectance functions; aerosol property; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; calibration; comparative study; instrumentation; literature review; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; aerosol; algorithm; anisotropy; atmosphere; calibration; controlled study; information retrieval; infrared radiation; polarization; remote sensing; review; Remote sensing","Aerosol; Aerosol model; Multi-angle remote sensing; Polarized remote sensing; Surface reflectance","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092755911"

We develop a multi-source remote sensing data acquisition system to effectively acquire multi-angle data of complex urban scenes. Multi-source data fusion solves the missing data problem caused by occlusion and achieves accurate, rapid, and complete collection of holographic spatial and temporal information in complex urban scenes. We carried out an experiment on Baisha Town, Chongqing, China and obtained multi-sensor, multi-angle data from UAV and mobile mapping vehicle. We first extracted the point cloud from UAV and then integrated the UAV and mobile mapping vehicle point cloud.

The Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) campaign was jointly sponsored by NASA and the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON). Six instruments were deployed on the ER-2 high-Altitude aircraft. Four were MAPs: The Airborne Hyper Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), the Airborne Spectrometer for Planetary EXploration (SPEX airborne), and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). The remainder were lidars, including the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL) and the High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2 (HSRL-2). The southern California base of ACEPOL enabled observation of a wide variety of scene types, including urban, desert, forest, coastal ocean, and agricultural areas, with clear, cloudy, polluted, and pristine atmospheric conditions. Flights were performed in coordination with satellite overpasses and ground-based observations, including the Groundbased Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI), sun photometers, and a surface reflectance spectrometer.

Due to the difficulties of locating the arbitrarily rotated ships and the complexity of the background around the ship, the existing deep learning-based object detection algorithm is difficult to accurately identify the ship target. For multi-angle ships, the horizontal bounding box contains not only ship objects but also a lot of irrelevant backgrounds, they are learned by the deep convolutional network as a learning object, and this leads to the common misalignment between the final classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new module called rotation RetinaNet (RRNet) to handle this problem. Firstly, we start from the popular one-stage RetinaNet approach, with ResNet50 as a basic network. Then, we apply a rotation head to RetinaNet to guarantee the rotation invariance of the model. Finally, we add an angular loss to the original loss so that the model can learn the angular offset of the bounding box. As a consequence, the proposed RRNet achieves high performance on the open-source DOTA datasets. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Antennas; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Object detection; Object recognition; Observatories; Remote sensing; Rotation; Automatic Detection; Classification confidence; Convolutional networks; Localization accuracy; Object detection algorithms; Remote sensing image processing; Rotation invariance; Rotation invariant; Ships","Convolutional neural network; Rotation RetinaNet; Ship detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087788246"

We have recently shown that machine learning using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) can improve the estimation of MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD). Although MAIAC CWV is generally well validated (Pearson's R > 0.97 versus CWV from AERONET sun photometers), it has not yet been assessed whether machine-learning approaches can further improve CWV. Using a novel spatiotemporal cross-validation approach to avoid overfitting, our XGBoost model, with nine features derived from land use terms, date, and ancillary variables from the MAIAC retrieval, quantifies and can correct a substantial portion of measurement error relative to collocated measurements at AERONET sites (26.9 % and 16.5 % decrease in root mean square error (RMSE) for Terra and Aqua datasets, respectively) in the Northeastern USA, 2000-2015. We use machine-learning interpretation tools to illustrate complex patterns of measurement error and describe a positive bias in MAIAC Terra CWV worsening in recent summertime conditions. We validate our predictive model on MAIAC CWV estimates at independent stations from the SuomiNet GPS network where our corrections decrease the RMSE by 19.7 % and 9.5 % for Terra and Aqua MAIAC CWV. Empirically correcting for measurement error with machine-learning algorithms is a postprocessing opportunity to improve satellite-derived CWV data for Earth science and remote sensing applications.  © 2020 Author(s).","error analysis; machine learning; measurement method; satellite altimetry; water vapor","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092306817"

It is a prerequisite for the ability to determine the location of the buried people and rescue the victims in the shortest time. Therefore, the timeliness of the post-earthquake building survey is a significant factor. The 3D reconstruction model of buildings based on UAV tilt photography has the advantages of multi-angle and three-dimensional, but it is too time-consuming. Therefore, this paper proposes a UAV tilt photography route planning algorithm. This algorithm improves the efficiency of the three-dimensional reconstruction of the building and saves valuable time for emergency rescue work. The algorithm requires two drone flights. During the first flight, the drone flies horizontally to get the aircraft POS data. With the POS data, the corresponding feature points on the ground will be obtained. According to the clustering of the feature points, the building oblique photography path planning area will be generated. Finally a reasonable drone route planning will be produced. During the second flight, the flight route generated by the algorithm was used to take oblique photography of the building to produce a three-dimensional reconstruction model. The final building model will be obtained based on the combination of the models obtained from the two flights. After contrast experiments with traditional oblique photography, the algorithm in this paper is significantly superior to the traditional oblique photography method in terms of building 3D reconstruction efficiency.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","3D modeling; Buildings; Civil defense; Drones; Earthquakes; Efficiency; Geology; Image reconstruction; Maintenance; Mapping; Photography; Remote sensing; 3-D reconstruction model; 3D reconstruction; Building damage; Building survey; Contrast experiment; Earthquake building damage; Emergency rescue; Three-dimensional reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108308920"

Compared with the traditional remote sensing which only views the ground surface in one direction, multi-angle remote sensing provides angle-dimensional information and improves the capability of obtaining vegetation structure parameters. It helps to improve the retrieval accuracy of key biophysical parameters and provides better data support for the research of ecological environment and climate change. After a detailed analysis of the publications in multi-angle remote sensing, we summarize the basic concepts, characteristics, advantages and developments of multi-angle remote sensing. Multi-angle remote sensing platforms vary from ground-based, airborne to spaceborne observation equipment. The first ground-based observation equipment appeared in 1952. All the ground-based equipment is classified as the fixed field of view mode or the changeable field of view mode. For the airborne or spaceborne platforms, only the fixed field of view mode is acceptable due to the heterogeneity of the land surfaces. With the development of UAV technique, the airborne multi-angle remote sensing is becoming more and more popular due to its flexibility and high spatial resolution. The multi-angle models play important roles in parameters inversion. Classic multi-angle remote sensing models include radiative transfer models, geometric optical models, hybrid models, and computer simulation models. They are all physical models which are developed based on some assumptions and theoretical analysis. Semi-empirical models combine the advantages of the empirical model and the physical model, as a result, they are simple and stable in inversion. The most widely used semi-empirical model is the linear kernel driven model used by the operational MODIS BRDF/albedo products algorithm. With the development of observing equipment and models, multi-angle remote sensing is widely used in many applications. Due to the anisotropic reflection characteristic, land surface albedo can only be retrieved by multi-angle remote sensing with high accuracy. Multi-angle remote sensing shows great potentials in vegetation structural parameters inversion which include the clumping index, LAI, FVC profile and canopy height. It has been found to be superior in vegetation type identification than the traditional vertical observation. Multi-angle remote sensing is also very useful in the cloud and aerosol parameters retrieval, such as the cloud albedo, height and types, as well as the aerosol optical depth and shapes. Large difference of optical scattering between the cloud and ice/snow in different viewing directions makes the identification of these covers easier with multi-angle remote sensing. The sea ice roughness can also be retrieved by multi-angle observations. In the last of this paper, we put forward the prospects of multi-angle optical quantitative remote sensing. As the multi-angle remote sensing observation data based on spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms become more and more abundant, the main research direction of multi-angle remote sensing in the future should focus on the following aspects: developing multi-angle reflection/radiation models for complex surfaces, enhancing the preprocessing capabilities of multi-angle remote sensing data, and promoting the comprehensive abilities of multi-source data integration in application, etc. © 2021, Science Press.

Using a multi-angle observation instrument, we conducted a field investigation and measured the snow/ice/ice-snow Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function. Both snow and ice have the typical feature of forwarding scattering, and the scattering intensity is governed by their properties (i.g., snow grain size, liquid water content, and transparency). The characteristics of ice-snow are similar to snow when a small amount of fresh snow is deposited on the ice surface, but will change significantly when the surface snow is metamorphic (melt or refreezing). This change can affect the monitoring accuracy of snow and ice using remote sensing data. In this study, a Normalized Difference Ice-Snow Index (NDISI) was developed using two bands (i.e., 1,080–1,120 nm and 1,760–1,800 nm). We applied spectra from different regions to verify the ability of NDISI and its application for distinguishing ice-snow.

It is also important to promote the demonstration of satellite missions and the application of its observations in earth system science. In the ShanDian River comprehensive remote sensing experiment, a large-scale aerial remote sensing experiment with soil moisture as the primary target was carried out using the airborne L-band active and passive microwave sounder. The passive detection part, the microwave radiometer, uses a microstrip antenna, supplemented by a mechanical scanning method for multi-angle imaging observation. In order to effectively support the development of remote sensing models and algorithms, real-time calibration of brightness temperature must be performed. This paper introduces a distributed calibration method combining internal and external calibration. Due to the limitation of the space and weight of the aircraft, the end-to-end calibration method cannot be used to calibrate the system. Therefore, the step-by-step calibration method is used in the test. First use Standard noise generator on the ground to calibrate the brightness temperature of the internal noise source, and then measure the antenna radiation efficiency, main beam efficiency, cable loss and other parameters. During the flight, use the reference load and the internal noise source as the two-point standard sources. The relationship between the receiver and the input brightness temperature is obtained, and finally the parameters of the ground measurement system are substituted to obtain the calibration equation of the airborne radiometer. During the flight, the water body in the Hulunnao'er was selected as the reference point for external calibration target to correct the equation. The results show that the airborne radiation brightness temperature is relatively consistent with the ground reference point (grassland) simulated brightness temperature. The comparison shows that the minimum root mean square error is 0.93 K (September 26, 2018, H polarization), and the unbiased average The minimum square root error is 0.96K (September 24, 2018, V polarization), which effectively supports the demonstration of the domestic-made L-band microwave radiometer satellite program and the subsequent development of related research work such as quantitative inversion and downscaling. The calibration method adopted in this paper can accurately describe the complex relationship between the radiometer electrical signal and the brightness temperature. However, this study did not consider the effects of antenna port matching, aircraft pod loss, antenna pattern error, etc. During the calibration of internal noise sources on the ground, the impact of the environment and the system nonlinearity were not considered. It is necessary to take these factors into consideration in subsequent research, and the calibration accuracy can be further improved. © 2021, Science Press.

Most previous studies focused on agricultural regions in the Northern Hemisphere and were based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This paper compares the capacity of four parametric double S-shaped models (Gaussian, Hyperbolic Tangent, Logistic, and Sine) to represent the seasonal phenology of an unmanaged, protected savanna biome in South Africa’s Lowveld, using the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) generated by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer-High Resolution (MISR-HR) processing system on the basis of data originally collected by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument since 24 February 2000. FAPAR time series are automatically split into successive vegetative seasons, and the models are inverted against those irregularly spaced data to provide a description of the seasonal fluctuations despite the presence of noise and missing values. The performance of these models is assessed by quantifying their ability to account for the variability of remote sensing data and to evaluate the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) of vegetation, as well as by evaluating their numerical efficiency. Simulated results retrieved from remote sensing are compared to GPP estimates derived from field measurements acquired at Skukuza’s flux tower in the Kruger National Park, which has also been operational since 2000. Preliminary results indicate that (1) all four models considered can be adjusted to fit an FAPAR time series when the temporal distribution of the data is sufficiently dense in both the growing and the senescence phases of the vegetative season, (2) the Gaussian and especially the Sine models are more sensitive than the Hyperbolic Tangent and Logistic to the temporal distribution of FAPAR values during the vegetative season, and, in particular, to the presence of long temporal gaps in the observational data, and (3) the performance of these models to simulate the phenology of plants is generally quite sensitive to the presence of unexpectedly low FAPAR values during the peak period of activity and to the presence of long gaps in the observational data. Consequently, efforts to screen out outliers and to minimize those gaps, especially during the rainy season (vegetation’s growth phase), would go a long way to improve the capacity of the models to adequately account for the evolution of the canopy cover and to better assess the relation between FAPAR and GPP. © 2020 by the authors.

Through remote sensing, air pollutant concentrations can be obtained over large areas for a long time. In this study, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations were estimated using satellite-derived Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values observed in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines. Models were generated using multiple linear regression (MLR) and gradient boosting regression to determine the best models for the whole data from 2017 to 2020, dry season, and wet season with a 70-30 split for the train-test sets. Initial models resulted with the best coefficient of determination R2 values of 2.6% and 1.2% using MLR and 2.0% using gradient boosting regression. The results for PM2.5 and PM10 showed the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 8.79 μg/m3 and 18.99 μg/m3 using MLR and 8.08 μg/m3 and 16.85 μg/m3 using gradient boosting, respectively. The preliminary results indicate the relatively poor performance of models in estimating particulate matter using satellite-derived AOD images. Improvements in the models will include the integration of more in-situ data from air quality monitoring stations and the addition of additional variables and features such as meteorological parameters and geographical layers. © Author(s) 2023.

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) onboard the Terra satellite has an innovative design to provide information about aerosol shape, size and extinction that are more related to PM2.5 speciation concentrations. In this study, we developed random forest models that incorporated ground measurements of PM2.5 species, MISR fractional AODs, simulated PM2.5 speciation concentrations from a chemical transport model (CTM), land use variables and meteorological fields, to predict ground-level daily PM2.5 sulfate, nitrate, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations in California between 2005 and 2014. Our models had out-of-bag R 2 of 0.72, 0.70, 0.68 and 0.70 for sulfate, nitrate, OC and EC, respectively. We also conducted sensitivity tests to explore the influence of variable selection on model performance. Results show that if there are sufficient ground measurements and predictor data to support the most sophisticated model structure, fractional AODs and total AOD have similar predicting power in estimating PM2.5 species. Otherwise, models using fractional AODs outperform those with total AOD. PM2.5 speciation concentrations are more sensitive to land use variables than other supporting data (e.g., CTM simulations and meteorological information). © 2020 The Author(s).

The Geostationary- National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth exchange (GeoNEX) project recently adapted the multiangle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm, originally developed for joint retrieval of AOD and surface anisotropic reflectance with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, to generate Earth monitoring products from the latest geostationary satellites including Himawari-8. This study evaluated the GeoNEX Himawari-8 ~1 km MAIAC AOD retrieved over all the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) sites between 6°N-30°N and 91°E-127°E. The corresponding JMA Himawari-8 AOD products were also evaluated for comparison. We only used cloud-free and the best quality satellite AOD retrievals and compiled a total of 16,532 MAIAC-AERONET and 21,737 JMA-AERONET contemporaneous pairs of AOD values for 2017. Statistical analyses showed that both MAIAC and JMA data are highly correlated with AERONET AOD, with the correlation coefficient (R) of ~0.77, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of ~0.16. The absolute bias of MAIAC AOD (0.02 overestimation) appears smaller than that of the JMA AOD (0.05 underestimation). In comparison with the JMA data, the time series of MAIAC AOD were more consistent with AERONET AOD values and better capture the diurnal variations of the latter. The dependence of MAIAC AOD bias on scattering angles is also discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Geostationary satellites; Mean square error; NASA; Optical properties; Radiometers; Remote sensing; AERONET; Aerosol optical depths; GeoNEX; MAIAC; Validation; Atmospheric aerosols","AERONET; Aerosol optical depth (AOD); GeoNEX; MAIAC; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076506694"

This study used black pine as the research object and the multi-angle hyperspectral data from specific black pines canopy were collected through different infected periods, then, we analyzed the spectral characteristics by directional reflectance. The main results were as follows: (1) the reflectance of the backward scattering direction was greater than that of forward scattering direction in theprincipal plane when viewed from the top, in addition, in the backward scattering direction, during the four periods of infection, the four bands had hotspot effect at about 40° of zenith angle. Both in the principal plane and theorthogonal principal plane, the reflectance of pine canopy in the blue wavelengths (450 nm) and the near infrared wavelengths (810 nm) showed a change rule at the azimuth angle of 0°, that were, the early>the health>the metaphase>the end, the red light band (680 nm) and the green light band (560 nm) were the early≈the health>the metaphase≈the end. At all azimuth angles; the canopy reflectivity increased with the increase of observed zenith angle. (2) on upward observation, the reflectance of the forward scattering direction was greater thanthat of the backward scattering direction in the principal plane, in other words, the reflectance was bigger when the azimuth angle was 0°; Both in the principal plane and theorthogonal principal plane, the blue light band (450 nm) and the red light band (680 nm) and the green light band of pine canopy reflectance in azimuth angle were 0°, presenting the early>the health>the end>the metaphase, and the near infrared wavelengths (810 nm) is the early>he health>the metaphase>the end; For all azimuth angles, canopy reflectance decreased with the increase of observed zenith angle. (3) the anisotropy of the bidirectional reflectance of each feature band was the strongest in the principal plane and was the weakest in the main vertical plane, and the forward and backward reflectance of the main vertical surface presented symmetry, namely ""mirror reflection""; the reflectance of the canopy of black pine changed significantly with the observed zenith angle at the end of infection period, while it did not change significantly with the observed zenith Angle in other periods. The reflection characteristics of the canopy at different bands and angles can promote the accuracy and reliability of UAV remote sensing to monitorforest diseases at different scales, also promote the construction of portable and real-time diagnosis system for forest diseases, and achieve the rapid acquisition of hyperspectral data at single wood level. © 2019, Peking University Press.

The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI.

The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is used to estimate the directional dependency of the radiance. Previous research on BRDF has focused on oceanic waters; few studies on turbid inland waters have been conducted. In this article, using multi-angle MISR measurements, five semi-empirical BRDF models (MAG2002, Lee2004, Park-Ruddick 2005, Woerd-Pasterkamp2008, and Lee2011) were quantitatively compared, and an adaptive algorithm was proposed over a typical turbid inland lake, Taihu Lake, China. Our results reveal the following: 1) the Woerd-Pasterkamp2008 and Lee2011 models provide the best fits with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8; 2) when prior modeling parameters were used, the Lee2011 model was still the most accurate with RMSEs less than 1.1%, while the accuracy of the Woerd-Pasterkamp2008 model varied; and 3) the use of an adaptive algorithm including an empirical rule based on the ratio of (Formula presented.) improved the accuracy. The results provide a theoretical basis for BRDF models and BRDF effects over inland Case II waters.

However, due to the loss of global context information, the effect of semantic segmentation is still incomplete or misclassified. In this paper, we propose a multi-angle self-attention network (MASANet) to solve this problem. Specifically, we design a multi-angle self-attention module to enhance global context information, which uses three angles to enhance features and takes the obtained three features as the inputs of self-attention to further extract the global dependencies of features. In addition, atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) and global average pooling (GAP) further improve the overall performance. Finally, we concatenate the feature maps of different scales obtained in the feature extraction stage with the corresponding feature maps output by ASPP to further extract multi-scale features. The experimental results show that MASANet achieves good segmentation performance on high-resolution remote sensing images. In addition, the comparative experimental results show that MASANet is superior to some state-of-the-art models in terms of some widely used evaluation criteria. © 2022, Strojarski Facultet.

In this work, we evaluate the AOD (550 nm) retrievals during the extreme wildfire events over the western U.S. in September 2020. Three products are analyzed, including the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) product collections C6.0 and C6.1, and the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) AOD from the NOAA Enterprise Processing System (EPS) algorithm. Compared with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, all three products show strong linear correlations with MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS presenting overall low bias (<0.06). The accuracy of MAIAC C6.1 is found to be substantially improved with respect to MAIAC C6.0 that drastically underestimated AOD over thick smoke, which validates the effectiveness of updates made in MAIAC C6.1 in terms of an improved representation of smoke aerosol optical properties. VIIRS AOD exhibits comparable uncertainty with MAIAC C6.1 with a slight tendency of increased positive bias over the AERONET AOD range of 0.5–3.0. Averaging coincident retrievals from MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS provides a lower root mean square error and higher correlation than for the individual products, motivating the benefit of blending these datasets. MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS are further compared to provide insights on their retrieval strategy. When gridded at 0.1° resolution, MAIAC C6.1 and VIIRS provide similar monthly AOD distribution patterns and the latter exhibits a slightly higher domain average. On daily scale, over thick plumes near fire sources, MAIAC C6.1 reports more valid retrievals where VIIRS tends to have retrievals designated as low or medium quality, which tends to be due to internal quality checks. Over transported smoke near scattered clouds, VIIRS provides better retrieval coverage than MAIAC C6.1 owing to its higher spatial resolution, pixel-level processing, and less strict cloud masking. These results can be used as a guide for applications of satellite AOD retrievals during wildfire events and provide insights on future improvement of retrieval algorithms under heavy smoke conditions. © 2022 by the authors.","Aerosols; Blending; Fires; Mean square error; Optical properties; Optical remote sensing; Radiometers; Thermography (imaging); Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Enterprise processing; Infrared imaging radiometers; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Retrieval; Satellite remote sensing; VIIRS; Wildfire smoke; Smoke","aerosol optical depth; MODIS; retrieval; VIIRS; wildfire smoke","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143822957"

The spectral library plays an important role in improving the level of remote sensing applications. In this study, we established the ""Ground Object Background Spectral Library for Surveying and Mapping (GOSPEL)"" under the National Science and Technology Foundation Project to standardize and enrich China's spectral database and promote its application in the fields of surveying and mapping. Notable progress was observed in the construction of the ground feature spectrum library, warehousing, and preliminary exploration of application demonstrations. Moreover, the Ground Spectral Spectrum and Supporting Non-spectral Data Collection and Summary Standards, Spectral and Supporting Non-spectral Parameter Test Technical Specifications, and Feature Classification Code Standards were established on the basis of the existing spectrum acquisition and processing specifications. Since the implementation of the project, more than 14,000 existing spectral data were compiled and stored in accordance with the data norms and standards formulated by the project. In addition, nationwide spectrum collection experiments were organized and implemented involving the major regions in China, which acquired more than 17,000 ground feature spectra. Full-band experiments (visible-near infrared, infrared, and microwave bands) were performed in north and northeast China to obtain full-band data of snow, soil, vegetation canopy, and artificial target. To facilitate the application and sharing of spectral data, a ground feature spectral database (i.e., GOSPEL) and a data sharing platform containing more than 30,000 data were constructed. Twenty-five datasets were formed according to the type of ground feature spectral data and application requirements, including full-band typical feature spectrum dataset, multi-angle spectral reflectance dataset, multiscale typical feature reflectance dataset, and long-term series spectral dataset. We also performed application demonstrations on ground feature classification, remote sensing mechanism simulation, remote sensing quantitative inversion, and remote sensing product validation based on the current ground feature spectrum from GOSPEL. © 2020, Science Press.

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is based on reflectance at 531 and 570 nm, which has great potential in predicting the light use efficiency (LUE) and makes LUE related to plant optical characteristics. Despite the great achievement in understanding the correlation of PRI and LUE on forests, the application of PRI in estimating LUE on crops has almost been ignored. The present study reported the ability of multi-angle PRI to track eddy covariance (EC)-based LUE in a rice field in East China. We found that PRI can estimate LUE in sunny days (R2 = 0.4; p < 0.05). The correlation of PRI and LUE was greater than that at OZA of 0° (R2 = 0.4; p < 0.05) after distinguishing different OZAs and scatter directions and was the greatest in the backscatter direction with an OZA of 60° (R2 = 0.7; p < 0.01). This correlation was also corrected by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), where R2 = 0.72 after correction. We noted that the relationship between PRI and LUE on cloudy days was poor, where R2 = 0.26. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) had an influence on the LUE and PRI, while vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and air temperature (Ta) had negative influences on the correlation of PRI and LUE. Our research suggests that PRI can efficiently track the LUE of the rice growth period when considering environmental factors and rice canopy structures.

Currently, the study of clouds is mostly based on a two-dimensional (2-D) plane rather than a three-dimensional (3-D) space. However, 3-D cloud reconstruction is playing an important role not only in a radiation transmission calculation but in forecasting climate change as well. Currently, the study of clouds is mostly based on 2-D single angle satellite observation data while the importance of a 3-D structure of clouds in atmospheric radiation transmission is ignored. 3-D structure reconstruction would improve the radiation transmission accuracy of the cloudy atmosphere based on multi-angle observations data. Characterizing the 3-D structure of clouds is crucial for an extensive study of this complex intermediate medium in the atmosphere. In addition, it is also a great carrier for visualization of its parameters. Special attributes and the shape of clouds can be clearly illustrated in a 3-D cloud while these are difficult to describe in a 2-D plane. It provides a more intuitive expression for the study of complex cloud systems. In order to reconstruct a 3-D cloud structure, we develop and explore a ray casting algorithm applied to data from the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC), which is onboard the GF-5 satellite. In this paper, we use DPC with characteristics of imaging multiple angles of the same target, and characterize observations of clouds from different angles in 3-D space. This feature allows us to reconstruct 3-D clouds from different angles of observations. In terms of verification, we use cloud profile data provided by the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to compare with the results of reconstructed 3-D clouds based on DPC data. This shows that the reconstruction method has good accuracy and effectiveness. This 3-D cloud reconstruction method would lay a scientific reference for future analysis on the role of clouds in the atmosphere and for the construction of 3-D structures of aerosols. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric structure; Cameras; Climate change; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Rendering (computer graphics); Cloud structure; Cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarizations; DPC images; Multi-angle observations; Radiation transmission; Reconstruction method; Satellite observations; Threedimensional (3-d); Image reconstruction","3-D reconstructed cloud; Cloud boundary; Cloud structure; DPC images; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077912224"

Airborne hyperspectral data is widely utilized to retrieve leaf nitrogen concentration. Since the current algorithms cannot completely fulfill the accuracy requirement of precision agriculture, it is urgent to improve the retrieval accuracy of leaf nitrogen concentration. The accuracy of leaf nitrogen concentration retrieval is restricted by principle error and algorithm error. The principle error is generated in the process of specular reflection at the leaf surface. The radiant energy detected by sensors consists of a specular components and multiple scattering components. Solely the multiple scattering component carries vegetation biochemistry information (leaf nitrogen concentration, for instance). The specular component represents the energy reflected directly at the foliar wax layer, thus carries no inner information of the leaf. Based on the Fresnel formula, the specular component is partially polarized, and the multiple scattering component is unpolarized. Therefore, the principle error can be eliminated by the specular reflectance estimate, particularly with the aid of polarization reflectance modelling. The algorithm error is derived from the difference of airborne hyperspectral data mining capability between different algorithms. The performance of Partial Least Squares Regression, Principal Component Regression, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor Regression and Random Forest Regression are systematically compared in this research, and ultimately Random Forest Regression is chosen to reduce the algorithm error. In this research, in order to estimate the polarization reflectance of broadleaf and needle vegetation, multispectral data gained by POLDER/PARASOL satellite (equipped with multi-angle polarization sensors) are used to establish Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function model. Hyperspectral data gained by the HySpex sensor system is used to conduct high-precision retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration. Root Mean Square Error is taken as a major evaluation index. The conclusion is: After eliminating polarization reflectance in hyperspectral data, an average accuracy improvement of 4.244% is achieved among the above algorithms. Random Forest Regression is rather competitive by reaching 13.103% improvement in accuracy (RSQ 0.803, RMSE 0.252), which indicates that Random Forest is sensitive to polarization information. Compared to the basic method (Partial Least Squares Regression), the accuracy is improved by 32.440% after eliminating principle error and reducing algorithm error. In our research, the high-accuracy retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration is realized, proving the significance of eliminating polarization reflectance and indicates the potential of random forest regression in hyperspectral remote sensing retrieval. © 2021, Peking University Press.

Traditional multibeam bathymetry is limited by the high cost of largescale topographic surveys in large, shallow sand wave areas. Remote sensing inversion methods to detect shallow sand wave topography in Taiwan rely heavily on measured water depth data. To address these problems, this study proposes a largescale remote sensing inversion model of sand wave topography based on long short-term memory network machine learning. Using multi-angle sun glitter remote sensing to obtain sea surface roughness (SSR) information and by learning and training SSR and its corresponding water depth information, the sand wave topography of a largescale shallow sea sand wave region is extracted. The accuracy of the model is validated through its application to a 774 km2 area in the sand wave topography of the Taiwan Banks. The model obtains a root mean square error of 3.31–3.67 m, indicating that the method has good generalization capability and can achieve a largescale topographic understanding of shallow sand waves with some training on measured bathymetry data. Sand wave topography is widely present in tidal environments; our method has low requirements for ground data, with high application value. © 2021 by the authors.

We present the temporal variability of atmospheric aerosols over India and north Indian Ocean (NIO) for the past two decades (2000–2019). Here, the measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on Terra, and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements from Envisat, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data are considered. On average, the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) shows the largest (0.5–1.2), and NIO and Himalaya show the smallest (0.1 or smaller) Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) values. The peak AOD loading is observed in June–July-August, and IGP has a secondary peak in March owing to the stubble and biomass burning in winter months. In contrast, the peak aerosol loading in the northeast is in winter due to forest and biomass burning during the period there. The inter-annual variability is very small in NIO, Himalaya and Bay of Bengal. The trends estimated from the combined (AATSR, MISR, MODIS and MERRA-2) data show the highest positive trends at the lower IGP and east central regions, about 0.8–1.2/dec, and are statistically significant. This is consistent with the urban activity, industries and dense population there. However, the Desert, northern Himalaya and northern Arabian Sea show insignificant negative trends, from −0.2 to −0.4/dec, as the anthropogenic sources of aerosols are very limited there. The bias estimate shows that most satellite and reanalysis data are in very good agreement at all regions (within 0.1–0.2). Even though the bias in the measurements are considered, the trends estimated are still large enough to be statistically significant. The analyses, therefore, caution the increasing aerosol loading and their plausible climate feedback in these regions. The assessment also demonstrate the potential of synergetic use of multiple-platform measurements for climate system studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Arabian Sea; Bay of Bengal; Gangetic Plain; Himalayas; India; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Budget control; Ecosystems; Geodetic satellites; Radiometers; Spectrometers; Advanced-along track scanning radiometers; Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic sources; Interannual variability; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Research and application; Retrospective analysis; aerosol; Along Track Scanning Radiometer; annual variation; anthropogenic source; biomass burning; climate feedback; Envisat; MODIS; observational method; optical depth; radiation budget; satellite data; Terra (satellite); Loading","AATSR; Aerosols; Climate change; India; Indian Ocean; MERRA; MISR; MODIS; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101844082"

SPEXone will fly together with the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) and the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter-2 (HARP-2) on the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Clouds and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, which has a notional launch in 2023. SPEXone will deliver high quality hyperspectral multi-angle radiance and polarization products that, together with products from OCI and HARP2, enable unprecedented aerosol and cloud characterization from space. SPEXone employs dual beam spectral polarization modulation, in which the state of linear polarization is encoded in a spectrum as a periodic variation of the intensity. This technique enables high polarimetric accuracies in operational environments, since it provides snapshot acquisition of both radiance and polarization without moving parts. SPEXone has five viewing angles that are realized using a novel three-mirror segmented telescope assembly. The telescope focuses light captured by the five viewing angles onto a single image plane consisting of five stacked sub-slits. This multi-slit forms the entrance slit of a reflective grating spectrometer that consists of freeform mirrors and an order-sorting filter close to the focal plane, yielding an intrinsic spectral resolution of 2 nm and 5.4 km spatial resolution across the 100 km swath. The spectrometer re-images two spectral images per viewing angle following a dual beam spectral polarization modulation implementation. In this contribution, the optical performance of the telescope and spectrometer will be presented by means of star stimulus measurements at the slit plane and at the spectrometer focal plane. Measurements of the optical spot quality and preliminary measurements of stray light are compared with the optical design and with stray light simulations. We find that the measured optical performance of the telescope and spectrometer is better than modelled, showing higher resolution and lower slit keystone, thereby meeting all spatial and spectral resolution requirements. Also, preliminary stray light results indicate a higher diffuse but lower ghost contribution to the total stray light, which is in general beneficial for implementing stray light correction, which will enhance the polarimetric accuracy in inhomogeneous scenes. © 2021 ESA and CNES","Atmospheric aerosols; Ellipsometry; Focusing; Mirrors; Modulation; NASA; Optical design; Polarization; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Spectrometers; Spectroscopy; Stray light; Aerosol clouds; Multi angle; Ocean ecosystems; Optical performance; Plankton, aerosol, cloud and ocean ecosystem; Remote-sensing; Spectral modulation; Spectropolarimetry; SPEXone; Viewing angle; Polarimeters","Atmospheric aerosol; Multi-angle; PACE; Remote sensing; Spectral modulation; Spectropolarimetry; SPEXone","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116025408"

Such observations can be performed by thermal sensors onboard lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to their flexibility in sampling from different directions. This study designed a straightforward and efficient protocol to obtain quasi-synchronous multi-angle USTs based on a lightweight UAV for a typical residential area in Nanjing (China). By using this protocol, we retrieved a directional brightness temperature (DBT) dataset with 73 DBTs 12 times throughout the diurnal cycle. Our results exhibited that the diurnal UTA intensity (UTAI) well corresponds to that of air temperature: the maximum UTAI (14.0 °C) occurred around 14:00 to 15:00 local time, and the minimum (3.5 °C) occurred at night. Interestingly, the nighttime DBT variations were found to depend both on viewing zenith and azimuth angles, and a slight hotspot effect was identified. These findings notably differ from previous studies based on modeling, which often assumed the independence of the nighttime DBT of the viewing azimuth angle and the absence of the hotspot effect. The analogous pattern of UTA between the daytime and nighttime (especially before midnight) was seemingly driven by a remarkable temperature contrast among urban surface components that can persist for many hours after sunset. Thus, the designed observation protocol can be applied to retrieve quasi-synchronous multi-angle USTs for other types of urban surfaces, thereby facilitating a complete understanding of diurnal UTA variations and assisting the validations of UTA models. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","China; Fujian; Nanjing [Fujian]; Anisotropy; Antennas; Atmospheric temperature; Luminance; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial vehicle; Anisotropy modeling; Directional brightness temperatures; Land surface temperature; Multi angle; Quasi-synchronous; Thermal anisotropy; Thermal remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Urban thermal anisotropy; brightness temperature; remote sensing; residential location; satellite data; satellite imagery; surface temperature; urban atmosphere; Surface properties","Directional brightness temperature; Land surface temperature; Thermal remote sensing; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Urban thermal anisotropy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135388621"

Among the many advancements that have since resulted from the launch of MISR is progress in the retrieval of aerosols from passive space-based remote sensing. The MISR operational standard aerosol (SA) retrieval algorithm has been refined several times over the last 20 years, resulting in significant improvements to spatial resolution (now 4.4 km) and aerosol particle properties. However, the MISR SA still suffers from large biases in retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) as aerosol loading increases. Here, we present a new MISR research aerosol (RA) retrieval algorithm that utilizes over-land surface reflectance data from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) to address these biases. This new over-land and over-water algorithm produces a self-consistent aerosol and surface retrieval when aerosol loading is low (AOD <0.75); this is combined with a prescribed surface algorithm using a bounded-variable least squares solver when aerosol loading is elevated (AOD 1.5). The two algorithms (prescribed + retrieved surface) are then merged as part of our combined surface retrieval algorithm. Results are compared with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) validation sun-photometer direct-sun + almucantar inversion retrievals. Over land, with AERONET AOD (550 nm) direct-sun observations as the standard, the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the MISR RA combined retrieval (nCombining double low line11563) is 0.084, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.935 and expected error of ±(0.20×[MISRAOD]+0.02). For MISR RA retrieved AOD 0.5 (nCombining double low line664), we report an Ångström exponent (ANG) RMSE of 1/40.35, with a correlation coefficient of 0.844. Retrievals of ANG, fine-mode fraction (FMF), and single-scattering albedo (SSA) improve as retrieved AOD increases. For AOD 1.5 (nCombining double low line66), FMF RMSE is <0.09 with correlation 0.95, and SSA RMSE is 0.015 with a correlation coefficient of 1/40.75. Over water, comparing AERONET AOD to the MISR RA combined retrieval (nCombining double low line4596), MISR RA RMSE is 0.063 and r is 0.935, with an expected error of ±(0.15×[MISRAOD]+0.02). ANG sensitivity is excellent when MISR RA reported AOD 0.5 (nCombining double low line188), with an RMSE of 0.27 and rCombining double low line0.89. Due to a lack of coincidences with AOD 1 (nCombining double low line21), our conclusions about MISR RA high-AOD particle property retrievals over water are less robust (FMF RMSE Combining double low line0.155 and rCombining double low line0.94, whereas SSA RMSE Combining double low line0.010 and rCombining double low line0.50). In general, better aerosol particle property constraints can be made at lower AOD over water compared to our over-land retrievals. It is clear from the results presented that the new MISR RA has quantitative sensitivity to FMF and SSA (and qualitative sensitivity to non-sphericity) when retrieved AOD exceeds 1, with qualitative sensitivity to aerosol type at lower AOD, while also eliminating the AOD bias found in the MISR SA at higher AODs. These results also demonstrate the advantage of using a prescribed surface when aerosol loading is elevated. © 2022 Copernicus GmbH.

To test this hypothesis, referred to the spectral invariance hypothesis, JPL's Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) was used to measure the polarized bidirectional reflectance factors (pBRFs) of different types of outdoor surfaces. GroundMSPI measures the linear polarization Stokes parameters ($I$, $Q$, and $U$) at three wavebands centered at 470, 660, and 865 nm. Images of pBRF were acquired at the three wavelengths and the best-fitting slopes of pairwise spectral regressions were determined. The spectral invariance hypothesis predicts that these slopes should be unity. All region types, excluding grass, meet this criterion within 8% for all three wavelengths. Grass measurements show a large mean deviation of 31.1% from the expected slope when regressing 865-nm data against other wavelengths due to the differences in the spectral absorbance of chlorophyll. Angle of linear polarization (AoLP) analysis of cotton crops is presented as a method to isolate cases where the scattered light is dominated by single reflection within the plants from cases where multiple scattering plays a larger role. Spectral invariance is observed in those cases where specular reflection from the top surfaces of the leaves is primarily responsible for the measured polarization. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Gossypium hirsutum; Distribution functions; Polarization; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Bi-directional reflectance factors; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Diffuse scattering; Land surface; Linear polarization; Multi-angle; bidirectional reflectance; ground-based measurement; hypothesis testing; land surface; polarization; remote sensing; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; variance analysis; Surface scattering","Angle of linear polarization (AoLP); diffuse scattering of vegetation; land surface reflection; Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI); polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution function (pBRDF); polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF); polarized reflection of vegetation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078358862"

Large-scale mid-infrared (MIR) emissivity can be efficiently obtained using remote sensing technology, but current methods mainly rely on prior knowledge and multi-temporal or multi-angle remote sensing images, and additional errors may be introduced due to the uncertainty of external data such as atmospheric profiles and the inconsistency of multiple source data in spatial resolution, observation time, and other information. In this paper, a new practical method was proposed which can retrieve MIR emissivity with only a single image input by combining the radiance properties of TIR and MIR channels and the spatial information of remote sensing images based on the Sentinel-3 Sea and land surface temperature radiometer (SLSTR) data. Two split-window (SW) algorithms that use TIR channels only and MIR and TIR channels to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) were developed separately, and the initial values of MIR emissivity were obtained from the known LST and TIR emissivity. Under the assumption that the atmospheric conditions in the local area are constant, the radiance transfer equations for adjacent pixels are iterated to optimize the initial values to obtain stable estimation results. The experimental results based on the simulation dataset and real SLSTR images showed that the proposed method can achieve accurate MIR emissivity results. In future work, factors such as angular effects, solar radiance, and the influence of atmospheric water vapor will be further considered to improve performance. © 2022 by the authors.","Algorithms; Climate; Remote Sensing Technology; Temperature; algorithm; land surface; radiative transfer; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; algorithm; climate; remote sensing; temperature","land surface emissivity; middle infrared; remote sensing; Sentinel-3 SLSTR; split-window algorithm; thermal infrared","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145970299"

For a given target, DOLP determines the magnitude of It has been proved that DOLP can be used for some remote monitoring cases that cannot be well detected with either non-polarized or polarized reflectance. Several bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF) models have been proposed in the last several decades to reproduce the angular distribution of R, but much less attention has been devoted to modeling and analyzing of DOLP. In this study, the Nadal-Bréon BPDF model was transferred for calculating the DOLP of earth targets, and characteristics of DOLP were analyzed based on the modeling results. To evaluate the model's feasibility, two experiments were executed: a fitting and a a priori modeling. The results showed good correlations ( r>0.9 ) between estimated and measured DOLP when the model was fitted with POLDER/PARASOL (a space-borne multi-angle multi-spectral polarimetric sensor) measurements. An increase of accuracy from 490 nm to 865 nm for fitting modeling was achieved and the highest accuracy was found at 865 nm for both experiments, with overall relative root mean square errors of 1.1 and 1.3 for fitting and a priori modeling, respectively. Class-based free parameters can be used for the a priori model of DOLP. The dispersion of the target-based free parameters controls the correlation of the a priori modeling results. Moreover, the maximum DOLP was found to be strongly determined by the corresponding bidirectional reflectance factor for every surface type This study provides an additional approach for obtaining DOLP from remote sensing platform and is helpful for studies of typical land surfaces.  © 2013 IEEE.","Angular distribution; Mean square error; Reflection; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Bi-directional reflectance factors; Bidirectional polarization distribution functions; Degree of linear polarization; Good correlations; Polarimetric sensors; Polarized reflectances; Remote sensing platforms; Root mean square errors; Polarization","bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF); BRDF-BPDF database; Degree of linear polarization (DOLP); POLDER/PARASOL","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096344055"

Thus, remote sensing is no longer far away. With the rapid development of aerospace and aviation remote sensing technology, a new era of three-dimensional, multi-level, multi-angle, omni-directional, and all-weather earth observation has arrived. How to activate the value of data and better serve industry applications so as to meet the rapidly growing demand for remote sensing applications has become an urgent issue for remote sensing companies. As a bridge between remote sensing data and industry applications, remote sensing image processing software plays an irreplaceable role in the process of remote sensing industrialization. With the implementation of major strategic projects such as ""China's High-Resolution Earth Observation System"" (high-score special project) and ""National Medium-term to Long-term Civilian Space Infrastructure Development Plan (2015-2025)"", domestic high-score remote sensing data is becoming more abundant. Whether these valuable data can play its value and how much value it can play depends on the conversion process from high-scoring remote sensing data to effective information and application services. The value of remote sensing data requires excellent remote sensing image processing software for mining and analysis. At the same time, vigorously developing independent and controllable remote sensing image processing software has increasingly become an urgent requirement to ensure national information security, implement the strategy of aerospace power, enhance technological innovation, and serve social development. Through the research and analysis of the development process of remote sensing satellite data and remote sensing software in China and abroad, the domestic remote sensing software has experienced three stages of development: the budding period, the catch-up period, and the independent innovation period. The remote sensing image processing software pixel information expert (PIE) is taken as an example to illustrate the development progress, typical applications, and future technological development directions of domestic remote sensing software. PIE, a domestically made remote sensing image processing software, was independently developed by PIESAT Information Technology Co., Ltd. (http: //www.piesat.cn/). While opening the application of cloud service platform, PIE has evolved from a single general-purpose software plug-in architecture to 3S integration, multi-platform, and multi-load cluster processing; from pure satellite remote sensing image processing to aerospace integrated platform; and from optical load to application mode of optics, radar, and hyperspectral full spectrum. PIE6.0 has developed from a general remote sensing image processing software to PIE-Basic remote sensing image processing software, PIE-Ortho satellite image surveying and mapping processing software, PIE-SAR radar image data processing software, PIE-Hyp hyperspectral image data processing software, PIE-UAV unmanned aerial vehicle image data processing software, PIE-SIAS scale set image analysis software, PIE-AI remote sensing image intelligent processing software, PIE-Map geographic information system software, and many other ""families"". PIE6.0 has five core capabilities: comprehensive support for multi-source remote sensing loads, intelligent extraction of full-spectrum element information, deep integration of multi-industry and full-business chains, rapid processing of massive remote sensing data, and complete control of independent property rights programs. In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for remote sensing applications, we should build an intelligent, high-performance, and practical remote sensing image processing system; provide a wider, more refined, and more in-depth special service; and gradually develop and improve market mechanisms to establish sustainable development of remote sensing industry capabilities. Domestic remote sensing software continues to develop key technologies, such as remote sensing spatiotemporal big data storage management, intelligent synthesis, incremental cascading update, cleaning analysis and mining, and information security, to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing and knowledge mining and decision support capabilities and to build shared data and codes. The open platform of methods promotes multi-source heterogeneous data sharing and interoperability. In the future, domestic remote sensing software will closely follow industry applications and public needs, advanced technology integration and collaboration, remote sensing on-orbit intelligent real-time processing, and one-stop refined remote sensing cloud services. PIE will continue to increase the contribution rate of science and technology; promote the modernization of remote sensing application capabilities; strengthen the cross-integration of remote sensing applications with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies; continue to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing, knowledge discovery, and decision support capabilities; and realize the on-demand acquisition of remote sensing data, the rapid transmission of data, and the focused services of thematic information, so that multi-source remote sensing data can truly become a powerful weapon to promote resource investigation, environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and so on. © 2021, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

However, the existing retrieval algorithms fail to derive soil moisture with expected accuracy. Insufficient understanding of the effects of soil and vegetation parameters on the backscatters is an important reason for this failure. To this end, we present a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to quantify the effects of parameters on the dual-polarized backscatters of Sentinel-1 based on a Water Cloud Model (WCM) and multiple global SA methods. The identification of the incidence angle and polarization of Sentinel-1 and the description scheme of vegetation parameters (A, B and α) in WCM are especially emphasized in this analysis towards an optimal estimation of parameters. Multiple SA methods derive identical parameter importance ranks, indicating that a highly reasonable and reliable SA is performed. Comparison between two existing vegetation description schemes shows that the scheme using Vegetation Water Content (VWC) outperforms the scheme combing particle moisture content and VWC. Surface roughness, soil moisture, VWC, and B, are most sensitive on the backscatters. Variation of parameter sensitivity indices with incidence angle at different polarizations indicates that VV-and VH-polarized backscatters at small incidence angles are the optimal options for soil moisture and surface roughness estimation, respectively, while VV-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles is well-suited for VWC and B estimation and HH-polarized backscatter is well suited for roughness estimation. This analysis improves the understanding of the effects of vegetated surface parameters on multi-angle and multi-polarized backscatters of Sentinel-1 SAR, informing improvement in SAR-based soil moisture retrieval. © 2021 by the authors.

Accurate estimation of CCC from remote-sensing data benefits from including information on leaf chlorophyll and canopy structures. However, conventional nadir reflectance is usually subject to the lack of an adequate expression on the geometric structures and shaded parts of vegetation canopy, and the derived vegetation indices (VIs) are prone to be saturated at high CCC level. Using 3-year field experiments with different wheat cultivars, leaf colors, structural types, and growth stages, and integrated with PROSPECT+SAILh model simulation, we studied the potential of multi-angle reflectance data for the improved estimation of CCC. The characteristics of angular anisotropy in spectral reflectance were investigated. Analyses based on both simulated and experimental multi-angle hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of 20 existing VIs at different viewing angles, and to propose an algorithm to develop novel biangular-combined vegetation indices (BCVIs) for tracking CCC dynamics in wheat. The results indicated that spectral reflectance values, as well as the coefficient of determination (R2) between mono-angular VIs and CCC, at back-scattering directions, were mostly higher than those at forward-scattering directions. Mono-angular VIs at +30° angle, were closest to the hot-spot position in our case, achieved the highest R2 among 13 viewing angles including the nadir observation. The general formulation for the newly developed BCVIs was BCVIVI = f × VI(θ1) − (1 − f) × VI(θ2), in which the VI was used to characterize chlorophyll status, while the subtraction of VI at θ1 and θ2 viewing angles in a proportion was used to highlight the canopy structural information. From our result, the values of the θ1 and θ2 around hot-spot and dark-spot positions, and the f of 0.6 or 0.7 were found as the optimized values. Through comparisons revealed that large improvements on CCC modeling could be obtained by the BCVIs, especially for the experimental data, indicated by the increase in R2 by 25.1–51.4%, as compared to the corresponding mono-angular VIs at +30° angle. The BCVIMCARI[705,750] was proved to greatly undermine the saturation effect of mono-angular MCARI[705,750], expressing the best linearity and the most sensitive to CCC, with R2 of 0.98 and 0.72 for simulated and experimental data, respectively. Our study will eventually have extensive prospects in monitoring crop phenotype dynamics in for example large breeding trials.

Hence, the spectral indices derived from LULC ((Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), Enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and Normalized difference build-up index (NDBI)) with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) high spatial resolution (1 km) AOD from the years 2010–2019 (less to high urbanized period) has been correlated. The current study used remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to examine changes in LULC in the current study region over the ten years (2010–2019) and the relationship between LULC and AOD. A significant increase in built-up areas (12.18%) and grasslands (51.29%) was observed during 2010–2019, while cropland decreased by 4.42%. A positive correlation between NDBI and SAVI (0.35, 0.27) indicates that built-up soils play an important role in accumulating AOD in a semi-arid region. At the same time, a negative correlation between NDVI and EVI (−0.24, −0.15) indicates the removal of aerosols due to an increase in vegetation. The results indicate that SAVI can play an important role in PM2.5 modeling in semi-arid regions.

The colour-ratio technique has been widely used in mapping planetary surfaces, but its solar phase-Angle dependence is not well understood. Understanding the phase-Angle dependence of the colour ratio would enhance our abilities in interpreting planetary remote sensing data. Aims. We aim to investigate the dependence of the colour ratio indices on mineralogy, phase angle, particle size, and the degree of simulated space weathering. Methods. We measured the multi-band (i.e. 458, 633, 750, and 905 nm) and multi-Angle reflectance spectra of four typical lunar-Type minerals with different particle sizes using a custom multi-Angular imaging device. Results. The colour ratio does have a phase-Angle dependence that is more sensitive to the mineralogy and wavelength and less sensitive to particle size distribution. Conclusions. The combined analysis of the colour ratio and its phase dependence can improve efficiency in mapping the lunar surface. With a prior knowledge of the phase behaviours of colour ratios of specific lunar-Type minerals, an optimised colour ratio at certain phase angles can be found to efficiently distinguish the composition of a target surface.  © ESO 2020.","Color; Lunar surface analysis; Mapping; Minerals; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Space optics; Combined analysis; Different particle sizes; Phase angle dependence; Phase dependence; Planetary remote sensing; Planetary surfaces; Reflectance spectrum; Space weathering; Remote sensing","Instrumentation: photometers; Moon; Planets and satellites: composition; Planets and satellites: surfaces; Techniques: photometric","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097087359"

Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the atmospheric point spread function (PSF) that are appropriate for the off-nadir optical remote sensing. By the convolution of the atmospheric PSF and the surface-leaving radiance, the radiance caused by the adjacency effect could be calculated. The influence factor analysis shows that, in addition to the surface albedo and the meteorological range, the viewing direction will affect the adjacency effect dramatically. With the deviation of the viewing zenith angle from the nadir, adjacency effect becomes weak. Unlike the nadir remote sensing, the adjacency effect in off-nadir remote sensing is azimuthally dependent and the contribution of the background in the viewing direction is greater than others. Based on a three-dimensional scene and a whole chain optical imaging simulation software, the images before the optical system of the sensor with and without the adjacency effect are simulated. The calculation of the SNR, contrast and spatial resolution of the images reveals that the adjacency effect seriously degrades the image quality.

In this contribution, we discuss the polarimetrie calibration of the multi-angle Polarimeter ""SPEX airborne"". SPEX airborne is a multi-angle viewing instrument providing snapshot measurements of spectral radiance and degree of linear polarization at fixed viewing angles. Radiance and polarization are measured as a continuous function of wavelength in the 400-760nm range, at nine viewing angles equally distributed over an angular range of -56° to +56°. Each viewing-angle aperture has a swath of 7° with an instantaneous field of view of 0.5°x 1° (cross-times along-track). SPEX airborne measures the degree and angle of linear polarization of scattered sunlight by means of spectral modulation. For each field of view, the instrument records two modulated spectra. Ideally, these are perfectly in anti-phase, such that the sum of the modulated spectra is modulation free and gives the spectral radiance. The state of linear polarization is derived from the scaled difference of the modulated spectra. As a result of finite image quality at the focal plane, any spectropolarimeter using spectral modulation will show different polarimetrie responses for the two modulated spectra, which breaks the anti-phase symmetry. For SPEX airborne this is indeed the case, and special care is taken both in the calibration and in the data processing. Ignoring this can lead to errors both in polarimetrie and radiometric measurements. It is shown however that these errors are quite small. In this contribution, we will outline the spectral modulation technique employed by SPEX airborne to measure the state of linear polarization, explain which instrumental parameters are to be determined by calibration and how they feature in the data processing chain. We discuss the polarization calibration setup and how polarization calibration measurements are processed into useful calibration data. Taking a Mueller matrix approach, we show how differences in polarimetrie responses can be mitigated, while also other imperfections like telescope polarization are accounted for without extra calibration effort. We also present a scheme to correct for sharp features in the solar spectrum, which would otherwise mix into the modulation spectra via the finite slit-width of the spectrometer and result in polarimetrie errors.

In response to this problem, this paper proposes a machine learning cloud detection algorithm that combines active and passive remote sensing satellites. The algorithm is based on the multi-channel multi-angle polarization characteristics of the POLDER3 payload and the high-precision cloud vertical characteristics of the CALIOP payload. It uses POLDER3 payload and CALIOP. The load observation overlaps the regional data, and the BP neural network optimized by the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is built to train the cloud detection model. Based on the cloud detection training model, a cloud detection experiment was carried out using POLDER3 level-1 data. The experiment showed that the cloud detection result of this algorithm is 92.46% consistent with the MODIS cloud detection product, which is higher than the consistency between the official POLDER3 cloud detection product and the MODIS cloud detection product 83.13%. By comparing the experimental results of the algorithm in this paper with the optical characteristics of different pixels from the official POLDER3 cloud detection product, it is found that compared with the official POLDER3 algorithm, this algorithm is more sensitive to thin clouds over the bright surface and can perform cloud detection more effectively. © 2021, Science Press.

The usefulness of almost every type of active and passive sensor deployed on air or spaceborne platforms has been examined in the past. The advent and the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during the last decade have opened up many new opportunities for earthquake damage mapping. The main advantages of UAVs are the high spatial resolution, the possibility to acquire stereo images and produce both orthophotos and Digital Surface Models, and the flexibility of the platform. Earthquake-induced strain and rupture traces are expressed on the surface and imprinted in the topography on the landscapes of fault zones. UAVs provide an efficient and flexible solution for the acquisition of multi-Angle imagery in order to reconstruct in fine scale the fault zone topography. The combination with RTK GNSS measurements provide the necessary accuracy to the final maps. A characteristic post-earthquake response based on UAV, GNSS and TLS technologies is presented in the current study. On March 3, 2021 (10:16:10 UTC) an earthquake with magnitude of 6.3 struck Thessaly, central Greece. The earthquake occurred in a region primarily characterized by active NW-SE trending normal faults, which belong to the Northern Thessaly fault zone. On March 4, 2021, (18:38:19 UTC), another earthquake struck the same area with magnitude 5.9. The University of Patras team detected innumerable lateral spreading, and liquefaction sand boils in close proximity with the active fault trace in the earthquake epicentral area. All these secondary earthquake environmental effects were mapped with UAV and traced with RTK GNSS. Co-seismic surface offset on the fault trace measured over than 25 cm. Our team mapped several places showing clear tectonic deformatin, although the intense agricultural modifications due to human activities disturbed the near surface stratigraphy. Therefore, only one favorable site for trenching was found. Two trenches 10 m long and 2.0 m wide with a maximum depth of almost 2.5 m were excavated and then mapped both by terrestrial photogrammetry and by a Terrestrial Laser Scanner.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Currently, ground measurement points of PM2.5 in China are relatively discrete, thereby limiting spatial cover-age. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data obtained from satellite remote sensing provide insights into spatiotemporal distributions for regional pollution sources. In this study, data from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD (1 km resolution) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and hourly PM2.5 concentration ground measurements from 2015 to 2020 in Dalian, China were used. Although trends in PM2.5 and AOD were consistent over time, there were seasonal differences. Spatial distributions of AOD and PM2.5 were consistent (R2 = 0.922), with higher PM2.5 values in industrial areas. The method of cross-dividing the test set by year was adopted, with AOD and meteorological factors as the input variable and PM2.5 as the output variable. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model of joint cross-validation was established; the stability of the model was evaluated. The trend in the predicted values of BPNN was consistent with the monitored values; the estimation result of the BPNN with the introduction of meteorological factors is better; coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE standard deviation (SD) between the predicted values and the monitored values in the test set were 0.663– 0.752 and 0.01–0.05 µg/m3, respectively. The BPNN was simpler and the training time was shorter compared with those of a regression model and support vector regression (SVR). This study demon-strated that BPNN could be effectively applied to the MAIAC AOD data to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. © 2022 by the authors.

This work is a significant attempt to use the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characteristics of mixed pixels in the prediction of spatial-heterogeneity metrics. Data sets from this function with different spatial distributions were constructed by the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model, and three spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics were calculated: percentage of like adjacencies, spatial division index, and aggregation index. A simple linear regression method was used to construct the prediction model of spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics. The potential of multiangle remote sensing model for identifying spatial patterns well was demonstrated, and its importance was found to differ for different spatial aggregation and dispersion metrics. Specifically, the precision of the model based on multiangle reflectance used for predicting the spatial division index could meet a minimum root mean square of 5.95%. The reflectance features from backward observation on the principal plane play the leading role in recognizing the spatial heterogeneity of mixed pixels. The prediction model is sufficiently robust to distinguish the same vegetation with different growth trends, but also performs well when the ground objects have a smaller reflectance difference in the mixed pixels in a certain band. This study is expected to offer a new thought for spatial-heterogeneity identification of ground objects and thus promote the development of remote sensing technology in assessing spatial distribution. © 2020 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Dispersions; Distribution functions; Forecasting; Pixels; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Multi-angle remote sensing; Multiangle reflectances; Radiative transfer model; Reflectance differences; Remote sensing technology; Simple linear regression; Vegetation remote sensing; bidirectional reflectance; decomposition analysis; heterogeneity; pixel; remote sensing; simulation; spatial distribution; vegetation type; Spatial distribution","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079877292"

A noteworthy aspect of MISR observations over the ocean is that, for much of the Earth, some of the multi-angle views have contributions from solar reflection by the ocean surface (glint, or glitter), while others do not. Aerosol retrieval algorithms often discard these glint-influenced observations because they can overwhelm the signal and are difficult to predict without knowledge of the (wind-speed-driven) ocean surface roughness. However, theoretical studies have shown that multi-angle observations of a location at geometries with and without reflected sun glint can be a rich source of information, sufficient to support simultaneous retrieval of both the aerosol state and the wind speed at the ocean surface. We are in the early stages of creating such an algorithm. In this paper, we describe our assessment of the appropriate level of parameterization for simultaneous aerosol and ocean surface property retrievals using sun glint. For this purpose, we use generalized nonlinear retrieval analysis (GENRA), an information content assessment (ICA) technique employing Bayesian inference, and simulations from the Ahmad-Fraser iterative radiative transfer code. We find that four parameters are suitable: aerosol optical depth (τ), particle size distribution (expressed as the fine mode fraction f of small particles in a bimodal size distribution), surface wind speed (w), and relative humidity (r, to define the aerosol water content and complex refractive index). None of these parameters define ocean optical properties, as we found that the aerosol state could be retrieved with the nine MISR near-infrared views alone, where the ocean body is strongly absorbing in the open ocean. We also found that retrieval capability varies with observation geometry and that as τ increases so does the ability to determine aerosol intensive optical properties (r and f, while it decreases for w). Increases in w decrease the ability to determine the true value of that parameter but have minimal impact on retrieval of aerosol properties. We explored the benefit of excluding the two most extreme MISR view angles for which radiative transfer with the plane-parallel approximation is less certain, but we found no advantage in doing so. Finally, the impact of treating wind speed as a scalar parameter, rather than as a two-parameter directional wind, was tested. While the simpler scalar model does contribute to overall aerosol uncertainty, it is not sufficiently large to justify the addition of another dimension to parameter space. An algorithm designed upon these principles is in development. It will be used to perform an atmospheric correction with MISR for coincident ocean color (OC) observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, also on the NASA Terra spacecraft. Unlike MISR, MODIS is a single-view-angle instrument, but it has a more complete set of spectral channels ideal for determination of optical ocean properties. The atmospheric correction of MODIS OC data can therefore benefit from MISR aerosol retrievals. Furthermore, higher-spatial-resolution data from coincident MISR observations may also improve glint screening.. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Multiangle remote sensing could effectively extract spatial structural information from different plant layers. The objectives of this study were to improve the monitoring accuracy of WPM severity and to screen suitable observation angles by developing a novel vegetation index. The monitoring capacities of the novel parameters [Normalized Powdery Mildew Index (NPMI) and Ratio Powdery Mildew Index (RPMI)] and 14 optimized traditional spectral parameters were compared at 13 observation angles and different angle ranges. The correlation between all spectral parameters and disease severity was superior in the forward observation direction than in the backward observation direction in the principal plane of the Sun, and the correlation between the two observation directions decreased with an increase in observation angle. The new spectral parameter suitable for inversion of disease index was RPMI ( {R}_{744}/{R}_{762}-0.5 \times R_{710} ), and the best optimal observation angle was +10°, with a 0.852 coefficient, which was 31.74% higher than that of the two-band spectral parameter, {R}_{744}/{R}_{762}. The fitting accuracy of the new parameter in the range of 0° to +30° in the forward direction was 0.704. RPMI could not only improve the monitoring accuracy of powdery mildew severity at a single angle but also achieve a more stable monitoring accuracy in the 0° to +30° range in the forward direction, which significantly expands the application scope of remote sensing monitoring and enhances the flexibility of the technology in actual production environments. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Fungi; Monitoring; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Monitoring accuracy; Multi-angle remote sensing; Optimal observation; Production environments; Remote sensing monitoring; Spatial structural information; Spectral parameters; disease severity; fungal disease; monitoring; NDVI; remote sensing; wheat; Remote sensing","Band combination; disease severity; observation angle; powdery mildew; wheat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099785294"

Here, we collected LNC data and hyperspectral data at the canopy scale, from 13 view zenith angles (VZAs) and two locations (Zhengzhou and Shangshui, in China) across 2 years (2012–2014). Four data processing methods—vegetation indices (VIs), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost), and partial least squares regression (PLSR)—were applied and compared for their ability to estimate LNC under 13 VZAs. These results revealed consistent trends in the performance of the four algorithms at 13 VZAs: the nadir direction is better than the extreme angle, and the best performance is obtained for the range of –30° to 0° (R2 ≥ 0.83; RMSE ≤ 0.41%). The number of bands is a critical factor affecting the accuracy of LNC monitoring: including red edge bands can alleviate angular effect to some extent. The accuracy of PLSR for monitoring LNC is not only superior near the nadir direction (R2 = 0.91), but also better than that provided VIs (16%–17%), BPNN (15%–16%), or XGBoost (29%–58%) at ± 60°. Therefore, it is strongly recommended the PLSR algorithm be used to process multi-angle remote sensing data to estimate the LNC of field crops.

Snow liquid-water and its melt/refreeze are retrieved from microwave antenna temperatures measured with the ground-based L-band radiometer ELBARA-III. The emission model (EM) used in the retrieval is a two-layer configuration of the 'L-Band Specific Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpack'. Consistent snow wetness retrievals were achieved from both single-and multi-Angle CR observations of L-band antenna temperatures. This suggests that multi-Angle observation is not a pre-requisite for snow wetness retrieval. Therefore, in addition to soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) multi-Angle measurements, snow wetness can be estimated from spaceborne L-band brightness temperatures measured at a single observation angle, such as from NASA's SMAP satellite. Our results provide partial validation of a recently presented snow wetness retrieval approach based on the same EM and applied over Greenland using multi-Angle SMOS brightness temperatures. Agreement between measured CR antenna temperatures and SMOS brightness temperatures is found to be within the 95% confidence intervals of ELBARA-III and SMOS measurement uncertainties. Our measurements confirm the modeled response of antenna temperatures to diurnal variations of snow wetness. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

Previous work has demonstrated some links between smoke properties and factors such as fuel type and meteorology. However, the factors controlling BB particle speciation at emission are not adequately understood nor are the factors driving particle aging during atmospheric transport. As such, modeling wildfire smoke impacts on climate and air quality remains challenging. The potential to provide robust, statistical characterizations of BB particles based on ecosystem type and ambient environmental conditions with remote sensing data is investigated here. Space-based Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) observations, combined with the MISR Research Aerosol (RA) algorithm and the MISR Interactive Explorer (MINX) tool, are used to retrieve smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD) and to provide constraints on plume vertical extent; smoke age; and particle size, shape, light-absorption properties, and absorption spectral dependence. These tools are applied to numerous wildfire plumes in Canada and Alaska, across a range of conditions, to create a regional inventory of BB particle-type temporal and spatial distribution. We then statistically compare these results with satellite measurements of fire radiative power (FRP) and land cover characteristics, as well as short-term climate, meteorological, and drought information from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) reanalysis and the North American Drought Monitor. We find statistically significant differences in the retrieved smoke properties based on land cover type, with fires in forests producing the thickest plumes containing the largest, brightest particles and fires in savannas and grasslands exhibiting the opposite. Additionally, the inferred dominant aging mechanisms and the timescales over which they occur vary systematically between land types. This work demonstrates the potential of remote sensing to constrain BB particle properties and the mechanisms governing their evolution over entire ecosystems. It also begins to realize this potential, as a means of improving regional and global climate and air quality modeling in a rapidly changing world.  Copyright © 2022 Katherine T.

Up to present, remote sensing community has developed a series of reflectance models for various applications in snow surface. Comprehensive comparison and evaluation of these models are essentially helpful in choosing an algorithm to produce satellite multi-angle remote sensing product. In this paper, we use the Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) multi-angle snow data to compare and evaluate the performance of three models to characterize the snow scattering. Three models including the kernel-driven linear RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) model as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo operational algorithm, the Asymptotic Radiative Theory model (ART) and the lately-developed RTLSR-Snow (RTLSRS) model have been well used in some studies. Method First, the POLDER data are divided into pure snow data and impure snow data by the homogeneity index provided by the POLDER database, and then we use three BRDF models to fit (1) a single pure snow BRDF dataset; (2) the entire archive of the pure snow BRDF data; (3) a single impure snow BRDF dataset; and (4) the entire achieve of the impure snow BRDF data, respectively. We analyze the result with the R2、RMSE and bias. As the volumetric scattering kernel and geometric optical kernel contribute little to pure snow reflectances, we further simplify the RTLSRS model by keeping only isotropic scattering and snow scattering kernel in the kernel-driven model framework (i.e., Isotropic and Snow-kernel Model, ISM). The performance of the ISM model has further been evaluated using the POLDER pure snow data. Result The results are as follows: (1) The RTLSRS is the most accurate model among all models being considered. For a single pure snow BRDF dataset, the RTLSRS model has a RMSE value that is 45.45% and 81.45% lower than that of ART and RTLSR model, respectively. For a single impure snow BRDF dataset, the BRDF curve of RTLSRS model is generally similar with RTLSR model’s, but the RMSE is 67.5% lower than RTLSR. The RMSE of the ART model is the largest in this case, arriving at 0.136. (2) The accuracy of the RTLSRS model in simulating the pure snow data (R2=0.969, RMSE=0.012) is higher than that of the impure snow data (R2=0.935, RMSE=0.018). (3) The simplified ISM model can characterize the pure snow BRDF data well. The R2 and RMSE can reach 0.949 and 0.034 for the entire POLDER pure snow data, even better than the ART model. Conclusion RTLSRS has the highest accuracy in fitting various POLDER BRDF snow data. Although the ISM has somewhat low accuracy relative to its original RTLSRS model, it shows a higher accuracy than the ART model in fitting the POLDER pure snow data. Our results also present that the index of the “homogeneity” provided by the entire archive of the POLDER snow database cannot necessarily meet the requirement to identify the pure snow pixels of POLDER snow data. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method to further refine the POLDER snow data and provide more details that can improve the understanding for potential users in relation to snow optical scattering. © 2022 National Remote Sensing Bulletin.

It can reveal for instance whether the plant has received too much or too little nutrients (nitrogen in particular). Corrective measures based on early diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency can prevent yield reduction. Optical approaches to estimating LCC are typically based on measuring the reflectance of leaves (close-range sensing) or canopy (remote sensing) with a spectrophotometer or a hyperspectral sensor. Given the cost of such devices, the use of colour cameras for LCC estimation has recently gained interest. However, existing approaches are mostly designed for very close range sensing, i.e. they allow the measurement of LCC for a single plant at a time, which limits their usefulness in practice. Furthermore, they do not exploit the anisotropic reflective properties of leaves and canopies. To investigate the feasibility of RGB imaging for remote sensing-based estimation of canopy LCC, we present a simulation based on a plant canopy reflectance model. An RGB camera model was used to generate RGB images with various reference illuminants and from 10 different viewing angles. We then applied linear and neural network based regression to predict LCC from RGB values without white balance. Results indicate a significant potential to use RGB sensors for remote sensing LCC estimation, particularly with a multi-angle approach. © 2019 IEEE.","Cameras; Chlorophyll; Diagnosis; Nitrogen; Plants (botany); Reflection; Chlorophyll contents; Corrective measures; Early diagnosis; Hyperspectral sensors; Leaf chlorophyll content; Nitrogen deficiency; Reflective properties; Spectral reflectances; Remote sensing","chlorophyll content; ProSail model; RGB sensor; spectral reflectance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078699416"

In this paper, we examined the effectiveness of the reconstructed MODIS typical-angle reflectances—reflectances observed from the hotspot, darkspot, and nadir directions—for estimating forest AGB from both theoretical and practical perspectives. To gain theoretical insights, we first tested the sensitivities of typical-angle reflectances to forest AGB through simulations using the 4-scale bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. We then built statistical models to fit the relationship between MODIS multi-angle observations and field-measured deciduous-broadleaf/mixed-temperate forest AGB at five sites in the eastern USA, assisted by a semivariogram analysis to determine the effect of pixel heterogeneity on the MODIS–AGB relationship. We also determined the effects of terrain and season on the predictive relationships. Our results indicated that multi-angle reflectances with fewer visible shadows yielded better AGB estimates (hotspot: R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 54.28 Mg/ha; nadir: R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 59.95 Mg/ha; darkspot: R2 = 0.46, RMSE = 65.66 Mg/ha) after filtering out the effects of complex terrain and pixel heterogeneity; the MODIS typical-angle reflectances in the NIR band were the most sensitive to forest AGB. We also found strong sensitivities of estimated accuracies to MODIS image acquisition dates or season. Overall, our results suggest that the current practice of leveraging only single-angle MODIS data can be a suboptimal strategy for AGB estimation. We advocate the use of MODIS multi-angle reflectances for optical remote sensing of forest AGB or potentially other ecological applications requiring forest structure information. © 2022 by the authors.","Biomass; Distribution functions; Forestry; Information filtering; NASA; Optical remote sensing; Pixels; Radiometers; Aboveground biomass; Bidirectional reflectance distribution function shape indicator; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions models; Forest; Kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function model; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Multi angle; Typical-angle reflectance; Reflection","aboveground biomass; BRDF; BRDF shape indicators; forest; kernel-driven BRDF model; MODIS; typical-angle reflectances","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141861283"

The method of combining different-angle location images is implemented iteratively. At each iteration, there is a search for pairs of points of the contour of the isolated areas. Areas are highlighted using two image segmentation methods. The final result is a proposed method for information fusion from a two-position on-board small-sized radar system and an optical location system. The implemented method of fusion makes it possible to increase the information content, quality and reliability of information about the observed underlying surfaces and the physical objects detected on them.

We use globally distributed, daily averaged measurements of aerosol stereo heights of fire aerosols from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) to understand the aerosol distribution. We also connect these results with a simple plume rise model and a new multi-linear regression model approach based on daily measurements of NO2 from OMI and CO from MOPITT to understand and model the global aerosol vertical height profile over biomass burning regions. First, plumes associated with the local dry-burning season at midlatitudes to high latitudes frequently have a substantial fraction lofted into the free troposphere and in some cases even the stratosphere. Second, plumes mainly associated with less-polluted regions in developing countries and heavily forested areas tend to stay closer to the ground, although they are not always uniformly distributed throughout the boundary layer. Third, plumes associated with more serious loadings of pollution (such as in Africa, Southeast Asia and northeast China) tend to have a substantial amount of smoke transported uniformly through the planetary boundary layer and up to around 3 km. Fourth, the regression model approach yields a better ability to reproduce the measured heights compared to the plume rise model approach. This improvement is based on a removal of the negative bias observed from the plume model approach, as well as a better ability to work under more heavily polluted conditions. However, over many regions, both approaches fail, requiring deeper work to understand the physical, chemical and dynamical reasons underlying the failure over these regions.  © Author(s) 2020.","aerosol property; atmospheric plume; measurement method; optical depth; radiometer; regression analysis; remote sensing; trace element","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097785969"

However, sampling the bidirectional reflectance of forest canopies at a small fixed angular interval over a certain observation plane is still difficult at present, and capturing hotspot and dark spot images is especially challenging. The objectives of this study are (1) to obtain bidirectional hyperspectral reflectance images, including hotspot and dark spot, at the principal plane for two conifer forest canopies, (2) to analyze the observed canopy BRDF characteristics, and (3) to compare and validate the observation with four-scale geometric optical model simulation. The two coniferous forest sites are located in the Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm in Hebei Province in northern China. A multiangle hyperspectral observation method was developed on the basis of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging platform. A hyperspectral imaging sensor was mounted on the multirotor UAV with a rotatable gimbal. The View Zenith Angle (VZA) of the hyperspectral sensor was controlled by adjusting the pitch angle of the gimbal at each observation point over the flight of the UAV. The VZAs ranged from 60° backward to 60° forward with an interval of 10°, along with the hotspot and dark spot angles. The observed UAV images were processed from digital numbers to reflectance by using a standard gray panel with known reflectance placed in the observation area. The UAV images were then resampled to 60 m to examine the reflectance at the canopy scale. Canopy reflectance was also simulated with the four-scale model and compared with the observation. Bidirectional reflectance, including hotspot and dark spot, images of conifer forest canopies were effectively observed using the developed multiangle UAV observation method. This method has the advantage of making hyperspectral and multiangular observations at the same time. The canopy reflectance values are higher at backward observation and highest at the hotspot direction compared with those at forward directions. The observed BRDF shapes differ at the two study sites with different canopy structure and leaf optical properties. The bowl effect with increasing reflectance with VZA is observed when the VZAs are larger than 40°. The results are as follows: (1) The BRDF shapes and canopy reflectance simulated using a four-scale model are consistent with the observation, except for a minimal underestimation at the hotspot in the red spectral bands and some deviation in the near infrared (NIR) bands at large VZAs in the forward direction; (2) The BRDF shapes differ in forests with different canopy structure and leaf optical properties; (3) The observed bidirectional reflectance of the two coniferous forests demonstrates distinct spectral variability of BRDF effects. The reflectance anisotropy is highest in the red bands and lowest in the NIR bands; and (4) Anisotropy of vegetation indices, including normalized difference vegetation index, photochemical reflectance index, MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index, and enhanced vegetation index, is observed due to the spectral variability of BRDF effects. The multiangle UAV platform is able to capture bidirectional reflectance images effectively, especially in the hotspot and dark spot directions. Compared with satellite-based, aerial, and tower- or ground-based multiangle observation methods, the UAV platform is more effective and flexible with a much lower labor and financial cost. However, the application of this UAV platform at a large spatial scale is limited due to the small coverage of UAV images compared with satellite images. The multiangle UAV platform has great potential in the research of bidirectional characteristics of various targets. © 2021, Science Press.

In this Review, we synthesize understanding of aerosol observations and their radiative and climate effects. Aerosols offset about one-third of the warming effect by anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Yet, in regions and seasons where the absorbing aerosol fraction is high — such as South America and East and South Asia — substantial atmospheric warming can occur. The internal mixing and the vertical distribution of aerosols, which alters both the direct effect and aerosol–cloud interactions, might further enhance this warming. Despite extensive research in aerosol–cloud interactions, there is still at least a 50% spread in total aerosol forcing estimates. This ongoing uncertainty is linked, in part, to the poor measurement of anthropogenic and natural aerosol absorption, as well as the little-understood effects of aerosols on clouds. Next-generation, space-borne, multi-angle polarization and active remote sensing, combined with in situ observations, offer opportunities to better constrain aerosol scattering, absorption and size distribution, thus, improving models to refine estimates of aerosol forcing and climate effects. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130705443"

Here we use Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) observations to investigate the sensitivity of C-band backscatter to spring phenology of temperate deciduous broadleaf forests in Austria. ASCAT's multi-angle looking capability enables the observation of backscatter over a large range of incidence angles. The vegetation status affects the slope of the backscatter-incidence angle relationship. We discovered a maximum in the slope around the month April, hereafter referred to as spring peak, predominantly in regions covered by deciduous broadleaf forest. We hypothesized that the spring peak indicates the average timing of leaf emergence in the deciduous trees in the sensor footprint. The hypothesis was tested by comparing the timing of the spring peak to leaf unfolding observations from the PEP725 phenology database, to the increase of leaf area index (LAI) during spring, and to temperature. Our results demonstrate a good agreement between the ASCAT spring peaks, phenology observations and temperature conditions. The steepest increase in LAI however lags behind the ASCAT peak by several days to a few weeks, suggesting that the spring peak in fact marks the timing of maximum woody water content, which occurs right before leaf emergence. Based on these observations, we conclude that the ASCAT signal has a high sensitivity to spring reactivation and in particular water uptake of bare deciduous broadleaf trees. Our findings might provide the basis for novel developments to estimate eco-physiological changes of forests during spring at large scales. © 2020 The Authors","Austria; Backscattering; Meteorological instruments; Vegetation; Broadleaf forest; C-band backscatters; Incidence angles; Plant water status; Seasonal changes; Sensor footprints; Temperature conditions; Water content in soil; ASCAT; backscatter; broad-leaved forest; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; hypothesis testing; leaf area index; physiological response; water content; water uptake; Forestry","Active microwave remote sensing; Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT); Deciduous broadleaf forest; Functional phenology; Slope; Vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089685559"

More than 75% of surface water supply originates as snowmelt in mountainous regions, such as the western U.S. Remote sensing has the potential to measure snowpack in these areas accurately. In this research, we combine light detection and ranging (lidar) from crewed aircraft (currently, the most reliable way of measuring snow depth in mountain forests) and structure from motion (SfM) remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) for cost-effective multi-temporal monitoring of snowpack in mountain forests. In sparsely forested areas, both technologies give similar snow depth maps, with a comparable agreement with ground-based snow depth observations (RMSE ~10 cm). In densely forested areas, airborne lidar is better able to represent snow depth than RPAS-SfM (RMSE ~10 cm vs ~10-20 cm). In addition, we find the relationship between RPAS-SfM and previous lidar snow depth data can be used to estimate snow depth conditions outside of relatively small RPAS-SfM monitoring plots, with RMSE's between these observed and estimated snow depths on the order of 10-15 cm for the larger lidar coverages. This suggests that when a single airborne lidar snow survey exists, RPAS-SfM may provide useful multi-temporal snow monitoring that can estimate basin-scale snowpack, at a much lower cost than multiple airborne lidar surveys. Doing so requires a pre-existing mid-winter or peak-snowpack airborne lidar snow survey, and subsequent well-designed paired SfM and field snow surveys that accurately capture substantial snow depth variability. © 2020 by the authors.","Aircraft; Aircraft detection; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Forestry; Landforms; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Surface waters; Surveys; Water supply; Airborne lidar data; Cost effective; Hydro-power generation; Light detection and ranging; Mountain forests; Mountainous regions; Remotely piloted aircraft; Structure from motion; Optical radar","Forests; Lidar; Remotely piloted aircraft systems; Snow; Structure from motion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088664883"

Global climate change exhibits diversity characteristics on both temporal and spatial scales. Since the Moon-based earth observation platform could provide large-scale, multi-angle, and long-term measurements complementary to the satellite-based Earth observation data, it is necessary to study the observation characteristics of this new platform. With deepening understanding of Moon-based observations, we have seen its good observation ability in the middle and low latitudes of the Earth's surface, but for polar regions, we need to further study the observation characteristics of this platform. Based on the above objectives, we used the Moon-based Earth observation geometric model to quantify the geometric relationship between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Assuming the sensor is at the center of the nearside of the Moon, the coverage characteristics of the earth feature points are counted. The observation intervals, access frequency, and the angle information of each point during 100 years were obtained, and the variation rule was analyzed. The research showed that the lunar platform could carry out ideal observations for the polar regions. For the North and South poles, a continuous observation duration of 14.5 days could be obtained, and as the latitude decreased, the duration time was reduced to less than one day at the latitude of 65ff in each hemisphere. The dominant observation time of the North Pole is concentrated from mid-March to mid-September, and for the South Pole, it is the rest of the year, and as the latitude decreases, it extends outward from both sides. The annual coverage time and frequency will change with the relationship between the Moon and the Earth. This study also proves that the Moon-based observation has multi-angle observation advantages for the Arctic and the Antarctic areas, which can help better understand large-scale geoscientific phenomena. The above findings indicate that the Moon-based observation can be applied as a new type of remote sensing technology to the observation field of the Earth's polar regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Earth (planet); Geometry; Observatories; Poles; Remote sensing; Arctic regions; coverage characteristics; Diversity characteristics; Earth observations; Geometric simulation; Remote sensing technology; Satellite based Earth observation; Temporal and spatial scale; Moon","Antarctic and Arctic regions; coverage characteristics; geometric simulation; Moon-based Earth observation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076515001"

In this study, we evaluate the spatiotemporal variations of dust extinction profiles and dust optical depth (DOD) simulated by the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) and version 2 (CESM2), the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 1 (E3SMv1), and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) against satellite retrievals from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We find that CESM1, CESM2, and E3SMv1 underestimate dust transport to remote regions. E3SMv1 performs better than CESM1 and CESM2 in simulating dust transport and the northern hemispheric DOD due to its higher mass fraction of fine dust. CESM2 performs the worst in the Northern Hemisphere due to its lower dust emission than in the other two models but has a better dust simulation over the Southern Ocean due to the overestimation of dust emission in the Southern Hemisphere. DOD from MERRA-2 agrees well with CALIOP DOD in remote regions due to its higher mass fraction of fine dust and the assimilation of aerosol optical depth. The large disagreements in the dust extinction profiles and DOD among CALIOP, MODIS, and MISR retrievals make the model evaluation of dust spatial distributions challenging. Our study indicates the importance of representing dust emission, dry/wet deposition, and size distribution in GCMs in correctly simulating dust spatiotemporal distributions.  © Author(s) 2020.","aerosol; climate modeling; dust; global climate; Northern Hemisphere; optical depth; remote sensing; satellite data; Southern Hemisphere; spatial distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096335245"

Planned for launch in late 2022 for a 3-year mission, the MAIA satellite instrument will focus on a selected set of metropolitan target areas, where air quality monitors and health data are available. Aerosol concentration and speciation are inferred from multi-angle measurements of backscattered sunlight in 14 spectral bands from 350-2200 nm, with bands near 442, 645 and 1040 nm measuring the degree (DoLP) and angle of linear polarization (AoLP) in addition to radiance. The pushbroom camera has a ∼240-km cross-track field of view with a nadir resolution of ∼200 m, and is mounted onto a biaxial gimbal to provide along-track view angles within ±60°, to extend the field of regard to ±48°, and to view the instrument's onboard calibrator (OBC) and dark target. The OBC consists of a sunlit transmissive diffuser, followed by 12 polarizers at different orientations. MAIA's polarimetry is implemented using miniature wiregrid polarizers on the focal plane array, and dual photoelastic modulators (PEMs) and achromatic quarter-wave plates to rapidly rotate the polarization. The resulting ∼26-Hz intensity modulation encodes the linearly polarized and total radiance in each pixel, leaving the DoLP and AoLP insensitive to gain calibration. We report on the polarimetric calibration of the MAIA camera using a vacuum-compatible polarization state generator, consisting of a 1600W Xenon lamp, 12-inch integrating sphere, and rotating high-extinction polarizer. Mueller-matrix-based calibration coefficients for each detector pixel are derived from measurements at multiple polarizer angles, and are used to correct the measurements for instrumental polarization aberrations. Prior to flight, the calibrated MAIA camera is panned across the OBC to characterize its output, using uniform illumination with an irradiance similar to the Sun. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

These instruments, especially when used in synergy, have great potential for improving estimates of water reflectance in the post Earth Observing System (EOS) era. Extending the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations to the UV, where aerosol absorption is effective, adding spectral bands in the SWIR, where even the most turbid waters are black and sensitivity to the aerosol coarse mode is higher than at shorter wavelengths, and measuring in the oxygen A-band to estimate aerosol altitude will enable greater accuracy in atmospheric correction for ocean color science. The multi-angular and polarized measurements, sensitive to aerosol properties (e.g., size distribution, index of refraction), can further help to identify or constrain the aerosol model, or to retrieve directly water reflectance. Algorithms that exploit the new capabilities are presented, and their ability to improve accuracy is discussed. They embrace a modern, adapted heritage two-step algorithm and alternative schemes (deterministic, statistical) that aim at inverting the TOA signal in a single step. These schemes, by the nature of their construction, their robustness, their generalization properties, and their ability to associate uncertainties, are expected to become the new standard in the future. A strategy for atmospheric correction is presented that ensures continuity and consistency with past and present ocean-color missions while enabling full exploitation of the new dimensions and possibilities. Despite the major improvements anticipated with the PACE instruments, gaps/issues remain to be filled/tackled. They include dealing properly with whitecaps, taking into account Earth-curvature effects, correcting for adjacency effects, accounting for the coupling between scattering and absorption, modeling accurately water reflectance, and acquiring a sufficiently representative dataset of water reflectance in the UV to SWIR. Dedicated efforts, experimental and theoretical, are in order to gather the necessary information and rectify inadequacies. Ideas and solutions are put forward to address the unresolved issues. Thanks to its design and characteristics, the PACE mission will mark the beginning of a new era of unprecedented accuracy in ocean-color radiometry from space. © Copyright © 2019 Frouin, Franz, Ibrahim, Knobelspiesse, Ahmad, Cairns, Chowdhary, Dierssen, Tan, Dubovik, Huang, Davis, Kalashnikova, Thompson, Remer, Boss, Coddington, Deschamps, Gao, Gross, Hasekamp, Omar, Pelletier, Ramon, Steinmetz and Zhai.","Aerosols; Angular distribution; Color; Color image processing; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Interplanetary spacecraft; Nanosatellites; Oceanography; Polarimeters; Reflection; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectrometers; Tungsten metallography; Vanadium metallography; Water absorption; Atmospheric corrections; HyperSpectral; Multi angle; Ocean color; PACE mission; aerosol; atmospheric correction; near infrared; ocean color; satellite imagery; spectral resolution; spectrometer; Uranium metallography","aerosols; atmospheric correction; hyper-spectral remote sensing; multi-angle polarimetry; ocean color; PACE mission","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068466848"

The emerging statistically derived PM2.5 estimations from satellite remote sensing observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data are an effective alternative to reconstruct global, long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution PM2.5 information. However, studies on PM2.5 estimation and its application to exposure and health-related studies are limited in China due to the lack of historical in-situ measurements before 2013. In this study, we explored the long-term trends of PM2.5 exposure in central China, a hotspot that has recently been experiencing severe particulate pollution, at the local scale. We first developed a spatiotemporal model incorporating periodical characteristics within the data to estimate daily concentrations of historical PM2.5 at a fine scale of 1 km for 2003–2018. The linear effects of predictors including AOD, meteorological and land-use parameters and the non-linear interaction between AOD and meteorological parameters were considered in the modeling process. The most recently released high-resolution satellite aerosol product, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) was used to help to represent the fine-scale particle gradients. Our daily estimates correlated well with in-situ observations (cross-validation R2 = 0.59), achieving precision comparable to previous statistical models. Through linking with gridded demographic data, the population-weighted PM2.5 average during 2003 to 2018 was found to be high (62.23 μg/m3 for the whole domain) with obvious spatial variations and seasonality. An inverse U pattern was seen in the time series, with two inflection points around 2008 and 2015. Our model provides reliable particulate information with high spatial resolution and long-term temporal coverage, which can inform local-scale PM2.5-related epidemiological studies and health-risk assessments for central China. © 2020 The Authors","Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; China; Aerosols; Air pollution control; Health; Health risks; Inverse problems; Land use; Optical properties; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Satellites; Aerosol optical depths; Fine particulate matter; Long-term trend; Satellite remote sensing; Spatio-temporal models; aerosol; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; trend analysis; aerosol; article; China; cross validation; demography; health hazard; land use; meteorology; optical depth; particulate matter; remote sensing; risk assessment; seasonal variation; time series analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; Particles (particulate matter)","Aerosol optical depth; Fine particulate matter; Long-term trend; Satellite remote sensing; Spatiotemporal modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079003315"

Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatial-resolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R2 = 0.86–0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R2 = 0.80–0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM2.5) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 μg/m3/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter.

This paper presents a new method for targets parameters estimation. The presented method modifies the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) model by introducing the Lorentz-Drude dispersion constants which do not vary with wavelength as well as the diffuse component of reflection related to the surface roughness to the DOLP equation. This solves the problem of difficulty and inaccuracy caused by multi-angle passive polarimetric measurements used by previous works and helps to improving the parameters estimation accuracy for rough targets. The Monte Carlo simulations result illustrate that the presented method is robust to Gaussian noise. Moreover, the experimental results of rough aluminium plate and rough copper plate validate the effectiveness of the presented model. The errors of estimated n are about 8% for aluminium plate and 9% for copper plate. The errors of estimated k are less than 4% for aluminium plate and no more than 5% for copper plate. The errors of estimated surface roughness σ are about 6.8% and about 6% for aluminium plate and copper plate respectively.

Compared with visible and infrared sensors, it is not limited by light, weather, and climate conditions and has all-weather and multi-angle data acquisition capability. With the development of SAR imaging technology, SAR image has been widely used in the military field for intelligence detection, navigation guidance, ocean ship detection, etc. Through the detection of ship target in the SAR image, the ship information of the sea surface, port, and other locations can be obtained quickly, which improves border prevention ability. The traditional methods of SAR ship detection have difficulty in detecting small-scale ships and avoiding the interference of inshore complex background. Moreover, the quality of SAR images needs to be high, and the images need to be preprocessed before detection. In addition, the robustness and generalization of most SAR images are not good enough for specific scenes, and they are susceptible to speckle noise, which has certain limitations. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been introduced into the SAR image target detection field. Deep learning is an enhanced version of machine learning. Recently, it has been gradually applied for ship detection in SAR images, but some problems need to be addressed. First, the near shore ships are seriously disturbed by the buildings on the shore. The existing detection methods cannot effectively distinguish the ship target from the background, so it is easy to mix the background with the ship target or mistake the target for the background, resulting in missed detection. Second, the existing algorithm cannot accurately locate the closely arranged ship targets, and the positioning effect is poor. It is easy to regard multiple targets as one target, which leads to wrong detection, resulting in low accuracy of detection results or high constant false alarm rate. To solve these problems, this study proposes a detection method based on bidirectional attention feature pyramid network. Method: Experiments are conducted on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) of the public SAR image ship dataset. This dataset comes from the Naval Aviation University, which is a common dataset in this field in China. Affine, fuzzy, and noisy data enhancement operations are performed to improve the generalization ability of the training model. A new bidirectional feature pyramid network is proposed based on the original fully convolutional one-stage (FCOS) object detection network. By connecting the attention mechanism module with each feature graph of the pyramid network, the features of a large amount of semantic information can be extracted. At the same time, we use convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to refine the stitched feature map and combine the idea of path aggregation network for instance segmentation. The bottom-up pyramid module is added to further highlight the prominent features of targets at different scales, so as to improve the ability of the network to accurately locate ship targets in a complex background. Then, a weighted feature fusion method is proposed, which makes the feature information extracted from different feature maps to have different emphases and then combines the salient features with the global non-fuzzy features to improve the ship detection accuracy. Finally, the fused feature map is fed back to the detection network to obtain the final detection result. In addition, a NVIDIA Titan RTX device is used for the experimental platform in this study, and the operating system is Ubuntu 18.04. The batch size of the training is set to the initialization model, the batch size of the training is 8, the total iteration number is 50 000, the initial learning rate is 0.001, the learning rate attenuation coefficient is 0.000 1, the 2 000 attenuation is once, and the kinetic parameters are analyzed at 0.9 mm. Result: We compared the added modules and found that the added modules have different degrees of improvement compared with the original FCOS method. At the same time, we also compared the experimental results with three other existing models, including SSD, Faster R-CNN (region convolutional neural network), and original FCOS. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 9.5% higher than that of the original FCOS method. The detection accuracy of this algorithm reached 90.2% under the same conditions, which was 14.09% higher than that of SSD and 8.5% higher than that of Faster R-CNN. The results show that the model algorithm can obtain accurate results. In addition, in terms of time, the proposed algorithm is 5 ms slower than FCOS. However, the detection speed was 1.6 times higher than that of SSD and 6 times higher than that of Faster R-CNN. In terms of speed, the detection speed of the proposed algorithm is obviously faster than that of other existing methods. From the comparison of experimental results, the proposed algorithm is not only good for the detection of small target ships in deep sea, but also good for the detection of near shore ship targets in the complex background, especially for closely arranged ship targets, with high accuracy of positioning effect. Conclusion: By improving the network features and the feature fusion method, the ship detection algorithm in SAR images is improved on the premise of ensuring the same detection effect of deep-sea ships. Under complex background, the ship positioning effect is compact, and the accuracy of ship detection is effectively enhanced, which is superior to other ship detection methods based on SSDD. © 2021, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm–5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to ~0.1 cm3/cm3 at an intermediate value of ~0.35 cm3/cm3. (2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large variation of ~30 dB and ~80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm3/cm3 to 0.5 cm3/cm3. The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial resolutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval. © 2020","China; Luan River; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellites; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic apertures; Temperature; Vegetation; Watersheds; Airborne experiments; Continuous measurements; L-band active and passive; Optical remote sensing data; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil temperature gradient; Vegetation temperature; Vegetation water content; accuracy assessment; airborne survey; backscatter; experimental study; ground-based measurement; radiometer; satellite altimetry; satellite data; satellite mission; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; water resource; watershed; Soil surveys","Airborne experiment; L-band active and passive; Luan River; Soil moisture; Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078694659"

Previous studies on laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) have mostly used vertical directions, and less consideration has been given to the effects of multi-angle and fluorescence polarization. In this paper, Chlorophytum, Green radish, and Phnom Penh Tiger Piran were used as research objects, and multi-angle and polarization observation methods were used to analyze the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectra, and the models were established. At the same time, the spatial distribution of laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence intensity and degree of polarization was plotted in polar coordinates. The results show that the shapes of fluorescence spectra of the three plants were different, and the changes in the Viewing Zenith Angles and Relative Azimuth Angles affect the fluorescence intensity and fluorescence parameters. The mathematical regression models of Viewing Zenith Angles and fluorescence parameter F685/F740 were established at Relative Azimuth Angles. According to the comparison of R2 and RMSE of different models, the Relative Azimuth Angle of 225° is the best angle to study the relationship between F685/F740 and Viewing Zenith Angles for these three plants at the same time. The regression coefficient is significant, which can accurately reflect that F685/F740 has a significant correlation with Viewing Zenith Angles. In addition, we also performed polarization observations on the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence of the three plants and calculated the corresponding fluorescence polarization in the 2π space. The studies have shown that the laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence spectrum has significant polarization, and the Viewing Zenith Angles, Relative Azimuth Angles, and band information have different effects on laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence polarization spectra. The mathematical regression models were established for the relationship between the fluorescence polarization at 685 and 740 nm for different plants.

Satellite-based remote sensing provides a useful tool for assessing both ongoing activity and retrospective eruptions. This paper represents an initial application of a multi-sensor approach, in part to demonstrate its strengths and limitations in a single volcanic region that is fairly well monitored in situ. We utilize data from five NASA satellite-based instruments, having up to 18 years of global observations, to conduct in-depth investigations of eight volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) that were active between 2000 and 2018. From 169 eruptive plumes observed, we performed detailed plume-dynamics analysis in eighty-two cases for which sufficiently favorable observations were obtained. Plume heights from MISR and CALIOP, microphysical particle properties (e.g. fine ash, sulfates) from MISR, thermal anomalies generated by lava features from MODIS, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from OMI and OMPS are all considered. Evidence of eruption evolution over months-to-years was identified at Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky, Zhupanovsky, Koryaksky and Kambalny. In cases with extensive data coverage (Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky), underlying subsurface dynamics is inferred, corroborated where possible with detailed ground-based data records. The 1.1 km resolution of the particle property retrievals from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument capture downwind plume-particle evolution in many cases. Comparison of changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved effective particle size (REPS) and retrieved effective particle absorption (REPA) map to six plume transport regimes, indicating varying degrees of downwind particle aggregation, deposition, and/or new particle formation. Distinct meteorological conditions are identified as likely driving these evolutionary processes, most notably the atmospheric static stability and wind shear at plume altitude. This approach can be applied to volcanic plumes globally, including those for which surface monitoring is limited or entirely absent. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Kamchatka; Kamchatka Peninsula; Russian Federation; Agglomeration; Dynamics; NASA; Particle size; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sulfur dioxide; Volcanoes; Atmospheric dispersion; Kamchatka; Microphysical property; MISR; MODIS; Plume evolution; Plume heights; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric plume; cloud microphysics; dispersion; instrumentation; MISR; natural hazard; observational method; optical depth; particle size; remote sensing; satellite sensor; volcanic eruption; volcano; wind shear; Particle size analysis","Atmospheric dispersion dynamics; Eruption dynamics; Kamchatka; MISR; MODIS; OMI; Particle microphysical properties; Plume evolution; Plume height; Remote sensing; Volcano","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077122970"

Its timely diagnosis is imperative for preventing and controlling its spread. In this study, the multi-angle canopy spectra and disease severity of wheat were investigated at several developmental stages and degrees of disease severity. Four wavelength variable-selected algorithms: successive projection (SPA), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), feature selection learning (Relief-F), and genetic algorithm (GA), were used to identify bands sensitive to powdery mildew. The wavelength variables selected were used as input variables for partial least squares (PLS), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, to construct a suitable prediction model for powdery mildew. Spectral reflectance and conventional vegetation indices (VIs) displayed angle effects under several disease severity indices (DIs). The CARS method selected relatively few wavelength variables and showed a relatively homogeneous distribution across the 13 viewing zenith angles. Overall accuracies of the four modeling algorithms were ranked as follows: ELM (0.70–0.82) > PLS (0.63–0.79) > SVM (0.49–0.69) > RF (0.43–0.69). Combinations of features and algorithms generated varied accuracies, with coefficients of determination (R2) single-peaked at different observation angles. The constructed CARS-ELM model extracted a predictable bivariate relationship between the multi-angle canopy spectrum and disease severity, yielding an R2 > 0.8 at each measured angle. Especially for larger angles, monitoring accuracies were increased relative to the optimal VI model (40% at −60°, 33% at +60°), indicating that the CARS-ELM model is suitable for extreme angles of −60° and +60°. The results are proposed to provide a technical basis for rapid and large-scale monitoring of wheat powdery mildew. © 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS","","Characteristic wavelength selection; Estimation model; Machine learning; Multi-angular remote sensing; Wheat powdery mildew","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136647597"

Analyzing the change of landscape pattern and its driving factors is of great significance to land use management and water quality protection in the basin. Based on the land use data obtained from the remote sensing image interpretation of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, the landscape pattern evolution characteristics of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) were quantitatively studied using the methods of multi-angle land use transfer matrix, land use information atlas, and landscape pattern index, and the influencing factors of landscape pattern evolution of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) were revealed using the geographic detectors (a new statistical method to measure the explanatory power of independent variables to dependent variables mainly by analyzing the overall differences among various types of geographical spaces). The results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the mutual transformation of land use types in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) was frequent, and the transformation tracks were diversified. Among them, the outflow behavior of land use types is mainly manifested in the transformation from cultivated land to construction land, and the inflow behavior of land use types is mainly manifested in the transformation from grassland and water to cultivated land. (2) In the information map of land use change in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) from 1990 to 2020, the stable type had the widest distribution range, accounting for 94.60% of the total area of the study area, with two main change patterns: “cultivated land-cultivated land-cultivated land-cultivated land” and “woodland-woodland-woodland-woodland”, which indicates that the landscape pattern of the basin dominated by cultivated land and woodland has not changed fundamentally. The four land use change structure types, repeated change, early change, intermediate change and continuous change, account for a relatively small proportion and are concentrated in the vicinity of the Yellow River. (3) At the landscape level, the watershed generally shows the trend of decreasing landscape fragmentation, increasing landscape heterogeneity and constantly balancing landscape patch types. At the level of patch type, the landscape dominance of cultivated land decreases, while that of construction land increases. The occupation of construction land is the main reason for the fragmentation and homogenization of cultivated land. (4) From the perspective of landscape scale and patch type scale, through the geographical exploration of various natural factors and socio-economic factors that potentially affect the landscape pattern evolution, it is found that the spatial differences of natural factors such as slope, elevation, temperature, and precipitation can better reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape pattern in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) than those of socio-economic factors such as GDP and population density, and the interaction of any two driving factors has a greater influence on the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape pattern than any single factor, indicating that the formation of spatial heterogeneity in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) is the result of the interaction of various influencing factors. The results of this study can provide ideas for exploring the trend and influencing mechanism of landscape pattern change in the basin, and have important reference significance for ecological environment management, ecosystem protection, and land use planning in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section). © 2022 by the authors.","China; Yellow River Basin; Information use; Remote sensing; Rivers; Transfer matrix method; Water quality; Watersheds; Cultivated lands; Driving forces; Geographic detector; Geographics; Landscape pattern; Landuse change; Pattern evolution; Transformation of land use; Yellow River basin; Yellow river basin (henan section); detection method; grassland; Gross Domestic Product; land use change; land use conflict; land use planning; landscape change; spatial distribution; water quality; Land use","driving force; geographic detector; landscape pattern; transformation of land use; Yellow River Basin (Henan section)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143726982"

Satellite-derived aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is highly correlated to ground-level PM2.5, providing an effective way to reveal spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 across urban landscapes. In this paper, Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOT and ground-based PM2.5 measurements were fused to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing for 2013-2017 at 1 km resolution through a linear mixed effect model (LMEM). The results showed a good agreement between the estimated and measured PM2.5 and effectively revealed the characteristics of its spatiotemporal variations across Beijing: (1) the PM2.5 level is higher in the central and southern areas, while it is lower in the northern and northwestern areas; (2) the PM2.5 level is higher in autumn and winter, while it is lower in spring and summer. Moreover, annual PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 24.03% for the whole of Beijing and 31.46% for the downtown area from 2013 to 2017.

In this paper, different oil slicks are made with different thicknesses by a kind of oil on water basis, and a series of experiments are set up in laboratory with ellipsometry to measure the mirror reflective polarization parameters: auxiliary angle Ψ and phase difference Δ from UV to near infrared (270~900 nm). We have changed different viewing angles and compared the result with those of oil and water under the same conditions. The result shows that except for Brewster angle, there exist significant distinctions between oil slick and water at different observation angles. Besides, the spectral refractive indexand extinction coefficient of the pure water/oil samples are obtained by Ψ and Δ at 45°. The water refractive index by the experiment meets the water model by Schiebener with standard deviation 3×10-5 after offset correction. The oil spill is modeled with ideal thin oil film on water basis according to those refractive index and extinction coefficient. The Fresnel theory is used to simulate and calculate the reflective light. The simulation shows the reflective light from oil has distinct degree of polarization (DOP) or polarization angle (AOP) vs. spectral with that from water background. Compared with the experiment results, the model shows the same results at 300~350 nm, which has weak interference effect and the properties are close to the oil's, whileat 350~550 nm, the amplitude of the interference simulation results is weaker than the experiment result, and until wavelength greater than 550 nm, the clear interference is detected. The fact indicates the more absorption or scattering phenomenon in oil slick than in oil. According to parameter identification, it is true that the extinction coefficient of oil slickhas a first smaller then bigger property with wavelength. To sum up, we found that spectral ellipsometry can be used to measure and analyze the spectral polarization properties and reflection index of liquid samples through multi band and multi angle measurements. Suitable observing angles for polarization to oil spill is related to the Brewster angle of oil/water. At incident angles except for Brewster observation angle, oil film can be distinguished from water. Visible and infrared spectrum are suitable for the interior optical properties of the oil film, while ultraviolet spectrum has good stability and is more suitable for observation of surface optical properties of very thin oil film. The method involved in the experiment can be applied to the polarization spectrum measurement of other oil slicks. The experimental data provide theoretical support and technical reference for the selection of appropriate spectral band and observation angle of water surface oil spill polarization remote sensing. © 2019, Peking University Press.

The multi-angle multi-spectral polarization remote sensing is an effective means for obtaining the aerosol polarized phase function. As a ground-based high-accuracy polarization instrument for aerosol remote sensing, the new generation CIMEL dual-polar sun-sky radiometer CE318-DP has been introduced into the worldwide AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Meanwhile, as the main instrument of the Sun/sky-radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) with the extension of multi-wavelength polarization measurements, it has accumulated polarization data for many years over observation stations with different aerosol types. However, the retrieval has been based only on the degree of linear polarization or the polarized radiance up to now. Compared to the degree of linear polarization and the polarized radiance, the Stokes parameters Q and U contain information not only on intensity of linear polarization but also on the orientation of polarization. This study introduces an algorithm to retrieve the aerosol polarized phase function based on the Stokes parameters Q and U of skylight from the multi-angle multi-spectral polarization measurements of the CE318-DP. Considering that the Stokes parameter U is changeless with different aerosol properties for the CE318-DP standard polarization observation scenario PPP (Polarized Principal Plane), which is difficult to be utilized, a new ALMP (ALMucantar Polarization) observation scenario is tested to obtain the Stokes parameters Q and U, then to be applied in retrieval of polarized phase function. As to the typical biomass burning and water-soluble aerosols, the results of -P12/P11 in the channels centered at 340 to 1 640 nm were presented and analyzed systematically. Moreover, the applicability of the inversion algorithm in clear and hazy sky conditions was also tested. For the visible and near-infrared channels, the results were in agreement with the truth values not only for the PPP but also for the ALMP geometries. One of the reasons for the obvious deviation of the results in the ultraviolet (UV) bands was also discussed, which was the assumption of the approximately equivalent ""ratios of atmospheric single scattering and atmospheric scattering"" based on the initial aerosol parameters and the real aerosol parameters could not be satisfied in the UV bands. The inversion model should be improved to be applied to the short-wave channels in further studies. On this basis, some subsequent researches can be engaged in to utilize the features of multi-spectral -P12/P11 to improve the retrieval of aerosol microphysical properties. © 2018, Peking University Press.

Remote sensing technology provides an effective method for rapid acquisition of large-area leaf area index. The Great Xing'an Mountains are an important ecological function area of China, where the present study was conducted. According to the different forest characteristics, we used 4-scale geometrical optics model based on physical process. Simultaneously, we used the multi-perspectives MISR remote sensing data to inverse the leaf area index of this region. Geometrical optics model characterized by parameters have physical significance which considers the hot-spot effect of the ground reflection, and modelling inversion process is independent on sample data, suitable for inversion in a large area. The MISR remote sensing data provide multiple perspectives in the same region, which effectively address the question that LAI can only be observed at a single angle and the question of low level saturation point in the LAI function relationship. Because the scale of ground validation data cannot meet the spatial resolution requirement of the MISR data, TM data were used to scale transformation for plot-measured leaf area index data. We analyzed the heterogeneity of LAI in different slopes and discussed the validation data rationality at different spatial resolutions. Our study shows that the validation data at a 600 m spatial resolution can obtain optimal inversion result of MISR data, and at such a resolution, the change of LAI with spatial scale tends to stabilize and successfully avoids the error caused by the geometric registration of the two remote sensing data. The results of our study showed that: 4-scale geometry model is suitable for LAI inversion in the Great Xing'an Mountains, MISR-inversed mean absolute error of LAI is 25.6% and RMSE (the root-mean-square error) is 0.622.

Thus, it is significant to perform the field polarization measurement of vegetation canopy using the ground-base instrument. The field polarization measurement data not only contain the physical polarization property of vegetation canopy, but also can be used to match with the polarimetry measurements from airborne and spaceborne sensors. Several previous studies have paid some attentions to the polarization of vegetation canopies, because of some airborne and spaceborne instruments can be used to obtain multi-angular polarized information. However, the investigation about the field measurements is rare. To study the contribution of this polarized light to multi-angular observations of reflectance over vegetation canopy, a hyperspectral bidirectional polarized reflectance data of one type of vegetation canopy acquired over a wide viewing range in field was analyzed in this paper. Then, it was analyzed with respect to basic physical polarized reflectance mechanisms. The impact of angular data sampling and the variation of the polarized spectral reflectance were also analyzed. Furthermore, we compared the modeled polarization from two current polarimetric models with our measured polarization of vegetation canopy at selected wavelength. Analyses showed that all the models were good fitted to the measurements; there was a very small spectral variability of the polarized reflectance of vegetation canopies. The good agreement between polarization measurements and modeled results confirms the ability of models and the accuracy of field experiments. These results, deepening our understanding of the scattering properties of vegetation canopies, suggest that we can model the polarization accurately by all the current polarimetric models; they are valuable for the development of polarized remote sensing applications on earth science and useful for studying the contribution of earth polarization on the atmosphere polarization. © 2017, Peking University Press.

In this paper we address the subsequent problem of inferring the secondary hydrometeor types present in a volume - the issue of hydrometeor de-mixing. The present study relies on the semi-supervised hydrometeor classification proposed by Besic et al. (2016) but nevertheless results in solutions and conclusions of a more general character and applicability. In the first part, oriented towards synthesis, a bin-based de-mixing approach is proposed, inspired by the conventional coherent and linear decomposition methods widely employed across different remote-sensing disciplines. Intrinsically related to the concept of entropy, introduced in the context of the radar hydrometeor classification in Besic et al. (2016), the proposed method, based on the hypothesis of the reduced random interferences of backscattered signals, estimates the proportions of different hydrometeor types in a given radar sampling volume, without considering the neighboring spatial context. Plausibility and performances of the method are evaluated using C- and X-band radar measurements, compared with hydrometeor properties derived from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera instrument. In the second part, we examine the influence of the potential residual random interference contribution in the backscattering from different hydrometeors populating a radar sampling volume. This part consists in adapting and testing the techniques commonly used in conventional incoherent decomposition methods to the context of weather radar polarimetry. The impact of the residual incoherency is found to be limited, justifying the hypothesis of the reduced random interferences even in a case of mixed volumes and confirming the applicability of the proposed bin-based approach, which essentially relies on first-order statistics. © Author(s) 2018.","backscatter; decomposition; entropy; hydrometry; performance assessment; radar; remote sensing; sampling; signal processing; supervised classification","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052405524"

The LiCHy system has acquired more than 8000 km2 of data over typical forests across China. These data are being used to investigate potential LiDAR and optical remote sensing applications in forest management, forest carbon accounting, biodiversity evaluation, and to aid in the development of similar satellite configurations. This paper describes the integration of the LiCHy system, the instrument performance and data processing workflow. We also demonstrate LiCHy's data characteristics, current coverage, and potential vegetation applications. © 2016 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Carbon; Charge coupled devices; Data handling; Ecosystems; Forestry; Lithium compounds; Pixels; Remote sensing; Room and pillar mining; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Airborne remote sensing; Forest structure; Imaging spectroscopy; Multi angle; Waveform lidars; Optical radar","Airborne remote sensing; CCD; Forest structure; Imaging spectroscopy; Multi-angle; Waveform LiDAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971473481"

Satellite remote sensing is highly expected to provide such valuable information. Before applying the remotely sensed soil moisture products, a thorough validation must be conducted to insure product quality. In this paper, we evaluate the soil moisture products retrieved from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) on board the Global Change Observation Mission - Water (GCOM-W) over Heihe river basin in China, respectively. The land cover in Heihe river basin changes from desert to grass, agriculture field, and then mountain forest, which makes the basin an obvious spatial variation in soil moisture field and valuable to check the reliability and stability of two soil moisture products. We calculate the diurnal relative difference (DRD) of monthly averaged soil moisture between day and night observation of each products, and comparing them with that calculated from corresponding Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) simulations. The comparison results indicate that the SMOS soil moisture products are much unstable than AMSR2 retrievals. The DRD of SMOS is 20 times larger than that of AMSR2 and 100 times larger than that of GLDAS. We speculate that the radio frequency interference effects on SMOS observation may contribute to this unstable performance. Moreover, the retrievals from multi-angle observations in SMOS algorithm is also a potential source causing this systemic bias. © 2015 IEEE.","","AMSR2; ascending and descending difference; GLDAS; Heihe; SMOS; soil moisture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962486924"

In this study, we used a tower-mounted hyperspectral camera in an eastern Amazon forest to assess how canopy spectral signals of three species are linked with phenological processes in the 2012 dry season. We explored different approaches to disentangle the spectral components of canopy phenology processes and analyze their variations over time using 17 images acquired by the camera. The methods included linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA); principal component analysis (PCA); continuum removal (CR); and first-order derivative analysis. In addition, three vegetation indices potentially sensitive to leaf flushing, leaf loss and leaf area index (LAI) were calculated: the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the entitled Green-Red Normalized Difference (GRND) index. We inspected also the consistency of the camera observations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and available phenological data on new leaf production and LAI of young, mature and old leaves simulated by a leaf demography-ontogeny model. The results showed a diversity of phenological responses during the 2012 dry season with related changes in canopy structure and greenness values. Because of the differences in timing and intensity of leaf flushing and leaf shedding, Erisma uncinatum, Manilkara huberi and Chamaecrista xinguensis presented different green vegetation (GV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) SMA fractions; distinct PCA scores; changes in depth, width and area of the 681-nm chlorophyll absorption band; and variations over time in the EVI, GRND and NDVI. At the end of dry season, GV increased for Erisma uncinatum, while NPV increased for Chamaecrista xinguensis. For Manilkara huberi, the NPV first increased in the beginning of August and then decreased toward September with new foliage. Variations in red-edge position were not statistically significant between the species and across dates at the 95% confidence level. The camera data were affected by view-illumination effects, which reduced the SMA shade fraction over time. When MODIS data were corrected for these effects using the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC), we observed an EVI increase toward September that closely tracked the modeled LAI of mature leaves (3–5 months). Compared to the EVI, the GRND was a better indicator of leaf flushing because the modeled production of new leaves peaked in August and then declined in September following the GRND closely. While the EVI was more related to changes in mature leaf area, the GRND was more associated with new leaf flushing. © 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Climate change processes and remote sensing measurements are affected by the PM properties, which are often lumped into homogeneous size fractions that show spatiotemporal variation. Since different sources are attributed to different geographic locations and show specific spatial and temporal PM patterns, we explored the spatiotemporal characteristics of the PM2.5/PM10ratio in different areas. Furthermore, we examined the statistical relationships between AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, satellite-based AOD, and the PM ratio, as well as the specific PM size fractions. PM data from the northeastern United States, from San Joaquin Valley, CA, and from Italy, Israel, and France were analyzed, as well as the spatial and temporal co-measured AOD products obtained from the MultiAngle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. Our results suggest that when both the AERONET AOD and the AERONET fine-mode AOD are available, the AERONET AOD ratio can be a fair proxy for the ground PM ratio. Therefore, we recommend incorporating the fine-mode AERONET AOD in the calibration of MAIAC. Along with a relatively large variation in the observed PM ratio (especially in the northeastern United States), this shows the need to revisit MAIAC assumptions on aerosol microphysical properties, and perhaps their seasonal variability, which are used to generate the look-up tables and conduct aerosol retrievals. Our results call for further scrutiny of satellite-borne AOD, in particular its errors, limitations, and relation to the vertical aerosol profile and the particle size, shape, and composition distribution. This work is one step of the required analyses to gain better understanding of what the satellite-based AOD represents. Implications: The analysis results recommend incorporating the fine-mode AERONET AOD in MAIAC calibration. Specifically, they indicate the need to revisit MAIAC regional aerosol microphysical model assumptions used to generate look-up tables (LUTs) and conduct retrievals. Furthermore, relatively large variations in measured PM ratio shows that adding seasonality in aerosol microphysics used in LUTs, which is currently static, could also help improve accuracy of MAIAC retrievals. These results call for further scrutiny of satellite-borne AOD for better understanding of its limitations and relation to the vertical aerosol profile and particle size, shape, and composition. © 2017 A&WMA.","Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Calibration; California; Environmental Monitoring; France; Israel; Italy; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Atmospheric aerosols; Calibration; Climate change; Particles (particulate matter); Remote sensing; Satellites; Table lookup; Aerosol optical depths; Airborne particulate matters; Composition distributions; Microphysical property; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Statistical relationship; aerosol; airborne particle; algorithm; Article; climate; comparative study; controlled study; France; Israel; Italy; optical depth; particle size; particulate matter; physical parameters; priority journal; seasonal variation; United States; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; calibration; California; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; Particle size","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006900451"

Aerosol products from these sensors are also used for analyzing feedbacks and relationship between aerosols and climatic variables including clouds, precipitation, and radiation fluxes. Several statistical techniques leading to the understanding of such relationships, including empirical orthogonal function and temporal trend extraction methods, require spatially complete AOD data records. Inherent to remote sensing of aerosols, cloud cover significantly affects aerosol retrievals and results in missing data across the AOD products. This paper demonstrates widely-used geostatistical techniques, such as Co-Kriging (CK) and Regression Kriging (RK), for spatially-filling missing data in the MISR AOD product for the period 2001–2013. Among the unique characteristics of this data-filling algorithm is that it utilizes additional AOD information obtained from MODIS. The mean accuracy of the predicted MISR AOD using CK method is estimated to be 0.05, globally. The gap-filled MISR AOD data are also compared with 131 ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations, located around the world. It is found that Root Mean Squared Error of the gap-filled AOD dataset and the original MISR AOD product with respect to AERONET data are 0.143. The gap-filled AOD dataset can be used in applications where the presence of missing values is undesirable such as for global/regional aerosol variability and trend analysis. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Filling; Interpolation; Mean square error; Optical properties; Orthogonal functions; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiometers; Remote sensing; Gap filling; Geo-statistics; Kriging; MISR; MODIS; Data mining","Gap-filling; Geostatistics; Kriging; MISR; MODIS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027683309"

Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown a powerful proxy for photosynthetic activity and used to estimate GPP. However, both non-physiological and functional factors controlling the emission of canopy SIF. The non-physiological factors, especially the sun-viewer geometry, impact the relationships between SIF and GPP. In this study, we did near-surface observations of both carbon flux and multi-view-angle spectra above a wheat canopy. The carbon flux was used to calculate GPP and the canopy spectra were used to retrieve SIF. SIF is significantly correlated with the angle between sun and viewer than SIF (R2=0.63). The relationships of SIF with GPP are also changing with different view azimuth angles. Generally, SIF observed at 180°(pointing north) are more correlated to GPP than that at the other two angles. A model recently developed by He et al. (2017) was used to normalize multi-angle SIF to the hotspot direction (SIFh) and to compute the canopy-level total SIF (SIFt), in order to reduce the effects of sun-viewer geometry on SIF. Compared to the correlation of GPP with the original observed SIF (SIFobs), the coefficients of determination (R2) increase by ~0.1 and ~0.05 for those of GPP with SIFh and SIFt, respectively. These results would be helpful in estimating GPP of crops at large scales using remote sensing techniques. © 2019 IEEE.","Carbon; Computational geometry; Fluorescence; Geology; Physiology; Canopy spectrum; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Gross primary production; Hot spot; Photosynthetic activity; Physiological factors; Remote sensing techniques; Terrestrial vegetation; Remote sensing","GPP; hotspot; multiple-angle remote sensing; SIF; sun-viewer geometry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077678814"

The accuracy of the new dataset is assessed compared to the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5.1 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data, retrieved at 0.55 μm with spatial resolution of 10 km (MYD04_L2). We focused on evaluating the ability of these two products to characterize both temporal and spatial distributions of aerosols within urban and suburban areas. Ground PM10measurements were obtained from 73 of the Italian Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA) monitoring stations, spread across northern Italy, during a three-year period from 2010 to 2012. The Po Valley area (northern Italy) was chosen as the study domain because of its severe urban air pollution, resulting from it having the highest population and industrial manufacturing density in the country, being located in a valley where two surrounding mountain chains favor the stagnation of pollutants. We found that the global correlations between the bin-averaged PM10and AOD are R2= 0.83 and R2= 0.44 for MYD04_L2 and for MAIAC, respectively, suggesting a greater sensitivity of the high-resolution product to small-scale deviations. However, the introduction of Relative Humidity (RH) and Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) depth corrections allowed for a significant improvement to the bin-averaged PM - AOD correlation, which led to a similar performance: R2= 0.96 for MODIS and R2= 0.95 for MAIAC. Furthermore, the introduction of the PBL information in the corrected AOD values was found to be crucial in order to capture the clear seasonal cycle shown by measured PM10values. The study allowed us to define four seasonal linear correlations that estimate PM10concentrations satisfactorily from the remotely sensed MAIAC AOD retrieval. Overall, the results show that the high resolution provided by MAIAC retrieval data is much more relevant than the 10 km MODIS data to characterize PM10in this region of Italy which has a pretty limited geographical domain but a broad variety of land usages and consequent particulate concentrations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Italy; Po Valley; Aerosols; Algorithms; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bins; Boundary layers; Image reconstruction; Landforms; Optical properties; Pollution; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Surge protection; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol retrieval; MAIAC; MODIS; Planetary boundary layers; Seasonality; aerosol; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; correlation; environmental monitoring; estimation method; MODIS; optical depth; particulate matter; planetary atmosphere; pollution monitoring; resolution; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatial distribution; urban area; aerosol; air pollution; Article; atmospheric deposition; boundary layer; comparative study; controlled study; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; humidity; Italy; manufacturing industry; optical depth; particulate matter; priority journal; remote sensing; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; suburban area; urban area; Particles (particulate matter)","Aerosol optical depth (AOD); High resolution aerosol retrieval; MAIAC; MODIS; Planetary boundary layer (PBL); PM<sub>10</sub>                      ; Seasonality AOD-PM<sub>10</sub>correlation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975789815"

However, the magnitude of these angular and band effects for forest structure parameters is difficult to quantify. We used the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and the Zelig model to simulate the forest canopy Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Factor (BRDF) in order to build a look-up table, and eight vegetation indices were used to assess the relationship between BRDF and forest biomass in order to find the sensitive angles and bands. Further, the European Space Agency (ESA) mission, Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard the Project for On-board Autonomy (CHRIS-PROBA) and field sample measurements, were selected to test the angular and band effects on forest biomass retrieval. The results showed that the off-nadir vegetation indices could predict the forest biomass more accurately than the nadir. Additionally, we found that the viewing angle effect is more important, but the band effect could not be ignored, and the sensitive angles for extracting forest biomass are greater viewing angles, especially around the hot and dark spot directions. This work highlighted the combination of angles and bands, and found a new index based on the traditional vegetation index, Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), which is calculated by combining sensitive angles and sensitive bands, such as blue band 490 nm/-55°, green band 530 nm/55°, and the red band 697 nm/55°, and the new index was tested to improve the accuracy of forest biomass retrieval. This is a step forward in multi-angle remote sensing applications for mining the hidden relationship between BRDF and forest structure information, in order to increase the utilization efficiency of remote sensing data. © 2016 by the authors.","Biomass; Image reconstruction; Reflection; Remote sensing; Space optics; Table lookup; Vegetation; Distribution factor; Forest biomass; Forest structure; Multi-angle remote sensing; Vegetation index; Forestry","Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Factor; Forest biomass; Forest structure information; Multi-angle remote sensing; Vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995469347"

The accuracy of satellite FAPAR products directly influences estimates of ecosystem productivity and carbon stocks. The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10% or 0.05 for many applications. However, most current FAPAR products do not meet such requirements, and further improvements are still needed. In this paper, a data fusion scheme based on the multiple resolution tree (MRT) approach is developed to integrate multiple satellite FAPAR estimates at site and regional scales. MRT was chosen because of the superior computational efficiency compared with other fusion methods. The fusion scheme removed the bias in FAPAR estimates and resulted in a 15% increase in the $R^{2}$ and 3% reduction in the root-mean-square error compared with the average of individual FAPAR estimates. The regional-scale fusion filled in the missing values, and provided spatially consistent FAPAR distributions at different resolutions. Overall, MRT can be used to efficiently and accurately generate spatially and temporally continuous FAPAR data across both site and regional scales. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Biological systems; Carbon; Climate models; Computational efficiency; Data fusion; Ecology; Forestry; Kalman filters; Mean square error; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Solar radiation; Spectrometers; Trees (mathematics); Biological system modeling; Green products; LANDSAT; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Multiple resolutions; Photosynthetically active radiation; absorption coefficient; data assimilation; error analysis; error correction; methodology; MISR; MODIS; photosynthetically active radiation; satellite data; Data integration","Data fusion; Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) integration; Landsat; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR); Multiple resolution tree (MRT)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040039826"

To obtain this parameter precisely, many institutions plan to launch satellites with multi-angle measurement sensors, but one important step in aerosol retrieval, the estimation of surface reflectance, is still a pressing issue. This paper presents an AOD retrieval method based on the multi-angle intensity data from the Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) platform using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), which can be universally applied to multi-angle observations. The function of EOFs in this study is to estimate surface intensity contributions, associated with aerosol lookup tables (LUTs), so that the retrieval of AOD can be implemented. A comparison of the retrieved AODs for the Beijing, Xianghe, Taihu, and Hongkong_PolyU sites with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations produced high correlation coefficients (r) of 0.892, 0.915, 0.831, and 0.897, respectively, while the corresponding root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.095, 0.093, 0.099, and 0.076, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Geophysics; Mean square error; Nanofluidics; Optical properties; Optical radar; Reflection; Table lookup; AERONET; Aerosol optical depths; Bright regions; East China; Empirical Orthogonal Function; Multi-angle remote sensing; PARASOL; Retrieval; Orthogonal functions","AERONET; Aerosol optical depth; Bright regions; East China; Empirical orthogonal functions; Multi-angle remote sensing; PARASOL; Retrieval","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021230432"

Using seven images from this product, captured by the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer sensor (MISR), we explored the values reached by the three parameters (ρ0, Θ, and k) of the Rahman–Pinty–Verstraete model, which was modified by Martonchick (MRPV). Thereafter, we compared the values and behaviors shown in seven Co-ordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover categories, in the red and near infrared (NIR) bands, over the seven MISR orbits captured in 2006 for Mainland Spain. Furthermore, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) ancillary data and the illumination angles from the same pixels, which made up the images. These ancillary data were also provided by the MISR products. An inferential statistic test was performed to evaluate the relationship between each parameter–band combination, and the land cover in every MISR orbit used. The results suggested that the ρ0 parameters of this product seemed to be the most related to photosynthetic activity, and it should be comparable with the widely-used NDVI. On the other hand, the k and Θ parameter values were not related, or at least not entirely related, to the phenology of land coverage. These seemed to be more influenced by the anisotropy behavior of the studied land cover pixels. Additionally, we observed, by constructing analysis of variance, how the mean of each MRPV parameter–band differed statistically (p < 0.01) by land covers and orbits. This study suggested that the MISR MRPV model parameter data product has great potential to be used to improve land cover applications. © 2017 by the authors.","","Anisotropy; BRF; MISR; MISR level 2 land surface (MIL2ASLS) product; MRPV model; Multiangular data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044583207"

The spatial distributions of annual mean lowest Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) value is observed in Bangalore (BLR) (0.22±0.04) and the highest AOD value is noted in Visakhapatnam (VSK) (0.39±0.05). Similarly high Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) is noticed over VSK and Thiruvananthapuram (TVM), while lower values are observed in Anantapur (ATP), Hyderabad (HYD), Pune (PUNE) and BLR. From the results, a negative correlation was found between AOD and Cloud Top Temperature (CTT), Cloud Top Pressure (CTP) where as, a positive correlation was observed between AOD and Cloud Fraction (CF), Water Vapor (WV) over the selected regions. Monthly average AOD and FMF are plotted for analysis of the trends of aerosol loading in a long-term scale and both values showed statistically significant enhancing trend over all regions as derived from the MODIS measurements. Further, the annual variation of spatial correlation between MODIS and MISR (Multi - Angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer) AOD has been analyzed and the correlation coefficients are found to be higher in two of the regions VSK and PUNE (>0.8), and considerably lower for TVM (<0.7). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Global warming; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol optical property; Correlation coefficient; Fine mode fraction; MISR; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; MODIS; Spatial and temporal variation; Optical properties","Aerosol optical depth; Fine mode fraction; MISR; MODIS; Ångstrrom exponent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969754354"

Compared with traditional remote sensing methods, multi-angle polarization has relatively stable correlation and regularity. RSP(research scanning polarimeter)is an airborne prototype for the APS(aerosol polarimetery sensor) developed by the USA, which can provide with us the polarization detection information of 9 channels. We can get optical properties and physical characteristics of vegetation by analyzing stable multi-angle and multi-band polarization detection information from preprocessing scanning polarization data of flight test. In this paper, after making registration based on flight attitude information, a comparative analysis is made between characteristics of reflectance and polarization reflectance with visible light and near infrared band of the view zenith angles between -30 degree and 65 degree, based on dense area and sparse area(close to bare field) of vegetation. The results show that both dense area and sparse area demonstrate regular characteristics of polarization degree. The area close to hot spot area has highest reflectance energy. In contrast, it has relatively least energy of polarization degree, which can prevent strong reflectance energy from influencing the stability of detector. Because the degree of polarization in dense area of vegetation is higher than that in sparse area at visible light band while that in concentration area of vegetation is lower than sparse area at near infrared light band, it shows that the visible light band information of dense area of vegetation that the sensor received is dominated by single scattering while the near infrared light band information of dense area of vegetation is dominated by multiple scattering. © 2016, Peking University Press.

NDVI-Surf is generally used to discriminate different surface cover types and adopted in many surface models as a vital adjustable parameter to estimate the surface reflectance in remote sensing aerosol retrieval. However, NDVI-Surf is challenging to obtained directly and usually calculated by the red and near-infrared reflectance at the top of atmosphere (NDVI-TOA). NDVI-TOA is very susceptible to the atmosphere with different angles. If NDVI-Surf is replaced by the NDVI-TOA, it will cause an error of surface reflectance estimation and then make the wrong aerosol retrieval. In this study, Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, Vector version (6SV) radiative transfer code was used to analyze the effects of NDVI-TOA on a surface Bidirectional Polarization Distribution Function (BPDF) model under different atmosphere and multi-angles conditions. The results display that the NDVI-TOA decreases with the rise of AOD. Within scattering angle (SA) of 60° to 115°, the influences of NDVI-TOA on BPDF are great and increases with the AOD reduces. Within the SA between 115° to 180°, the effects of NDVI-TOA on BPDF are small and remain unchanged with the AOD decreases.

The performance of the single-angle and multi-angle two-parameter retrieval algorithms employed during each of the aforementioned three periods is assessed using in-situ measured ground permittivity and snow density. Additionally, a synthetic sensitivity analysis is conducted that studies melting effects on the retrievals in the form of two types of ""geophysical noise"" (snow liquid water and footprint-dependent ground permittivity). Experimental and synthetic analyses show that both types of investigated ""geophysical noise"" noticeably disturb the retrievals and result in an increased correlation between them. The strength of this correlation is successfully used as a quality-indicator flag for the purpose of filtering out highly correlated ground permittivity and snow density retrievals. It is demonstrated that this filtering significantly improves the accuracy of both ground permittivity and snow density retrievals compared to corresponding reference in-situ data. Experimental and synthetic retrievals are performed in retrieval modes RM = ""H"", ""V"", and ""HV"", where brightness temperatures from polarizations p = H, p = V, or both p = H and V are used, respectively, in the retrieval procedure. Our analysis shows that retrievals for RM = ""V"" are predominantly least prone to the investigated ""geophysical noise"".

The results of cloud detection have a significant influence on the retrieval accuracy of cloud microphysical properties over the ocean. Therefore, achieving cloud detection over the ocean and determining methods to improve the processing speed of operational algorithm and the precision of cloud pixel recognition for polarized sensors are urgent concerns. This work proposes an Improved Cloud Detection (ICD) algorithm over the ocean according to operational cloud detection problems in satellite polarized sensor data. A series of continuous processes and tests is used to identify the clear-sky and pixel-by-pixel cloudy area using the data of Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectances (POLDER3). Such data are loaded by Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a LiDAR (PARASOL) satellite. The pixels are divided into ocean and land parts. Then, the ocean glint pixels are eliminated via the glint angle computing formula and the empirical threshold (see MODIS 40 degrees). Thereafter, the cloudy pixels are identified using the characteristic difference of near-infrared reflectance between cloud and clear-sky regions. Cloudy pixels with low reflectance are also further recognized using a polarized reflectance test according to the polarized sensitive characteristics of cloud particles. Next, the clear-sky pixels are identified by the reflectance ratio test between near- infrared and visible light. Finally, the spatial registration rule is created with multi-angle cloud detecting results, and all pixels are relabeled to cloudy, clear-sky, and undetermined pixels with this rule. The Indian Ocean is used as an example for experimental analysis. The results of improved cloud detection are compared with those of the Buriez method. The detection accuracy is very close to the Buriez algorithm but is more time-efficient. In the case of clear-sky pixels, the recognition rates of ICD and of the Buriez algorithm are approximately 30. For cloudy pixels, the recognition rate of ICD is approximately 47%. The error range of cloudy and undetermined pixels is approximately 1% compared with the Buriez algorithm. Furthermore, the efficiency of our cloud detection algorithm greatly improved. The data processing speed is improved approximately three times without considering the time consumption of external data acquisition. Results show that the algorithm is highly effective in achieving high-precision results of cloud detection. At the same time, the processing time of cloudy pixels is significantly reduced, and the operational speed of cloud-detecting products is considerably improved. This algorithm can provide real-time and accurate products for the inversion of atmosphere and ocean parameters to meet the high-precision and -efficiency requirements of operational processing in satellite ground systems. This algorithm is also dominant in the cloud detection process for Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) in the GF-5 satellite which is planned for launch in 2017. © 2018, Science Press.

The seasonal analysis of DOD and dust occurrences identified the largest dust loading and the most frequent dust occurrence in the spring and summer, respectively. No significant trend was found during the research period in terms of both DOD and the dust occurrence. Further analysis of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) aerosol products on a case-by-case basis in most dust months of 2007 suggested that the vertical structure is varying in terms of the extension and the dust loading from one event to another, although dust particles of most episodes have similar physical characteristics (particle shape and size).

One of the difficult problems is how to ensure the reconstruction quality of image edge texture area. In this paper, a single image super-resolution reconstruction approach based on wavelet domain is proposed. Firstly, the non-subsampled wavelet transform (NSWT) is applied to the input image, according to the multi-directionality of wavelet transform, three kinds of multi-angle templates are proposed, and each subband contour is estimated by total variation model (TV model) to determine its optimal direction. Then, the multi-angle templates and bicubic B-spline interpolation are used to interpolate the subbands. Finally, the non-subsampled wavelet inverse transform is implemented. This approach makes edge information and texture information of the reconstructed images more precise, and overcomes some deficiencies such as edge blurring, edge serration, as well as distortion of texture region, caused by traditional interpolation reconstruction approaches, such as bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation, etc. The quality of reconstructed image is improved. This approach can be used in image monitoring, remote sensing image analysis, medical image processing, and so on. A large number of simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2018, Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Therefore, global observations of GWs in the MLT region are of particular interest. The small scales of GWs, however, pose a major problem for the observation of GWs from space. We propose a new observation strategy for GWs in the mesopause region by combining limb and sub-limb satellite-borne remote sensing measurements for improving the spatial resolution of temperatures that are retrieved from atmospheric soundings. In our study, we simulate satellite observations of the rotational structure of the O2 A-band nightglow. A key element of the new method is the ability of the instrument or the satellite to operate in so-called target mode, i.e. to point at a particular point in the atmosphere and collect radiances at different viewing angles. These multi-angle measurements of a selected region allow for tomographic 2-D reconstruction of the atmospheric state, in particular of GW structures. The feasibility of this tomographic retrieval approach is assessed using simulated measurements. It shows that one major advantage of this observation strategy is that GWs can be observed on a much smaller scale than conventional observations. We derive a GW sensitivity function, and it is shown that target mode observations are able to capture GWs with horizontal wavelengths as short as 50km for a large range of vertical wavelengths. This is far better than the horizontal wavelength limit of 100-200km obtained from conventional limb sounding. © Author(s) 2017.","airglow; atmospheric wave; gravity wave; mesopause; nightglow; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial resolution; thermosphere; tomography; wavelength","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037032918"

In this paper we illustrate aerosol mass loadings by integrating in situ measurements with satellite and ground-based remote sensing datasets for the 2011-2013 period, on both local and large scales. Mass concentrations of these surface atmospheric aerosols were relatively low and varied with land cover, showing a general tendency of Ngari and QOMS (barren sites) > Nam Co (grassland site) > SET (forest site). Daily averages of online PM2.5 (particulates with aerodynamic diameters below 2.5 μm) at these sites were sequentially 18.2 ± 8.9, 14.5 ± 7.4, 11.9 ± 4.9 and 11.7 ± 4.7 μg m-3. Correspondingly, the ratios of PM2.5 to total suspended particles (TSP) were 27.4 ± 6.65, 22.3 ± 10.9, 37.3 ± 11.1 and 54.4 ± 6.72 %. Bimodal mass distributions of size-segregated particles were found at all sites, with a relatively small peak in accumulation mode and a more notable peak in coarse mode. Diurnal variations in fine-aerosol masses generally displayed a bi-peak pattern at the QOMS, Nam Co and SET stations and a single-peak pattern at the Ngari station, controlled by the effects of local geomorphology, mountain-valley breeze circulation and aerosol emissions. Dust aerosol content in PM2.1 samples gave fractions of 26 % at the Ngari station and 29 % at the QOMS station, or ∼ 2-3 times that of reported results at human-influenced sites. Furthermore, observed evidence confirmed the existence of the aerodynamic conditions necessary for the uplift of fine particles from a barren land surface. Combining surface aerosol data and atmospheric-column aerosol optical properties, the TSP mass and aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) generally decreased as land cover changed from barren to forest, in inverse relation to the PM2.5 ratios. The seasonality of aerosol mass parameters was land-cover dependent. Over forest and grassland areas, TSP mass, PM2.5 mass, MISR-AOD and fine-mode AOD were higher in spring and summer, followed by relatively lower values in autumn and winter. At the barren site (the QOMS station), there were inconsistent seasonal patterns between surface TSP mass (PM2.5 mass) and atmospheric column AOD (fine-mode AOD). Our findings implicate that HTP aerosol masses (especially their regional characteristics and fine-particle emissions) need to be treated sensitively in relation to assessments of their climatic effect and potential role as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei. © 2017 Author(s).","China; Himalayas; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; aerosol; cloud condensation nucleus; concentration (composition); ground-based measurement; observational method; optical depth; particle size; satellite data","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009212785"

To improve the SAR image quality, we propose a distributed SAR imaging method for the cylinder target with a sparse distributed SAR configuration. The proposed method reconstructs the cylinder target by estimating the parameters from the SAR image, and then identity the cylinder target from the distributed SAR echo. When positive decision is made, the shape of the cylinder target can be recovered with these parameters.

Aerosol data assimilation is an operational reality at numerous centers, and like meteorological reanalyses, aerosol reanalyses will see significant use in the near future. Here we present a standardized 2003-2013 global 1 × 1° and 6-hourly modal aerosol optical thickness (AOT) reanalysis product. This data set can be applied to basic and applied Earth system science studies of significant aerosol events, aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction, and electro-optical propagation and sensor performance, among other uses. This paper describes the science of how to develop and score an aerosol reanalysis product. This reanalysis utilizes a modified Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) at its core and assimilates quality controlled retrievals of AOT from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua and the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on Terra. The aerosol source functions, including dust and smoke, were regionally tuned to obtain the best match between the model fine- and coarse-mode AOTs and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOTs. Other model processes, including deposition, were tuned to minimize the AOT difference between the model and satellite AOT. Aerosol wet deposition in the tropics is driven with satellite-retrieved precipitation, rather than the model field. The final reanalyzed fine- and coarse-mode AOT at 550nm is shown to have good agreement with AERONET observations, with global mean root mean square error around 0.1 for both fine- and coarse-mode AOTs. This paper includes a discussion of issues particular to aerosol reanalyses that make them distinct from standard meteorological reanalyses, considerations for extending such a reanalysis outside of the NASA A-Train era, and examples of how the aerosol reanalysis can be applied or fused with other model or remote sensing products. Finally, the reanalysis is evaluated in comparison with other available studies of aerosol trends, and the implications of this comparison are discussed. © Author(s) 2016.","AERONET; aerosol; Aqua (satellite); data assimilation; meteorology; MISR; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite sensor; Terra (satellite); wet deposition","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965159515"

The experiment in Feb. 23, 2010 showed that, by our algorithm, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of haze can be retrieved well. The AOD of our algorithm from 2009 to 2010 was close to that of ground-based measurements (correlation coefficient was about 0.9), and the retrieval error was about 10%.

It is very important to monitor the changes in the amount of soil erosion, for useful information to guide the planning of soil and water conservation, protect the soil and water resources and control the soil erosion. Therefore, the method by which we obtain high quality and long sequential LAI at a regional scale is very important for analyzing the relationship between the dynamic changes in soil erosion and vegetation. Previous studies showed that the neural network had an incomparable superiority in terms of complex, nonlinear data fitting and pattern recognition, and had been successfully applied to inverse the LAI in Nanjing based on the multi-spectral remote sensing data derived from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager(OLI), four types of vegetation indices(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI; Ratio Vegetation Index, RVI; Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index, SAVI; Modified Soil adjusted Vegetation Index, MSAVI), and measured LAI data. The results showed that the accuracy of retrieval was good. In this paper, we used the Back Propagation(BP) neural network model to inverse the LAI in Nanjing during 1988-2013 based on the data derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM). Based on the measured values of LAI in 2009 and 2010, the evaluation accuracy and adaptability of the model were verified and discussed. The results showed that:(1) The model had a fitting of higher degree, and average relative errors (MAPE), root mean square errors(RMSE), and correlation coefficients(R) in 2009 and 2010 of 0.2395 and 0.2174, 0.2962 and 0.2581, and 0.7713 and 0.6844, respectively. Each accuracy evaluation index was good. (2) Following statistical analysis, we found that the low vegetation coverage area (LAI < 2) exhibited an increasing trend, the high vegetation coverage area (LAI > 3) presented a first decreasing and then increasing trend, while the cultivated land area decreased with the rapid development in Nanjing.(3) To analyze accurately the LAI, we extracted the LAI in the main urban area, and found that there was a relatively high inversion value, and the inter-annual change in LAI was consistent with the change in vegetation coverage in Nanjing reported by other studies. Therefore, we could see that the BP neural network model had a high accuracy for the time series LAI inversion. It provides a new way for quantitative remote sensing monitoring of regional soil erosion. Moreover, because of other potential limiting factors, such as the errors produced by the BP neural network model, the large area of the inversion area, the complexity of vegetation types and community structure, etc., the inversion accuracy of LAI through remote sensing still needs to be explored, and the inversion method improved. We will try to establish a multi-angle LAI inversion method to construct the coupling model of LAI and soil erosion or quantitative fusion of multi-source remote sensing images in the future study. © 2018 Science Press.

Among satellites dedicated to Earth observation and monitoring ecosystem succession, CHRIS/PROBA is the only satellite that presents quasi-simultaneous multi-angular pointing and hyperspectral imaging. These two characteristics permit the study of structural and compositional differences of TDFs with different levels of succession. In this paper, we use 2008 and 2014 CHRIS/PROBA images from a TDF in Minas Gerais, Brazil to study ecosystem succession after abandonment. Using a -55° angle of observation; several classifiers including spectral angle mapper (SAM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision trees (DT) were used to test how well they discriminate between different successional stages. Our findings suggest that the SAM is the most appropriate method to classify TDFs as a function of succession (accuracies ~80 for % for late stage, ~85% for the intermediate stage, ~70% for early stage, and ~50% for other classes). Although CHRIS/PROBA cannot be used for large-scale/long-term monitoring of tropical forests because of its experimental nature; our results support the potential of using multi-angle hyperspectral data to characterize the structure and composition of TDFs in the near future. © 2018 by the authors.","Decision trees; Ecosystems; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Tropics; Compositional difference; Dry forests; Ecological successions; Ecosystem successions; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Multi-angle remote sensing; Spectral angle mappers; Forestry","Dry forests; Ecological succession; Multi-angle remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058874455"

They are typically screened out through statistical procedures, though this approach does not provide a real justification for discarding values, other than they appear different from the rest of the data. On the other hand, remote sensing products are frequently derived by inverting a model against measurements, a procedure that naturally leads to the estimation of some ‘cost function’, a numerical value that quantitatively expresses the ability of the model to ‘fit’ the data. This paper argues that it may be more meaningful to identify and sift outliers on the basis of this cost function, than solely on the basis of being different from some measure of central tendency. One advantage of this approach is that it will filter out data points with an excessive mismatch between the model and the data, whether or not these appear to be outliers. This approach is demonstrated by analysing specific products derived from NASA’s Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data, though the method is applicable to any result generated through model inversion against observational data, and is therefore of general interest to a wide range of geographical applications. © 2017 Society of South African Geographers.","South Africa; data interpretation; data inversion; MISR; outlier; remote sensing; time series","MISR; outliers; Remote sensing; South Africa; time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021675349"

Two critical parameters of the model are the vegetation index values of fully-vegetated and bare soil pixels (denoted Vx and Vn hereafter). These are commonly empirically set according to spatial and/or temporal statistics. The uncertainty and difficulty of accurately determining Vx and Vn in many ecosystems limits the accuracy of resultant FVC estimates and hence reduces the utility of VI-based mixture model for FVC estimation. Here, an improved method called MultiVI is developed to quantitatively estimate Vx and Vn from angular VI acquired at two viewing angles. The directional VI is calculated from the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43A1) data. The results of simulated evaluation with 10% added noise show that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of FVC is approximately 0.1 (the valid FVC range is [0, 1]). Direct evaluation against 34 globally-distributed FVC measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) sites during 2000 to 2014 demonstrated that the accuracy of MultiVI FVC (R2 = 0.866, RMSD = 0.092) exceeds than from SPOT/VEGETATION bioGEOphysical product version 1 (GEOV1) FVC (R2 = 0.795, RMSD = 0.159). MultiVI FVC also exhibits higher correlation to the VALERI reference FVC than does the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product (MCD15A2H; R2 is 0.696). A key advantage of the MultiVI method is obvious in areas where fully-vegetated and/or bare soil pixels do not exist in moderate-coarse spatial resolution imagery when compared to the conventional VI-based mixture modelling. The MultiVI method can be flexibly implemented over regional or global scales to monitor FVC, with maps of Vx and Vn generated as two important byproducts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Byproducts; Distribution functions; Mixtures; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Fractional vegetation cover; Mixture model; Multi-angle observations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Vegetation index; bare soil; bidirectional reflectance; modeling; MODIS; NDVI; numerical method; numerical model; observational method; photosynthetically active radiation; pixel; satellite data; spatial resolution; vegetation cover; Vegetation","Fractional vegetation cover; Mixture model; Multi-angle observations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Vegetation index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049318027"

The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given leaf area index (LAI) value. Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observation data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the synergy between a MODIS-based CI and a MODIS LAI product is examined using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability (‘p-theory’), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types. The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. We show that empirically-based CI maps can be integrated with the MODIS LAI product.

The capability of MAI is mainly used to obtain macroscopic and microphysical features of clouds. On-orbit calibration of spaceborne remote sensing instruments is a key prerequisite for the quantitative application of observational data and extends throughout the life of the instrument. Laboratory calibration has been performed prior to MAI launch with high accuracy. In order to monitor the status of MAI after launched, aiming at the problem that MAI has no onboard calibration system, a method of on-orbit monitoring and inter-calibration of TG-2/MAI 565, 670 and 763 nm channels based on Metop-B/GOME-2 hyperspectral data has been presented. The method first obtains the data of same observation target at the similar time and near geometric condition of MAI and GOME-2 based on spatial, temporal and geometric collocation criterion. Then, the GOME-2 reflectance is convoluted with the spectral response function of the MAI visible channels to obtain the reference reflectivity of visible channels. Finally, compare the reference reflectivity with the MAI reflectivity to achieve the onboard calibration of MAI. The process of calibration mainly includes: (1) Forecasting the orbit of TG-2 and Metop-B from December 2016 to February 2017 to obtain the collocated observations between MAI and GOME-2. The temporal matching interval is set to 900 s, and 8 collocated samples of MAI and GOME-2 are obtained, including 2 455 matched pixels. (2) The spatial location of matched pixels is checked, and the cross samples with MAI pixels over 338 covered by a single GOME-2 pixel is reserved to ensure that a single GOME-2 pixel is filled as completly as possible by the MAI pixels. (3) The limit of GOME-2 observation zenith angle is set to 30°, and the geometry of the observation sight detection condition matching pixels is set to the ratio of cosine of the two instruments observed zenith angle is close to 1, and the difference is not more than 0.05, and takes full advantage of MAI multi-angle observation, which allows each MAI pixel with up to 14 viewing angles. Therefore, the optimal matching viewing angle could be chosen; (4) In the target uniformity checking, the condition of uniformity detection for matched pixels is set to the ratio of the reflectance of all MAI piexls coveraged by a GOME-2 piexl standard deviation and the average is less than 0.5. And 469 GOME-2 pixels are reserved. (5) The reflectance of each wavelength corresponding to the above GOME-2 pixels is convoluted with the spectral response function of the MAI visible channel to obtain the corresponding GOME-2 reference reflectance of each MAI channel. (6) Based on the large difference of the spatial resolution of GOME-2 and MAI pixel, the reflectance of all MAI pixels covered by each GOME-2 pixel is averaged and taken as MAI reflectivity, which significantly reduces the dependence of calibration results on target uniformity. (7) And the inter-calibration coefficients are derived by regression analysis of the GOME-2 reference reflectivity and the MAI reflectivity. Onboard inter-calibration of the MAI is achieved. To analyze the influence of matching and screening conditions on the calibration results, the simple variable method is used to adjust the threshold of each test condition in pixel matching and screening process. The results show that the calibration results do not change significantly when the matching and screening conditions are more stringent. The MAI reflectance and the GOME-2 reference reflectance are compared, and the results indicate that both reflectivities have a significant linear relationship with the correlation coefficients all better than 0.97. The mean values of their differences are 1.6%, 4.2% and 2.3%, and the standard deviations are 3.1%, 4.1% and 2.4% for the three channels, respectively. Therefore, on-orbit monitoring and vicarious calibration of the MAI visible bands can be achieved by the inter-calibration method, which lays the foundation for the quantitative application of MAI data. © 2019, Peking University Press.

They use the characteristics and spatial characteristics of electromagnetic waves to accurately identify all the surface of the earth's object. Any single method and means cannot fully describe and reflect all the features of the ground. Polarization measurement is one of the indispensable technologies in target recognition and recognition technology, and has become a research hotspot in the field of target recognition in the world in recent years. Since the effects of strong and weak reflection intensity on vegetation remote sensing cannot be ignored in quantitative remote sensing inversion, which renders the reflected radiant signal as either saturated or too weak to be detected. Polarization is an important method for the quantitative remote sensing of vegetation. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a method to overcome the vegetation inversion error caused by strong and weak reflection intensities, which is the goal of our present research. If the reflected radiant signal is either too strong or too weak, it will affect the accuracy of remote sensing. Polarized light from vegetation can provide useful information, especially when the reflected radiant signal is saturated so that the sensor cannot obtain enough useful non-polarization information. This study developed a polarization method to overcome the vegetation inversion error caused by strong or weak reflection intensity using a ground-based polarized field imaging spectrometer system. The FISS-P polarization imaging spectrometer system was used to study the effect of reflection intensity on the utility of remote sensing vegetation NDVI and DoLP. The experiment was conducted at the Olympic Science and Technology Park of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. When targets are sampled, the vegetation with strong reflectivity, low reflectivity and moderate reflectivity is measured respectively. Meanwhile, the DoLP of target vegetation's different bands (470, 555, 670, 864 nm) are calculated and analyzed. The degree of vegetation density (NDVI) is very low due to signal saturation and shadow effect, resulting in severe inversion error. However, strong reflection has little effect on DoLP. As the ground-based field imaging spectrometer system (FISS-P) provides high-spatial-resolution images with polarization information, we can determine the spectrum-polarization characteristics of single pixels in shaded and strong reflection areas. On the basis of the imaging spectral information, the physical properties of the ground objects are analyzed by using the polarization of light. In this paper, the Stokes component is used to characterize the polarization components of the reflected light, and the degree of polarization of the reflected light is characterized by linear polarization (DoLP). Signal saturation and shadow effects result in very low values for dense vegetation on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), causing serious inversion error. However, strong reflection has few effects on the degree of linear polarization (DoLP). This study showed that polarization can improve vegetation inversion accuracy by using the appropriate band when the reflected radiant signal is saturated, and the relative error of the average NDVI is 33. 8%, while that of DoLP (670 nm) is only 6. 3%, the relative errors of DoLP (555, 864 nm) in other bands are much larger. The results of this study show that strong reflection can be ignored when identifying vegetation, however, the shadow (weak reflection) effects could not be ignored. FISS-P images are an effective tool for calculating polarization and non-polarization parameters for sample types with different reflection intensities. In conclusion, the polarization effect can improve the vegetation inversion accuracy when the reflected radiant signal is saturated compared with non-polarization methods. This study analyzed the reduction in error caused by strong and weak reflection intensities using a polarization method. And there are still some problems need to be solved in order to further reveal the relationship between the shadow (weak reflection) effects and DoLP of vegetation. © 2018, Peking University Press.

Multi-Angle instruments, such as the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the POlarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), seek to address this by making information-rich multi-Angle observations that can be used to better retrieve aerosol optical properties. The paradigm for such instruments is that each angle view is made from one platform, with, for example, a gimballed sensor or multiple fixed view angle sensors. This restricts the observing geometry to a plane within the scene bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) observed at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). New technological developments, however, support sensors on small satellites flying in formation, which could be a beneficial alternative. Such sensors may have only one viewing direction each, but the agility of small satellites allows one to control this direction and change it over time. When such agile satellites are flown in formation and their sensors pointed to the same location at approximately the same time, they could sample a distributed set of geometries within the scene BRDF. In other words, observations from multiple satellites can take a variety of view zenith and azimuth angles and are not restricted to one azimuth plane as is the case with a single multi-Angle instrument. It is not known, however, whether this is as potentially capable as a multi-Angle platform for the purposes of aerosol remote sensing. Using a systems engineering tool coupled with an information content analysis technique, we investigate the feasibility of such an approach for the remote sensing of aerosols. These tools test the mean results of all geometries encountered in an orbit.We find that small satellites in formation are equally capable as multi-Angle platforms for aerosol remote sensing, as long as their calibration accuracies and measurement uncertainties are equivalent. As long as the viewing geometries are dispersed throughout the BRDF, it appears the quantity of view angles determines the information content of the observations, not the specific observation geometry. Given the smoothly varying nature of BRDF's observed at the TOA, this is reasonable and supports the viability of aerosol remote sensing with small satellites flying in formation. The incremental improvement in information content that we found with number of view angles also supports the concept of a resilient mission comprised of multiple satellites that are continuously replaced as they age or fail. © Author(s) 2018.","aerosol; azimuth; calibration; feasibility study; instrumentation; MISR; optical property; POLDER; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; top of atmosphere; zenith angle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049597654"

Directional brightness temperature (BT) models that describe this anisotropic behavior of TIR emissions can be applied to separate component temperatures using multi-angle observations. The surface temperature differences that occur between sunlit and shaded areas and the leaf clumping phenomenon jointly affect the directional signatures of out-of-canopy directional BTs. However, these factors are not fully considered in existing directional BT models. This paper therefore extends the FR97 analytical model to 1) a four-component scene containing sunlit and shaded soil and leaves by incorporating the effective emissivity values of the sunlit and shaded parts and 2) row-planted crop and forest canopies by introducing a leaf clumping index. The proposed model was assessed using a synthetic dataset that was generated by the Thermal Radiosity-Graphics Combined Model (TRGM) under various conditions. The evaluation results indicated that the proposed model performed as well as the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (4SAIL) model over continuous canopies with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.3 °C. Over non-continuous crops and forests, the behavior of the proposed model displayed improved agreement with the TRGM with RMSEs lower than 0.65 °C. The proposed model also displayed a robust performance over both the maize and pine canopies, which was evaluated against the directional anisotropy of measured datasets that were collected at the Huailai remote sensing test site and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), respectively. From these points, the proposed model has potential for component temperature inversion and rapid assessment of TIR angular effects. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","China; Hebei; Huailai; Zea mays; Anisotropy; Crops; Forestry; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Temperature; Anisotropic behaviors; Component temperatures; Directional brightness temperatures; FR97; Leaf clumping; Multi-angle observations; Root mean squared errors; Surface temperature difference; analytical method; anisotropy; brightness temperature; coniferous tree; crop plant; forest canopy; leaf area index; maize; numerical model; remote sensing; surface temperature; Luminance","Directional anisotropy; Directional brightness temperature model; FR97; Leaf clumping index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043520367"

The SSR quantitative inversion model based on multi-angle sun glitter (SG) images has been proposed recently, which will significantly promote SSR observations through multi-angle remote-sensing platforms. However, due to the sensitivity of the sensor view angle (SVA) to SG, it is necessary to determine the optimal imaging angle and their combinations. In this study, considering the design optimization of imaging geometry for multi-angle remote-sensing platforms, we have developed an error transfer simulation model based on the multi-angle SG remote-sensing radiation transmission and SSR estimation models. We simulate SSR estimation errors at di_erent imaging geometry combinations to evaluate the optimal observation geometry combination. The results show that increased SSR inversion accuracy can be obtained with SVA combinations of 0_ and 20_ for nadir- and backward-looking SVAcompared with current combinations of 0_ and 27.6_. We found that SSR inversion prediction error using the proposed model and actual SSR inversion error from field buoy data are correlated.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations on a daily basis using satellite-retrieved Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in the state of Texas. Methods: We obtained the AOD values at 1-km resolution generated through the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm based on the images retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites. We then developed mixed-effects models based on AODs, land use features, geographic characteristics, and weather conditions, and the day-specific as well as site-specific random effects to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations (μg/m3) in the state of Texas during the period 2008–2013. The mixed-effects models’ performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and square root of the mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) from ten-fold cross-validation, which randomly selected 90% of the observations for training purpose and 10% of the observations for assessing the models’ true prediction ability. Results: Mixed-effects regression models showed good prediction performance (R2 values from 10-fold cross validation: 0.63–0.69). The model performance varied by regions and study years, and the East region of Texas, and year of 2009 presented relatively higher prediction precision (R2: 0.62 for the East region; R2: 0.69 for the year of 2009). The PM2.5 concentrations generated through our developed models at 1-km grid cells in the state of Texas showed a decreasing trend from 2008 to 2013 and a higher reduction of predicted PM2.5 in more polluted areas. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that mixed-effects regression models developed based on MAIAC AOD are a feasible approach to predict ground-level PM2.5 in Texas.

Long-term trends of vegetative decline (browning) or improvement (greening) have thus not been evaluated despite their importance for assessing conservation strategy implementation in regions where field-based monitoring by environmental authorities is limited. Using Colombia's Cordillera de los Picachos National Natural Park as a case study, we provide a temporally rigorous assessment of regional vegetation change from 2001-2015 with two remote sensing-based approaches using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm. First, we measured long-term vegetation trends using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) time series, and, second, we mapped short-term disturbances using all available Landsat images. MAIAC-derived trends indicate a net greening in 6% of the park, but in the surrounding 10 km area outside of the park, a net browning trend prevails at 2.5%. We also identified a 12,500 ha area within Picachos (4% of the park's total area) that has shown at least 13 years of consecutive browning, a result that was corroborated with our Landsat-based approach that recorded a 12,642 ha (±1440 ha) area of disturbed forest within the park. Landsat vegetation disturbance results had user's and producer's accuracies of 0.95 ± 0.02 and 0.83 ± 0.18, respectively, and 75% of Landsat-detected dates of disturbance events were accurate within ±6 months. This study provides new insights into the contribution of short-term disturbance to long-term trends of vegetation change, and offers an unprecedented perspective on the distribution of small-scale disturbances over a 15-year period in one of the most inaccessible national parks in the Andes. © 2017 by the authors.","Conservation; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Time series; Tropics; Vegetation; Andes; Breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST); Disturbance; LANDSAT; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Tropical forest; Forestry","Andes; Breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST); Disturbance; Landsat; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC); Time series; Tropical forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013637362"

OG significantly influences the imaging quality of ocean remote sensing, especially because the interference is large for clouds and aerosols above the ocean surface. Therefore, eliminating OG is the key problem to be solved in the process of remote sensing data. At present, most OG detections of sensors are utilized by a rough sea surface polarization model combined with an empirical threshold. Orbit height and resolution is different from various sensors available. Thus, the result is quite inaccurate using the same threshold to discriminate glint pixels, thereby resulting in several pixels being utilized ineffectively. The Chinese GF-5 satellite has been scheduled for launch in 2017. It carries a Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) sensor for the atmospheric polarization research at a global scale. Similarly, the OG detection is essential to DPC data processing. The traditional method cannot achieve the dynamic detection of OG for different satellite data. Thus, the problem of accurately obtaining a threshold angle has become the key difficulty of OG dynamic detecting research. OG dynamic detecting (OGDD) method was proposed on the basis of near-infrared (NIR) polarized data, which were not easily affected by atmospheric disturbance under a clear sky. From these data, several parameters, such as the geometry conditions of solar and observation and sea surface wind speed and direction, could be obtained. According to ocean-atmosphere coupled radiative transfer theory, the OGDD model, combined with the OG and multi-directional NIR-polarized radiation information (865 nm), was developed on the basis of the regular performance of the NIR-polarized radiation characteristic. The OGDD was realized by obtaining the dynamic threshold of a glint angle. A calibration layer was selected by using the polarized characteristic tendency of an OG center from detecting layers, and after cloudy pixels have been removed, a slope dynamic analysis was conducted on the basis of an OG-polarized radiative regular variety on top of the atmosphere. Finally, the ocean pixels were marked as glint pixels using the dynamic threshold of the glint angle. This study used PARASOL/POLDER3 satellite data as the research object for the DPC simulation and selected the Indian Ocean as the study area. The NIR channel utilized the OGDD model to acquire apparent and polarization reflectivity (865 nm) of the sea surface. The glint threshold was adjusted dynamically to 34° using the OGDD model. In comparison with MODIS 40°, the glint angle was reduced by approximately 15%, and the pixel-marked glint was relatively decreased by 30%. Similarly, in comparison with POLDER3 30°, the glint angle was relatively improved by nearly 13%, and the pixel-marked glint was increased by 30%. The model can effectively distinguish the glint and non-glint pixels through a dynamically adjusted threshold and significantly improve the utilization rate of the pixels by reducing the interference of aerosol retrieval at the clear sky area. Furthermore, this model can generate reliable data for cloud detection and microphysical characteristic retrieval and provide support to developing the in-flight calibration and aerosol inversion of the GF-5 satellite multi-angle polarization sensor. © 2019, Science Press.

In this contribution, we provide an detailed description of the multi-angle spectro-polarimetric instrument ""SPEX airborne"" that was developed to operate from NASA's high altitude research aircraft ER-2. SPEX airborne delivers measurements of radiance and linear polarization at nine fixed viewports with angles equally distributed over at total angular range of 112°, at visual wavelength in the range 400-760nm. Each viewport acts as a pushbroom spectrometer with a swath of 6°. SPEX airborne participated in the recent the ACEPOL campaign in October-November 2017 when it flew together with NASA's Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI), and the Airborne Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (AirHARP). We compare polarimetric and radiometric measurements from SPEX airborne with those collected by RSP at four visible wavelength bands. Simultaneous measurements were made while flying over widely different scenes, under different illumination and meteorological conditions. This provided a large dynamic range in radiometric and polarimetric values. We find that the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) measured by both instruments agrees well with a RMS differences of ∼0.005 as the best result for 555nm. For radiance measurements excellent agreement is obtained with a RMS difference of ∼4%. The in-flight comparison results provide verification of SPEX airborne's capability to deliver high-quality data. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.","Aerosols; Air quality; Ellipsometry; Instrument scales; NASA; Polarization; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Research aircraft; Space optics; Airborne; Degree of linear polarization; High-altitude research aircraft; Meteorological condition; Multi angle; Radiometric measurements; Research scanning polarimeters; Simultaneous measurement; Polarimeters","Aerosols; Airborne; Multi-angle; Remote sensing; Spectro-polarimetry","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065336740"

The scanning lidar was utilized to be the remote sensing tool to overcome the effect of overlap function of lidar system. The twin scanning lidars were performed for the cross scanning from the ground to the height of concern, which made the exact solutions of the two unknown parameters (extinction and backscatter coefficients) in the lidar equation retrievable. In the procedures of data retrieval, the coordinate and gridding were performed in the cross region, and the initial values of the pixel data were set. Numerical approximations of aerosol extinction and backscatter coefficients were got finally by minimizing the estimation of lidar function and the real one. The verification of retrieval method was performed using the scanning data from the long-range scanning lidar. The result shows that the retrieved result has the same tendency of height compared with the result from the multi-angle method, and twin scanning lidars can provide the aerosol distribution in cross scanning region profile which has advantage compared to the single profile. © 2017, Science Press.

Shadows can lead to either a reduction in or a total loss of information in an image. This can potentially lead to the corruption of biophysical parameters derived from pixel values, such as vegetation indexes (VIs). VIs are widely used in remote sensing inversion applications. If the effects of shadows are not properly accounted for, retrieval may be uncertain when using a VI to calculate vegetation parameters. One of the major reasons that the effects of shadows are easy to be ignored in remote sensing is the spatial resolution of the measurement. High spatial and spectral resolutions are typically difficult to achieve simultaneously, and images that have one tend to not have the other. A ground-based imaging spectrometer brings a turning point to solve this problem as it can obtain both high spatial and high spectral resolutions to obtain feature and shadow images simultaneously. The resolution of the system used here was 1 mm at a height of 1 m, and the spectral resolution was better than 5 nm. For each pixel, the spectral curve of the image was almost a pure-pixel spectral curve, which allowed the differentiation of sunlit and shaded areas. To investigate the effects of shadows on different indexes, 14 hyperspectral VIs were calculated. Moreover, the vegetation fractional coverage calculated using the same 14 VIs was compared. The results show that shadows affect not only each narrowband of a VI but also vegetation parameters. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Image resolution; Pixels; Spectral resolution; Spectrometers; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Biophysical parameters; High spatial resolution; High spectral resolution; Imaging spectrometers; Multi-angle remote sensing; Remotely sensed images; Spectral vegetation; Vegetation parameters; Remote sensing","Hyperspectral imaging; Imaging; Indexes; Spatial resolution; Vegetation mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947042625"

However, the relative toxicity of specific PM types-mixtures of particles of varying sizes, shapes, and chemical compositions-is not well understood. A major impediment has been the sparse distribution of surface sensors, especially those measuring speciated PM. Aerosol remote sensing from Earth orbit offers the opportunity to improve our understanding of the health risks associated with different particle types and sources. The Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite has demonstrated the value of near-simultaneous observations of backscattered sunlight from multiple view angles for remote sensing of aerosol abundances and particle properties over land. The Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) instrument, currently in development, improves on MISR's sensitivity to airborne particle composition by incorporating polarimetry and expanded spectral range. Spatiotemporal regression relationships generated using collocated surface monitor and chemical transport model data will be used to convert fractional aerosol optical depths retrieved from MAIA observations to near-surface PM10, PM2.5, and speciated PM2.5. Health scientists on the MAIA team will use the resulting exposure estimates over globally distributed target areas to investigate the association of particle species with population health effects. © The Authors.

However, traditional remote sensing systems are expensive, highly specialised and may lack the ability to be moved or quickly deployed. Fortunately, the cost of sensors like those used in existing remote sensing systems has decreased over time, and their availability and capability has increased. It is now possible to build and deploy ground-based remote sensing systems with capabilities similar to those on traditional platforms. In this context we define ‘in situ remote sensing systems’ to be within, above, or otherwise adjacent to the vegetation under study but not in direct contact with it. Such systems typically have a measurement range of a few tens of metres, can be deployed quickly and easily moved to new areas of study when required. This paper describes the development of in situ remote sensing systems as has occurred in Australia. The paper also outlines some of the challenges that were met during development and use of several generations of in situ remote sensing systems and presents contemporary work being done for the next generation of systems that will further expand our scientific measurement capability. Initial development of in situ remote sensing systems started in about 2003 with the deployment of the first single pixel multi-angle spectrometer at the CSIRO Tumbarumba field site in south-east New South Wales. Though this was a basic system, it provided much useful data, both in a scientific sense as well as providing information that would be useful in engineering the next generation of sensor systems. Early work in comparing acquired in situ data to satellite sensed data, and radiative modelling was complicated; difficulties included the effects of a non-homogenous forest canopy and the angular distribution of leaves. In 2013 a much more sophisticated system capable of hyperspectral and thermal imaging was installed at the same site, and this system continues to provide detailed and calibrated spectral and thermal time series images of forest canopy dynamics. The ability to examine specific and more uniform regions of interest within the forest canopy is the real value of imaging systems, as opposed to single footprint area-averaged measurements. Because of the high spatial resolution of the acquired data, it is now possible to examine ‘within-tree’ variability as well as ‘between-tree’ variability. The system provides much data for scientific analysis, and points to some of the engineering and data handling issues that influence the way future systems are developed. Building upon these earlier systems, the Australian National University has embarked on a project to build a ‘state of the art’ sensor system that will extend the range of observed wavelengths and be deployable on various platforms for either short-term or extended observation campaigns. This new system uses a variety of sensors that cover the visible, short- and long-wave infrared wavelengths. In the first instance, scientific applications will focus on in situ remote sensing at the ANU Forest Research Facility at the National Arboretum in Canberra. Some important lessons have been learnt over the past 15 years. In situ remote sensing systems require careful design and engineering if they are to reach their full potential. Instrument calibration, handling the vast amount of acquired data and efficient data reduction are significant factors in the successful use of such systems. This contribution concludes with a speculative view of the future direction of science infrastructure in this field. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

This study intended to apply the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to track LUE or APAR variations in a subtropical coniferous forest using tower-based PRI and GPP measurements. To improve the ability of using PRI to track LUE or APAR, a two-leaf approach differentiating sunlit and shaded leaves was used to process the remote sensing and flux data. However, penumbra region, the 'grey region' between sunlit and shaded leaves, increases the difficulty for quantifying the fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves. Firstly, three methods with different ways on treating the penumbra region were investigated for estimating the fraction of sunlit leaves (PT). After evaluating the correlations between observed PRI (PRIobs) and inversely retrieved PRI (PRIinv) from estimated PT using the three methods, we found that treating a substantial portion of penumbra region as sunlit leaves was reasonable and using the ratio of canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance as PT was accurate and efficient. Based on this, we used the two-leaf approach to estimate the canopy-level PRI, aiming to evaluate the ability of using PRI as a proxy for LUE or APAR. Results showed that PRI was able to capture half-hourly and daily changes in LUE and APAR, and the two-leaf approach could enhance the correlations between PRI and both LUE and APAR at both half-hourly and daily time steps. Strong diurnal correlations (averaged R = 0.82 from 173 days) between two-leaf PRI and APAR were found on more than 80% days and the relationship between them over the whole study period was also very significant (R2 > 0.5, p < 0.0001) regardless of different climate conditions, suggesting that the two-leaf PRI was probably a better proxy for APAR than for LUE at short-term scale as PRI mainly represented the absorbed energy allocated to photoprotection at short time scale and was a direct outcome driven by APAR. However, the scattered relationships of PRI with LUE and APAR indicated there were still many limitations in usage of PRI to accurately estimate physiological parameters affected by changing weather conditions, pigment pool size, etc., which needed further exploration. © 2019 by the authors.","Physiological models; Plants (botany); Reflection; Remote sensing; HyperSpectral; Light use efficiency; Multi angle; Photochemical reflectance index; Photosynthetically active radiation; Two-leaf; Forestry","Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; Hyperspectral; Light use efficiency; Multi-angle; Photochemical reflectance index; Two-leaf","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071556884"

Clouds rarely form in clean conditions and often take on lofted aerosol to spur rapid condensation. In doing so, the aerosol enhances cloud brightness and lifetime and prolongs rainout. Understanding this interplay is essential: it is still one of the most uncertain contributors to global radiative balance. At the Earth and Space Institute at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in Baltimore, MD, USA, we are designing and developing the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter-2 (HARP2), a wide field-of-view (FOV) multi-angle imaging polarimeter instrument to advance cloud and aerosol microphysical surveys. Proposed as a result of the NASA Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystem (ACE) study and the 2007 National Academy of Sciences Decadal Survey, HARP2 will fly on-board the NASA Plankton-Aerosol-Cloud-ocean Ecosystem (PACE) spacecraft in the early 2020s. HARP2 will perform atmospheric and ocean characterization in synergy with the primary payload, the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), and the SPEXone hyper-spectral polarimeter during the PACE mission. HARP2's 113 degree FOV and four visible wavelengths, spread across 120 distinct viewing angles, enable multi-dimensional measurement over a broad scattering angle range, both along- and cross-track. Additionally, the PACE polar orbit supports HARP2 global coverage in two days, benefitted by 700m native resolution at nadir. HARP2 will perform several calibration modes (solar, lunar, vicarious) on-orbit that exploit an internal transfer calibration mechanic for total radiance and polarization, UV solarization studies, and traceability. Predicted accuracy in degree of linear polarization (0.005) and total radiance (0.03) improves upon earlier HARP concepts: HARP CubeSat, a 10x10x15 (1.5U) payload slated for ISS orbit in 2019, and AirHARP, an aircraft-ready version of HARP CubeSat that participated in two NASA aircraft campaigns in 2017. When launched, HARP2 will be the only Earth science polarimeter instrument in space that can spatially characterize a 3D cloud or aerosol scene with (1) high co-located angular and spatial resolution, (2) several wavelengths, and (3) a wide swath in polarized light. Cloud droplet size distribution retrievals from AirHARP measurements and preliminary aerosol studies using the GRASP algorithm will be used to discuss the potential of HARP2 measurement and synergy with OCI, SPEXone, and other current Earth observing instruments (MODIS, VIIRS, ABI, etc.).

Surface reflectance anisotropy is characterized by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Within the past decade, space-borne multiangle observations acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (which has a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m) and by the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) sensor (which has a spatial resolution of 6 × 7 km) have been used for a wide variety of global applications. However, it is necessary to fully understand the variability inherent in the surface BRDF information as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER at these two spatial resolutions to optimize their use. In this study, we make use of extensive POLDER Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRFs) selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF database and standard MODIS BRDF parameter products (MCD43A1, Collection V005) that were geolocated within the same spatial extents as the POLDER data. The variability in surface BRDF is characterized by investigation of three BRDF model parameters as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER and a comprehensive index indicating the variations in the primary dome-bowl BRDF patterns (the anisotropic flat index (AFX)). The principal information content contained in these BRDF data is characterized by the general BRDF shapes (the BRDF archetypes) that account for >90% of the total variance in these BRDF data. A hotspot-revised BRDF model is used directly on top of the retrieved model BRDF parameters to capture the hotspot effect associated with these BRDF parameters. The main findings of this study show that the variability in surface BRDF, as extracted from the MODIS and POLDER datasets, shares six reciprocal BRDF archetypes. However, the 500-m MODIS BRDF data can uniquely capture some additional extreme BRDF shapes mainly due to the data's finer pixel scales. These original findings are very important, because subsequent albedo retrievals can be significantly impacted by the use of BRDFs of different resolutions. This study provides evidence concerning the influence of spatial resolution on angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from the MODIS and POLDER BRDF products. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Anisotropy; Distribution functions; Earth (planet); Image resolution; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space optics; BRDF; BRDF archetype; BRDF model; Hot spot; MODIS; Multi-angle remote sensing; POLDER; Scale effects; algorithm; angular momentum; anisotropy; database; measurement method; MODIS; numerical model; optical property; pixel; POLDER; reflectance; remote sensing; scale effect; spatial resolution; Radiometers","AFX; BRDF; BRDF archetype; Hotspot effect; Kernel-driven BRDF model; Linear RTLSR model; MODIS; Multiangle remote sensing; POLDER; Scale effect","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048992120"

Grasping bidirectional reflectance characteristics of the canopy reflectance spectrum is significant to improve the accuracy of remote sensing applications. Many scholars at home and abroad measured and analyzed the vegetation reflectance rate with the change of view angle, variation of solar zenith angle and season, but they mainly focused on the meadows and forests, and the systematical sensitivity analysis on crop reflectance spectrum was less involved. This paper got a lot of multi-angle hyperspectral remote sensing data based on surface automatic remote sensing platforms. Different from the traditional field spectrometer (ASD Fieldspec), Jaz-Combo 2 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, America) uses the field automatic observation system and has some advantages of low cost, continuous observation all day and real-time automatic remote sensing. This paper continuously observed multi-angel canopy reflectance spectra for winter wheat, and analyzed how various factors influenced the canopy reflectance spectra and 2 commonly used vegetation indices NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI(enhanced vegetation index). The results showed that the fluctuation form for the measured canopy reflectance spectra from the self-designed ground automatic remote sensing platforms was found to be consistent with that simulated by the PROSAIL (PROPECT+SAIL) model and also similar to the results studied by Hiker T and Coops N C, et al. The above results demonstrate the measured canopy reflectance spectral data are effective and available, and the calculation method of data is also proved to be reasonable and feasible. With the solar radiation increasing, the canopy reflectance spectra showed an increasing trend and were more obvious in response to weather conditions on sunny days than cloudy days. ""Hot spot effect"" and ""specular reflection"" can be used to explain the phenomenon that with the changes of view angle, the canopy reflectance spectra show different distributions. When the direction of observation and the incidence direction of the sun were on the same side (backscatter), the field of view(direct radiating portion of solar rays) coinciding with the incidence direction of the sun had the strongest point of reflection; when the direction of observation and the incidence direction of the sun were on the opposite side(forward scatter), the field of view(direct radiating portion of solar rays) coinciding with the incidence direction of the sun had the weakest point of reflection. Under the above described conditions, vegetation index NDVI and EVI also showed similar variation with canopy reflectance spectra. Influenced by the red band and near infrared band, the change trend of NDVI and EVI was very consistent. The multi-angle relevant analysis of vegetation index NDVI and EVI showed they had a highly significant linear correlation (R2>0.72, P<0.01). So there were no obvious advantages or disadvantages between NDVI and EVI for uniform growth status and full coverage of vegetation, and they would provide the theoretical reference for the choice and design of remote sensing's view angle and the application of vegetation indices. In this paper, the observations only occurred in the field under uniform growth conditions which was fully covered by the late growth winter wheat, so that the data analysis was not sufficient. In subsequent studies, the data need to be further analyzed with different methods, and crop varieties, crop species and growth period are also needed to verify the findings. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The Multi-Angle Polarization Imager (MAI), onboard TG-2, is the first visible and near-infrared multi-angle polarization imager developed in China. MAI can accomplish polarization observation from up to 14 different viewing angles, which is of great significance for relevant research on the microphysical characteristics of clouds and aerosols. Aimed at the problem of a lack of an onboard calibration device for MAI, to correct TG-2’s calibration coefficients in time, the Simultaneous Nadir Overpass (SNO) cross-calibration method is proposed as a reasonable and feasible method for MAI 565- and 670-nm channels. Data from the M4 and M5 channels of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), with good calibration accuracy, are used as reference data, and a series of matching conditions and a spectral adjustment algorithm are specified. To apply the SNO method, eight groups of examples from December 2016 to February 2017 are selected, and a large number of matching pixel samples covering land, ocean surface, and cloud layers are obtained. The resulting cross-calibration curves between MAI 565-nm and VIIRS M4 channels, and between MAI 670-nm and VIIRS M5 channels, show correlation coefficients of reflectivity of 0.986 and 0.994, mean biases of 2.48% and 5.90%, and RMSEs of 3.56% and 6.95%, respectively. Overall, the cross-calibration method achieved good results, which are of reference significance to correct the laboratory calibration coefficient of MAI. The proposed method effectively solves the problems of MAI’s subsequent on-orbit monitoring and vicarious calibration, and also lays a foundation for later applications of MAI data in research on cloud and aerosol microphysical parameters. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Aerosols; Infrared devices; Polarization; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space stations; Thermography (imaging); Cross calibration; SNO method; Tiangong-2; VIIRS; Visible channels; Calibration","Cross-calibration; MAI; SNO method; Tiangong-2; VIIRS; Visible channels","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058570861"

With the aid of the MISR (multi-angle imaging spectro-radiometer) image, the multi-scale BCVL inversion is implemented with the algorithm on each scale of wavelet decomposition based on DWD of MISR image. The retrieved results of the rough-scale wavelet decomposition are regarded as a priori knowledge of the fine-scale inversion, and then the retrieved results of the rough-scale are also considered as the initial values of the fine-scale inversion. In this way, wavelet decomposition of MISR image is gradually refined, and the retrieved result is likewise gradually refined until the final retrieved result of BCVL is achieved in the end. The algorithm provides a novel solution scheme for the model inversion of BCVL with the aid of DWD of MISR image. Furthermore, this article also discusses the arithmetic principle of the model inversion of BCVL by employing the radiative transfer model of vegetation leaves (RTMV). On this basis, this manuscript builds the inversion model of BCVL based on RTMV. The proposed algorithm is applied specially to the model inversion of BCVL by using MISR image in this experiment, and satisfactory results are finally achieved. Taking the model inversion of LAI (leaf area index) as an example, the retrieved result of a higher precision is achieved in the experiment. Where, correlation coefficient between measured LAI and retrieved LAI is R=0.84, and root-mean-square error is RMSE=0.26. Experiment demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is very effectual and reliable in the model inversion of BCVL. The proposed algorithm opens up a novel algorithmic pathway for the model inversion of BCVL by means of DWD of MISR image. © 2018","","BCVL; DWD; LAI; MISR image; RS; RTMV","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059478595"

Conversely, an improved ocean surface constraint should also improve MISR aerosol-type products, especially spectral single-scattering albedo (SSA) retrievals. We introduce a coupled, self-consistent retrieval of Chl together with aerosol over dark water. There are time-varying MISR radiometric calibration errors that significantly affect key spectral reflectance ratios used in the retrievals. Therefore, we also develop and apply new calibration corrections to the MISR top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data, based on comparisons with coincident MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations and trend analysis of the MISR TOA bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) over three pseudo-invariant desert sites. We run the MISR research retrieval algorithm (RA) with the corrected MISR reflectances to generate MISR-retrieved Chl and compare the MISR Chl values to a set of 49 coincident SeaBASS (SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System) in situ observations. Where Chlinsitu&lt;1.5mgmg-3, the results from our Chl model are expected to be of highest quality, due to algorithmic assumption validity. Comparing MISR RA Chl to the 49 coincident SeaBASS observations, we report a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.86, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.25, and a median absolute error (MAE) of 0.10. Statistically, a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that it is not possible to distinguish between MISR Chl and available SeaBASS in situ Chl values (p>0.1). We also compare MODIS-Terra and MISR RA Chl statistically, over much broader regions. With about 1.5 million MISR-MODIS collocations having MODIS Chl <1.5mgmg-3, MISR and MODIS show very good agreement: R Combining double low line 0. 96, MAE Combining double low line 0.09, and RMSE Combining double low line 0.15. The new dark water aerosol/Chl RA can retrieve Chl in low-Chl, case I waters, independent of other imagers such as MODIS, via a largely physical algorithm, compared to the commonly applied statistical ones. At a minimum, MISR's multi-angle data should help reduce uncertainties in the MODIS-Terra ocean color retrieval where coincident measurements are made, while also allowing for a more robust retrieval of particle properties such as spectral single-scattering albedo. © 2017 The Author(s).","aerosol; albedo; algorithm; atmospheric correction; bidirectional reflectance; chlorophyll a; MISR; MODIS; ocean color","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018652323"

However, there is a need to develop this model to characterize the light scattering properties of snow, which tends to exhibit strongly forward scattering behaviors. This study proposes a snow kernel to describe the reflectance anisotropy of snow, mainly based on the asymptotic radiative transfer theory (ART) for a semi-infinite weakly absorbing layer of snow, and then applies this kernel to the framework of kernel-driven BRDF model. This snow kernel adopts the analytic form of the ART model with an improved ability in forward scattering direction, particularly in a case of a large viewing zenith angle (> 60°) where the simulation accuracy of the ART model somewhat decreases in the principal plane (PP). Validation of this method was implemented using observed multiangle data. Pure snow targets were selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF data. This validation demonstrates that this proposed snow kernel in the framework of the kernel-driven RTLSR model show potentials for many potential applications, particularly in the field of Earth's water cycle and radiation budget where snow cover plays an important role. © 2019 IEEE.","Anisotropy; Budget control; Distribution functions; Forward scattering; Geology; Light scattering; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Anisotropic reflectance; ART model; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; BRDF model; Multi-angle observations; Radiative transfer theory; Scattering direction; Scattering property; Snow","ART model; Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); Kernel-driven BRDF model; RTLSR model; snow","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077681752"

However, the flooded background effects on the reflectance anisotropy have not been fully understood. This paper explores the water background effects on the anisotropic reflectance of rice canopy through multi-angle measurements. Seasonal multi-angle reflectance was measured for different view zenith angles (VZA) (−60°–60° with 15° interval) in a flooded paddy rice site. Wavelengths of 550 nm, 660 nm, 850 nm and 1640 nm were extracted to show the canopy anisotropic characteristics. Two canopy anisotropic indices, the anisotropic factor (ANIF) and the anisotropy index (ANIX), were examined for both non-flooded and flooded canopies in key phenology phases. Results show that the reflectance anisotropy of rice canopy is significantly weakened by a shallow layer (≈10 cm) of water. For VZA > 15°, background water decreases the canopy reflectance by up to 28% and weakens the anisotropic properties when LAI < 4.0 and the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover) <80%. The background water shows barely no effect on canopy reflectance when LAI > 5.0. 1640 nm shows the strongest anisotropy when LAI < 2.0, whereas 660 nm shows more significant anisotropy when LAI > 3.0. The backward observations show stronger scattering than the forward observations for the same VZA. The data from this study can be used as input for biophysical models and as validation data for remote sensing products. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","","Background reflectance; Canopy anisotropy; Paddy rice; Water background; Water effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997480167"

A challenge of this model in regard to surface reflectance anisotropy effects comes from its underestimation of the directional reflectance signatures near the Sun illumination direction; also known as the hotspot effect. In this study, a method has been developed for improving the ability of the RTLSR model to simulate the magnitude and width of the hotspot effect. The method corrects the volumetric scattering component of the RTLSR model using an exponential approximation of a physical hotspot kernel, which recreates the hotspot magnitude and width using two free parameters (C1 and C2, respectively). The approach allows one to reconstruct, with reasonable accuracy, the hotspot effect by adjusting or using the prior values of these two hotspot variables. Our results demonstrate that: (1) significant improvements in capturing hotspot effect can be made to this method by using the inverted hotspot parameters; (2) the reciprocal nature allow this method to be more adaptive for simulating the hotspot height and width with high accuracy, especially in cases where hotspot signatures are available; and (3) while the new approach is consistent with the heritage RTLSR model inversion used to estimate intrinsic narrowband and broadband albedos, it presents some differences for vegetation clumping index (CI) retrievals.

For 18+ years, the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has been observing the land surface reflectance anisotropy, which is known to be related to vegetation structure. This study sought to determine the performance of a new MISR-High Resolution (HR) dataset, recently produced at a full 275 m spatial resolution, and consisting of 36 Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRF) and 12 Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) parameters, to estimate the mean tree height (Hmean) and canopy cover (CC) across structurally diverse, heterogeneous, and fragmented forest types in South Africa. Airborne LiDAR data were used to train and validate Random Forest models which were tested across various MISR-HR scenarios. The combination of MISR multi-angular and multispectral data was consistently effective in improving the estimation of structural parameters, and produced the lowest relative root mean square error (rRMSE) (33.14% and 38.58%), forHmean and CC respectively. The combined RPV parameters for all four bands yielded the best results in comparison to the models of the RPV parameters separately: Hmean (R2 = 0.71, rRMSE = 34.84%) and CC (R2 = 0.60, rRMSE = 40.96%). However, the combined RPV parameters for all four bands in comparison to the MISR-HR BRF 36 band model it performed poorer (rRMSE of 5.1% and 6.2% higher for Hmean and CC, respectively). When considered separately, savanna forest type had greater improvement when adding multi-angular data, with the highest accuracies obtained for the Hmean parameter (R2 of 0.67, rRMSE of 31.28%).

Recently, however, their capability to monitor the Amazon forest phenology has been intensely scrutinized. In this study, we analyze the consistency of VIs seasonal patterns obtained from two MODIS products: the Collection 5 BRDF product (MCD43) and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC). The spatio-temporal patterns of the VIs were also compared with field measured leaf litterfall, gross ecosystem productivity and active microwave data. Our results show that significant seasonal patterns are observed in all VIs after the removal of view-illumination effects and cloud contamination. However, we demonstrate inconsistencies in the characteristics of seasonal patterns between different VIs and MODIS products. We demonstrate that differences in the original reflectance band values form a major source of discrepancy between MODIS VI products. The MAIAC atmospheric correction algorithm significantly reduces noise signals in the red and blue bands. Another important source of discrepancy is caused by differences in the availability of clear-sky data, as the MAIAC product allows increased availability of valid pixels in the equatorial Amazon. Finally, differences in VIs seasonal patterns were also caused by MODIS collection 5 calibration degradation. The correlation of remote sensing and field data also varied spatially, leading to different temporal offsets between VIs, active microwave and field measured data. We conclude that recent improvements in the MAIAC product have led to changes in the characteristics of spatio-temporal patterns of VIs seasonality across the Amazon forest, when compared to the MCD43 product. Nevertheless, despite improved quality and reduced uncertainties in the MAIAC product, a robust biophysical interpretation of VIs seasonality is still missing. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonia; algorithm; bidirectional reflectance; MODIS; NDVI; phenology; rainforest; remote sensing; seasonality","BRDF effect; EVI; GEP; MAIAC; MODIS; NDVI; Phenology; Seasonality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997795123"

One is the problem of spatial integration over a large domain where the scattering particles cluster randomly in a medium uniformly filled with an absorbing gas, and only a probabilistic description of the variability is available. The increasingly important application here is passive atmospheric profiling using oxygen absorption in the visible/near-IR spectrum. The other scenario is spectral integration over a region where the absorption cross-section of a spatially uniform gas varies rapidly and widely and, moreover, there are scattering particles embedded in the gas that are distributed uniformly, or not. This comes up in many applications, O2 A-band profiling being just one instance. We bring a common framework to solve these problems both efficiently and accurately that is grounded in the recently developed theory of Generalized Radiative Transfer (GRT). In GRT, the classic exponential law of transmission is replaced by one with a slower power-law decay that accounts for the unresolved spectral or spatial variability. Analytical results are derived in the single-scattering limit that applies to optically thin aerosol layers. In spectral integration, a modest gain in accuracy is obtained. As for spatial integration of near-monochromatic radiance, we find that, although both continuum and in-band radiances are affected by moderate levels of sub-pixel variability, only extreme variability will affect in-band/continuum ratios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption spectroscopy; Aerosols; Computation theory; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Absorption cross sections; Atmospheric profiling; Computational advantages; Multi-angle remote sensing; Probabilistic descriptions; Radiative transfer theory; Scattering particles; Spatial integrations; absorption; aerosol; oxygen; radiative transfer; remote sensing; scattering; spatial variation; spectrum; Integration","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033564514"

Aerosol remote sensing from multi-angle radiometric-only observations enables aerosol characterization to a greater degree than single-view radiometers, as demonstrated by nearly two decades of heritage instruments. Adding polarimetry to the multi-angle observations allows for the retrieval of aerosol optical depth, Angstrom exponent, parameters of size distribution, measures of aerosol absorption, complex refractive index and degree of nonsphericity of the particles, as demonstrated by two independent retrieval algorithms applied to the heritage POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectance (POLDER) instrument. The reason this detailed particle characterization is possible is because a multi-angle polarimeter measurement contains twice the number of Degrees of Freedom of Signal (DFS) than does an observation from a single-view radiometer. The challenges of making use of this information content involve separating surface signal from atmospheric signal, especially when the surface is optically complex and especially in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum where we show the necessity of polarization in making that separation. The path forward is likely to involve joint retrievals that will simultaneously retrieve aerosol and surface properties, although advances will be required in radiative transfer modeling and in representing optically complex constituents in those models. Another challenge is in having the processing capability that can keep pace with the output of these instruments in an operational environment. Yet, preliminary algorithms applied to airborne multi-angle polarimeter observations offer encouraging results that demonstrate the advantages of these instruments to retrieve aerosol layer height, particle single scattering albedo, size distribution and spectral optical depth, and also show the necessity of polarization measurements, not just multi-angle radiometric measurements, to achieve these results. © 2019 Remer, Knobelspiesse, Zhai, Xu, Kalashnikova, Chowdhary, Hasekamp, Dubovik, Wu, Ahmad, Boss, Cairns, Coddington, Davis, Dierssen, Diner, Franz, Frouin, Gao, Ibrahim, Levy, Martins, Omar and Torres.","","Aerosol; Multi-angle; PACE; Polarimeter; Satellite remote sensing","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069043195"

Smoke contains carbonous particles that influence the regional climate patterns. Wildfires sometimes generate thick smoke layers that cause poor visibility and accidents. Generally smoke tends to disperse in form of layers in the atmosphere. Aircraft measurements are performed to understand the dynamics of smoke plumes. However, these measurements involve cost and enormous amount of exercise. Significant amount of information is required for understanding the dissipation of smoke from wildfires. Occasionally, smoke generated from wildfires cross political boundaries and influence chemical composition of atmosphere. Recently, at a unit of Department of Space (DOS) located near Tirupati, a laser radar system was developed indigenously for remote sensing smoke layers in the atmosphere. The developed laser radar system uses a novel multi-angle method to track the smoke layers in the atmosphere. The LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) system uses visible wavelength for probing smoke layers. The system was operated during dry season to remote sense smoke layers produced by wildfires that occurred in the nearby reserve forest. During the observations, the LIDAR system was found suitable for tracking smoke plume boundaries, its top height, dispersion and change of its intensity with time. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Air quality; Aircraft accidents; Fighter aircraft; Fires; Fluid dynamics; Radar systems; Remote sensing; Smoke; Space optics; Aircraft measurement; Amount of information; Chemical compositions; LIDAR (light detection and ranging); Political boundaries; Regional climate; Toxic pollutants; Visible wavelengths; Optical radar","LIDAR; Remote sensing; Smoke","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049788800"

Seven flights and synchronous ground-based observations were acquired. These data were used to test the sensor's measurements and associated aerosol retrieval algorithm. According to the AMPR measurements, a successive surface-atmosphere decoupling based algorithm was developed to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD). It works via an iteration method, and the lookup table was employed in the aerosol inversion. Throughout the results of the AMPR retrievals, the surface polarized reflectances derived from air- and ground-based instruments were well matched; the measured and simulated reflectances at the aircraft level, which were simulated based on in situ sun photometer observed aerosol properties, were in good agreement; and the AOD measurements were validated against the automatic sun-photometer (CE318) at the nearest time and location. The AOD results were close; the average deviation was less than 0.03. The MODIS AODs were also employed to test the AMPR retrievals, and they showed the same trend.

The satellite will carry two Kuband radars: The wave scatterometer (SWIM) and the wind scatterometer (SCAT). Such a unique configuration provides multi-look and multi-angle observations to reconstruct key parameters of local sea surface conditions: The directional wave spectrum and the determination of the sea surface wind speed and direction. From unique collocated wave and wind measurements, each single instrument observation by its own can benefit from the other one. As often discussed, radar returns, at the same location but for different angles of observations, will possibly exhibit different sensitivity with regard to various sea surface parameters, i.e. near-surface wind speed and direction, significant wave height, sea state degree of development and/or local swell wave spectrum characteristics. This often results in radar signal dispersion which limits the precision of the retrieval algorithms from radar remote sensing measurements. Accordingly, the potential to benefit from additional information from a co-located second instrument could be strongly useful in the correction of such factors. The present work considers the possibility of using the near-nadir SWIM measurements to improve the wind estimates from the scatterometer inversion algorithm. Preliminary estimates and simulations confirm that some types of errors, e.g. due to SCAT antenna geometry and configuration, can largely be reduced. As well, additional improvement can be expected for the measurements under low-wind and rapidly changing sea conditions. © 2018 IEEE.","Antennas; Geology; Meteorological instruments; Ocean currents; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Wind effects; CFOSAT; Directional wave spectrum; Multi-angle observations; Ocean remote sensing; Oceanography satellites; Sea-surface conditions; Significant wave height; Surface ocean; Radar measurement","CFOSAT; Ocean remote sensing; Surface ocean wind scatterometer","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064224461"

Clumping index (CI) quantifies the level of foliage grouping relative to a random distribution in space. As an additional vegetation structural parameter of comparable importance to leaf area index (LAI), CI strongly influences canopy radiation regimes, photosynthesis and land-atmosphere interactions. It is a correction factor to convert the effective LAI which assumes a random distribution of leaves in space to the true LAI, and is also needed to separate the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaves for accurate simulations of process-based ecological and land surface models. However, due to the lack of clumping index available, clumping index values are often assumed to vary only with land cover types in most operational LAI retrieval algorithms and ecological models, which might induce large uncertainties in these model outputs. Therefore, it is highly desirable to map the spatial and temporal variations of the clumping for different land cover types. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) provides the anisotropic nature of surface scattering including both the spectral and angular signatures, which can be used to retrieve structural information of vegetated surfaces. In this paper, based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF parameters product, a modified RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal model was used to simulate the reflectance at hotspot (the solar zenith angle was set as 45°, and the relative azimuth angle between the sun and sensor was 0°) and darkspot (the solar zenith angle was set as 45°, while the relative azimuth angle was 180°) in the near infrared band, which was then used to calculate the angular index named normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD). With the relationship between CI and NDHD simulated by the 4-Scale geometrical model, the clumping index over China at 500 m resolution was retrieved every 8 days during the period from 2000 to 2013. The effect of topography on the retrieved CI was corrected using a topographic compensation function calculated from the digital elevation model at 90 m resolution. A locally adjusted cubic-spline capping method was used to remove the noises in the seasonal trajectory of CI. Then, the spatial and temporal variations of clumping index in China and its relationships with temperature and precipitation were analyzed. Results show that there is obvious difference in the dimensional distribution of CI which closely relates to the land cover types. Among all cover types, the needle-leaved deciduous forests and the needle-leaved evergreen forests have the smallest mean CI (CI are equal to 0.63 and 0.65, respectively) during the growing seasons (from April to September) from 2000 to 2013 in China, indicating the most clumped canopy structure of coniferous forests. The broad-leaved evergreen forests have the second smallest mean CI (CI=0.68), followed by the broad-leaved deciduous forests (CI=0.75), and the shrub evergreen forests (CI=0.76). On average, grasslands and croplands have the highest CI (least clumped). All cover types have smaller CI values in mid-summer than in other seasons due to the fact that the canopy becomes denser after the spring growth, but the CI seasonal trajectories driven by site/species phenology are quite distinct for different land cover types. MODIS CI can reflect the influence of extreme weather and climate events on the vegetation structure, but the correlation between CI and annual average temperature or annual average precipitation is not significant.

By taking advantage of the polarization characteristics of the surface reflecting light of soil with different moisture, the polarization spectral method is applied to measure soil moisture. The spectropolarimeter was used to measure the polarized reflectance spectrum of different soil moisture. The correlation between soil moisture and polarization spectrum was analyzed. The polarization characteristics of soil surface reflecting light in different viewing angles were surveyed by experiments. The experimental results show that: in the higher soil moisture conditions, the polarization spectrum and soil moisture have a certain connection, especially in the 500~700 nm band and soil moisture is directly proportional to the degree of polarization; but in low soil moisture conditions, the correlation of polarization spectrum and soil moisture is not obvious; in addition, the polarization spectrum are influenced by viewing angles, for example, when the incident angle of source light is fixed at 50°, while the viewing angle of instrument is between 20° and 60°, the degree of polarization increases with the viewing angle. When the viewing angle becomes wider,, the degree of polarization changed more significantly with the soil moisture. © 2016, Peking University Press.

The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given value of leaf area index (LAI). Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observing (EO) systems such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the compatibility between CI and LAI products derived from EO data is examined independently using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability theory (i.e. ‘ptheory’), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types (PFTs). The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. Our results indicate that the integration of empirically-based CI maps with the MODIS LAI product is feasible, providing a potential means to improve the accuracy of LAI EO data products. Given the strong results for the large range of PFTs explored here, we demonstrate the capacity to obtain p-values for any location solely from EO data.

One common application of this technique is used by sun photometers such as in NASA's AErosol Robotic Network (AERONET). This large, spatially distributed network collects time averaging data from across the globe and applying Beer's Law, produces hourly estimates of AOD. While this technique has produced excellent data, the dependence on direct sun irradiance requires cloudless skies and line-ofsight to the sun. Atmospheric LIDARs, on the other hand, can operate in the presence of clouds and can also produce range-resolved measurements of AOD by applying the same Langley technique. For aerosol LIDARs, this technique requires that the LIDAR be capable of producing high quality waveforms within the atmospheric coherence time and also be capable of taking measurements off zenith. At least two unique angles are required to produce data, although 3+ are recommended. This paper will present an overview of the Langley technique applied with a 1064 nm atmospheric aerosol LIDAR, an overview of the LIDAR hardware and capabilities, sample data collected by the LIDAR, and challenges associated with this technique. It will be shown that while this technique is useful, it requires measurements at all three angles to be made when the atmosphere is reasonably horizontally homogenous. Furthermore, the system optics, alignment, and laser power must be kept constant (keeping the LIDAR's system constant the same for all measurements) for the data to be useful in a Langley analysis. © 2018 SPIE.","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Extrapolation; Laser applications; Light extinction; Light polarization; NASA; Optical properties; Remote sensing; Transmissions; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Atmospheric lidars; Atmospheric optical depth; Distributed networks; Langley extrapolation; Multi angle; Waveform processing; Optical radar","Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD); Atmospheric LIDAR; Extinction; Multi-angle Calibration; Remote sensing; Transmission; Waveform Processing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050203785"

For more accurate predictions of future climate the uncertainties of the net radiative forcing of aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere must be reduced [2]. Essential parameters that are needed as input in climate models are not only the aerosol optical thickness (AOT), but also particle specific properties such as the aerosol mean size, the single scattering albedo (SSA) and the complex refractive index. The latter can be used to discriminate between absorbing and non-absorbing aerosol types, and between natural and anthropogenic aerosol. Classification of aerosol types is also very important for air-quality and health-related issues [3]. Remote sensing from an orbiting satellite platform is the only way to globally characterize atmospheric aerosol at a relevant timescale of ∼ 1 day [4]. One of the few methods that can be employed for measuring the microphysical properties of aerosols is to observe both radiance and degree of linear polarization of sunlight scattered in the Earth atmosphere under different viewing directions [5][6][7]. The requirement on the absolute accuracy of the degree of linear polarization PL is very stringent: The absolute error in PL must be smaller then 0.001+0.005⋅PL in order to retrieve aerosol parameters with sufficient accuracy to advance climate modelling and to enable discrimination of aerosol types based on their refractive index for air-quality studies [6][7]. In this paper we present the SPEX instrument, which is a multi-angle spectropolarimeter that can comply with the polarimetric accuracy needed for characterizing aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere. We describe the implementation of spectral polarization modulation in a prototype instrument of SPEX and show results of ground based measurements from which aerosol microphysical properties are retrieved. © 2018 SPIE.","Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Orbits; Polarization; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Aerosol characterization; Aerosol optical thickness; Anthropogenic aerosols; Complex refractive index; Degree of linear polarization; Ground based measurement; Microphysical property; Single scattering albedo; Atmospheric aerosols","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050462095"

The targeted accuracy of FAPAR products is 10%, or 0.05, for many applications. However, most of the FAPAR products in current usage have not yet fulfilled the accuracy requirement, thus requiring further improvements. In this study, a new FAPAR estimation model is developed on the basis of the radiative transfer (RT) for a horizontally homogeneous continuous canopy. The spatially explicit parameterization of leaf-scattering and soil background reflectance is derived from a 13-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo database. The new algorithm requires the input of leaf area index (LAI), which is estimated by a hybrid geometric optical-RT model suitable for both continuous and discrete vegetation canopies in this study. The model calculated radiative surface fluxes, i.e., canopy reflectance, absorption, and transmittance, are compared with the reference data from Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) exercise. The evaluation results show that the model estimated FAPAR has an uncertainty of 0.08 over homogeneous and heterogeneous canopies. The FAPAR estimates from the new model are intercompared with reference satellite FAPAR products and validated with ground-based measurements at the Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERI) AmeriFlux experimental sites. The validation results show that the FAPAR estimates from the new model are comparable to or slightly better in performance than the MODIS and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) FAPAR products when using corresponding satellite LAI product values as the input. The FAPAR estimates are further improved when using the new LAI estimates from the hybrid model as the input. The new model adequately identifies the growing seasons and produces smooth time series curves of estimated FAPAR during a specific duration. The uncertainty is reduced to 0.1 when validating with total FAPAR measurements, and 0.08 when validating with green FAPAR measurements. The improvements are apparent in grasslands and forests with an uncertainty reduction of 0.06. The regional-scale application of the presented model generates consistent FAPAR maps at spatial resolutions of 30 m, 500 m, and 1 km from the Landsat, MODIS, and MISR data, respectively. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Solar radiation; Spectrometers; FAPAR; LANDSAT; MISR; MODIS; Validation; accuracy assessment; albedo; algorithm; climatology; Landsat; leaf area index; MISR; model validation; MODIS; parameterization; photosynthetically active radiation; radiative transfer; satellite data; Uncertainty analysis","FAPAR; Landsat; MISR; Model retrieval; MODIS; Validation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982746811"

In the WATER experiment of Heihe in 2008, we developed an algorithm for estimating the albedo of Wide-angle Infrared Dual-mode line/area Array Scanner (WIDAS) based on the MODIS Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) archetype-based algorithm for the narrow-angle observations of the airborne WIDAS. However, in the HiWATER experiment in 2012, the WIDAS observation angle range was upgraded from the early 30° to the maximum observation zenith angle of 52°, which impacted the data preprocessing (radiation scaling, atmospheric correction, and multi-angle registration). This condition caused significant noise and created new challenges for the surface albedo inversion of WIDAS. In the current study, we addressed new problems and adopted new surface observation data to verify the ability of the BRDF archetype-based algorithm to retrieve the albedo of WIDAS. To obtain quasi-real-time BRDF prior knowledge, we first extracted five BRDF archetypes as a priori information from 500 m MODIS BRDF parameter product (MCD43A1) within the Heihe experimental region. Then, we applied these BRDF archetypes to airborne WIDAS multi-angular observations for albedo estimates based on the hotspot-corrected linear kernel-driven BRDF model, that is, RossThickChen-LiSparseReciprocal model. Finally, field albedo measurements were conducted to validate the broadband albedo estimates. We compared three commonly used albedo estimate methods, namely, the BRDF archetype-based algorithm that was developed in our previous paper; full-inversion BRDF/albedo algorithm that has been adopted as the operational MODIS BRDF/albedo algorithm; and Lambertian assumption method that is commonly used to estimate surface albedo, especially when only nadir observations are available. The performance of the BRDF archetype-based algorithm was verified by comparison and analysis of the algorithms. Unsurprisingly, the accuracy of the albedo retrievals by using the BRDF archetype-based algorithm was obtained at 0.034, which was 18% and 71% higher than those of the full inversion algorithm and the Lambertian assumption method, respectively. The inversion and verification of the WIDAS demonstrated that the BRDF archetype-based method was noise resistant and obtained stable albedo estimates.

As these variables are derived from measured radiances, the underlying radiance data are the most reliable sources of information for change detection. Here, we identify statistically significant trends in the color and spatial texture of the Earth as viewed from multiple directions from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), which has been sampling the angular distribution of scattered sunlight since 2000. Globally, our results show that the Earth has been appearing relatively bluer (up to 1.6% per decade from both nadir and oblique views) and smoother (up to 1.5% per decade only from oblique views) over the past 15 years. The magnitude of the global blueing trends is comparable to that of uncertainties in radiometric calibration stability. Regional shifts in color and texture, which are significantly larger than global means, are observed, particularly over polar regions, along the boundaries of the subtropical highs, the tropical western Pacific, Southwestern Asia, and Australia. We demonstrate that the large regional trends cannot be explained either by uncertainties in radiometric calibration or variability in total or spectral solar irradiance; hence, they reflect changes internal to the Earth's climate system. The 15-year-mean true color composites and texture images of the Earth at both nadir and oblique views are also presented for the first time. © 2016 IEEE.","Asia; Australia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); Angular distribution; Calibration; Color; Radiometry; Color and textures; Earth observing satellite; Global observation; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Radiometric calibrations; Solar irradiances; Sources of informations; Tropical Western Pacific; climate change; color; detection method; EOS; light scattering; MISR; nadir; radiance; regional geography; remote sensing; satellite data; solar radiation; texture; trend analysis; uncertainty analysis; Earth (planet)","Climate change; regional trends; satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979725230"

It couples boundary layer aerosol composition, size and concentration with cloud reflectivity. It affects cloud evolution, precipitation, radiative forcing, global climate and, through observation, can be used to partially monitor the first indirect effect. With its unique combination of multi-wavelength, multi-angle, total and polarized reflectance measurements, the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP)retrieves Nd with relatively few assumptions. The approach involves measuring cloud optical thickness, mean droplet extinction cross-section and cloud physical thickness. Polarimetric observations are capable of measuring the effective variance, or width, of the droplet size distribution. Estimating cloud geometrical thickness is also an important component of the polarimetric Nd retrieval, which is accomplished using polarimetric measurements in a water vapor absorption band to retrieve the amount of in-cloud water vapor and relating this to physical thickness. We highlight the unique abilities and quantify uncertainties of the polarimetric approach. We validate the approach using observational data from the North Atlantic and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). NAAMES targets specific phases in the seasonal phytoplankton lifecycle and ocean-atmosphere linkages. This study provides an excellent opportunity for the RSP to evaluate its approach of sensing Nd over a range of concentrations and cloud types with in situ measurements from a Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The RSP and CDP, along with an array of other instruments, are flown on the NASA C-130 aircraft, which flies in situ and remote sensing legs in sequence. Cloud base heights retrieved by the RSP compare well with those derived in situ (R = 0.83)and by a ceilometer aboard the R.V. Atlantis (R = 0.79). Comparing geometric mean values from 12 science flights throughout the NAAMES-1 and NAAMES-2 campaigns, we find a strong correlation between Nd retrieved by the RSP and CDP (R = 0.96). A linear least squares fit has a slope of 0.92 and an intercept of 0.3 cm−3. Uncertainty in this comparison can be attributed to cloud 3D effects, nonlinear liquid water profiles, multilayered clouds, measurement uncertainty, variation in spatial and temporal sampling, and assumptions used within the method. Radiometric uncertainties of the RSP measurements lead to biases on derived optical thickness and cloud physical thickness, but these biases largely cancel out when deriving Nd for most conditions and geometries. We find that a polarimetric approach to sensing Nd is viable and the RSP is capable of accurately retrieving Nd for a variety of cloud types and meteorological conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Aerosols; Aircraft instruments; Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layers; Clouds; Drops; Ecosystems; Geometry; Life cycle; Meteorological instruments; NASA; Optical properties; Polarimeters; Polarization; Reflection; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Water absorption; Water vapor; Aerosol-cloud interaction; Cloud droplet number concentrations; Droplet concentration; Droplet size distributions; In-situ measurement; Radiometric uncertainties; Research scanning polarimeters; Water vapor absorption bands; aerosol; airborne survey; boundary layer; cloud; cloud droplet; concentration (composition); environmental monitoring; global climate; in situ measurement; liquid; parameter estimation; polarization; radiometric survey; reflectivity; remote sensing; spectral reflectance; uncertainty analysis; Precipitation (meteorology)","Clouds; Droplet concentration; In situ measurements; Polarization; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058147019"

In this study, scattering matrices for two loess samples collected from different regions of CLP were measured at a wavelength of 532 nm from 5° to 160° scattering angles. Other necessary characteristics were also analyzed, like particle size distribution, chemical composition, refractive index and micro morphology. Synthetic scattering matrices for different loess samples were defined over full angular range of scattering by combining Lorenz–Mie calculations as well as extrapolations or interpolations of measurement results. From the perspective of constructing an average scattering matrix suitable for loess, similarities and discrepancies between synthetic scattering matrices for loess samples collected from CLP and Hungary were analyzed. Although different light wavelengths were employed in experimental measurements of CLP samples and Hungary loess, matrix elements for these three samples show comparable angular distributions and are confined to relatively limited domains, respectively. Then, an average synthetic scattering matrix targeted for loess dust was proposed for spectral range from 441.6 to 632.8 nm, which is valuable for multispectral and multi-angle satellite remote sensing as well as radiative transfer calculations. When compared with average scattering matrix of different kinds of mineral dust proposed previously, it can be seen clearly that the domains covered by loess samples and various kinds of mineral dust are highly coincident, while the areas covered by loess samples are more narrow. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Hungary; Loess Plateau; Chemical analysis; Dust; Light scattering; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Polarization; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Atmospheric dust; Chemical compositions; Chinese Loess Plateau; Laboratory measurements; Micromorphologies; Radiative transfer calculations; Satellite remote sensing; Scattering matrices; dust; light scattering; loess; particulate matter; polarization; resuspension; wavelength; Sediments","Atmospheric dust; Light scattering; Loess dust; Polarization; Scattering matrix","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063126939"

Due to the low reflectivity characteristic of water, data noise from the environment factors will cover the true information carried by radiation from the water. A simulated condition eliminating the influence of environment factors could help researchers to solve the problem. In this article, a method of water spectrum data measurement under simulated condition in laboratory is designed. Through simulating light condition, shielding scattering and airflow, the environment factors are delimitated as much as possible. The observation geometry of the spectrometer lens could be automatic controlled in remote by mechanical designing, electronic automation technology and video monitoring.

In order to assess the relative impacts of these events, accurate plume injection altitude measurements are needed. In this work, volcanic plumes generated from seven Kamchatka Peninsula volcanoes (Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Bezymianny, Tolbachik, Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky), were identified using over 16 years of Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) measurements. Eighty-eight volcanic plumes were observed by MISR, capturing 3–25% of reported events at individual volcanoes. Retrievals were most successful where eruptive events persisted over a period of weeks to months. Compared with existing ground and airborne observations, and alternative satellite-based reports compiled by the Global Volcanism Program (GVP), MISR plume height retrievals show general consistency; the comparison reports appear to be skewed towards the region of highest concentration observed in MISR-constrained plume vertical extent. The report observations display less discrepancy with MISR toward the end of the analysis period (2013–2016), with improvements in the suborbital data likely the result of the deployment of new instrumentation. Conversely, the general consistency of MISR plume heights with conventionally reported observations supports the use of MISR in the ongoing assessment of volcanic activity globally, especially where ground-based observations are unavailable. Differences between the northern (Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Bezymianny and Tolbachik) and southern (Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky) volcanoes broadly corresponding to the Central Kamchatka Depression (CKD) and Eastern Volcanic Front (EVF) geological sub-regions of Kamchatka, respectively, are distinguished by varying magma composition. For example, by comparison with reanalysis-model simulations of local meteorological conditions, CKD plumes were generally less constrained by mid-tropospheric (< 6 km) layers of vertical stability above the boundary layer, suggesting that these eruptions were more energetic than those in the EVF region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Kamchatka; Kamchatka Peninsula; Russian Federation; Atmospheric aerosols; Boundary layers; Remote sensing; Airborne observations; Ground-based observations; Kamchatka; Meteorological condition; MISR; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Plume heights; Volcanic activities; altitude; atmospheric plume; dispersion; height determination; MISR; remote sensing; satellite data; volcanic eruption; Volcanoes","Kamchatka; MISR; Plume height; Remote sensing; Volcano","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014873114"

These data sets also support improved information extraction capabilities at a fine scale. In order to improve the spatial resolution of coarser resolution RS data, the Super Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) technique has become widely acknowledged which focused on multi-angular image sequences. In this study multi-angle CHRIS/PROBA data of Kutch area is used for SR image reconstruction to enhance the spatial resolution from 18 m to 6m in the hope to obtain a better land cover classification. Various SR approaches like Projection onto Convex Sets (POCS), Robust, Iterative Back Projection (IBP), Non-Uniform Interpolation and Structure-Adaptive Normalized Convolution (SANC) chosen for this study. Subjective assessment through visual interpretation shows substantial improvement in land cover details. Quantitative measures including peak signal to noise ratio and structural similarity are used for the evaluation of the image quality. It was observed that SANC SR technique using Vandewalle algorithm for the low resolution image registration outperformed the other techniques. After that SVM based classifier is used for the classification of SRR and data resampled to 6m spatial resolution using bi-cubic interpolation. A comparative analysis is carried out between classified data of bicubic interpolated and SR derived images of CHRIS/PROBA and SR derived classified data have shown a significant improvement of 10-12% in the overall accuracy.

The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) provides hyper-stereo imagery, from which the altitude and microphysical properties of suspended atmospheric aerosols can be derived. These capabilities are applied to plumes emitted at Karymsky volcano from 2000 to 2017. Observed plumes from Karymsky were emitted predominantly to an altitude of 2-4 km, with occasional events exceeding 6 km. MISR plume observations were most common when volcanic surface manifestations, such as lava flows, were identified by satellite-based thermal anomaly detection. The analyzed plumes predominantly contained large (1.28 m effective radius), strongly absorbing particles indicative of ashrich eruptions. Differences between the retrievals for Karymsky volcano's ash-rich plumes and the sulfur-rich plumes emitted during the 2014-2015 eruption of Holuhraun (Iceland) highlight the ability of MISR to distinguish particle types from such events. Observed plumes ranged from 30 to 220 km in length and were imaged at a spatial resolution of 1.1 km. Retrieved particle properties display evidence of downwind particle fallout, particle aggregation and chemical evolution. In addition, changes in plume properties retrieved from the remote-sensing observations over time are interpreted in terms of shifts in eruption dynamics within the volcano itself, corroborated to the extent possible with suborbital data. Plumes emitted at Karymsky prior to 2010 display mixed emissions of ash and sulfate particles. After 2010, all plumes contain consistent particle components, indicative of entering an ash-dominated regime. Post-2010 event timing, relative to eruption phase, was found to influence the optical properties of observed plume particles, with light absorption varying in a consistent sequence as each respective eruption phase progressed. © 2018 Author(s).","Kamchatka; Karymsky Volcano; Russian Federation; altitude; atmospheric plume; imagery; MISR; optical property; remote sensing; volcanic eruption; volcanology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044189211"

The coarse registration method is first used to achieve a good initial position, based on which registration is then refined utilizing the fine registration method. According to the coarse-to-fine framework, this paper reviews current registration methods and their methodologies, and identifies important differences between them. The lack of standard data and unified evaluation systems is identified as a factor limiting objective comparison of different methods. The paper also describes the most commonly-used point cloud registration error analysis methods. Finally, avenues for future work on LiDAR data registration in terms of applications, data, and technology are discussed.

In this paper we will demonstrate the use of adjoint methods for retrieving two-dimensional (2D) fields of cloud extinction. The demonstration uses a new 2D radiative transfer solver (FSDOM). This radiation code was augmented with adjoint methods to allow efficient derivative calculations needed to retrieve cloud and surface properties from multi-angle reflectance measurements. The code was then used in three synthetic retrieval studies. Our retrieval algorithm adjusts the cloud extinction field and surface albedo to minimize the measurement misfit function with a gradient-based, quasi-Newton approach. At each step we compute the value of the misfit function and its gradient with two calls to the solver FSDOM. First we solve the forward radiative transfer equation to compute the residual misfit with measurements, and second we solve the adjoint radiative transfer equation to compute the gradient of the misfit function with respect to all unknowns. The synthetic retrieval studies verify that adjoint methods are scalable to retrieval problems with many measurements and unknowns. We can retrieve the vertically-integrated optical depth of moderately thick clouds as a function of the horizontal coordinate. It is also possible to retrieve the vertical profile of clouds that are separated by clear regions. The vertical profile retrievals improve for smaller cloud fractions. This leads to the conclusion that cloud edges actually increase the amount of information that is available for retrieving the vertical profile of clouds. However, to exploit this information one must retrieve the horizontally heterogeneous cloud properties with a 2D (or 3D) model. This prototype shows that adjoint methods can efficiently compute the gradient of the misfit function. This work paves the way for the application of similar methods to 3D remote sensing problems. © 2017","Linearization; Radiative transfer; Adjoint methods; Computationally efficient; Horizontal coordinates; Parameter derivatives; Radiative transfer equations; Three-dimensional vectors; Threedimensional (3-d); Vertical profile retrieval; algorithm; equation; radiative transfer; remote sensing; vertical profile; Remote sensing","Adjoint methods; Linearization; Parameter derivatives; Remote sensing; Searchlight functions; Three-dimensional vector radiative transfer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032479964"

The ground-based true values of surface roughness parameters are important for the validation and accuracy evaluation of inversion results, and also vital in microwave soil moisture inversion algorithm for calibrating the constants in the model. For a long time, there is a lack of a simple, fast, high-precision method to obtain surface roughness parameters. Firstly, 2 commonly used parameters that characterize surface roughness i.e. root mean square height and correlation length, are described in this paper. Then, the concrete process of surface roughness measurement by close-range photogrammetry is introduced. We also analyze the factors which influence the measurement accuracy of close-range photogrammetry. In addition, close-range photogrammetry results are compared with the traditional pin-profiler method, and the measurement results of the root mean square height and correlation length of the 2 methods are analyzed. It is shown that the mean square root height error measured by the traditional pin-profiler method can reach is 12%-35.1%, and the correlation length error is 19.6%-62.4%. The advantages and disadvantages of the 2 methods are analyzed from the aspects of applicability and accuracy. The accuracy required for microwave inversion of surface roughness parameters is also analyzed. Result shows the way by close-range photogrammetry can improve the accuracy of surface roughness measurement effectively, and meet the requirements of inversion research of soil surface roughness. The influence of sampling interval on roughness measurement accuracy is also analyzed by changing the sampling interval of close-range photogrammetry. This article uses Agisoft Photoscan software to reconstruct point cloud. Specifically, a non-measuring camera is used to obtain multi-angle overlapping image of the study area. Secondly, SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) approach is used to detect correspondences across the photos. Then bundle-adjustment algorithm is used to solve camera intrinsic and extrinsic orientation parameters and a multi-view approach is utilized to reconstruct dense cloud. Finally, the effect of non-contact measurement can be achieved by measuring the generated dense point cloud. This article also presents the requirements of hardware and image acquisition operations that need paid attention during the measurement of surface roughness using close-range photogrammetry. In this paper, the method of measuring surface roughness by close-range photogrammetry has the following advantages: The accuracy of surface roughness measurement is greatly improved, and the problem of certain surface which is extremely rough and can't be measured is also solved. And the sampling interval of close-range photogrammetry is quantitatively analyzed. Close-range photogrammetric measurement can easily adjust the sampling angle and describe the anisotropy of surface roughness accurately. The number of sampling can be easily increased so as to solve the measurement error caused by the heterogeneity of the surface. At the same time, it is concluded that the measurement result is stable and can be regarded as the true value when the number of measurements is greater than 12. With the advantages of non-contact measurement, high precision, adjustable sampling interval and frequency, the close-range photogrammetric method provides an effective solution for soil surface roughness measurement. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

We introduce the FlySPEX spectropolarimetric fiber-head that constitutes the essential building block of a novel multi-angle sensing system. A combination of miniaturized standard polarization optics inside every fiber-head encodes the full linear polarization information as a spectral modulation of the light that enters two regular optical fibers. By orienting many FlySPEX fiber-heads in any desired set of directions, a fiber bundle contains the complete instantaneous information on polarization as a function of wavelength and as a function of the set of viewing directions. This information is to be recorded by one or several multi-fiber spectrometers. Not only is this system flexible in the amount of viewing directions and their configuration, it also permits multiplexing different wavelength ranges and spectral resolutions by implementing different spectrometers. We present the design and prototyping for a FlySPEX fiber-head that is optimized for both polarimetric accuracy and commercial series production.

Consequently, the CI is very useful for ecological and meteorological models. One method used to retrieve the CIs of plant canopies is to construct a linear relationship between the CI and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index. This method requires a particularly accurate reconstruction of hotspot signatures, which are difficult to measure. In this study, we propose a framework to retrieve CIs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, which are generally based on linear CI-NDHD equations. The main algorithm is designed to retrieve CIs in the closed interval [0.33, 1.00]. This range is derived from the CI-NDHD equations and is thus called as the physical range here, although a modified lower boundary can be implemented in the future if necessary. If CIs are outside of this range, then a backup algorithm is designed to reprocess these so-called outlier CIs. The hotspot-adjusted version of the RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) model (i.e., the RTCLSR model) is employed to reconstruct the hotspot signatures for the MODIS BRDF parameters. This method simplifies the hotspot reconstruction by using two hotspot parameters that are not distinctly scale-dependent particularly in the context of an inhomogeneous coarse spatial resolution. To evaluate this algorithm framework, we collect dozens of global field-measured CIs and calculate their determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias relative to MODIS CIs derived using both the main algorithm and the backup algorithm. Our results show that this framework can derive MODIS CIs with a high accuracy (i.e., R2 = 0.80 (0.72), RMSE = 0.07 (0.12), bias = −0.03 (−0.10)) using the main (backup) algorithms and that it shows promise for various ecological applications, especially in combination with the leaf area index (LAI). © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Distribution functions; Ecology; Mean square error; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; BRDF; BRDF archetype; Clumping index; Hot spot; MODIS; Multi-angle remote sensing; NDHD; algorithm; genetic algorithm; index method; leaf area index; MODIS; NDVI; numerical model; parameter estimation; plant; remote sensing; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; Radiometers","AFX; BRDF; BRDF archetype; Clumping index; Hotspot; Linear RTLSR model; MODIS; Multi-angle remote sensing; NDHD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043360991"

One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22.

Monitoring and mapping of forest distribution are of great significance. With the successive launch of new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, microwave remote sensing data acquisition methods have been developed from single-band, single-polarization and single-angle to multi-frequency, multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-temporal and so on. That provides an unprecedented potential and opportunity for SAR in the research and application of forest identification. In this paper, the data source mainly included the quad-polarization C-band GaoFen-3(GF-3) and dual-polarization L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR. First, the single-look complex (SLC) data was preprocessed with multi-look, filtering, radiation calibration, geocoding, registration and clipping. Three polarization characteristic parameters of entropy (H), scattering angle (α) and anisotropy (A) were obtained by using Cloude-Pottier polarization decomposition, and three texture features of the mean (MEAN), variance (VAR) and dissimilarity (DIS) were extracted based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM). Combined with the advantages of GF-3 high-resolution quad-polarization and PALSAR L-band, multi-dimensional information including frequency, polarization, temporal and texture features was used synthetically. Then support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier was used to obtain the four classification results, including coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and others. The experimental result shows that proposed method achieved a better classification result based on multi-dimensional POLSAR, the overall accuracy of forest type identification is approximately 89.47% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.85. © 2018 SPIE.","Air conditioning; Data acquisition; Ecosystems; Microwave sensors; Polarization; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest type; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Microwave remote sensing; Multi dimensional; Polarization characteristics; Research and application; Single-look complex datum; Texture features; Forestry","Forest type identification; Multi-dimensional POLSAR; Polarization decomposition; SVM; Texture feature","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057302112"

As the TWP warms, the SST mode (~29.5 °C) is constant, but the area of the mode grows, indicating increased kurtosis of SSTs and decreased SST gradients overall. This is associated with weaker low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric ascent (!500) over the highest SSTs as the TWP warms, but also a broader area of weak ascent away from the deepest convection, albeit stronger when compared to when the mean TWP is cooler. These associated dynamics changes are collocated with less anvil and thick cloud cover over the highest SSTs and similar thin cold cloud fraction when the TWP is warmer, but broadly more anvil and cirrus clouds over lower local SSTs (SST < 27 °C). For all TWP SST quintiles, anvil cloud fraction, defined as clouds with tops > 9 km and TOA albedos between 0.3-0.6, is closely associated with rain rate, making it an excellent proxy for precipitation; but for a given heavier rain rate, cirrus clouds are more abundant with increasing domain-mean TWP SST. Clouds locally over SSTs between 29-30 °C have a much less negative net cloud forcing, up to 25 W m-2 greater, when the TWP is warm versus cool. When the local rain rate increases, while the net cloud fraction with tops < 9 km decreases, mid-level clouds (4 km < Ztop < 9 km) modestly increase. In contrast, combined low-level and mid-level clouds decrease as the domain-wide SST increases (-10% deg-1). More cirrus clouds for heavily precipitating systems exert a stronger positive TOA effect when the TWP is warmer, and anvil clouds over a higher TWP SST are less reflective and have a weaker cooling effect. For all precipitating systems, total high cloud cover increases modestly with higher TWP SST quintiles, and anvil + cirrus clouds are more expansive, suggesting more detrainment when TWP SSTs are higher. Total-domain anvil cloud fraction scales mostly with domain-mean w500, but cirrus clouds mostly increase with domain-mean SST, invoking an explanation other than circulation. The overall thinning and greater top-heaviness of clouds over the TWP with warming are possible TWP positive feedbacks not previously identified. © 2019 by the authors.","Atmospheric radiation; Cooling systems; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Cloud feedbacks; Cloud fraction; Cloud radiative forcing; Hadley circulation; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Precipitating clouds; Top of atmospheres; Tropical convection; Clouds","Cloud feedbacks; Cloud fraction; Cloud radiative forcing; Precipitation; Remote sensing; Tropical convection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066761544"

Several instruments collected data from November 2015 to February 2016 or longer, including a polarimetric radar (MXPol), a Micro Rain Radar (MRR), a weighing gauge (Pluvio2), and a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). These instruments collected the first ground-based measurements of precipitation in the region of Adélie Land (Terre Adélie), including precipitation microphysics. Microphysical observations during the austral summer 2015/2016 showed that, close to the ground level, aggregates are the dominant hydrometeor type, together with small ice particles (mostly originating from blowing snow), and that riming is a recurring process. Eleven percent of the measured particles were fully developed graupel, and aggregates had a mean riming degree of about 30 %. Spurious precipitation in the Pluvio2 measurements in windy conditions, leading to phantom accumulations, is observed and partly removed through synergistic use of MRR data. The yearly accumulated precipitation of snow (300 m above ground), obtained by means of a local conversion relation of MRR data, trained on the Pluvio2 measurement of the summer period, is estimated to be 815 mm of water equivalent, with a confidence interval ranging between 739.5 and 989 mm. Data obtained in previous research from satellite-borne radars, and the ERA-Interim reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provide lower yearly totals: 655 mm for ERA-Interim and 679 mm for the climatological data over DDU. ERA-Interim overestimates the occurrence of low-intensity precipitation events especially in summer, but it compensates for them by underestimating the snowfall amounts carried by the most intense events. Overall, this paper provides insightful examples of the added values of precipitation monitoring in Antarctica with a synergistic use of in situ and remote sensing measurements. © Author(s) 2017.","Adelie Coast; Antarctica; Dumont d'Urville; East Antarctica; aggregate; confidence interval; data inversion; gauge; ground-based measurement; instrumentation; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation intensity; radar; satellite data; snow; spatiotemporal analysis; videography; weather forecasting","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027260114"

The Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) instrument can detect polarized signal from multi-angle observation and the polarized signal mainly comes from the radiation contribution of the fine-mode aerosols, which provides an opportunity to obtain AODf directly. However, the currently operational algorithm of Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosphérique (LOA) has a poor AODf retrieval accuracy over East China on high aerosol loading days. This study focused on solving this issue and proposed a grouped residual error sorting (GRES) method to determine the optimal aerosol model in AODf retrieval using the traditional look-up table (LUT) approach and then the AODf retrieval accuracy over East China was improved. The comparisons between the GRES retrieved and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based AODf at Beijing, Xianghe, Taihu and Hong_Kong_PolyU sites produced high correlation coefficients (r) of 0.900, 0.933, 0.957 and 0.968, respectively. The comparisons of the GRES retrieved AODf and PARASOL AODf product with those of the AERONET observations produced a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.054 versus 0.104 on high aerosol loading days (AERONET mean AODf at 865 nm = 0.283). An application using the GRES method for total AOD (AODt) retrieval also showed a good expandability for multi-angle aerosol retrieval of this method. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Errors; Optical properties; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Sorting; Table lookup; Aerosol modeling; Aerosol optical depths; Multi-angular remote sensing; PARASOL; Polarized remote sensing; Aerosols","Fine-mode aerosol optical depth; Multi-angular remote sensing; Optimal aerosol model determination; PARASOL; Polarized remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057115772"

PODEX supported the pre-formulation NASA Aerosol–Cloud–Ecosystem (ACE) mission, which calls for an imaging polarimeter in polar orbit (among other instruments) for the remote sensing of aerosols, oceans, and clouds. Several polarimeter concepts exist as airborne prototypes, some of which were deployed during PODEX as a capabilities test. Two of those instruments to date have successfully produced Level 1 (georegistered, calibrated radiance and polarization) data from that campaign: the Airborne Multiangle Spectropolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) and the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). We compared georegistered observations of a variety of scene types by these instruments to test whether Level 1 products agreed within stated uncertainties. Initial comparisons found radiometric agreement, but polarimetric biases beyond measurement uncertainties. After subsequent updates to calibration, georegistration, and the measurement uncertainty models, observations from the instruments now largely agree within stated uncertainties. However, the 470 nm reflectance channels have a roughly 6% bias of AirMSPI relative to RSP, beyond expected measurement uncertainties. We also find that observations of dark (ocean) scenes, where polarimetric uncertainty is expected to be largest, do not agree within stated polarimetric uncertainties. Otherwise, AirMSPI and RSP observations are consistent within measurement uncertainty expectations, providing credibility for the subsequent creation of Level 2 (geophysical product) data from these instruments, and comparison thereof. The techniques used in this work can also form a methodological basis for other intercom-parisons, for example, of the data gathered during the recent Aerosol Characterization from Polarimeter and Lidar (ACEPOL) field campaign, carried out in October and November of 2017 with four polarimeters (including AirMSPI and RSP). © 2019 Optical Society of America.","Aerosols; NASA; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Aerosol characterization; Geo-registration; Geophysical products; Imaging Polarimeter; Intercomparisons; Measurement uncertainty; Pre formulations; Research scanning polarimeters; Uncertainty analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060274241"

And it has been rapidly developed and applied in the study of crop growth in recent years. A clear and thorough understanding of the current situation and existing problems of crop growth based on UAV remote sensing is conducive to a better grasp of the current core areas and further research. In this study, we firstly reviewed the papers published on the topic of “research on crop growth based on remote sensing by unmanned aerial vehicle”. Then, UAV remote sensing platform and the principle of basic remote sensing in different sensors, inversion parameter types, and its’ advantages and limitations were summarized. And the crop growth inversion process based on UAV remote sensing was summarized in detail. On this basis, crop growth parameters were summed up by divided into 4 categories, including morphological index, physiological and biochemical index, stress index, and yield index. On the other hand, the inversion methods of crop growth parameters were classified into 4 categories, including empirical statistical regression and machine learning, morphological features and spectral features identification, radiation transmission model, multi-angle aerial photography and satellite-UAV image combinations. And the advantages and disadvantages of different inversion methods were summarized. Finally, we conducted a discussion analysis and outlook evaluation based on the research status at domestic and abroad. This paper summarizes the research results of UAV remote sensing crop growth key parameters inversion in recent 10 years, which can provide reference for the theoretical basis and technical support of UAV remote sensing based crop growth research in the future. In this study, we think the reasons for the improvement of remote sensing inversion accuracy of UAV are as follows: First, the aerial photography height is low and close to the canopy of crops. The obtained information is less distorted and responsive, and it can reflect the small changes of crop phenotypes well. Second, the spatial scale of UAV remote sensing research is relatively small, which objectively not only excludes the heterogeneous factors that affect crop growth inversion at medium and large scales, but also can precisely control the variables required by the test purpose. And we believe that the real advantages of UAV remote sensing inversion of crop growth parameters are that: 1) UAV remote sensing is maneuverability and flexibility. 2) UAV remote sensing can provide higher resolution image data. 3) UAV remote sensing is sensitive to response of spatial heterogeneity information. To overcome the limitations of UAV remote sensing, our opinions are as follows: 1) Reducing equipment cost, improving flight duration and load capacity, improving flight stability, overcoming systemic and non-systematic errors to further improve the accuracy of inversion, are important direction for UAV remote sensing to be broken in the future. 2) Realizing platform docking between the UAV and the sensor as well as manipulating the same interface are the key technologies to be solved in the future. 3) Compared with satellite remote sensing, UAV remote sensing data exhibited some defects. The remote areas are not easily to reach for the UAV. Ideal data also can not be easily obtained as affected by various factors as scheduled. Cumbersome data preprocessing and so on. 4) UAV remote sensing in combined inversion of multi-type sensors is yet to be implemented, and the UAV remote sensing data acquisition on a long-time scale is implemented for different crop growth periods. On this basis, a staged and multi-parameter dynamic inversion model is constructed according to different physiological characteristics of crops and remote sensing information, which needs to be further explored. In summary, compared with traditional satellite remote sensing, UAV remote sensing has its unique advantages, but there are still some scientific problems to be further solved. However, the existing limitations of UAV remote sensing also fully illustrate that it has a vast prospect and great development potential in the study of crop growth. ©2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The leaf area index (LAI) of plants, as an important structural parameter of the terrestrial ecosystem, can reflect horizontal vegetation coverage, vertical structure of vegetation, litter thickness and underground biomass. All these are the principal aspects of vegetation affecting soil erosion. The multi-angle remote sensing data can provide the stereoscopic and directional information of the surface target, which is helpful to extract the vertical structure parameters of vegetation effectively. Therefore, in order to improve the estimation accuracy of soil erosion, a two-step method was developed in this study to estimate the forest LAI under different vertical structures using the PROSAIL model and multi-angle CHRIS/PROBA data based on the field data. A total of 70 quadrats (10 m × 10 m sized) were deployed in Mount Zijin with undisturbed natural vegetation, considering the vegetation types and accessibility in the middle of August 2017. The pixels were first classified into two categories depending on complexity of vertical structure; then, a specific algorithm was applied to the different classes. For Class 1, the single angle data of 55° had the highest accuracy, indicating that, for forests with a simple vertical structure, the single angle data was sufficient for LAI estimation. For Class 2, the multi-angle data combination of 0° 55° and −55° had the highest accuracy, indicating that, for forests with complex vertical structure, the multi-angle data can improve the accuracy of LAI estimation. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the accuracy of the LAI estimation algorithm. The results indicated that the two-step method can significantly improve the LAI estimation accuracy of forests with complex vertical structure, with a decrease in MAPE and RMSE of 19.52% and 23.08%, respectively, compared to the traditional empirical algorithm. The developed LAI estimation algorithm can be widely applied to forests with different vertical structures. Lastly, the two-step method was applied to the CHRIS/PROBA image acquired on September 7th, 2015 for mapping the spatial distribution of forest LAI in the western part of Mount Zijin. The result showed that the northern part and the southern part had higher LAI than the middle part of Mount Zijin. © 2019","Data; Erosion; Estimation; Forestry; Mapping; Plants; Remote Sensing; China; Guangdong; Zijin; Erosion; Forestry; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soils; Stereo image processing; Vegetation; Directional information; Forest LAI; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi-angle remote sensing; PROBA/CHRIS data; Root mean square errors; Terrestrial ecosystems; Two step method; accuracy assessment; algorithm; bidirectional reflectance; CHRIS; complexity; ecosystem modeling; empirical analysis; error analysis; forest ecosystem; image analysis; leaf area index; mountain region; Proba; satellite imagery; Mapping","Forest LAI; PROBA/CHRIS data; PROSAIL model; The two-step method","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063220885"

Nevertheless, the use of thermal remote sensing data over tropical forests still has some limitations being of special importance the atmospheric correction under very humid conditions and the possible high occurrence of cloudy pixels. In order to mitigate these limitations over the Amazon region, we present in this paper a new processing methodology to derive a LST product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The LST product was generated using a tuned split-window equation and cloud information derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. This LST product was validated using simulated and in situ data, and intercompared to the MODIS LST standard product (MOD11). Validation analysis shows that the new LST product reduces the RMSE by 0.6 to 1 K when compared to the MODIS standard LST product, mainly because of a reduction of the bias. We also show a preliminary intercomparison between MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST spatial patterns to illustrate the feasibility of VIIRS to extend forward the MODIS LST temporal series. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Amazonia; Carbon; Climate change; Forestry; Infrared imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Thermography (imaging); Tropics; Vegetation; Atmospheric corrections; Climate change projections; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer datum; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Retrieval algorithms; Thermal remote sensing; Vegetation temperature; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; algorithm; atmospheric correction; biomass; biome; climate change; climate prediction; evergreen forest; MODIS; pixel; plant; rainforest; remote sensing; tropical forest; VIIRS; Radiometers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032390483"

With the strong correlation of different angle images, the low-rank structure of multiangle image is explored by lexicographically ordering the 3-D data cube into a 2-D matrix. Based on this property, the observed images is decomposed to a background image and a foreground image. Considering the high relationship between each band of the multispectral image, a multichannel total variation (MTV) constraint was applied on the target high resolution background image. Therefore, a robust superresolution model of multiangle-multispectral remote sensing image based on rank minimization (RSRRM) is proposed to register the low resolution multi-angle images and reconstruct high-resolution image. This method can achieve image registration and superresolution at the same time. Several experiments are conducted to illustrate the performance of the method. © 2016 IEEE.","","low-rank; multiangle; multichannel total variation; multispectral; registration; superresolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007483299"

Polarization information is an important component to remote sensed data, which comprises spatial, spectral, and radiation information. In optical remote sensing, polarization information supplements spectral information. Polarization-based remote sensing has a significant application potential for analyzing the spectral characteristics of water bodies, wherein a very important technique is eliminating the mirror reflection caused by skylight on the water surface and extracting water-leaving radiance that carry the constituent information. The incident sunlight on the surface of water either reflects or scatters owing to the existence of particles in water, which results in water-leaving signals with strong polarization characteristics. The ongoing experiments on remote sensing involve water polarization cover either clean ocean waters under natural light or indoor simulations of water under artificial light; however, turbid inland waters under natural light have rarely been investigated. Through the combination of a field spectroradiometer and a Thompson polarizing prism, this study obtained in-situ measurements of the spectral polarization reflectance over inland waters under natural light conditions. Using the obtained multiangle polarized reflectance spectra, the polarization spectral characteristics of water under multiangle viewing conditions were quantitatively analyzed, and the water-leaving radiance was achieved by eliminating skylight reflection. When observing water bodies at an azimuth of 135° and a zenith of 53°, the measurement of polarization to eliminate skylight reflection had better elimination efficiency than at other viewing angles, and this observation angle was recommended for conducting spectral polarized above-water observations. Compared with the traditional methods including non-polarized above-water measurements, the proposed method is less prone to being affected by changes in weather conditions, and it can extract water-leaving radiance more accurately. © 2016, Peking University Press.

The bidirectional polarization distribution function is a useful tool for quantitatively describing the surface polarized reflectance. The multi-angle polarized remote sensing reveals a significant advantage in capturing the radiation and polarization information. The polarization and directionality of the earth reflectance (POLDER) instrument is the only sensor which has provided a long-term trend of polarized measurements. Its combination of multi-spectral, polarization and multi-angle observations has considerable capability for retrieving ocean, land, cloud and aerosol properties. Until now, data obtained from POLDER has been widely used to study various surface bidirectional polarized reflectance models, especially Nadal model. However, parameters of Nadal model reveal a low accuracy in China region. In this study, the parameters of Nadal model suitable for China region are obtained and analyzed based on the POLDER-2 polarized reflectance data. Based on the modified parameters of Nadal model, polarized reflectance under different surface types is further analyzed. Our results show that the polarized reflectance retrieved from modified parameters of Nadal model reveals better correlation with the POLDER-2 products than the polarized reflectance from Nadal official parameters under different surface types. The polarization properties of three typical surfaces (forest, grassland and desert) are further investigated and reveal that 1) different surface polarized reflectances decrease with the increase of the scattering angle, and the polarized reflectance of the same object decreases as the normalized difference vegetation index increases; 2) significant discrepancies exist between the polarized reflectances of different surfaces, the polarized reflectance of forest is the lowest in the three surface types, then that of grass is the second lowest, and desert reveal the largest value (about twice that of forest), 3) the discrepancies of polarized reflectance between different surfaces have an increasing trend as satellite view zenith angle increases. This study will provide a priori knowledge for the detection of surface polarization properties and aerosol parameters based on multi-angle polarization remote sensing data, and also establish a good foundation for the quantitative applications of GF-5 satellite multi-angle polarization imager to be launched soon in China. © 2015 Chinese Physical Society.","Aerosols; Distribution functions; Forestry; Light polarization; Polarization; Reflection; Surface waters; Vegetation; Bidirectional polarization distribution functions; Leaf angle distributions; Multi angle; Multi-angle observations; Normalized difference vegetation index; Polarization reflectance; Polarized remote sensing; Vegetation classification; Remote sensing","Multi-angle polarization; Nadal model; Polarization reflectance; Remote sensing inversion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949292752"

To help discriminate between different aerosol particle types, which is crucial to improve our understanding of their impact on climate and air quality, AirMSPI acquires imagery over multiple view angles in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared, and it employs dual photoelastic modulators (PEMs) to target an uncertainty requirement of 0.005 in the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) at selected wavelengths. Laboratory polarimetric calibrations using a second-generation Polarization State Generator-2 (PSG-2) and validation measurements at 0 < DoLP < 1 demonstrate a systematic uncertainty of <0.002. In-flight calibrations of the temperature sensitivity of the PEMs, which could otherwise introduce DoLP errors up to 0.02, are extracted from onboard “validator” measurements as well as from the AirMSPI imagery of the Earth. After this in-flight calibration, the stability of measurements of the validator’s DoLP throughout the POlarimeter Definition EXperiment and Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys field campaigns is 0.001. Comparisons of DoLP data from these campaigns with the Research Scanning Polarimeter show root-mean-square differences ranging between 0.003 and 0.006, while the regression slopes deviate from unity by currently unexplained values up to 0.024. The observed differences are the result of measurement errors in both instruments, as well as imperfections in the intercomparison.

Although remote sensing soil moisture measurement has become an important data source, it cannot be used directly in hydrological modelling. A novel study based on nonlinear techniques (a local linear regression (LLR) and two feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs)) is carried out to estimate soil moisture deficit (SMD), using the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) multi-angle brightness temperatures (Tbs) with both horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarisations. The gamma test is used for the first time to determine the optimum number of Tbs required to construct a reliable smooth model for SMD estimation, and the relationship between model input and output is achieved through error variance estimation. The simulated SMD time series in the study area is from the Xinanjiang hydrological model. The results have shown that LLR model is better at capturing the interrelations between SMD and Tbs than ANNs, with outstanding statistical performances obtained during both training (NSE = 0.88, r = 0.94, RMSE = 0.008 m) and testing phases (NSE = 0.85, r = 0.93, RMSE = 0.009 m). Nevertheless, both ANN training algorithms (radial BFGS and conjugate gradient) have performed well in estimating the SMD data and showed excellent performances compared with those derived directly from the SMOS soil moisture products. This study has also demonstrated the informative capability of the gamma test in the input data selection for model development.

Here, we investigate the vulnerability of Amazonian forests, both undisturbed and human-modified, to repeated droughts. We defined vulnerability as a measure of (i) exposure, which is the degree to which these ecosystems were exposed to droughts, and (ii) its sensitivity, measured as the degree to which the drought has affected remote sensing-derived forest greenness. The exposure was calculated by assessing the meteorological drought, using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and the maximum cumulative water deficit (MCWD), which is related to vegetation water stress, from 1981 to 2016. The sensitivity was assessed based on the enhanced vegetation index anomalies (AEVI), derived from the newly available Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC) product, from 2003 to 2016, which is indicative of forest’s photosynthetic capacity. We estimated that 46% of the Brazilian Amazon biome was under severe to extreme drought in 2015/2016 as measured by the SPI, compared with 16% and 8% for the 2009/2010 and 2004/2005 droughts, respectively. The most recent drought (2015/2016) affected the largest area since the drought of 1981. Droughts tend to increase the variance of the photosynthetic capacity of Amazonian forests as based on the minimum and maximum AEVI analysis. However, the area showing a reduction in photosynthetic capacity prevails in the signal, reaching more than 400 000 km2 of forests, four orders of magnitude larger than areas with AEVI enhancement. Moreover, the intensity of the negative AEVI steadily increased from 2005 to 2016. These results indicate that during the analysed period drought impacts were being exacerbated through time. Forests in the twenty-first century are becoming more vulnerable to droughts, with larger areas intensively and negatively responding to water shortage in the region.

A promising method for estimating LUE is through remote sensing of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). However, there are internal (e.g. pigment concentrations) and external factors (e.g. environmental conditions and sun-target-view geometry) that affect PRI signals. Considering the reflectance difference between sunlit and shaded leaves, the ratio of observed canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is used to represent the observed fraction of sunlit leaves, and the observed fraction of shaded leaves is calculated with a geometrical optical model. Thus, a canopy-level PRI observation is separated into sunlit and shaded PRI values, and a two-leaf canopy PRI (PRIt) is calculated as sum of these two values weighted by their respective sunlit and shaded leaf area indices. The usefulness of PRIt in assessing the canopy-level LUE is evaluated with automated multi-angle PRI observations acquired on a flux tower from April to September 2013 over a sub-tropical coniferous forest in southern China. In each 15-minute observation cycle, PRI is observed at four view zenith angles fixed at (37°, 47°, 57°) or (42°, 52°, 62°) and the instantaneous solar zenith angle in the azimuth angle range from 45° to 325° (from the geodetic north). In both the half-hourly and daily time steps, PRIt can effectively improve (> 50% and > 35% increases in R2, respectively) the ability as a proxy of LUE derived from the tower flux measurements over the big-leaf PRI taken as the arithmetic average of the multi-angle measurements in a given time interval. In the dry season from July to September, correlations of PRI with LUE at daily time steps are much stronger in the two-leaf case than in the big-leaf case. The correlation between PRIt and LUE is the strongest (R2 = 0.785, p < 0.001) in July.

To manage and prevent such disasters, studies for constructing a three-dimensional (3D) geographic information system (GIS) that provides multi-angle analysis of disasters and offers easy management have been conducted. Among the developed GIS engines, 3D game engines can construct 3D display systems with the GIS function depending on the capabilities of the developers, but terrain and 3D building information produced with high-precision spatial information and high-resolution images is large in capacity and requires much time for system services. In addition, the method of loading all the information of images regardless of their scale causes overload to the image processing device, making efficient image processing impossible. To overcome these limitations, this study aimed to address the loading delay problems, which are obstacles to system operation, by applying the level of detail (LOD) technique to the high-precision terrain information provided by systems based on the Unity 3D engine, which is a game engine. The LOD technique is a technique used to control large-capacity images and adjusts the details according to the scales of the images. To apply the LOD technique to the 3D engine, images with various resolutions were stored, and aerial images were segmented according to the zoom. In other words, the zoom far away from the terrain produced low-resolution images while the zoom close to the terrain produced high-resolution images. Based on this method, the loading delay time of the display system could be shortened. 3D disaster prevention GIS systems based on high-precision terrain and building information can be constructed using this developed method. In addition, the use of this method will make it possible to apply effective system functions and information services in the future. © 2017 ACRS.

In this study, we explain the physical mechanism of the polarization properties of vegetation on the basis of the Fresnel equation and its derivative polarized reflectance models and compare them with the polarization measurement results of a single leaf and two vegetation covers, which are measured using a goniometer system. The Fresnel equation is effective for explaining the polarization of vegetation in forward-scattering directions, however, other theories should be considered in explaining polarization in backward-scattering directions. The polarization of vegetation covers can be considered as ""noise"" when we use the photometric signal, such as the separation of specular portion (which is computed by bidirectional polarized reflectance factor) from the total reflectance factor, which decreases the difference between BRF model results and measured results from 30% to 20%. Moreover, it possesses potentially useful information, such as the relationship between model parameter and vegetation cover roughness, which can characterize the structure of vegetation covers. Investigating the polarization of vegetation contributes to the understanding of the optical property of natural surfaces and potentially provides an additional and effective method for remote-sensing applications of vegetation covers. Our study also potentially provides a method for measuring the polarization of vegetation covers and demonstrates the physical rules of polarization in vegetation covers, such as the flatter the vegetation samples, the more polarization can be measured, and separating polarization from the total reflectance factor contributes to the improvement of the ability of current BRF models to simulate vegetation reflection. These results highlight the efficiency of polarized remote sensing on characterizing natural surfaces such as vegetation covers. © 2018, Science Press.

Vegetation biomass is an important index to evaluate the structure, function and health status of wetland ecosystems, directly reflecting the growth status of vegetation communities. Taking Longbaotan Wetland Nature Reserve as the research object, this study was conducted based on the ESA CHRIS/PROBA data. Remote sensing factors, including original spectral reflectance, narrow band Indices, red edge indices, and the newly established vegetation index - VInew, were extracted at the three angles of +36°, 0° and -36° respectively. Correlation between the factors and vegetation biomass in the alpine marsh was analyzed, and sensitivity of the biomass to angle was discussed. The optimal biomass estimation model was established by using the regression analysis method, and then used to estimate the aboveground vegetation biomass in Longbaotan Wetland. The results showed that the exponential model established with VInew (-36°) as the independent variable had the best fitting effect, with a determination coefficient of 0.613, and the inversion accuracy was improved obviously. The accuracy of reverse solving of biomass was obviously improved by using vegetation indices at different angles, which is very important for the optimization of remote sensing parameters used to retrieve wetland vegetation biomass. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Biomass; Ecology; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Wetlands; Determination coefficients; Established vegetations; HyperSpectral; Independent variables; Multi angle; Regression analysis methods; Spectral reflectances; Wetland vegetation; Vegetation","Biomass; Hyperspectral; Multi-angle; Remote sensing; Wetland vegetation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045518858"

Simulations of the dust event with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the Chemistry module (WRF-Chem) were analyzed and verified using MSG-SEVIRI imagery and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the recent 1-km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm for MODIS Terra/Aqua.

In addition, the impact of the event on atmospheric and air quality conditions is investigated. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was calculated prior, during, and after the event to assess the degradation of air quality conditions. Simulated temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and surface radiation were compared to observations at six monitoring stations in the UAE giving R2 values of 0.84, 0.63, 0.60, and 0.84, respectively. From 1 to 2 April 2015, both observations and simulations showed an average drop in temperature from 33 to 26 °C and radiance reduction from about 950 to 520 Wm−2. The AOD modeled by WRF-Chem showed a good correlation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements in the UAE with R2 of 0.83. The AQI over the UAE reached hazardous levels during the peak of the dust event before rapidly decreasing to moderate–good air quality levels.

Matching the divergence angle of the calibration light source with the corresponding field angle of the DPC pixel is important in achieving high-precision laboratory polarimetric calibration. A model of matching the divergence angle of the calibration light source with the corresponding field angle of the DPC pixel is established by comparing the state difference between on-orbit detection and laboratorial polarization calibration. This comparison is performed according to DPC on-orbit optical system imaging theory using the differential operation method. The divergence angle of the calibration light source should be larger than 0.14° to fulfill the polarization calibration requirement according to the analysis result of the model. The 499 nm polarization channel is taken as an example, and spectrum-tunable integrating spheres are used instead of the 0.125° divergence angle of quasi-parallel light as polarization calibration light source to test the validity of the model and the analysis result. Using spectrum-tunable integrating spheres instead of quasi-parallel light decreases the average deviations between the measurement DOLP of DPC and theoretical reference from 1.26×10-2 to 4.4×10-3. We validate the model of matching the divergence angle of the calibration light source with the corresponding field angle. The method that uses spectrum-tunable integrating spheres instead of quasi-parallel light satisfies the high-precision laboratory polarimetric calibration requirements of DPC for scientific applications. © 2018, Science Press.

A systematic assessment of aerosol effects on Earth's climate requires global mapping of tropospheric aerosols through satellite remote sensing. However aerosol retrieval over land surface remains a challenging task due to bright background of the land surfaces. Polarized measurements can provide an improved aerosol sensing by providing a means of decoupling the surface and atmospheric contribution. The Indian Space Research Organisation has planned a Multi- Angle Dual-Polarization Instrument (MADPI) onboard a Nano satellite for Earth Monitoring & Observations for Aerosol Monitoring (NEMO-AM). MADPI has three spectral bands in blue, red and near infrared spectral regions with a nominal spatial resolution of 30 m from an altitude of 500 km polar orbit. A study has been taken up with the aim of development of an algorithm for retrieving aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over land surfaces from NEMO-AM polarized measurements. The study has three major components: (1) detailed theoretical modelling exercise for computing the atmospheric and surface polarized contributions, (2) modelling of total satellite-level polarized contribution, and (3) retrieval of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) by comparing the modelled and measured polarized signals. The algorithm has been developed for MADPI/NEMO-AM spectral bands and tested successfully on similar spectral bands of POLDER/PARASOL measurements to retrieve AOT over Indian landmass having diverse atmospheric conditions. POLDER-derived AOT fields were compared with MODIS-AOT products. Results showed a very good match (R2∼0.69, RMSE∼0.07). Initial results have provided encouraging results, however, comprehensive analysis and testing has to be carried out for establishing the proposed algorithm for retrieving AOT from NEMO-AM measurements. © 2016 SPIE.","Atmospheric aerosols; Budget control; Earth (planet); Infrared devices; Optical properties; Orbits; Polarization; Radiation effects; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soils; Space optics; Space research; Surface measurement; Vegetation; Aerosol optical thickness; Aerosol retrieval over land; Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric contributions; Comprehensive analysis; Earth radiation Budget; Near-infrared spectral regions; Satellite remote sensing; Aerosols","Aerosol; NEMO-AM; Polarization; Reflectance; Soil; Vegetation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006867135"

As nicotine is in a non-uniform distribution in tobacco plants, current single-angle and single-period remote sensing observation methods may neglect nicotine information of middle and lower leaves or only obtain single period information of vegetation, which is difficult to meet the needs of quantitative remote sensing. In contrast, multi-angle, multi-temporal remote sensing can provide directional information and time information of vegetation, which helps to understand the characteristics of two-way reflection and improve the ability to quantitatively invert vegetation structure and physiological parameters. This research was carried out in different regions, varieties and nitrogen fertilizers in Xuchang Tobacco Science and Education Park of Henan Agricultural University, Songxian County of Luoyang City and Lushi County of Sanmenxia City for two consecutive years from 2016 to 2017. Data were collected from root-grown period of flue-cured tobacco (30d after transplanting), prolonged period (55d after transplanting) and mature period (75d after transplanting); for each treatment, 3 strains with uniform growth and typical representativeness were selected. Spectral reflectance of 73 angles per tobacco was collected. The total number of samples was 175,200, and the total number of samples per single angle was 2,400. Half of the random selection was made for modeling and verification. Nicotine density vegetation index was constructed using spectral data formed by different combinations of zenith angle and azimuth angle. Quantitative relationship between nicotine density normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) was systematically analyzed by decremental fine sampling method. Results showed that the combination angle of 30¡ã zenith angle and 210¡ã azimuth was the best observation angle for nicotine canopy density; band combinations of R2 >0.8 of RVI were (1,596~1,610, 1,757~1,761), (1,609~11,672, 1,733~1,760) and (1,682~1,691, 1,716~1,722); band combinations of R2 >0.8 of NDVI were (1,598~1,605, 1,758~1,761), (1,610~1,668, 1,734~1,755) and (1,683~1,691, 1,717~1,722); and the best sensitive spectral parameters for monitoring nicotine density were RVI (1, 630, 1, 740) and NDVI (1, 630, 1, 740). A random sample of 120 samples from a total sample of single angle were used to build a prediction model, while the remaining 120 samples were used to validate the model. BP neural network and SVM (support vector machine), as nonlinear nicotine density prediction models, were constructed by selecting the top 20 RVI values and the first 20 NDVI with the best angle of 30°-210° values as independent variables, with the R2 being 0.944 and 0.996, respectively, and the RMSE of the model verification being 0.858 and 0.011, respectively. Both models had high precision and universality. This study proves that multi-angle and multi-temporal remote sensing has a good application prospect in the monitoring of nicotine density of tobacco. © 2019, Editorial Office Chinese Tobacco Society.

Synthetic aperture radars (SAR) are common instruments for land remote sensing. GPRs with synthetic aperture radar technique (GPR-SAR) are popular instruments to obtain image of the buried objects. To know about dielectric contents, position and shape of the buried target objects, ordinary GPR-SAR is insufficient, because angle between transmit and receive antenna is fixed. Therefore, information is lacked, mainly about microwave propagation velocity of soil which affects measurement accuracy of position of various buried objects. Multi-angle GPR-SAR, a new method, is proposed and can change angle between transmit and receive antennas. In the multi-angle GPR-SAR, a lot of angle points between the antennas can be set, and much more detailed information can be obtained related to buried objects and surrounding soil.

Sun glitter (SG), caused by direct specular reflection of sunlight from the sea surface, and its intensity are strongly affected by SSR. Here, we propose a new model for estimating SSR at a pixel scale using multi-angle SG images. To test our model, high-resolution multi-angle SG images acquired by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor were used to estimate SSR. The modal value of SSR was more suitable for describing the background SSR induced by wind, and these data were then converted into wind speed for accuracy evaluation. The estimated wind matched reasonably well with corresponding reanalysis wind data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting and buoy wind data from the National Data Buoy Center. The results showed that the proposed model has an inversion accuracy that is comparable to other remote sensing methods. Next, we presented three examples of high-resolution SSR images of an oil slick, submarine topography, and internal wave information to illustrate the applications of the model. These estimated SSR images showed detailed oceanographic features with low noise and quantitative changes in SSR at a pixel scale. The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible to estimate SSR at a high resolution using multi-angle SG images, and high-resolution SSR observations have considerable applicability to oceanographic phenomena. © 2018 The Authors","Image acquisition; Pixels; Remote sensing; Surface roughness; Weather forecasting; Wind; Wind effects; ASTER; Mean square slopes; Sea surface roughness; Sun glitter; Wind speed; ASTER; image resolution; internal wave; numerical method; pixel; remote sensing; satellite sensor; surface roughness; wind velocity; Surface waters","ASTER; Mean square slope; Multi-angle sun glitter; Sea surface roughness; Wind speed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042066487"

It is based on channel-1 and -2 radiance data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments flown on successive National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) platforms. We extend the previous GACP dataset by four years through the end of 2009 using NOAA-17 and -18 AVHRR radiances recalibrated against MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiance data, thereby making the GACP record almost three decades long. The temporal overlap of over three years of the new NOAA-17 and the previous NOAA-16 record reveals an excellent agreement of the corresponding global monthly mean AOT values, thereby confirming the robustness of the vicarious radiance calibration used in the original GACP product. The temporal overlap of the NOAA-17 and -18 instruments is used to introduce a small additive adjustment to the channel-2 calibration of the latter resulting in a consistent record with increased data density. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the newly extended GACP record shows that most of the volcanic AOT variability can be isolated into one mode responsible for ~. 12% of the total variance. This conclusion is confirmed by a combined PCA analysis of the GACP, MODIS, and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) AOTs during the volcano-free period from February 2000 to December 2009. We show that the modes responsible for the tropospheric AOT variability in the three datasets agree well in terms of correlation and spatial patterns. A previously identified negative AOT trend which started in the late 1980s and continued into the early 2000s is confirmed. Its magnitude and duration indicate that it was caused by changes in tropospheric aerosols. The latest multi-satellite segment of the GACP record shows that this trend tapered off, with no noticeable AOT change after 2002. This result is consistent with the MODIS and MISR AOT records as well as with the recent gradual reversal from brightening to dimming revealed by surface flux measurements in many aerosol producing regions. Thus the robustness of the GACP record is confirmed, increasing our confidence in the validity of the negative trend. Although the nominal negative GACP AOT trend could partially be an artifact of increasing aerosol absorption, we argue that the time dependence of the GACP record, including the latest flat period, is more consistent with the actual decrease in the tropospheric AOT. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRR); Aerosols; Calibration; Climatology; Image reconstruction; Optical properties; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectrometers; Troposphere; Volcanoes; Aerosol remote sensing; Global aerosol; Long-term trend; Optical thickness; Tropospheric aerosols; aerosol property; AVHRR; MODIS; NOAA satellite; optical depth; principal component analysis; remote sensing; trend analysis; troposphere; Principal component analysis","Aerosol remote sensing; Global Aerosol Climatology Project; Long-term trends; Optical thickness; Principal Component Analysis; Tropospheric aerosols","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936767126"

Traditional methods require a large number of ground control points(GCPs) which consuming lots of manpower and financial resources. With the resolution up to 0.8m, the original geo-positioning accuracy of the Chinese Gaofen(GF-2) multi-angle imagery is about 90m which means a limited application in geometric processing. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the geometric performance of the multi-angle satellite imagery based on the geometric error sources of this experimental dataset without GCPs. Under the condition of weak intersection of our test dataset, we use a DEM-assisted approach to acquire a more accurate initial position accuracy of all tie points, and all extracted data is clustered by the Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN) algorithm in order to eliminate points or impages with large positioning error automatically. Then, the error-based block adjustment model are proposed and investigated to improved the geometric performance of the experimental dataset. Based on our proposed method, 142 multi-angle GF-2 satellite images covering the western Beijing area are experimented and the root mean square error(RMSE) of the geometric accuracy is improved up to about 12m in plane and 6m in height, which shows a significantly improvement in geo-positioning accuracy of these multi-angle GF-2 remote sensing imagery. © 2019 IEEE.","Errors; Geology; Geometry; Large dataset; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Statistical tests; Block adjustment; DBSCAN; Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; geometric performance; Ground control points; Multi angle; Remote sensing imagery; Root mean square errors; Image enhancement","DBSCAN; error-based block adjustment; geometric performance; multi-angle; RFM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077724155"

Here, remote sensing data and machine learning techniques that could support or substitute traditional field-based data collection are evaluated. For the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario, Canada, different combinations of multi-angle/temporal quad pol RADARSAT-2, simulated compact pol RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and high and low spatial resolution Digital Elevation and Surface Models (DEM and DSM, respectively) were used to classify six land cover classes with Random Forests: shallow water, marsh, swamp, water, forest, and agriculture/non-forested. Results demonstrate that high accuracies can be achieved with multi-temporal SAR data alone (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image and a summer image), or via fusion of SAR and DEM and DSM data for single dates/incidence angles (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image, DEM, and DSM data). For all models based on single SAR images, simulated compact pol data generally achieved lower accuracies than quad pol RADARSAT-2 data. However, it was possible to compensate for observed differences through either multi-temporal/angle data fusion or the inclusion of DEM and DSM data (i.e., as a result, there was not a statistically significant difference between multiple models). With a higher repeat-pass cycle than RADARSAT-2, RCM is expected to be a reliable source of C-band SAR data that will contribute positively to ongoing efforts to inventory wetlands and monitor change in areas containing the same land cover classes evaluated here. © 2019 by the authors.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (MC6) ice cloud property retrievals are produced in conjunction with a single-habit ice particle model with a fixed degree of ice particle surface roughness (the MC6 model). In this study, we examine the MC6 model and five other ice models with either smoother or rougher surface textures to determine an optimal model to reproduce the angular variation of the radiation field sampled by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) as a function of latitude. The spherical albedo difference (SAD) method is used to infer an optimal ice particle model. The method is applied to collocated MISR and MODIS data over ocean for clouds with temperatures ≤233 K during December solstice from 2012-2015. The range of solar zenith angles covered by the MISR cameras is broader at the solstices than at other times of the year, with fewer scattering angles associated with sun glint during the December solstice than the June solstice. The results suggest a latitudinal dependence in an optimal ice particle model, and an additional dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA) at the time of the observations. The MC6 model is one of the most optimal models on the global scale. In further analysis, the results are filtered by a cloud heterogeneity index to investigate cloudy scenarios that are less susceptible to potential 3D effects. Compared to results for global data, the consistency between measurements and a given model can be distinguished in both the tropics and extra-tropics. The SAD analysis suggests that the optimal model for thick homogeneous clouds corresponds to more roughened ice particles in the tropics than in the extra-tropics. While the MC6 model is one of the models most consistent with the global data, it may not be the most optimal model for the tropics. © 2018 by the authors.","Clouds; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Spectrometers; Surface roughness; Tropics; Additional dependences; Ice clouds; Ice particles; Latitude;MISR;MODIS; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Radiative transfer simulations; Ice","Cloud and radiation; Ice clouds; Ice particle model; Latitude;MISR;MODIS; Multiangle imaging; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058887823"

To retrieve global biophysical parameters from multiangle data, the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model has been widely applied to satellite multiangle observations to model (interpolate/extrapolate) the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in an arbitrary direction of viewing and solar geometries. Such modeled BRFs, as an essential information source, are then input into an inversion procedure that is devised through a large number of simulation analyses from some widely used physical models that can generalize such an inversion relationship between the BRFs (or their simple algebraic composite) and the biophysical/structural parameter. Therefore, evaluation of such a link between physical models and kernel-driven models contributes to the development of such inversion procedures to accurately retrieve vegetation properties, particularly based on the operational global BRDF parameters derived from satellite multiangle observations (e.g., MODIS). In this study, the main objective is to investigate the potential for linking a popular physical model (PROSAIL) with the widely used kernel-driven Ross-Li models. To do this, the BRFs and albedo are generated by the physical PROSAIL in a forward model, and then the simulated BRFs are input into the kernel-driven BRDF model for retrieval of the BRFs and albedo in the same viewing and solar geometries. To further strengthen such an investigation, a variety of field-measured multiangle reflectances have also been used to investigate the potential for linking these two models. For simulated BRFs generated by the PROSAIL model at 659 and 865 nm, the two models are generally comparable to each other, and the resultant root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.0092 and 0.0355, respectively, although some discrepancy in the simulated BRFs can be found at large average leaf angle (ALA) values. Unsurprisingly, albedos generated by the method are quite consistent, and 99.98% and 97.99% of the simulated white sky albedo (WSA) has a divergence less than 0.02. For the field measurements, the kernel-driven model presents somewhat better model-observation congruence than the PROSAIL model. The results show that these models have an overall good consistency for both field-measured and model-simulated BRFs. Therefore, there is potential for linking these two models for looking into the retrieval of canopy biophysical/structural variables through a simulation method, particularly from the current archive of the global routine MODIS BRDF parameters that were produced by the kernel-driven BRDF model; however, erectophile vegetation must be further examined. © 2018 by the authors.","Biophysics; Distribution functions; Lithium; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Vegetation; Albedo; Bi-directional reflectance factors; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; BRDF; Model linking; Multi-angle observations; Multiangle reflectances; Root mean square errors; Mean square error","Albedo; Anisotropy Flat Index (AFX); BRDF; Model linking; PROSAIL model; The kernel-driven Ross-Li model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044218488"

Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15 years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes.

To manage such consequences, oil leak indicators should be detected quickly by monitoring systems. Remote sensing is one of the most suitable techniques for monitoring systems, especially for areas which are uninhabitable and difficulty to access. The most available physical quantities in optical remote sensing domain are the intensity and spectral information obtained by visible or infrared sensors. However, besides the intensity and wavelength, polarization is another primary physical quantity associated with an optical field. During the course of reflecting light-wave, the surface of soil polluted by crude oil will cause polarimetric properties which are related to the nature of itself. Thus, detection of the spectralpolarimetric properties for soil polluted by crude oil has become a new remote sensing monitoring method. In this paper, the multi-Angle spectral-polarimetric instrument was used to obtain multi-Angle visible and near infrared spectralpolarimetric characteristic data of soil polluted by crude oil. And then, the change rule between polarimetric properties with different affecting factors, such as viewing zenith angle, incidence zenith angle of the light source, relative azimuth angle, waveband of the detector as well as different grain size of soil were discussed, so as to provide a scientific basis for the research on polarization remote sensing for soil polluted by crude oil. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Indeed, aerosol particles constitute a highly variable atmospheric component characterized by a large number of parameters describing particle sizes, morphologies (including shape and internal structure), absorption and scattering properties, amounts, horizontal and vertical distribution, etc. Reliable monitoring of all these parameters is very challenging, and therefore the aerosol effects on climate and environment are considered to be among the most uncertain factors in climate and environmental research. In this regard, observations that provide both the angular distribution of the scattered atmospheric radiation as well as its polarization state at multiple wavelengths covering the UV–SWIR spectral range carry substantial implicit information on the atmospheric composition. Therefore, high expectations in improving aerosol characterization are associated with detailed passive photopolarimetric observations. The critical need to use space-borne polarimetry for global accurate monitoring of detailed aerosol properties was first articulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By now, several orbital instruments have already provided polarization observations from space, and a number of advanced missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years by international and national space agencies. The first and most extensive record of polarimetric imagery was provided by POLDER-I, POLDER-II, and POLDER/PARASOL multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensors. Polarimetric observations with the POLDER-like design intended for collecting extensive multi-angular multi-spectral measurements will be provided by several instruments, such as the MAI/TG-2, CAPI/TanSat, and DPC/GF-5 sensors recently launched by the Chinese Space Agency. Instruments such as the 3MI/MetOp-SG, MAIA, SpexOne and HARP2 on PACE, POSP, SMAC, PCF, DPC–Lidar, ScanPol and MSIP/Aerosol-UA, MAP/Copernicus CO2 Monitoring, etc. are planned to be launched by different space agencies in the coming decade. The concepts of these future instruments, their technical designs, and the accompanying algorithm development have been tested intensively and analyzed using diverse airborne prototypes. Certain polarimetric capabilities have also been implemented in such satellite sensors as GOME-2/MetOp and SGLI/GCOM-C. A number of aerosol retrieval products have been developed based on the available measurements and successfully used for different scientific applications. However, the completeness and accuracy of aerosol data operationally derived from polarimetry do not yet appear to have reached the accuracy levels implied by theoretical sensitivity studies that analyzed the potential information content of satellite polarimetry. As a result, the dataset provided by MODIS is still most frequently used by the scientific community, yet this sensor has neither polarimetric nor multi-angular capabilities. Admittedly polarimetric multi-angular observations are highly complex and have extra sensitivities to aerosol particle morphology, vertical variability of aerosol properties, polarization of surface reflectance, etc. As such, they necessitate state-of-the-art forward modeling based on first-principles physics which remains rare, and conventional retrieval approaches based on look-up tables turn out to be unsuitable to fully exploit the information implicit in the measurements. Several new-generation retrieval approaches have recently been proposed to address these challenges. These methods use improved forward modeling of atmospheric (polarized) radiances and implement a search in the continuous space of solutions using rigorous statistically optimized inversions. Such techniques provide more accurate retrievals of the main aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness and yield additional parameters such as aerosol absorption. However, the operational implementation of advanced retrieval approaches generally requires a significant extra effort, and the forward-modeling part of such retrievals still needs to be substantially improved. Ground-based passive polarimetric measurements have also been evolving over the past decade. Although polarimetry helps improve aerosol characterization, especially of the fine aerosol mode, the operators of major observational networks such as AERONET remain reluctant to include polarimetric measurements as part of routine retrievals owing to their high complexity and notable increase in effort required to acquire and interpret polarization data. In addition to remote-sensing observations, polarimetric characteristics of aerosol scattering have been measured in situ as well as in the laboratory using polar nephelometers. Such measurements constitute direct observations of single scattering with no contributions from multiple scattering effects and therefore provide unique data for the validation of aerosol optical models and retrieval concepts. This article overviews the above-mentioned polarimetric observations, their history and expected developments, and the state of resulting aerosol products. It also discusses the main achievements and challenges in the exploitation of polarimetry for the improved characterization of atmospheric aerosols. © 2018 The Authors","Aerosols; Angular distribution; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Complex networks; Ellipsometry; Nanosatellites; Optical radar; Orbits; Particle size; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Space optics; Table lookup; Uncertainty analysis; Absorption and scatterings; Multi-angular capabilities; Multiple scattering effect; Polarimetric capabilities; Polarimetric measurements; Polarimetric remote sensing; Polarization observations; Retrieval algorithms; AERONET; aerosol; algorithm; monitoring; parameterization; polarization; radiative transfer; remote sensing; Atmospheric aerosols","Aerosols; Polarimetry; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Retrieval algorithms","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058149597"

Conventional methods for Car content estimation were mostly based on reflectance data acquired from nadir direction. However, reflectance acquired at this direction is highly influenced by canopy structure and soil background reflectance. Off-nadir observation is less impacted, and multi-angle viewing data are proven to contain additional information rarely exploited for crop Car content estimation. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of multi-angle observation data for winter wheat canopy Car content estimation. Canopy spectral reflectance was measured from nadir as well as from a series of off-nadir directions during different growing stages of winter wheat, with concurrent canopy Car content measurements. Correlation analyses were performed between Car content and the original and continuum removed spectral reflectance. Spectral features and previously published indices were derived from data obtained at different viewing angles and were tested for Car content estimation. Results showed that spectral features and indices obtained from backscattering directions between 20° and 40° view zenith angle had a stronger correlation with Car content than that from the nadir direction, and the strongest correlation was observed from about 30° backscattering direction. Spectral absorption depth at 500 nm derived from spectral data obtained from 30° backscattering direction was found to reduce the difference induced by plant cultivars greatly. It was the most suitable for winter wheat canopy Car estimation, with a coefficient of determination 0.79 and a root mean square error of 19.03 mg/m                             2                             .

This study explores the relationship between Integrated Fertility Index (IFI) and soil spectrum curve under the best observation conditions through measuring the spectrum curves in different conditions of typical farmland soil in Jilin Province. The study shows that incidence angles, relative azimuth angles and polarized states will affect soil spectrum curve under certain circumstances In fact, the design of the most workable remote sensing to observe soil fertility for this purposecan be realized by equipment. In this way, soil reflection was mathematically manipulated into first derivative reflectance spectra and inverse-log spectra, then established soil fertility model on ground of characteristic bands. The study shows the negative correlation between soil fertility and reflectance, positive correlation between soil fertility and absorptivity of spectrum, but the correlation between soil fertility and reflectance of spectrum in first differential is uncertain. When using reflectance of spectrum and first differential reflectance of spectrum and absorbance indexes to calculate soil fertility, it has been found that the quadratic function of reflectance of spectrum and fertility fits properly, with determination coefficient reaching 0.876 and 0.867 at 560 and 860 nm respectively. © 2018, Peking University Press.

How Amazon forests responded to these droughts is critical for the future of the Earth's climate system. It is only possible to assess Amazon forests' response to the droughts in large areal extent through satellite remote sensing. Here, we used the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) data to assess Amazon forests' response to droughts, and compared the results with those from the standard (Collection 5 and Collection 6) MODIS VI data. Overall, the MAIAC data reveal more realistic Amazon forests inter-annual greenness dynamics than the standard MODIS data. Our results from the MAIAC data suggest that: (1) the droughts decreased the greenness (i.e., photosynthetic activity) of Amazon forests; (2) the Amazon wet season precipitation reduction induced by El Niño events could also lead to reduced photosynthetic activity of Amazon forests; and (3) in the subsequent year after the water stresses, the greenness of Amazon forests recovered from the preceding decreases. However, as previous research shows droughts cause Amazon forests to reduce investment in tissue maintenance and defense, it is not clear whether the photosynthesis of Amazon forests will continue to recover after future water stresses, because of the accumulated damages caused by the droughts. © 2016 by the authors.","Drought; Earth (planet); Photosynthesis; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Accumulated damage; Amazon forests; MAIAC; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Photosynthetic activity; Satellite remote sensing; Forestry","Amazon forests; Drought; MAIAC; MODIS; Photosynthesis; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971634668"

Passive optical remote sensing using sunlight has been used for several decades, and significant progress has been made in recent years. It exhibits the following characteristics.(1)The optical detection and classification of oil spills and hydrocarbon seepage are based on their different optical properties from oil-free water. These properties include oil slicks of different thicknesses, oil-water mixture(i.e., oil emulsion of different concentrations), thick floating oil, and thin oil slicks, and hydrocarbon gas from seabed hydrocarbon seepage. (2) These different oil and hydrocarbon forms undergo different optical processes when interacting with light because they can reflect, absorb, and scatter the incident light, resulting in different levels of optical contrast from surrounding oil-free water and thus providing a theoretical basis for their detection, classification, and quantification through optical remote sensing. (3) The Fresnel reflection of different surfaces, such as oil-free water or oiled surfaces with different refractive indexes and roughness, helps detection but presents challenges on classification and quantification. This paper provides a brief review of the characteristics of marine oil spills and hydrocarbon seepage in their various forms, and discusses the advantages and challenges in their optical detection and quantification. Many space borne and airborne multi/hyper-spectral or multi-angle optical sensors, such as MODIS, MERIS, AVIRIS, MISR, Hyperion, and Landsat, have been used to detect, quantify, and map oil spills or natural seepage, as shown in the most recent oil spill disasters and natural seepage estimates in the Gulf of Mexico. In these applications, lab-based experimental results provide optical models and key parameters to improve the quantification of surface oil from remote sensing images. Environmental conditions, such as sea state and solar/viewing geometry from a real spill case, can be dramatically different from those in the lab experiments. Thus, applying lab-based results to aquatic environments becomes technically challenging. Significant process has been made in understanding the oil-water spatial and spectral contrasts of these different oil forms under different environmental conditions. However, some key issues still need to be investigated further. These issues include sensor capability (i.e., spectral, spatial, and radiometric resolutions), relationship between spectral/spatial oil-water contrast and oil type and thickness, and optical models for improved detection and quantification at various scales. The fundamental difficulty in determining oil thickness or volume in the field needs to be overcome to refine lab-based models and validate remote sensing estimates. Nevertheless, optical remote sensing is expected to make continuous progress to eventually overcome these challenges and thereby play an increasingly important role in assessing marine oil spills and hydrocarbon seepage. © 2016, Science Press.

Part of this limitation comes from the small number of global satellite sensors which in turn only measures a restricted subset of aerosol and cloud microphysical properties. Enabling small satellites to perform high quality cloud and aerosol microphysical measurements is an important pathway to resolve this puzzle. The reduced cost of small satellites can enable the use of multiple platforms or even constellations to increase spatial and temporal coverage for the required measurements. The HARP (HyperAngular Rainbow Polarimeter) is a 3U CubeSat sensor designed for the measurement of aerosol, clouds and surface properties with a wide FOV that enables nearly global coverage from multiple wavelengths and tens of different along track viewing angles. The technology developed for HARP allows for all these characteristics to be packaged within the envelope of a CubeSat sensor while preserving strict science requirements. © 2018 IEEE.","Aerosols; Climate change; Clouds; Geology; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Uncertainty analysis; Cloud microphysical properties; Imaging Polarimeter; Interaction process; Microphysical measurements; Multi angle; Multiple wavelengths; Quantitative information; Science requirements; Small satellites","Aerosol; Clouds; CubeSat; Multi-angle; Polarimeter","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058141206"

However, in comparison to ground-based measurements, the FMF is still difficult to retrieve from satellite observations, as attempted by a Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) algorithm. In this paper, we introduce the retrieval of FMF based on Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) data. This method takes advantage of the coincident multi-angle intensity and polarization measurements from a single satellite platform. In our method, we use intensity measurements to retrieve the total AOD and polarization measurements to retrieve the fine-mode AOD. The FMF is then calculated as the ratio of the retrieved fine-mode AOD to the total AOD. The important processes in our method include the estimation of the surface intensity and polarized reflectance by using two semi-empirical models, and the building of two sets of aerosol retrieval lookup tables for the intensity and polarized measurements via the 6SV radiative transfer code. We apply this method to East Asia, and comparisons of the retrieved FMFs for the Beijing, Xianghe and Seoul_SNU sites with those of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) ground-based observations produce correlation coefficients (R2) of 0.838, 0.818, and 0.877, respectively. However, the comparison results are relatively poor (R2 = 0.537) in low-AOD areas, such as the Osaka site, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the satellite observations. © 2016 by the authors.","Atmospheric aerosols; Image reconstruction; Optical properties; Optical radar; Polarization; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Table lookup; Aerosol optical depths; Fine-mode fraction; Multi-angular remote sensing; PARASOL; Polarized remote sensing; Aerosols","Aerosol optical depth; Fine-mode fraction; Multi-angular remote sensing; PARASOL; Polarized remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971468266"

However, epidemiological studies on the chronic health impacts of PM2.5 in the developing countries are hindered by the lack of monitoring data. Despite the recent development of using satellite remote sensing to predict ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in China, methods for generating reliable historical PM2.5 exposure, especially prior to the construction of PM2.5 monitoring network in 2013, are still very rare. In this study, a high-performance machine-learning model was developed directly at monthly level to estimate PM2.5 levels in North China Plain. We developed a random forest model using the latest Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological parameters, land cover and ground PM2.5 measurements from 2013 to 2015. A multiple imputation method was applied to fill the missing values of AOD. We used 10-fold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate model performance and a separate time period, January 2016 to December 2016, was used to validate our model's capability of predicting historical PM2.5 concentrations. The overall model CV R2 and relative prediction error (RPE) were 0.88 and 18.7%, respectively. Validation results beyond the modeling period (2013–2015) shown that this model can accurately predict historical PM2.5 concentrations at the monthly (R2 = 0.74, RPE = 27.6%), seasonal (R2 = 0.78, RPE = 21.2%) and annual (R2 = 0.76, RPE = 16.9%) level. The annual mean predicted PM2.5 concentration from 2013 to 2016 in our study domain was 67.7 μg/m3 and Southern Hebei, Western Shandong and Northern Henan were the most polluted areas. Using this computationally efficient, monthly and high-resolution model, we can provide reliable historical PM2.5 concentrations for epidemiological studies on PM2.5 health effects in China.

Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness < 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice.

We utilize three Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization network sites and one Environmental Protection Agency Chemical Speciation Network station that afforded simultaneous Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol mass, chemistry, and light scattering monitoring. Prediction of AERONET AOD using linear regression of daily-mean PM2.5 during the SEAC4RS campaign yielded r2 of 0.36–0.53 and highly variable slopes across four sites. There were further reductions in PM2.5 predictive skill using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpetroRadiometer (MISR) AOD data, which have shorter correlation lengths and times relative to surface PM2.5. Long-term trends in aerosol chemistry and optical properties in the SEUS are also investigated and compared to SEAC4RS period data, establishing that the SEUS experienced significant reduction in aerosol mass, corresponding with changes in both aerosol chemistry and optical properties.

The measurements and the results with the best fitted model parameters were evaluated to determine whether the BRF models produce vegetation cover reflectance factor values that are qualitatively the same as the measured values. These models effectively characterized the BRF of the vegetation cover at most of the selected wavelengths (565, 670, and 865 nm). However, for planophile vegetation cover with smooth leaves, the current BRF models did not produce accurate values in the selected visible wavelength range; the average relative difference was approximately 0.3 at 670 nm. Subsequently, we subtracted the specular reflectance factor (calculated using the bidirectional polarized reflectance factors) from the total BRF and compared these data with the modeled results. The difference between the measured and modeled BRFs was notably decreased when we separated the specular reflectance factor at 670 nm for the planophile vegetation cover with smooth leaves. Moreover, there was a different degree of improvement in the agreement between the measured and modeled results, which depended on the wavelength and the type of vegetation cover.

We propose that aerosols layer is formed in the atmosphere via reflected signals to create multipath. This act makes the satellite sensors see the superposition of multiple copies of transmitted signal which affects aerosol measurement at the long run. One of the reliable remote sensing techniques for investigating aerosol optical depth is the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MISR). The MISR reanalysis is performed at the native horizontal resolution of 2°/3° longitude by 0.5° latitude and at 72 levels up to 0.01 hPa. The accuracy of MISR was investigated using mathematical experimentation. The spectral resolution of the green spectral band of the MISR corresponds to four bands (i.e., 1, 2, 3 and 6) on the MODIS. This occurrence affirms the band superposition theorem enacted in this research. This phenomenon is responsible for the inability of satellite or ground sensors to effectively measure the vertical distribution of aerosol. Five evidences of the superposition effect on satellite sensor adaptation were shown. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","","Aerosol optical depth; Band superposition; MISR; Nigeria; Spectral radiance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983587902"

In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) aerosol retrievals in desert regions of East Asia using ground-based observations over eight sites of the China Aerosol Remote Sensing Network (CARSNET). Different from their well-characterized performance in urban and cropland areas around the globe, DB aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals exhibit underestimation across the deserts in East Asia. We found that 38%–96% of satellite values fall out of an expected-error envelope of ±(0.05 + 20%AODCARSNET), with the worst performance in Taklimakan Desert. In particular, DB retrievals erroneously give a nearly constant low values of 0.05 in Taklimakan Desert when AOD is below 0.5, which does not match with variation of moderate dust plumes. Comparison with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer AOD shows that a similar underestimation is prevalent over the extensive deserts. Inversion of sky light measurements show that single scattering albedos of the yellow dust in East Asia are mostly below 0.9 at 440 nm, much lower than the “whiter” and “redder” dust models applied in the DB algorithm. On the other hand, overestimation of surface reflectance dominantly contributes to the significant low constant AOD values in MODIS DB retrievals in Taklimakan Desert. These large biases, however, can be substantially reduced by considering unique characteristics of aerosols and surface over the arid regions in East Asia. ©2017. American Geophysical Union.

The study of SMC quantitative inversion based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology has become the hot spot. Because of using statistical modeling methods and without considering soil bidirectional reflection characteristics, the SMC inversion accuracy and model applicable scope were limited. The purpose of this study was to use the soil radiation transfer model (SOILSPECT) to invert SMC in order to not only improve the SMC hyperspectral inversion accuracy, but also make the model applying widely. Taking the black soil and chernozem in Gongzhuling city of Jilin province as the study object, this paper conducted multi-angle spectrometry measurement for different SMC from 5% to 45% (5% interval) to get measured soil reflectance by using the ASD Fieldspec Pro spectrometer under the indoor condition. The influences of the light source zenith angle, observing zenith angle, azimuth angle and SMC on soil bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were analyzed. Then SOILSPECT model parameters were obtained by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method under the different SMC gradients, and SMC inversion by using SOILSPECT model was conducted. The results showed that soil BRDF declined with SMC rising in the range of 4001400 nm wavelength, when SMC was less than the field water holding capacity, and soil BRDF rose with SMC rising when SMC was larger than the field water holding capacity. In the range of 14002400nm wavelength and under different observing zenith angles, there was no rules for soil BRDF changing. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model was higher. R2 value was above 0.98 compared the estimated values with the measured values. The inversion accuracy for 15% and 30% of SMC were higher at every sensitive band, but that for other SMC was unsteadiness. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model increased with the decreasing of the observational zenith angle. The vertical observation can get the highest SMC inversion accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.","Distribution functions; Light sources; Moisture determination; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Reflection; Remote sensing; Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; BRDF; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral remote sensing technology; Particle swarm optimization method (PSO); Radiation transfer model; Reflection characteristics; Spectrometry measurements; Soil moisture","BRDF; hyperspectral inversion; soil moisture content; SOILSPECT model","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055869784"

Previously, it has been estimated based on the normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD), which is derived from multi-Angle remote sensing data. However, currently it is impossible to derive CI from NDHD for a large area at a spatial resolution finer than 275 m since such fine multi-Angle data are unavailable. In this study, an algorithm of the mixed-pixel clumping index (MPCI) was implemented, and an MPCI map of China's landmass at 1 km resolution was derived from the HJ-1A/1B data at 30 m resolution. The MPCI map was compared with the previous NDHD CI derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correlation of these two datasets was greater than 0.9, and the mean bias was approximately 0.1. Indirectly, the MPCI map was applied to an effective leaf area index (LAI) product to derive true LAI. Using the MODIS LAI product as a reference, we found that the coefficient of determination was improved from 0.72 to 0.80, and the root mean squared error was reduced from 0.53 to 0.35 m2/m2 after the effective LAI is corrected by this MPCI map, suggesting that this MPCI map is comparable to the NDHD CI. Although our algorithm is currently tested at 1 km resolution, potentially, it can be applied to higher spatial resolution than 275 m for mapping LAI and carbon cycle modeling before these multi-Angle data at higher resolution are available. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Image resolution; Mean square error; Pixels; Radiometers; Clumping index (CI); Coefficient of determination; evaluation; Leaf Area Index; Mixed pixel; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle remote sensing; Normalized difference between hotspot and darkspot (NDHD); algorithm; correlation; data set; leaf area index; modeling; MODIS; pixel; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Remote sensing","Clumping index (CI); evaluation; leaf area index (LAI); mixed pixel; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070532860"

To mitigate non-uniqueness, extra constraints (in addition to observations) are valuable for stabilizing the inversion process. This paper focuses on the imposition of an empirical correlation constraint on the retrieved aerosol parameters. This constraint reflects the empirical dependency between different aerosol parameters, thereby reducing the number of degrees of freedom and enabling accelerated computation of the radiation fields associated with neighboring pixels. A cross-pixel constraint that capitalizes on the smooth spatial variations of aerosol properties was built into the original multi-pixel inversion approach. Here, the spatial smoothness condition is imposed on principal components (PCs) of the aerosol model, and on the corresponding PC weights, where the PCs are used to characterize departures from the mean. Mutual orthogonality and unit length of the PC vectors, as well as zero sum of the PC weights also impose stabilizing constraints on the retrieval. Capitalizing on the dependencies among aerosol parameters and the mutual orthogonality of PCs, a perturbation-based radiative transfer computation scheme is developed. It uses a few dominant PCs to capture the difference in the radiation fields across an imaged area. The approach is tested using 27 observations acquired by the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) during multiple NASA field campaigns and validated using collocated AERONET observations. In particular, aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, aerosol size, and refractive index are compared with AERONET aerosol reference data. Retrieval uncertainty is formulated by accounting for both instrumental errors and the effects of multiple types of constraints. © 2019 by the authors.","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Microcomputers; NASA; Parameter estimation; Pixels; Polarimeters; Radiative transfer; Radiometry; Refractive index; Remote sensing; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol remote sensing; Aerosol retrieval algorithms; Correlated aerosol inversion; Empirical correlations; Multi-angle; Number of degrees of freedom; Single scattering albedo; Aerosols","Correlated aerosol inversion; Multiangle radiometry; Polarimetry; Radiative transfer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062283933"

Vulnerability research has become the basis for assessing states of development and the criteria for measuring future development plans. This study used previous reports on vulnerability research from China and the rest of the world to review the origin and development of the concept of vulnerability, and the qualitative and quantitative methods for vulnerability assessment. Furthermore, this study scientifically reviewed recent progress in vulnerability research since the beginning of the 21st century, by assessing current evaluation methods, the influence of human activities, multi-scale fine evaluation, multi-source data mining, and the key elements threshold definition. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanism underlying vulnerability evolution was also undertaken. The study found that vulnerabilities research has progressed rapidly since the beginning of the 21st century and that the main features are diversification, multiple angles, refinement, and synthesis. Progress in these areas has led to method and data diversification; multi-angle analyses of transverse spatial correlation and longitudinal time series; multi-scale fine evaluation; and research on the key factor threshold and the mechanism that drives the development of vulnerability. Future studies should effectively strengthen the basic theory and vulnerability mechanism, investigate the processes and mechanisms underlying coupled systems, explore evolutionary mechanisms for vulnerability, scientifically define the thresholds for key elements of system vulnerability, and extract information from multi-source remote sensing data. In addition, vulnerability research should aim to carry out a dynamic evaluation of system vulnerability and use space-time analysis to quantitatively evaluate vulnerability and current comprehensive practice.

We use a multi-angle remote sensing approach to determine changes in vegetation structure from differences in directional scattering (anisotropy) observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with data atmospherically corrected by the Multi-Angle Implementation Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC). Our results show a strong linear relationship between anisotropy and field (r2=0.70) and LiDAR (r2=0.88) based estimates of LAI even in dense canopies (LAI≤7m2m-2). This allowed us to obtain improved estimates of vegetation structure from optical remote sensing. We used anisotropy to analyze Amazon seasonality based on spatially explicit estimates of onset and length of dry season obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). An increase in vegetation greening was observed during the beginning of dry season (across ~7% of the basin), which was followed by a decline (browning) later during the dry season (across ~5% of the basin). Anomalies in vegetation browning were particularly strong during the 2005 and 2010 drought years (~10% of the basin). We show that the magnitude of seasonal changes can be significantly affected by regional differences in onset and duration of the dry season. Seasonal changes were much less pronounced when assuming a fixed dry season from June through September across the Amazon Basin. Our findings reconcile remote sensing studies with field based observations and model results as they provide a sounder basis for the argument that tropical vegetation growth increases during the beginning of the dry season, but declines after extended drought periods. The multi-angle approach used in this work may help quantify drought tolerance and seasonality in the Amazonian forests. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Amazon Basin; Amazonia; Agronomy; Anisotropy; Atmospheric structure; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Optical radar; Radiometers; Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Tropics; Vegetation; Amazon; Browning; Greening; MAIAC; MODIS; algorithm; anisotropy; atmospheric correction; drought; forest canopy; leaf area index; MODIS; rainforest; remote sensing; seasonality; TRMM; vegetation structure; Drought","Amazon; Anisotropy; Browning; Drought; Greening; MAIAC; MODIS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946413427"

In the 21st century, three droughts have already occurred in the Amazonia (e.g. 2005, 2010, 2015), inducing regional changes in the seasonal patterns of atmospheric constituents. In addition to climate, the atmospheric dynamic and attenuation properties are long-term challenges for satellite-based remote sensing of this ecosystem: high cloudiness, abundant water vapor content and biomass burning season. Therefore, while climatology analysis supports the understanding of atmospheric variability and trends, it also offers valuable insights for remote sensing applications. In this study, we evaluate the seasonal and interannual variability of cloud cover and atmospheric constituents (aerosol loading, water vapor and ozone content) over the Amazon basin, with focus on both climate analysis and remote sensing implications. We take the advantage of new atmosphere daily products at 1 km resolution derived from Multi-Angle Implementation for Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm developed for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. An intercomparison of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and MAIAC aerosol optical depth (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV) showed quantitative information with a correlation coefficient higher than 0.81. Our results show distinct regional patterns of cloud cover across the Amazon basin: northwestern region presets a persistent cloud cover (>80%) throughout the year, while low cloud cover (0–20%) occurs in the southern Amazon during the dry season. The cloud-free period in the southern Amazon is followed by an increase in the atmospheric burden due to fire emissions. Our results reveal that AOD records are changing in terms of area and intensity. During the 2005 and 2010 droughts, the positive AOD anomalies (δ > 0.1) occurred over 39.03% (240.3 million ha) and 27.14% (165.99 million ha) of total basin in the SON season, respectively. In contrast, the recent 2015 drought occurred towards the end of year (October through December) and these anomalies were observed over 23.72% (145 million ha) affecting areas in the central and eastern Amazon – unlike previous droughts. The water vapor presents high concentration values (4.0–5.0 g cm−2) in the wet season (DJF), while we observed a strong spatial gradient from northwestern to southeastern of the basin during the dry season. In addition, we also found a positive trend of water vapor content (∼0.3 g/cm2) between 2000 and 2015. The total ozone typically varies between 220 and 270 DU, and it has a seasonal change of ∼25–35 DU from wet season to dry season caused by large emissions of ozone precursors and long-range transport. Finally, while this study contributes to climatological analysis of atmospheric constituents, the remote sensing users can also understand the regional constraints caused by atmospheric attenuation, such as high aerosol loading and cloud obstacles for surface observations. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To deepen our understanding of the light reflected from vegetation, we present results of photopolarimetric laboratory measurements from single leaf and two vegetation covers (planophile and erectophile) over a wide range of viewing directions. The bidirectional polarized reflectance factor (BPRF) was used to characterize the polarization property of our samples. We observed positive and negative polarization (−BPRFQ) of all samples in the forward scattering and backward scattering directions, respectively. Based on the comparison of the BPRF among single leaf, planophile vegetation and erectophile vegetation, our measurements demonstrate that the orientation of the leaf is a key factor in describing the amount of polarization in the forward scattering direction. Our measurements also validated certain model results stating that (1) specular reflection generates a portion of polarization in the forward scattering direction and diffuses scattering of polarized light in all hemisphere directions, (2) BPRFU is anti-symmetric in the principal plane from a recent study in which the authors simulated the polarized reflectance of vegetation cover using the vector radiative transfer theory.

In this study we derived a new empirical relationship that binds OA single scattering albedo (SSA), which is the ratio of light scattering to extinction, with sulfate + nitrate aerosol optical depth (AOD) and applied this method to estimate OA SSA over the tropical biomass burning regions. This method includes division of the attribution of black carbon (BC) and OA absorption aerosol optical depths from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observation and determination of the fine-mode ratio of sea-salt and dust AODs from several atmospheric chemistry models. Our best estimate of OA SSA over the tropical biomass burning regions is 0.91 at 550 nm. Uncertainties associated with observations and models permit a value range of 0.82–0.93. Furthermore, by using the estimated OA SSA and comprehensive observations including AERONET, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), we examined the first global estimate of sulfate + nitrate AOD through a semi-observational approach. The global mean sulfate + nitrate AOD of 0.017 is in the lower range of the values obtained from 21 models participated in AeroCom phase II. The results imply that most aerosol models as well as climate models, which commonly use OA SSA of 0.96–1.0, have so far ignored light absorption by OAs and have overestimated light scattering by sulfate + nitrate aerosols. This indicates that the actual aerosol direct radiative forcing should be less negative than currently believed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric radiation; Biomass; Budget control; Climate models; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Image reconstruction; Light absorption; Light scattering; Nitrates; Optical properties; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Solar radiation; Spectrometers; Sulfur compounds; Tropics; black carbon; nitrate; sulfate; Aerosol direct radiative forcing; Aerosol light absorption; Atmospheric chemistry model; Brown carbons; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Organic aerosol; Sulfate; absorption spectrum; AERONET; aerosol; albedo; biomass burning; black carbon; brown carbon; MISR; MODIS; nitrate; optical depth; organic matter; quantitative analysis; radiative forcing; sulfate; tropical environment; albedo; Article; biomass; light absorption; light scattering; optical depth; priority journal; radiative forcing; remote sensing; secondary organic aerosol; simulation; Aerosols","Aerosol light absorption; Brown carbon; Nitrate; Organic aerosol; Sulfate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989282232"

Assessing the uncertainties associated with these LAI products is essential for their proper application. In validation activities, LAI reference maps serve as the bridge to upscale the field measurements to coarse resolution. Currently, the temporally continuous validation is attracting increasing attention. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for the temporally continuous LAI reference maps. However, two main problems hinder the generation of temporally continuous LAI reference maps: 1) How to obtain temporally continuous field measurements, effectively and inexpensively? 2) How to obtain temporally continuous and fine spatial resolution satellite images which are synchronous with the field measurements? This paper proposed a method to address the above two problems based on the combination of the wireless sensor network technology and a data blending approach. Firstly, the temporally continuous effective LAI was obtained through the analysis of multi-angle gap fraction measured by LAINet observation system (developed with wireless sensor network technology), and the temporally continuous NDVI was reconstructed through CACAO (Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations, a data blending approach). Then, a transfer function relating reconstructed NDVI to field measured LAI was calibrated through exponential function fitting. Finally, the temporally continuous LAI reference maps were generated by applying the calibrated transfer function to the reconstructed NDVI. Performances of the proposed method were evaluated over a crop site. Results show that the reconstructed LAI reference maps agree well with the original LAI reference maps derived from the Landsat-8 OLI NDVI (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.27 at 30 m resolution, R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.09 at 1 km resolution). The derived temporally continuous LAI reference maps were then used as benchmark to validate the MOD15A2 LAI product. Generally, the MOD15A2 LAI has a relatively high accuracy (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.31), and captures the overall vegetation phenology well. But its value shows an obvious underestimation with a bias of −0.30. The results of this study contribute to the assessment of temporal dynamics of uncertainty in LAI products, which will benefit the long-term vegetation monitoring and data assimilation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","data assimilation; land surface; Landsat; leaf area index; map; model validation; MODIS; NDVI; observational method; phenology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; transfer function","Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO); LAINet observation system; Leaf area index (LAI); Temporal continuity; Validation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000631005"

Studies show that BRDF sampling has a significant effect on parameter inversion such as albedo. However, BRDF samplings are complex, and only specific samplings were considered in previous studies. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of BRDF sampling to albedo and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index based on the kernel-driven Ross-Li BRDF model. Albedo and NDHD calculated by a set of dense sampling airborne data were used as the reference data, and inversion results from many sparse samplings were compared to the reference results. The result shows the overall number, plane, range and symmetry in observing condition of BRDF sampling can affect albedo and NDHD estimation.

Extending such observations to regional or global scales requires new remote sensing approaches, such as retrievals that make use of spectropolarimetric, multiangle imaging. In this work measurements made during the Imaging Polarimetric Assessment and Characterization of Tropospheric Particulate Matter (ImPACT-PM) field campaign in a smoke plume near the town of Lebec in Southern California by the Navy Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies Twin Otter aircraft on 8 July 2016 are used in conjunction with near-coincident measurements from the Airborne Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (AirMSPI) on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft to assess the sensitivity of spectropolarimetric measurements to the black carbon content of the plume. Tracking visible features in the smoke through the sequence of AirMSPI observations allowed the height of the plume to be estimated through geometric techniques. Then, by constraining the fractional amounts of the aerosol constituents with the in situ data, radiative closure was obtained through simulations performed with a polarimetric radiative transfer code, demonstrating the ability to constrain the black carbon mass fraction to approximately 5%, given the uncertainties in the AirMSPI measurements and the assumption of external mixing of aerosol components. The AirMSPI retrieval, made using a limited set of observations from the 470 nm polarimetric spectral band alone, was also generally consistent with operational retrievals of aerosol optical depth and surface reflectance made by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm at 1 km resolution. ©2018.

SPEXone will provide accurate atmospheric aerosol characterization from space for climate research, as well as for light path correction in support of the main Ocean Color Instrument. SPEXone employs dual beam spectral polarization modulation, in which the state of linear polarization is encoded in a spectrum as a periodic variation of the intensity. This technique enables high polarimetric accuracies in operational environments, since it provides snapshot acquisition of both radiance and polarization without moving parts. This paper presents the polarimetric error analysis and budget for SPEXone in terms of polarimetric precision and polarimetric accuracy. We consider factors that contribute to instrumental polarization and modulation efficiency, which will be calibrated on-ground with high, but finite accuracy. The sensitivity to dynamic systematic effects in a space environment, such as degradation and ageing of components and small variations in the temperature and thermal gradients is addressed and quantified. Finally, the impact of scene dependent error sources, mainly resulting from stray light, are assessed and the total polarimetric error budget is presented. We show that SPEXone complies with the radiometric SNR requirement of 300, yielding a minimum polarimetric precision of 200 (fully polarized light) to 300 (unpolarized light) over the full spectral range for dark ocean scenes at high solar zenith angle. Assuming a stray light correction factor of 5 and considering a moderate contrast scene, the expected in-flight polarimetric accuracy of SPEXone is 1.5 · 10-3 for unpolarized scenes and 2.9 · 10-3 for highly polarized scenes, compliant with the polarimetric accuracy requirement. This performance should enable SPEXone to deliver the data quality that enables unprecedented aerosol characterization from space on the NASA PACE mission. © 2019 SPIE.","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Budget control; Error analysis; Modulation; NASA; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Space optics; Stray light; Multi angle; PACE; Spectral modulation; Spectropolarimetry; SPEXone; Polarimeters","atmospheric aerosol; multi-angle; PACE; remote sensing; spectral modulation; spectropolarimetry; SPEXone","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076578443"

Satellite remote sensing provides the most efficient means to observe phenological events through time series analysis of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This study investigates the potential of a Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), which has been linked to vegetation light use efficiency, to improve the accuracy of MODIS-based estimates of phenology in an evergreen conifer forest. Timings of the start and end of the growing season (SGS and EGS) were derived from a 13-year-long time series of PRI and NDVI based on a MAIAC (multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction) processed MODIS dataset and standard MODIS NDVI product data. The derived dates were validated with phenology estimates from ground-based flux tower measurements of ecosystem productivity. Significant correlations were found between the MAIAC time series and ground-estimated SGS (R2 = 0.36-0.8), which is remarkable since previous studies have found it difficult to observe inter-annual phenological variations in evergreen vegetation from satellite data. The considerably noisier NDVI product could not accurately predict SGS, and EGS could not be derived successfully from any of the time series. While the strongest relationship overall was found between SGS derived from the ground data and PRI, MAIAC NDVI exhibited high correlations with SGS more consistently (R2 > 0.6 in all cases). The results suggest that PRI can serve as an effective indicator of spring seasonal transitions, however, additional work is necessary to confirm the relationships observed and to further explore the usefulness of MODIS PRI for detecting phenology. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Biology; Climate change; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Harmonic analysis; Productivity; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Ecosystem productivity; MODIS; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenology; Photochemical reflectance index; Time series analysis","Ecosystem productivity; MODIS; Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Phenology; Photochemical reflectance index (PRI); Time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010660402"

Remote sensing approaches, in particular multi-angular spectroscopy, have proven successful for studying relationships between canopy-reflectance and plant-physiology processes, thus providing a mechanism to scale up. However, many different instrumentation designs exist and few cross-comparisons have been undertaken. This paper discusses the design evolution of the Automated Multiangular SPectro-radiometer for Estimation of Canopy reflectance (AMSPEC) series of instruments. Specifically, we assess the performance of the PP-Systems Unispec-DC and Ocean Optics JAZ-COMBO spectro-radiometers installed on an updated, tower-based AMSPEC-III system. We demonstrate the interoperability of these spectro-radiometers, and the results obtained suggest that JAZ-COMBO can successfully be used to substitute more expensive measurement units for detecting and investigating photosynthesis and canopy spectra. We demonstrate close correlations between JAZ-COMBO and Unispec-DC measured canopy radiance (0.75 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.85) and solar irradiance (0.95 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.96) over a three month time span. We also demonstrate close agreement between the bi-directional distribution functions obtained from each instrument. We conclude that cost effective alternatives may allow a network of AMSPEC-III systems to simultaneously monitor various vegetation types in different ecosystems. This will allow to scale and improve our understanding of the interactions between vegetation physiology and spectral characteristics, calibrate broad-scale observations to stand-level measurements, and ultimately lead to improved understanding of changing vegetation spectral features from satellite. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Remote Sensing Technology; Carbon; Colorimetric analysis; Cost effectiveness; Distribution functions; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Radiometers; Reflection; Units of measurement; Vegetation; Gross primary production; Light use efficiency; Multi angle; PRI; Spectro-radiometers; environmental monitoring; forest; image processing; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; procedures; remote sensing; Remote sensing","Gross primary production; Light use efficiency; Multi-angle spectroscopy; Photosynthesis; PRI; Remote sensing; Spectro-radiometer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84950122093"

Here we develop and explore a ray casting algorithm applied to data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) onboard the Terra satellite, in order to reconstruct 3-D cloud volumes of observed clouds. The ray casting algorithm is first applied to geometrically simple synthetic clouds to show that, under the assumption of perfect, clear-conservative cloud masks, the reconstruction method yields overestimation in the volume whose magnitude depends on the cloud geometry and the resolution of the reconstruction grid relative to the image pixel resolution. The method is then applied to two hand-picked MISR scenes, fully accounting for MISR's viewing geometry for reconstructions over the Earth's ellipsoidal surface. The MISR Radiometric Camera-by-camera Cloud Mask (RCCM) at 1.1-km resolution and the custom cloud mask at 275-m resolution independently derived from MISR's red, green, and blue channels are used as input cloud masks. A wind correction method, termed cloud spreading, is applied to the cloud masks to offset potential cloud movements over short time intervals between the camera views of a scene. The MISR cloud-top height product is used as a constraint to reduce the overestimation at the cloud top. The results for the two selected scenes show that the wind correction using the cloud spreading method increases the reconstructed volume up to 4.7 times greater than without the wind correction, and that the reconstructed volume generated from the RCCM is up to 3.5 times greater than that from the higher-resolution custom cloud mask. Recommendations for improving the presented cloud volume reconstructions, as well as possible future passive remote sensing satellite missions, are discussed. © 2018 by the authors.","Cameras; Geometry; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Rendering (computer graphics); Repair; Spectrometers; Volume measurement; Cloud geometry; MISR; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Passive remote sensing; Ray casting algorithm; Reconstruction method; Short time intervals; Volume reconstruction; Green computing","Cloud boundary; Cloud geometry; Cloud shape; Cloud volume; Cloud volume reconstruction; MISR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057081202"

This paper was based on multi-sensor remote sensing image data and employs several landscape metrics and the centroid shift model to conduct a multi-angle quantitative analysis on urban expansion in Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan (Jing-Jin-Tang) in the period from 1970-2013. In addition, the impact analysis of urban growth on land use was adopted in this research. The results showed that Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan all experienced rapid urbanization, with an average annual urban growth rate of 7.28%, 3.9%, and 0.97%, respectively. Beijing has especially presented a single choropleth map pattern, whereas Tianjin and Tangshan have presented a double surface network pattern in orientation analysis. Furthermore, urban expansion in Beijing was mainly concentrated in Ring 4 to Ring 6 in the northwest and southeast directions, whereas the major expansion was observed in the southeast in Tianjin, primarily affected by dramatic development of Binhai New Area and Tianjin South Railway Station. Naturally, the urban expansion in Tangshan was significantly influenced by the expansion of Beijing and was primarily southwestward. The hot-zones of urbanization were observed within the ranges of 7-25 km, 6-18 km, and 0-15 km, accounting for 93.49%, 89.44% and 72.44% of the total expansion area in Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan, respectively.

Previously, several BRDF archetypes were distilled from high-quality MODIS BRDF/Albedo products. In this study, we propose a method that largely relies on matching observed multiangular reflectances with the most appropriate of these prior BRDF archetypes to determine the amplitude and shape of the actual surface BRDFs, when directional signatures are insufficient. This method is first evaluated using an assortment of multisource BRDF data sets to demonstrate its viability for surface albedo estimates, and then is applied to airborne wide-angle infrared dual-mode line/area array scanner (WIDAS) from the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER) campaign in the Heihe River Basin of China in 2008. This algorithm makes use of the linear MODIS BRDF model to determine the BRDF archetypes needed as prior knowledge for intrinsic spectral albedo estimates. The intrinsic spectral albedos are then used to estimate actual spectral albedos by considering the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation. A spectral-to-broadband conversion is performed to generate the broadband albedo at shortwave regimes through the use of conversion coefficients derived from extensive radiative transfer simulations. A further validation confirms that the estimated albedos are consistent with in situ field measured albedos over available corn crop sites. This method provides a major advantage on utilizing generalized BRDF information derived from MODIS in conjunction with other instrument data that are acquired with less angular variation. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","China; Gansu; Heihe Basin; Zea mays; Algorithms; Budget control; Distribution functions; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Scanning; Surface measurement; anisotropic flat index (AFX); Bidirectional reflectance distribution functions; BRDF archetypes; Dual modes; EOS land validation core sites; inversion; Linear modeling; MODIS; Multi-angle remote sensing; Prior knowledge; Surface albedo; airborne survey; albedo; algorithm; data acquisition; in situ measurement; observational method; radiation balance; radiative transfer; Solar radiation","Airborne wide-angle infrared dual-mode line/area array scanner (WIDAS); anisotropic flat index (AFX); bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF); BRDF archetypes; EOS land validation core sites; inversion; linear model; MODIS; multiangle remote sensing; prior knowledge; surface albedo; WATER campaign","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027927612"

Spectral neutrality of the polarized surface reflectance over visible to short-wavelength infrared bands is verified, and the 1640-nm measurements corrected for atmospheric effects are used to estimate the polarized surface reflectance at shorter wavelengths. The AMPR measurements over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in north China reveal that the polarized surface reflectance of 670, 865 and 1640 nm are highly correlated with correlation slopes close to one (0.985 and 1.03) when the scattering angle is less than 145°. The 1640-nm measurements are then employed to estimate polarized surface reflectance at shorter wavelengths for each single viewing direction, which are then used to improve the retrieval of AOD over land. The comparison between AMPR retrievals and ground-based Sun-sky radiometer measurements during three experimental flights illustrates that this approach retrieves AOD at 865 nm with uncertainties ranging from 0.01 to 0.06, while AOD varies from 0.05 to 0.17. © 2015 by the authors.","Aerosols; Algorithms; Atmospheric aerosols; Infrared radiation; Optical properties; Polarimeters; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Table lookup; 1640 nm; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol retrieval algorithms; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Multi angle; Polarimetric measurements; Short-wavelength infrared; Surface reflectance; Uncertainty analysis","1640 nm; Aerosol optical depth (AOD); Airborne Advanced Multi-angle Polarized Radiometer (AMPR); Polarized surface reflectance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930036082"

The Spectral Invariance Hypothesis asserts that the magnitude and shape of the polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) is equal for all wavelengths. In order to test this hypothesis, JPL's Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) is used to measure polarization information of different outdoor surface types. GroundMSPI measures the linear polarization Stokes parameters (I, Q, U), at three wavelengths, 470 nm, 660 nm, and 865 nm. The camera is mounted on a two-Axis gimbal to accurately select the view azimuth and elevation directions. On clear sky days we acquired day-long scans of scenes that contain various surface types such as grass, dirt, cement, brick, and asphalt and placed a Spectralon panel in the camera field of view to provide a reflectance reference. Over the course of each day, changing solar position in the sky provides a large range of scattering angles for this study. The polarized bidirectional reflectance factor (pBRF) is measured for the three wavelengths and the best fit slope of the spectral correlation is reported. This work reports the range of best fit slopes measured for five region types. © 2015 SPIE.","Cameras; Polarization; Reflection; Land surface; Multi-angle; pBRDF; pBRF; Spectral invariances; spectrally neutral; Remote sensing","land surface reectance; Multiangle Spec-TroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI); pBRDF; pBRF; spectral invariance; spectrally neutral","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960846080"

Our ability to project the role of vegetation carbon feedbacks on future climate critically depends upon our understanding of this tropical ecosystem, its tolerance to climate extremes and tipping points of ecosystem collapse. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to obtain observational evidence of trends and changes across large regions of the Amazon forest; however, inferring these trends in the presence of high cloud cover fraction and aerosol concentrations has led to widely varying conclusions. Our study provides a simple and direct statistical analysis of a measurable change in daily and composite surface reflectance obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based on the noise level of data and the number of available observations. Depending on time frame and data product chosen for analysis, changes in leaf area need to exceed up to 2 units leaf area per unit ground area (expressed as m2m-2) across much of the basin before these changes can be detected at a 95% confidence level with conventional approaches, roughly corresponding to a change in NDVI and EVI of about 25%. A potential way forward may be provided by advanced multi-angular techniques, such as the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC), which allowed detection of changes of about 0.6-0.8units in leaf area (2-6% change in NDVI) at the same confidence level. In our analysis, the use of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) did not improve accuracy of detectable change in leaf area but added a complicating sensitivity to the bi-directional reflectance, or view geometry effects. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Amazonia; Carbon; Earth (planet); Ecology; Ecosystems; Image reconstruction; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Amazon; MAIAC; MOD09; MODIS; Vegetation change; accuracy assessment; algorithm; biodiversity; carbon flux; cloud cover; energy flux; measurement method; MODIS; NDVI; rainforest; satellite data; satellite imagery; sensitivity analysis; surface reflectance; tropical environment; vegetation structure; Sensitivity analysis","Amazon; MAIAC; MOD09; MODIS; Sensitivity analysis; Vegetation change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937966430"

Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) in its geographic information system (GIS) dictionary denes remote sensing as “collecting and interpreting information about the environment and the surface of the earth from a distance, primarily by sensing radiation that is naturally emitted or reaected by the earth's surface or from the atmosphere, or by sending signals transmitted from a device and re-ected back to it (ESRI, 2014).” Ye usual source of passive remote sensing data is the measurement of re-ected, or transmitted electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from the sun across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS); this can also include acoustic or sound energy, gravity, or the magnetic eld from or of the objects under consideration. In this context, the simple act of reading this text is considered remote sensing. In this case, the eye acts as a sensor and senses the light re-ected from the object to obtain information about the object. It is the same technology used by a handheld camera to take a photograph of a person or a distant scenic view. Active remote sensing, however, involves sending a pulse of energy and then measuring the returned energy through a sensor (e.g., Radio Detection and Ranging [RADAR], Light Detection and Ranging [LiDAR]). Yermal sensors measure emitted energy by dierent objects. Yus, in general, passive remote sensing involves the measurement of solar energy re-ected from the Earth's surface, while active remote sensing involves synthetic (man-made) energy pulsed at the environment and the return signals are measured and recorded. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Air navigation; Aircraft detection; Altitude control; Antenna arrays; Atmospheric temperature; Band structure; Broadcasting; Climatology; Color photography; Communication satellites; Control system synthesis; Digital radio; Electromagnetic waves; Electronic document exchange; Geodetic satellites; Green computing; Image enhancement; Image recording; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Marine communication; Marine navigation; Marine radar; Mass spectrometers; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Mobile antennas; Multispectral scanners; NASA; Oceanography; Optical radar; Orbits; Planetary surface analysis; Public administration; Quality control; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Radio navigation; Radiometers; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Satellite imagery; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Solar energy; Space flight; Space optics; Surface topography; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Underwater acoustics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Water quality; Weather satellites; Environmental systems research institutes; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis; National center for atmospheric researches; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National polar orbiting environmental satellite systems; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager; Space-based radar","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032662433"

While most previous studies have focused on establishing relationships between collocated, hourly or daily AOD and PM2.5 measurements, in this study, we instead focus on the comparison of the large-scale spatial and temporal variability between satellite AOD and PM2.5 using monthly mean measurements. A newly developed spectral analysis technique - Combined Maximum Covariance Analysis (CMCA) is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) AOD datasets and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) PM2.5 data, in order to extract and compare the dominant modes of variability. Results indicate that AOD and PM2.5 agree well in terms of interannual variability. An overall decrease is found in both AOD and PM2.5 across the United States, with the strongest signal over the eastern US. With respect to seasonality, good agreement is found only for Eastern US, while for Central and Western US, AOD and PM2.5 seasonal cycles are largely different or even reversed. These results are verified using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD observations and differences between satellite and AERONET are also examined. MODIS and MISR appear to have the best agreement with AERONET. In order to explain the disagreement between AOD and PM2.5 seasonality, we further use Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) extinction profile data to investigate the effect of two possible contributing factors, namely aerosol vertical distribution and cloud-free sampling. We find that seasonal changes in aerosol vertical distribution, due to the seasonally varying mixing height, is the primary cause for the AOD and PM2.5 seasonal discrepancy, in particular, the low AOD but high PM2.5 observed during the winter season for Central and Western US. In addition, cloud-free sampling by passive sensors also induces some bias in AOD seasonality, especially for the Western US, where the largest seasonal change in cloud fraction is found. The seasonal agreement between low level (below 500m AGL), all sky CALIOP AOD and PM2.5 is significantly better than column AOD from MODIS, MISR, SeaWiFS and OMI. In particular, the correlation between low level, all sky AOD and PM2.5 seasonal cycles increases to above 0.7 for Central and Western US, as opposed to near zero or negative correlation for column, clear sky AOD. This result highlights the importance of accounting for the seasonally varying aerosol profiles and cloud-free sampling bias when using column AOD measurements to infer surface PM2.5 concentrations. © 2014 The Authors.","United States; Band structure; Environmental Protection Agency; Imaging techniques; Importance sampling; Optical properties; Optical radar; Principal component analysis; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectrum analysis; Ultraviolet spectrometers; ozone; Aerosol optical depths; Cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarizations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite remote sensing; Sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensors; Spatial and temporal variability; Spectral analysis techniques; concentration (composition); lidar; MODIS; observational method; particulate matter; principal component analysis; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air quality; Article; cloud; particulate matter; seasonal variation; spectroscopy; summer; time series analysis; United States; winter; Aerosols","Aerosol optical depth; PM<sub>2</sub>; Principal component analysis; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial and temporal variability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84916883351"

The role of clouds in determining climate sensitivity to change is highly uncertain, in particular due to their multiple and complex interactions with aerosols. Hence new cloud observation systems (ground-based and space-borne) are needed for cloud monitoring. The purpose of the 3MI is to provide multi-spectral (from 410 to 2130 nm), multi-polarisation (-60°, 0°, and +60°), and multi-Angular (10 to 14 views) images of the Earth top of atmosphere (TOA) outgoing radiances. First results from the 3MI synthetic data simulator will be presented. Although aerosol and cloud characterisation is the primary application, 3MI will further support observation of landsurface characteristics which will benefit from the enhanced directional and polarisation measurements and provide a better understanding of the Earth radiation budget. 3MI will also benefit from the synergy of other instruments flying onboard EPS-SG. Measurements from thermal infrared channels will be available from the METimage and IASI-NG instruments. Furthermore, the Sentinel-5 will provide information from the ultra-violet to the shortwave infrared, at a coarser horizontal sampling. The synergy with these instruments will also support 3MI with beneficial cross-calibration as 3MI will not have an onboard calibration and its radiometric performance will rely on vicarious calibration. © 2015 SPIE.","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Budget control; Calibration; Climate change; Earth atmosphere; Polarization; Remote sensing; Space optics; Aerosol remote sensing; Climate monitoring; Land surface characteristics; Multi angle; Multi-spectral; Numerical weather prediction; Weather forecasting","3MI; air quality; atmospheric composition; climate monitoring; cloud and aerosol remote sensing; land-surface characteristics; multi-Angle; multi-polarisation; multi-spectral; numerical weather prediction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960906427"

It is a key structural parameter of plant canopies that influences canopy radiation regimes and controls canopy photosynthesis and other land-atmosphere interactions. The Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) index has been previously used to retrieve global clumping index maps from POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) data at ~6. km resolution and the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 500. m resolution. Most recently the algorithm was also applied with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) data at 275. m resolution over selected areas. In this study for the first time we characterized and compared the three products over a set of sites representing diverse biomes and different canopy structures. The products were also directly validated with both in-situ vertical profiles and available seasonal trajectories of clumping index over several sites. We demonstrated that the vertical distribution of foliage and especially the effect of understory need to be taken into account while validating foliage clumping products from remote sensing products with values measured in the field. Satellite measurements responded to the structural effects near the top of canopies, while ground measurements may be biased by the lower vegetation layers. Additionally, caution should be taken regarding the misclassification in land cover maps as their errors can propagate into the foliage clumping maps. Our results indicate that MODIS data and MISR data, with 275. m in particular, can provide good quality clumping index estimates at spatial scales pertinent for modeling local carbon and energy fluxes. © 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

By Mie theory, their extinction, scattering phase function, polarized phase function are calculated, and for water soluble particle, these parameters are calculated in different relative humidities (RHs). Then, multi-angle intensity and polarized signals, which are received by the satellite, are simulated for these haze components by RT3 (radiative transfer 3). The results show that scalar signal intensities of WASO and SubM are larger than others in most satelite observation angles, while polarized signal intensities of BC and WASO are obviously larger than the others. As the increasing of RH, the extinction of WASO will increase while scattering and polarized phase function will decrease entirely, and the main reason is the hygroscopic growth of particle radius. So, for remote sensing inversion of haze, multi-angle polarized measurements will be assisted by multi-angle intensity measurements. ï¿½, 2015, Chinese Optical Society.

Currently, the most widely-used model to achieve forest canopy structure parameters is the Li-Strahler geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance model, by considering the effect of crown shape and mutual shadowing, which is referred to as the GOMS model. However, it is difficult to retrieve LAI through the GOMS model directly because LAI is not a fundamental parameter of the model. In this study, a gap probability model was used to obtain the relationship between the canopy structure parameter nR2 and LAI. Thus, LAI was introduced into the GOMS model as an independent variable by replacing nR2 The modified GOMS (MGOMS) model was validated by application to Dayekou in the Heihe River Basin of China. The LAI retrieved using the MGOMS model with optical multi-angle remote sensing data, high spatial resolution images and field-measured data was in good agreement with the field-measured LAI, with an R-square (R2) of 0.64, and an RMSE of 0.67.

If a cloud screening is applied that is not strict enough, the ground scene has the probability of residual cloud cover which causes large errors on the retrieved aerosol parameters. On the other hand, if the cloud-screening procedure is too strict, too many clear sky cases, especially near-cloud scenes, will falsely be flagged cloudy. The detrimental effects of cloud contamination as well as the importance of aerosol cloud interactions that can be studied in these near-cloud scenes call for new approaches to cloud screening. Multi-angle multi-wavelength photopolarimetric measurements have a unique capability to distinguish between scattering by (liquid) cloud droplets and aerosol particles. In this paper the sensitivity of aerosol retrievals from multi-angle photopolarimetric measurements to cloud contamination is investigated and the ability to intrinsically filter the cloud-contaminated scenes based on a goodness-of-fit criteria is evaluated. Hereto, an aerosol retrieval algorithm is applied to a partially clouded over-ocean synthetic data set as well as non-cloud-screened over-ocean POLDER-3/PARASOL observations. It is found that a goodness-of-fit filter, together with a filter on the coarse mode refractive index ( > 1.335) and a cirrus screening, adequately rejects the cloud-contaminated scenes. No bias or larger SD are found in the retrieved parameters for this intrinsic cloud filter compared to the parameters retrieved in a priori cloud-screened data set (using MODIS/AQUA cloud masks) of PARASOL observations. Moreover, less high-aerosol load scenes are misinterpreted as cloud contaminated. The retrieved aerosol optical thickness, single scattering albedo and Ångström exponent show good agreement with AERONET observations. Furthermore, the synthetic retrievals give confidence in the ability of the algorithm to correctly retrieve the micro-physical aerosol parameters. © 2015 Author(s).","AERONET; aerosol; albedo; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); clear sky; cloud cover; cloud droplet; data set; error analysis; measurement method; MODIS; PARASOL; POLDER; refractive index; sensitivity analysis; wavelength","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925002714"

However, due to the ground sample spacing and spatial footprint of the detection, the different sizes of footprints cannot guarantee the spatial matching of some partly overlap pixels, which turn into a bottleneck for the effective use of the multi-angular detected information of AMPR to study the aerosol and surface polarized properties. Based on our definition and calculation of t he pixel coincidence rate for the multi-angular detection, an effective multi-angle observation's pixel matching method is presented to solve the spatial matching problem for airborne AMPR. Assuming the shape of AMPR's each pixel is an ellipse, and the major axis and minor axis depends on the flying attitude and each scanning angle. By the definition of coordinate system and origin of coordinate, the latitude and longitude could be transformed into the Euclidian distance, and the pixel coincidence rate of two nearby ellipses could be calculated. Via the traversal of each ground pixel, those pixels with high coincidence rate could be selected and merged, and with the further quality control of observation data, thus the ground pixels dataset with multi-angular detection could be obtained and analyzed, providing the support for the multi-angular and polarized retrieval algorithm research in t he next study. © 2015 SPIE.","Image analysis; Image matching; Image processing; Optical data processing; Quality control; Remote sensing; Scanning; Aerial remote sensing; along-track observation; AMPR; Co-ordinate system; Euclidian distance; Multi-angle observations; Pixel matching; Retrieval algorithms; Pixels","aerial remote sensing; along-track observation; AMPR; elliptical pixel; multi-angular pixel matching","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963509919"

This involves a retrieval process that uses a radiative transfer model to relate satellite-observed radiances to geophysical variables such as soil dielectric constant and soil moisture. The L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) based retrieval products of SMOS have previously been evaluated to show reasonably good agreement with ground measurements. An alternative product is based on the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), which has been adapted for a wide range of X- and C-band sensors to retrieve soil moisture from single-angle observations. From the implementation viewpoint, LPRM is attractive in its limited requirements for additional auxiliary parameters and in its simple geophysical parameterization. The research gaps lie in the limited previous study on retrieving SMOS multi-angular observations using LPRM. The development of a LRPM-retrieved SMOS product is also motivated by establishing an algorithmic consistency across multiple C-, X- and L-band sensors, allowing them to be compared more directly for relative performance. This study considers the LPRM-like retrieval algorithm based on generic Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) and uses a controlled numerical experiment to determine the properties of LPRM when acting on synthetic multi-angular SMOS observations. The influences of observational uncertainties, model parameter uncertainties and multi-angle observations (c.f. single-angle) are evaluated on the retrieval performance. In particular, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to quantify the uncertainties in, and correlations between, retrieved parameters, under these influences. The main findings of this study are listed as follows, • According to retrieval sensitivity analysis, vegetation optical depth (t) and surface temperature (Ts) are more critical parameters in the retrieval model compared to surface roughness and scattering albedo, and they may be retrieved simultaneously with soil moisture in a 3-parameter retrieval configuration; • The uncertainty in brightness temperature (TB) has more significant impact on a vegetated-wet scenario than on a bare-dry case: vegetated-wet surface can tolerate 2K brightness temperature uncertainty to achieve the target retrieval accuracy whereas bare-dry surface can tolerate as much as 8K TB uncertainty; • MCMC results demonstrate the advantages of LPRM soil moisture retrieval with multi-angular TB observations over single-angle retrievals in terms of higher robustness and less uncertainty in retrieval results. This work therefore provides guidance to adapting LPRM for SMOS data and soil moisture retrieval at continental scale. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.

The signals from the three instruments are very consistent. The backscattering tends to decrease with increasing vegetation density, as expected, making it possible to classify vegetation density with active microwaves. Over the northern African desert, a very large spatial variability of the backscattering is observed, with both surface and volume scatterings contributing to the signals. The use of multiangle observations does help characterizing the desert types, but in some areas, the ambiguity of the signals is still unexplained. The French-Chinese joint mission 'Chinese-French Oceanic SATellite' will carry two active microwave instruments with a large range of incidence angles, from 0° to 50°.

We study two WorldView-2 multispectral in-track sequences acquired over the cities of Atlanta, USA, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, consisting of 13 and 20 co-located images, respectively. The sequences possess off-nadir acquisition angles up to 47.5° and bear markedly different sun-satellite configurations with respect to each other. Both scenes comprise classic urban structures such as buildings of different size, road networks, and parks. First, we quantify the degree of distortion affecting the sequences by means of a non-linear measure of distance between probability distributions, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Second, we assess the ability of a classification model trained on an image acquired at a certain view angle to predict the land-cover of all the other images in the sequence. The portability across the sequence is investigated for supervised classifiers of different nature by analyzing the evolution of the classification accuracy with respect to the off-nadir look angle. For both datasets, the effectiveness of physically- and statistically-based normalization methods in obtaining angle-invariant data spaces is compared and synergies are discussed. The empirical results indicate that, after a suitable normalization (histogram matching, atmospheric compensation), the loss in classification accuracy when using a model trained on the near-nadir image to classify the most off-nadir acquisitions can be reduced to as little as 0.06 (Atlanta) or 0.03 (Rio de Janeiro) Kappa points when using a SVM classifier. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The main ideal of PCC is that feature points of image are coded in the designed polar geometric structure, and codes are compared point by point to find the longest chain, by which the points are matched to solve the affine equation.

It is therefore of great significance to study the fresh snow emission spectroscopy properties by using the thermal infrared Polarization technique. This can provide a basis for quantitative thermal infrared remote sensing monitoring of snow as well as a deeper understanding of global warming and appropriate countermeasures. This paper focuses on the investigation of the thermal infrared polarization properties of the fresh snow. The results show that the thermal emissive polarization properties of fresh snow depend significantly on the wavelengths (channels) and view angles used to measure them. Four channels are considered in this study, their spectral response ranges are 8~14 μm for channel 1 (CH1), 11.5~12.5 μm for channel 2 (CH2), 10.3~11.5 μm for channel 3 (CH3) and 8.2~9.2 μm for channel 4 (CH4). The snow polarized radiance (L) and its polarized brightness temperature (T) manifest as LCH1>LCH3>LCH4>LCH2 and TCH4>TCH1>TCH2>TCH3, respectively, while the degree of polarization (P) manifests as P0>P30>P40>P20>P10>P50 where the subscript of P denotes the view angle. The maximum of both L and T occurs at the view angle of 50 degree and polarization angle of 90 degree while their minimum appears at the view angle of 30 degree and polarization angle of 75 degree for each channel. In addition, the results show that: CH3 is more appropriate for better investigation of the emissive polarization properties of snow. Linear relationship is found between the fresh snow polarized T and the polarization angle with the coefficient of determination larger than 0.77 for all four channels. The polarized brightness temperature of the fresh snow is found to be increased about 0.003 K per polarization angle within 0~135 degree. The degree of polarization of snow is almost independent of the channels we used (CH1 to CH4). The snow emissive polarization is isotropic and the relative azimuth view angle has no significant impact on the snow emissive polarization properties. The impact of the polarization angle may be neglected if the investigation of the relative azimuth view angle on the fresh snow thermal emissive polarization is conducted. The difference of the fresh snow emissive polarization properties mainly comes from the snow surface roughness and structure. ©, 2015, Science Press.

We present a method for bathymetric mapping of submarine sand waves using multiangle sun glitter information from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer stereo imagery. Based on a multiangle image geometry model and a sun glitter radiance transfer model, sea surface roughness is derived using multiangle sun glitter images. These results are then used for water depth inversions based on the Alpers-Hennings model, supported by a few true depth data points (sounding data). Case study results show that the inversion and true depths match well, with high-correlation coefficients and root-mean-square errors from 1.45 to 2.46 m, and relative errors from 5.48% to 8.12%. The proposed method has some advantages over previous methods in that it requires fewer true depth data points, it does not require environmental parameters or knowledge of sand-wave morphology, and it is relatively simple to operate. On this basis, we conclude that this method is effective in mapping submarine sand waves and we anticipate that it will also be applicable to other similar topography types. © The Authors.

This paper addresses damage assessment based on multi-perspective, overlapping, very high resolution oblique images obtained with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). 3-D point-cloud assessment for the entire building is combined with detailed object-based image analysis (OBIA) of facądes and roofs. This research focuses not on automatic damage assessment, but on creating a methodology that supports the often ambiguous classification of intermediate damage levels, aiming at producing comprehensive per-building damage scores. We identify completely damaged structures in the 3-D point cloud, and for all other cases provide the OBIA-based damage indicators to be used as auxiliary information by damage analysts. The results demonstrate the usability of the 3-D point-cloud data to identify major damage features. Also the UAV-derived and OBIA-processed oblique images are shown to be a suitable basis for the identification of detailed damage features on facądes and roofs. Finally, we also demonstrate the possibility of aggregating the multi-perspective damage information at building level. © 2015 Author(s).","assessment method; building; damage; image analysis; structural analysis; unmanned vehicle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930620500"

Ground-MSPI is an eight-band spectropolarimetric camera mounted on a rotating gimbal to acquire push-broom imagery of outdoor landscapes. The camera uses a photoelastic-modulator-based polarimetric imaging technique to measure linear Stokes parameters in three wavebands (470, 660, and 865 nm) with a ±0.005 uncertainty in degree of linear polarization (DoLP). Comparisons between MSPI measurements, BRDM models, and common modifications to the model are made over a range of scattering angles determined from a fixed viewing geometry and varying sun positions over time. The BRDM model is comprised of a volumetric reflection term plus a specular reflection term of Fresnel-reflecting micro-facets. We consider modifications to this model using a shadowing function and two different micro-facet scattering density functions. We report the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the Ground-MSPI measurements and BRDM model. The BRDM model predicts an angle of the linear polarization (AoLP) that is perpendicular to the scattering plane. This is usually, but not always, observed in Ground-MSPI measurements and in this work we offer explanations for some of the deviations from the model. © 2015 SPIE.","Cameras; Distribution functions; Imaging techniques; Light polarization; Light scattering; Matrix algebra; Mean square error; Polarization; Remote sensing; Bidirectional Polarized reectance Distribution Function (BPDF); Bidirectional reflectance; Distribution matrices; Land surface; Light scattering measurement; Multi-angle; Photo-elastic modulator; Root mean square errors; Surface scattering","Bidirectional Polarized reectance Distribution Function (BPDF); Bidirectional Reectance Distribution Matrix (BRDM); Land surface; Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (MSPI); p-BRDF; polarized light scattering; reection models","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960840043"

Firstly, a “global-local” threshold segmentation method is applied to extract snow ice boundaries with multitemporal remote sensing images. Secondly, the glacier boundaries hidden by mountain shadows are restored with topographic features and multiangle information in different remote sensing images. Finally, the best glacier extents are the intersections of different glacier/snow extents. In order to validate the method, a glacier extraction is tested with 4 Landsat images during 2009-2010 in the western part of Tumur peak of the Tienshan Mountains. The results show that the proposed method performs well in extracting the glacier boundaries inside the mountain shadows with multiangle images. ©, 2015, SinoMaps Press.

In recent years, influence of yellow sand and biomass burning aerosols generated by agricultural biomass burning (ABB) has been noted upon the severe air pollution episodes. This work intends to make the retrieval algorithm more efficient and to make the aerosol model more tractable as far as heavy air pollution caused by ABB is concerned. Aerosol retrieval in the hazy atmosphere is achieved based on radiation simulation method of successive order of scattering (MSOS) for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on AQUA data. The retrieved aerosol properties agree well with the ground measurements and numerical model simulations. Multi-angle observations with the polarization and directionality of the Earth's reflectances (POLDER) on the polarization & anisotropy of reflectances for atmospheric sciences coupled with observations from a lidar (PARASOL) are available for aerosol retrieval from a mixture of cloud and haze, and many potential applications of MSOS involving polarization information are expected to be available for cloud as well as aerosol episodes. © 2015 Mukai, Nakata, Yasumoto, Sano and Kokhanovsky.","","Aeronet; Aerosol Remote Sensing; BBA; Modis; MSOS; Polder","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961609990"
