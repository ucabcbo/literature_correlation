Synthetic aperture radars (SAR) are common instruments for land remote sensing. GPRs with synthetic aperture radar technique (GPR-SAR) are popular instruments to obtain image of the buried objects. To know about dielectric contents, position and shape of the buried target objects, ordinary GPR-SAR is insufficient, because angle between transmit and receive antenna is fixed. Therefore, information is lacked, mainly about microwave propagation velocity of soil which affects measurement accuracy of position of various buried objects. Multi-angle GPR-SAR, a new method, is proposed and can change angle between transmit and receive antennas. In the multi-angle GPR-SAR, a lot of angle points between the antennas can be set, and much more detailed information can be obtained related to buried objects and surrounding soil. A new indoor experiment instrument of full-polarimetric, multi-angle and bi-static GPR-SAR have been developed, which enables us to evaluate possibility of imaging various already-known buried objects. Outline of the instrument is introduced, and polarimetric calibration and imaging capability are verified. © 2019 SPIE.","Calibration; Geological surveys; Geophysical prospecting; Ground penetrating radar systems; Object detection; Polarimeters; Radar antennas; Radar imaging; Receiving antennas; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Active microwave; Buried objects; Detection and identifications; Ground Penetrating Radar; Ground penetrating radar (GPR); Imaging capabilities; Microwave propagation; Polarimetric calibration; Synthetic aperture radar","active microwave remote sensing; buried objects; ground penetrating radar; polarimetric calibration; synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077026528"

During multiple azimuth angle observation, the satellite orbit is equivalent to long three-dimensional (3-D) curvilinear array, which has the potential for 3-D imaging. Sampling by space-borne multiple azimuth angle SAR is sparse in height dimension, which makes unambiguous 3-D imaging by 3-D fast Fourier transform infeasible. Besides, the complex relationship between the targets' projection in multi-angle SAR images and the height error is difficult to determine. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we present a 3-D imaging method based on joint multiple azimuth angle Doppler frequency rate estimation. First, a relationship is proposed between the height error and Doppler frequency rate at different azimuth angle. Then, the Doppler frequency modulation rate error is estimated by Map Drift (MD) technique. Next, the height estimation results of different azimuth angle are combined to improve the estimation accuracy. From the estimated height and the target location in the SAR images, 3-D geometric information is retrieved and 3-D imaging is achieved. Our simulation experiments validate that the height estimation can achieve an accuracy of few meters with the proposed method. © 2018 Institute of Electronics Chinese Academy of Sciences.

A technique based on the relations between the invariant positions of ground targets among the reference and sensed images is proposed to accommodate the nonmatching patterns. It involves a target extraction using wavelet coefficient fusion, as well as a geometric voting matching routine for searching the matched control points (CPs) in the reference and sensed images, respectively. To accelerate the speed of the search, a robust, rapidly corresponding CPs determination strategy is exploited by utilizing the global spatial transformation model, as well as a procedure of outlier removal to ensure the desired accuracy. Meanwhile, the positions of the matched point pairs are relocated using mutual information. The final warping of the images according to the CPs is performed by using a polynomial function. The results show the possibility of matching multi-angle SAR images in general cases. © 2015 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.","Extraction; Feature extraction; Image matching; Image processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Matched point pairs; Multi angle; Polynomial functions; SAR Images; Spatial transformation; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Voting; Wavelet coefficients; Radar imaging","Feature extraction; Image matching; Multi-angle; SAR image; SAR image registration; Voting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922706440"

Here, remote sensing data and machine learning techniques that could support or substitute traditional field-based data collection are evaluated. For the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario, Canada, different combinations of multi-angle/temporal quad pol RADARSAT-2, simulated compact pol RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and high and low spatial resolution Digital Elevation and Surface Models (DEM and DSM, respectively) were used to classify six land cover classes with Random Forests: shallow water, marsh, swamp, water, forest, and agriculture/non-forested. Results demonstrate that high accuracies can be achieved with multi-temporal SAR data alone (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image and a summer image), or via fusion of SAR and DEM and DSM data for single dates/incidence angles (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image, DEM, and DSM data). For all models based on single SAR images, simulated compact pol data generally achieved lower accuracies than quad pol RADARSAT-2 data. However, it was possible to compensate for observed differences through either multi-temporal/angle data fusion or the inclusion of DEM and DSM data (i.e., as a result, there was not a statistically significant difference between multiple models). With a higher repeat-pass cycle than RADARSAT-2, RCM is expected to be a reliable source of C-band SAR data that will contribute positively to ongoing efforts to inventory wetlands and monitor change in areas containing the same land cover classes evaluated here. © 2019 by the authors.

For the conventional SAR with low-squint narrow beams, the azimuth antenna pattern and the elevation antenna pattern play separate roles in scattering measurements. In recent years, a novel spaceborne SAR imaging mode-azimuthal multi-angle observation-has been proposed based on the capability of beam steering. However, in the case of squint and high resolution, the antenna pattern becomes two-dimensional (2-D) inseparable along with the beam steering. Therefore, a spatially varying radiometric error is induced, which makes the calibration more complicated. This paper analyzed the impact of 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. First, the antenna pattern angles varying with the observation angles are analyzed. Then, an equivalent antenna pattern model for squint steering beam seen by an on-ground point scatterer is proposed. Finally, the relative radiometric error induced by the 2-D antenna pattern is assessed based on the integral method. The results show that the impact is related to the squint angle and azimuth resolution. The larger the squint angle, the higher the resolution, and the higher the impact of the 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. In addition, the beam steering needs to be controlled not only in azimuth but also in elevation. Otherwise, the radiometric error can increase several times.  © 2021 IEEE.","Calibration; Directional patterns (antenna); Errors; Radar antennas; Radiometry; Space-based radar; Beam-steering; Imaging modes; Multi-angle observations; Narrow beams; Radiometric calibrations; Radiometrics; Scattering measurements; Spaceborne synthetic aperture radars; Squint angles; Synthetic aperture radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126396822"

This paper presents a novel method for earthquake damage assessment by using multi-angle SAR images. The scatter of building, especially for the damaged buildings, will change with the elevation angle and squint angle, which means a serious lack of information. In order to get more information, the multi-angle SAR images should be obtained. Moreover, a fast and accurate image information algorithm should be used. Furthermore, image geometry correction is realized in slant range plane. After correction operation, fusion operation is implemented.

Twenty-six BSAR experiments were conducted and analyzed in different configurations. Furthermore, a region-based fusion algorithm using region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation was proposed to generate a high-quality fusion image.

However, THz radar security screening for walking human is still a challenge due to the non-rigid motion of walking. To figure it out, a THz radar security screening method for walking human torso is proposed with multi-angle synthetic aperture. In this method, the echo data of walking human torso component is assumed as a rigid motion model within a short time. Particularly, the torso component has the maximum ratio of surface area and echo energy, which means that its motion phase error can be detected after fractional Fourier transform processing. Besides, after the correction and imaging processing, the imaging results under different angles are fused by coherent integration with registration processing to improve the integrity of scattering information, which is incomplete within a short aperture due to self-occlusion and the changes in incident angles. The simulation experiments are conducted to verify the imaging quality and feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, the real small aperture echo data of moving torso collected by our THz radar (that operates at 330GHz with the bandwidth of 30GHz and the output peak power of 5mW) is processed via the proposed method to indicate the significance of multi-angle imaging. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Coherent scattering; Hosiery manufacture; Radar; Radar imaging; Synthetic apertures; Coherent integration; Fractional Fourier transforms; Imaging processing; Non-rigid motion; Output peak power; Rigid motion models; Scattering information; Security screening; Image processing","phase error correction; security screening; synthetic aperture radar; THz radar; Walking human imaging","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107226112"

First, the supervised area is introduced to describe the areas of the same deformation based on the persistent scatter (PS) point.

Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) in its geographic information system (GIS) dictionary denes remote sensing as “collecting and interpreting information about the environment and the surface of the earth from a distance, primarily by sensing radiation that is naturally emitted or reaected by the earth's surface or from the atmosphere, or by sending signals transmitted from a device and re-ected back to it (ESRI, 2014).” Ye usual source of passive remote sensing data is the measurement of re-ected, or transmitted electromagnetic radiation (EMR) from the sun across the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS); this can also include acoustic or sound energy, gravity, or the magnetic eld from or of the objects under consideration. In this context, the simple act of reading this text is considered remote sensing. In this case, the eye acts as a sensor and senses the light re-ected from the object to obtain information about the object. It is the same technology used by a handheld camera to take a photograph of a person or a distant scenic view. Active remote sensing, however, involves sending a pulse of energy and then measuring the returned energy through a sensor (e.g., Radio Detection and Ranging [RADAR], Light Detection and Ranging [LiDAR]). Yermal sensors measure emitted energy by dierent objects. Yus, in general, passive remote sensing involves the measurement of solar energy re-ected from the Earth's surface, while active remote sensing involves synthetic (man-made) energy pulsed at the environment and the return signals are measured and recorded. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Air navigation; Aircraft detection; Altitude control; Antenna arrays; Atmospheric temperature; Band structure; Broadcasting; Climatology; Color photography; Communication satellites; Control system synthesis; Digital radio; Electromagnetic waves; Electronic document exchange; Geodetic satellites; Green computing; Image enhancement; Image recording; Infrared detectors; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Mapping; Marine communication; Marine navigation; Marine radar; Mass spectrometers; Microwave sensors; Microwaves; Mobile antennas; Multispectral scanners; NASA; Oceanography; Optical radar; Orbits; Planetary surface analysis; Public administration; Quality control; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Radio navigation; Radiometers; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Satellite imagery; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; Soil conservation; Soil surveys; Solar energy; Space flight; Space optics; Surface topography; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Underwater acoustics; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicle to vehicle communications; Water quality; Weather satellites; Environmental systems research institutes; Medium resolution imaging spectrometers; Microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis; National center for atmospheric researches; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; National polar orbiting environmental satellite systems; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager; Space-based radar","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032662433"

In contrast to linear approaches, which often provide algorithms that are simple to apply, nonlinear learning machines such as neural networks demand more computing and are more likely to have nonlinear optimization difficulties, which are more difficult to solve. Kernel methods, a recently developed technology, are strong machine learning approaches that have a less complicated architecture and give a straightforward way to transforming nonlinear optimization issues into convex optimization problems. Typical analytical tasks in kernel-based learning include classification, regression, and clustering, all of which are compromised. For image processing applications, a semisupervised deep learning approach, which is driven by a little amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, has shown excellent performance in recent years. For their part, today's semisupervised learning methods operate on the assumption that both labeled and unlabeled information are distributed in a similar manner, and their performance is mostly impacted by the fact that the two data sets are in a similar state of distribution as well. When there is out-of-class data in unlabeled data, the system's performance will be adversely affected. When used in real-world applications, the capacity to verify that unlabeled data does not include data that belongs to a different category is difficult to obtain, and this is especially true in the field of synthetic aperture radar image identification (SAR). Using threshold filtering, this work addresses the problem of unlabeled input, including out-of-class data, having a detrimental influence on the performance of the model when it is utilized to train the model in a semisupervised learning environment. When the model is being trained, unlabeled data that does not belong to a category is filtered out by the model using two different sets of data that the model selects in order to optimize its performance. A series of experiments was carried out on the MSTAR data set, and the superiority of our method was shown when it was compared against a large number of current semisupervised classification algorithms of the highest level of sophistication. This was especially true when the unlabeled data had a significant proportion of data that did not fall into any of the categories. The performance of each kernel function is tested independently using two metrics, namely, the false alarm (FA) and the target miss (TM), respectively. These factors are used to calculate the proportion of incorrect judgments made using the techniques.  © 2022 Pooja Chopra et al.","Classification (of information); Computer aided instruction; Convex optimization; Data handling; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Automated registration; Data set; Linear methods; Multi angle; Non-linear optimization; Nonlinear data; Performance; Polynomial filters; SAR Images; Unlabeled data; Nonlinear programming","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130320058"

This paper studies multi-angle SAR image reconstruction based on non-negative Tucker decomposition using adjacent azimuth images reconstructed to form a sparse tensor. Sparse tensors are used to perform non-negative Tucker decomposition, resulting in non-negative core tensors and factor matrices. The reconstruction tensor is obtained by calculating the n-mode product of the core tensor and the factor matrix, and then image reconstruction is realized. The similarity between the original image and the reconstructed image is calculated by using the structural similarity index and the cosine of the angle between the feature vectors. The reconstruction results of three target images of MSTAR show that the reconstructed image has a similarity higher than 95% with the original image in most cases, which can support target recognition under sparse observation to a certain extent. © 2022 by the authors.","","image reconstruction; multi-angle; SAR image; similarity evaluation; tensor decomposition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138602707"

However, the existing retrieval algorithms fail to derive soil moisture with expected accuracy. Insufficient understanding of the effects of soil and vegetation parameters on the backscatters is an important reason for this failure. To this end, we present a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to quantify the effects of parameters on the dual-polarized backscatters of Sentinel-1 based on a Water Cloud Model (WCM) and multiple global SA methods. The identification of the incidence angle and polarization of Sentinel-1 and the description scheme of vegetation parameters (A, B and α) in WCM are especially emphasized in this analysis towards an optimal estimation of parameters. Multiple SA methods derive identical parameter importance ranks, indicating that a highly reasonable and reliable SA is performed. Comparison between two existing vegetation description schemes shows that the scheme using Vegetation Water Content (VWC) outperforms the scheme combing particle moisture content and VWC. Surface roughness, soil moisture, VWC, and B, are most sensitive on the backscatters. Variation of parameter sensitivity indices with incidence angle at different polarizations indicates that VV-and VH-polarized backscatters at small incidence angles are the optimal options for soil moisture and surface roughness estimation, respectively, while VV-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles is well-suited for VWC and B estimation and HH-polarized backscatter is well suited for roughness estimation.

To solve the problem, this paper introduces a novel approach for velocity measurement based on the azimuth multi-angle SAR imaging mode. First, the geometry model was built, and the functions to measure moving target’s velocity were deduced as well. By analyzing the effects of the moving targeton SAR image, the approach for measuring azimuth velocity with one satellite and range velocity with two satellites were proposed. Using this approach, we can not only estimate velocity along both azimuth and range direction with high accuracy, but also solve the problem of blind velocity and velocity ambiguity. The effective of this approach is validated by the computer simulation results. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Azimuth velocity; High-accuracy; Moving target indication; Multi angle; Multi-Angle-SAR; Space-borne SAR; Velocity ambiguity; Velocity estimation; Network security","Azimuth multi-angle; High accuracy; SAR; Velocity estimation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961574814"

The shadow can block the target of the observation area, making it impossible to obtain the scattering characteristics of the target. The layover causes phase distortion and alters target characteristics. Shadow and layover severely hinder the interpretation of SAR images. To confront the above problems, a multi-angle fusion algorithm based on unsupervised progressive segmentation network is proposed. Firstly, inspired by mega-constellations of low earth orbit, a spaceborne SAR collaborative observation model is proposed to generate multi-angle images of fluctuant terrain. Secondly, according to the difference of echos in the shadow and layover regions, an unsupervised progressive segmentation network is designed to sequentially segment the shadow and layover regions. Finally, to improve the contrast and brightness of the fused SAR image, a single-scale weighted fusion algorithm is designed. Experiments were conducted using the simulated multi-angle SAR images.

Optical images can directly reflect the information of ground objects and provide people a real and intuitive feeling. Earthquake areas are often hit with inclement weather after the occurrence of earthquakes. Effective optical images are difficult to obtain in the presence of clouds and fog, thus leading to the incomplete recognition of landslide information. Given that SAR satellite technology is not affected by clouds and breaks through the limitations of optics, SAR data have gradually become the mainstream data for earthquake disaster response and assessment. With the development of SAR sensors, SAR has developed into a multiband, multi-polarization, multi-angle, and variable working model from the first single mode of operation. SAR data guarantee flexibility in its application to seismic landslide identification. Existing SAR image landslide identification methods mainly use single characteristics of texture features or polarization features of landslide information in SAR images. Multi-source features in SAR images have not been fused, especially the characteristics of multi-polarization SAR image data. Thus, landslide survey accuracy is low and cannot meet actual application needs. Taking the Jiuzhaigou earthquake as an example, this study adopts the first C-band multi-polarization GF-3 satellite data with a resolution of 1 m as the data source. Polarization and texture features of the image are extracted based on an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of multi-polarization image data. Afterward, GF-2 satellite data obtained post-earthquake are carefully registered with the GF-3 satellite data. Typical landslide samples are selected from the GF-2 images, which are used as training samples for classification. Finally, back propagation neural network is used to extract the landslide in the whole area through the comprehensive utilization of polarization characteristics, texture, and terrain feature information based on the training samples. To meet the urgency of the disaster, identification accuracy can be improved as much as possible while meeting the efficiency of information identification. The findings can provide a reference for the restoration, reconstruction, and scientific exploration of the Jiuzhaigou earthquake. A comparison of the results of visual interpretation of GF-2 optical images and the unmanned aerial vehicle images revealed that the overall extraction accuracy of the landslide is 92.8% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.715. The scattering characteristics of the ridge on the image are easily confused with the bright spots formed by the landslide because these characteristics are more obvious. The spatial distribution feature of the slope can eliminate partial landslide information and eliminate the influence of the ridge. Taking the Jiuzhaigou earthquake as an example and using the homemade GF-3 full polarization SAR satellite data, this study proposes a fully polarimetric data seismic landslide automatic recognition method based on integrated polarization features, texture features, and terrain features. The method is used for a general investigation of landslides in the entire earthquake area of Jiuzhaigou. The extraction results meet the requirements of earthquake emergency, post-earthquake recovery, and reconstruction. The method also promotes the application of GaoFen satellites in the earthquake prevention and disaster reduction industry. © 2019, Science Press.

To address the aforementioned problems, by virtue of a geosynchronous (GEO) SAR platform, this paper firstly demonstrates the expressions of 3D deformation and the corresponding errors in GEO SAR multi-angle processing. An optimal multi-angle data selection method based on minimizing position dilution of precision (PDOP) is proposed to obtain a good 3D deformation retrieval accuracy. Moreover, neural network is utilized for analyzing the accuracy of the retrieved 3D deformation under different orbit configurations and geo-locations. Finally, the proposed methods and the theoretical analysis are verified by simulation experiments.

Monitoring and mapping of forest distribution are of great significance. With the successive launch of new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, microwave remote sensing data acquisition methods have been developed from single-band, single-polarization and single-angle to multi-frequency, multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-temporal and so on. That provides an unprecedented potential and opportunity for SAR in the research and application of forest identification. In this paper, the data source mainly included the quad-polarization C-band GaoFen-3(GF-3) and dual-polarization L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR. First, the single-look complex (SLC) data was preprocessed with multi-look, filtering, radiation calibration, geocoding, registration and clipping. Three polarization characteristic parameters of entropy (H), scattering angle (α) and anisotropy (A) were obtained by using Cloude-Pottier polarization decomposition, and three texture features of the mean (MEAN), variance (VAR) and dissimilarity (DIS) were extracted based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM). Combined with the advantages of GF-3 high-resolution quad-polarization and PALSAR L-band, multi-dimensional information including frequency, polarization, temporal and texture features was used synthetically. Then support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier was used to obtain the four classification results, including coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and others.

Local anomalies of wind, waves, currents or surfactants appear on the images as local anomalies of brightness. A quantitative interpretation of those brightness anomalies must relate them to slope properties of the wave field, which are to the lowest order described by the mean square slope (mss). The prevailing paradigm for such interpretation is that of the critical zenith angle. It states that, for sub-critical zenith view angle, brightness and mss anomalies have opposite signs, and this defines the so-called inversion region. This prevailing paradigm implicitly builds on the assumption that the mss decomposition between upwind and crosswind components is conserved. The mss anomalies are then isotropic and can be reduced to a scalar (i.e. one-dimensional) quantity. In such a case, one single sunglint image would be sufficient to retrieve the mss anomaly. This isotropic case likely applies for surface wave changes induced by varying wind speed or by surfactants. Yet, satellite and airborne observations at multiple view angles recently revealed anisotropic mss anomalies, e.g. with mss increase in the upwind direction and decrease in the crosswind direction. This anisotropic behavior likely characterizes wave modulations by anisotropic surface current gradients. This paper details the expected properties of such anisotropic mss modulations. It is shown that: 1) The classical concept of critical angle does not systematically hold, neither for frontal current shear nor for internal wave divergence. 2) At least two sunglint images at different zenith and azimuth angles are needed to retrieve the mss anomalies, and a single observation is not sufficient. 3) A satellite with radiometers looking at multiple zenith angles is capable of providing a geometry favorable to retrieve mss anomalies. An illustration is discussed with internal waves observed by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), where the upwind and crosswind components of the retrieved mss anomalies are anisotropic. Those results provide guidelines to interpret available observations and to help refine strategy for future satellite missions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Anisotropy; Luminance; Modulation; Oceanography; Radiometers; Salinity measurement; Satellites; Surface active agents; Surface roughness; Surface waters; Surface waves; Synthetic aperture radar; Wind; Mean square slopes; Multi angle; SAR Images; Sea surface roughness; Sun glint; Surface current; Surface slope; Wave current interaction; brightness temperature; data interpretation; decomposition analysis; image resolution; MISR; observational method; quantitative analysis; radiometer; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea surface; surfactant; synthetic aperture radar; turbulence; wave-current interaction; zenith angle; Shear flow","Mean square slope; Multi-angle radiometers; SAR images; Sea surface roughness; Submesoscale turbulence; Sun glint imagery; Surface current gradients; Surface slope distribution; Surfactants; Wave-current interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049329024"

However, most existing methods detect ships with horizontal bounding boxes, which leads to the redundancy of detected regions. Furthermore, the high Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between two horizontal bounding boxes of densely arranged ships can cause missing detection. In this paper, a multi-stage rotational region based network (MSR2N) is proposed to solve the above problems. In MSR2N, the rotated bounding boxes, which can reduce background noise and prevent missing detection caused by high IoUs, are utilized to represent ship regions. MSR2N consists of three modules: Feature pyramid network (FPN), rotational region proposal network (RRPN), and multi-stage rotational detection network (MSRDN). First of all, the FPN is applied to combine high-resolution features with semantically strong features. Second, in RRPN, a rotation-angle-dependent strategy is employed to generate multi-angle anchors which can represent arbitrary-oriented ship regions more felicitously than horizontal anchors. Finally, the MSRDN with three sub-networks is proposed to regress proposals of ship regions stage by stage. Meanwhile, the incrementally increasing IoU thresholds are selected for resampling positive and negative proposals in sequential stages of MSRDN, which eliminates close false positive proposals successively. With the above characteristics, MSR2N is more suitable and robust for ship detection in SAR images. The experimental results on SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) show that the MSR2N has achieved state-of-the-art performance. © 2020 by the authors.

The repeat-pass concept is adopted in GNSSbased InSAR to retrieve the deformation of the target area, and it has inherited advantages from the GNSS system, such as a short repeat-pass period and multi-angle retrieval. However, several interferometric phase errors, such as inter-channel and atmospheric errors, are introduced into GNSSbased InSAR, which seriously decreases the accuracy of the retrieved deformation. In this paper, a deformation retrieval algorithm is presented to assess the compensation of the interferometric phase errors in GNSS-based InSAR. Firstly, the topological phase error was eliminated based on accurate digital elevation model (DEM) information from a light detection and ranging (lidar) system. Secondly, the inter-channel phase error was compensated, using direct wave in the echo channel, i.e., a back lobe signal. Finally, by modeling the atmospheric phase, the residual atmospheric phase error was compensated for. This is the first realization of the deformation detection of urban scenes using a GNSS-based system, and the results suggest the effectiveness of the phase error compensation algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

When the phase contributions from surface deformation, topography, and ionospheric delays are negligible or known, the interferogram can be used to estimate the differential tropospheric delay (DTD), which can help to improve tropospheric delay predictions from weather models and in situ measurements. In conventional repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR), however, the estimation of the DTD can still be significantly hindered by baseline errors. In addition, a single interferogram provides only relative DTDs, as the delays can be retrieved up to an unknown offset. To address such issues, this article presents a method for the estimation of DTDs on large scales by using repeat-pass simultaneous multi-angle SAR systems. Complementary simultaneous observations of the correlated troposphere from multiple angles are used to retrieve estimates of the absolute DTD and, at the same time, to mitigate the effect of baseline knowledge errors. Finally, a performance evaluation is presented for the Harmony Earth Explorer 10 candidate mission. A centimeter-level absolute accuracy and a submillimeter-level relative accuracy of the DTD estimation are achieved under the multistatic Harmony case when at least one companion satellite has an inter-satellite distance longer than 300 km to provide enough sensitivity. © 2021 IEEE.","Interferometry; Predictive analytics; Space-based radar; Topography; Troposphere; In-situ measurement; Inter satellite distances; Interferometric phase; Interferometric SAR; Simultaneous observation; Surface deformation; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Tropospheric delays; accuracy assessment; atmospheric modeling; correlation; deformation; error analysis; estimation method; ionosphere; satellite data; strain; synthetic aperture radar; topography; troposphere; Synthetic aperture radar","Atmospheric modeling; Delays; Estimation; Satellites; Strain; Synthetic aperture radar; Terrestrial atmosphere","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114626644"

However, due to the coherent superposition of received echoes, the continuous edges of targets are discretized in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, i.e., the edges become dispersed points, which seriously affects the extraction of visual and geometric information from SAR images. In this article, we focus on solving the problem of how to recover smooth linear edges (SLEs). By introducing multiangle observations, we propose an SAR parametric image reconstruction method (SPIRM) that establishes a parametric framework to recover SLEs from SAR echoes.

The main objective of this research was to develop, test, and validate a soil moisture retrieval method for agricultural fields using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in preparation for the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM). The integral equation model (IEM) was used to estimate soil moisture for 12 quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images acquired in 2011 and 2012 over a test site in eastern Canada. A new hybrid inversion scheme is introduced whereby field-level soil moisture retrieval was accomplished through a look-up table (LUT) optimization using backscatter from pairs of RADARSAT-2 data acquired at two incidence angles and two polarizations. The accuracy of this new hybrid approach was compared to that of the more conventional multipolarization inversion. For validation purposes, in situ soil moisture was monitored using a network of four stations designed to capture the maximum soil variability within the study area. Results showed that the hybrid approach provided the best estimates with a mean absolute error of 4.13%. Unlike the multipolarization inversion, the hybrid approach does not require a roughness calibration term. This model/inversion configuration was implemented to produce soil moisture maps from image pairs acquired at different incidence angles. Spatiotemporal changes conveyed by retrieved maps were assessed using an index of absolute normalized moisture difference. The resulting maps provided meaningful information, showing the potential of combining a soil moisture index statistic, IEM, and RADARSAT data in estimating soil moisture conditions. Based on the results presented here, the hybrid approach is well suited for the planned RADARSAT Constellation Mission considering the more frequent relook expected with three satellites. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is preparing to implement the hybrid approach to monitor soil moisture across Canada's agricultural landscapes using RCM. Résumé. L’objectif principal de cette recherche était de développer, tester et valider une méthode d'extraction de l’humidité du sol pour les champs agricoles en utilisant des données du radar à synthèse d’ouverture (RSO) en bande C en préparation de la mission de la Constellation RADARSAT (MCR). Le modèle des équations intégrales (MEI) a été utilisé pour estimer l’humidité du sol pour 12 images polarimétriques de RADARSAT-2 acquises en 2011 et 2012 sur un site d’essai dans l’est du Canada. Un nouveau système d’inversion hybride est présenté dans lequel l'extraction de l’humidité du sol au niveau du terrain a été réalisée grâce à une optimisation de table de recherche en utilisant la rétrodiffusion des paires de données RADARSAT-2 acquises à deux angles d’incidence et à deux polarisations. La précision de cette nouvelle approche hybride a été comparée à celle de l’inversion multipolarisation plus classique. À des fins de validation, l’humidité du sol in situ a été surveillée en utilisant un réseau de quatre stations disposées pour obtenir la variabilité maximum du sol dans la zone d’étude. Les résultats ont montré que l’approche hybride a fourni les meilleures estimations avec une erreur absolue moyenne de 4,13 %. Contrairement à l’inversion multipolarisation, l’approche hybride ne nécessite pas un terme d’étalonnage de rugosité. Cette configuration modèle / inversion a été mise en œuvre pour produire des cartes d’humidité du sol à partir de paires d’images acquises à différents angles d’incidence. Les changements spatio-temporels représentés par des cartes extraites ont été évalués en utilisant un indice de la différence normalisée absolue de l’humidité. Les cartes résultantes ont fourni des informations utiles, montrant le potentiel de combiner une statistique de l’indice de l’humidité du sol, MEI, et les données de RADARSAT pour estimer les conditions d’humidité du sol. Basée sur les résultats présentés ici, l’approche hybride est bien adaptée à la mission de la Constellation RADARSAT compte tenu de la réobservation plus fréquente prévue avec trois satellites. Agriculture et Agroalimentaire Canada se prépare à mettre en œuvre l’approche hybride pour la surveillance de l’humidité du sol dans les paysages agricoles du Canada à l’aide de la MCR.

But the conventional triangular reflectors cannot meet the requirements of obtaining multi‑angle deformation information on ascending and descending track scenes. They need to be tailored for specific datasets to meet monitoring needs. Methods: A set schemes for corner reflector design and accuracy verification are constructed.According to the characteristics of X‑band radar satellite satellite, a two‑way adjustable rectangular corner reflector is designed to meet the monitoring scene of the ascending and descending track. Due to the relationship between the radar cross section(RCS) and the size of the corner reflector, the side length of the bidirectional rectangular corner reflector is calculated to be 0.35 m.Ten bidirectional rectangular corner reflectors are placed on the side slope of the highway in the monitoring area.By artificially simulating the two‑dimensional deformation,the detection accuracy and reliability of the TS‑InSAR on the bidirectional rectangular corner reflector is verified. Results: Under the condition of effectively eliminating the sidelobe effect of the pixel, the designed bidirectional rectangular corner reflector maintains a high and stable backscattering intensity, which can be easily extracted. Through the analysis of the weather conditions at the time of imaging, heavy rainfall has a certain influence on the backscattering intensity of corner reflectors. Under the blind experimental conditions of artificially adjusting the height of the corner reflector, CR1 and CR2 are moved between May 13, 2018 and May 24, 2018. The root mean square error is 0.6 mm. The deformation detection accuracy reaches the sub‑millimeter level. Conclusions: The TS‑InSAR is highly sensitive to the deformation of the designed bidirectional rectangular corner reflector. The bidirectional rectangular corner reflector can meet the requirements of obtaining multi-angle deformation information on ascending and descending track scenes. © 2021, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

To solve this problem, by introducing the improved attributed scattering model into the traditional SAR echo model, we propose our multi-angle sparse image reconstruction method (MASIRM). Through modeling the illuminated scene with point scatterers and line-segment-scatterers, a multi-angle echo model is first presented. By generating an adaptive mixed dictionary and applying the pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning, the MASIRM obtains more geometric information of the distributed target with higher quality sparse SAR images.

For this reason, CSAR is the best mode of SAR to exploit target feature extraction on azimuth directions. Over larger azimuth angular extents the energy reflected by targets is, in general, not uniform and most targets exhibit only limited scattering persistence. The algorithm proposed in this paper extracts the width of target persistence angle which is defined as target azimuth-angle sensitivity. It is an effective parameter to distinguish different types of anisotropic targets. And it is independent of azimuth orientations for its measurement of width of target persistence angle. This feature is extracted by data inversion in this paper. Compared with the sub-aperture approach which can also extract the anisotropic scattering properties of target, data inversion approach in our algorithm can provide more accurate results and finer curve.

Radiometric calibration is a necessary approach to consistent and accurate SAR measurements, but has so far not been carefully considered for AMAO space-borne SAR. This paper addressed the new issues in radiometric calibration arising from the AMAO space-borne SAR system. The AMAO imaging modes are firstly been illustrated, based on which the influences of the AMAO on radiometric calibration are analyzed. To guarantee the accuracy of the radiometric calibration, an appropriate form of the SAR radar equation is derived for AMAO space-borne SAR. On these bases, the calibration models can be obtained by reformulating the novel AMAO SAR equation, and the corresponding normalization method is then proposed.

The technologies of polarimetric and interferometric synthetic-aperture radar, high-resolution optical satellite remote sensing, spaceborne lidar, and multi-angle satellite remote sensing can effectively obtain forest structure regionally. However, it is challenging to obtain structural parameters on a single-tree scale using these technologies. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) recently provides a new means to obtain forest structures. The ground images can be obtained using UAV ordinary cameras, and the ground point cloud can be obtained using structure from motion photogrammetry technology for 3D reconstruction, generating digital surface model, digital elevation model (DEM), and canopy height model (CHM). The local maximum algorithm is used to process CHM data. The key to the local maximum algorithm is to select an appropriate window size and find the largest grid value (seed point) in the window as the highest point of the tree crown to represent the tree. However, it is challenging to calculate the window size. One solution is to use the variable window method. In this study, the height and crown diameter of 49 Populus euphratica trees were measured in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, Xinjiang, China. The Populus euphratica were counted in a 251 hm2 grid, and a DJI Phantom 4 Pro was used to acquire the image data. The DJI Phantom 4 Pro is a consumer-grade UAV using oblique and ortho photogrammetry, respectively. An adaptive window maxima algorithm was proposed to analyze and process CHM data, obtaining the structural parameters of the Populus euphratica forest in the study area, such as tree height, crown diameter, and number of trees. The structural parameters extracted using oblique and ortho photogrammetry were compared and analyzed with field-measured data. The results and conclusions are (1) the adaptive window maxima algorithm and fixed window maximum algorithm (1.5-, 2.0-, 2.5-, and 3.0- m fixed windows, respectively) were used to process CHM data obtained using oblique photogrammetry to generate Populus euphratica seed points. The data are compared with the statistical data of 25 sample plots. The R2 of fixed window values vary widely from 0.7834 to 0.8261, indicating that we should choose an appropriate window size to achieve higher accuracy according to the actual situation of the region. While the R2 of the adaptive window maxima algorithm is the highest (0.8341), it can achieve higher accuracy because the algorithm reduces the window size dependence. (2) The tree height measured using oblique and ortho photogrammetry is overestimated, and the crown diameter is underestimated. The mean, median, and distribution of tree height and crown diameter obtained using ortho photogrammetry are closer to the field-measured values, indicating that oblique photogrammetry could achieve more accurate results than ortho photogrammetry. (3) The oblique photogrammetry and field-measured data were compared to determine the coefficients (R2) of tree height, crown diameter, and tree numbers per hectare (0.9002, 0.8403, and 0.9405, respectively). The root means squared error was 0.4457, 0.6815, and 4.2500, respectively.

Compared to lidars and cameras, automotive-legacy radars can work in any weather condition and without an external source of illumination, but are limited in either range or angular resolution. SARs offer a relevant increase in angular resolution, provided that the ego-motion of the radar platform is known along the synthetic aperture. In this paper, we present the results of an experimental campaign aimed at assessing the potential of a multi-beam SAR imaging in an urban scenario, composed of various targets (buildings, cars, pedestrian, etc.), employing a 77 GHz multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar platform based on a mass-market available automotive-grade technology. The results highlight a centimeter-level accuracy of the SAR images in realistic driving conditions, showing the possibility to use a multi-angle focusing approach to detect and discriminate between different targets based on their angular scattering response. © 2022 IEEE.","MIMO radar; MIMO systems; Radar imaging; Angular resolution; Automotives; Autonomous driving; Environment mapping; External sources; High resolution; Multibeams; Synthetic aperture radar imaging; Technological solution; Urban scenarios; Synthetic aperture radar","Automotive; multi-beam; SAR; urban scenarios","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137101106"

The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI. Linear regression models are created for the estimation of FYI and MYI roughness from NDAI, and FYI roughness from backscatter.

Our team has previously proposed the logarithm background subtraction algorithm for moving target detection in single-channel circular SAR. Its principle is that the background image (static clutter) is obtained by median filtering of the image sequence, and the foreground image (moving target) is obtained by subtraction. To further improve the performance of background and foreground separation, we introduce the low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD) method into the previous framework. A new algorithm based on LRSD and adaptive threshold detector (ATD) is proposed in this letter. First, this letter introduces entropy metric to optimize parameters in LRSD to obtain better background and foreground separation. Second, since the statistical distribution of the foreground image is unknown, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector cannot be applied to the foreground image. Therefore, an adaptive threshold detector (ATD) built on Otsu is presented in this letter, which is independent of image statistical properties. The final detection result is obtained via clustering using the modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by the experimental results on the airborne X-band Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Clutter (information theory); Median filters; Object detection; Object recognition; Radar clutter; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Circular synthetic aperture radar; Clutter; Dynamic threshold; Image sequence; Images segmentations; Local dynamic threshold detection; Local dynamics; Low-rank sparse decomposition; Moving target detection; Single channels; Sparse decomposition; Sparse matrices; Threshold detection; algorithm; decomposition analysis; detection method; observational method; parameter estimation; synthetic aperture radar; Image segmentation","adaptive threshold detector (ATD); Circular synthetic aperture radar (SAR); low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD); moving target detection; single channel","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125298913"

For stronger prediction this paper presents new structure that benefit from both MS-MA BT (multi-scale multi-angle breaking ties) and CNN algorithm. We build a new MS-MA BT and CNN architecture. It obtains multiple characteristics from the raw image as an input. This algorithm generates relevant feature maps which are fed into concatenating layer to form combined feature map. The obtained mixed feature map is then placed into the subsequent stages to estimate the final results for each hyperspectral pixel. Not only does the suggested technique benefit from improved extraction of characteristics from CNNs and MS-MA BT, but it also allows complete combined use of visual and temporal data. The performance of the suggested technique is evaluated using SAR data sets, and the results indicate that the MS-MA BT-based multi-functional training algorithm considerably increases identification precision. Recently, convolution neural networks have proved outstanding efficiency on multiple visual activities, including the ranking of common two-dimensional pictures. In this paper, the MS-MA BT multi-scale multi-angle CNN algorithm is used to identify hyperspectral images explicitly in the visual domain.

Traditional azimuth velocity estimation methods ignore the displacement error caused by defocusing, which lead to the pixel offset measurement error among sequential images. In order to correct this error, a velocity measurement approach by moving target refocusing is presented in this paper. A novel azimuth multi-Angle spaceborne SAR imaging mode is introduced to get sequential images, and effects of azimuth velocity on targets are presented as well. Moreover, azimuth velocity measurement method is derived to get the initial estimation value of the azimuth velocity. By using the initial estimation value, a refocusing approach is given, by compensating the quadratic residual phase and the time-shift phase caused by object moving. Consequently, a more precise azimuth velocity estimation result can be get by implementing the azimuth velocity measurement method again. Finally, the approach is verified by simulation of a point target with azimuth velocity. © 2016 IEEE.","Errors; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Multi angle; Phase compensation; refocusing; Sequential images; Velocity estimation; Radar imaging","multi-Angle; phase compensation; refocusing; sequential images; velocity estimation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013837168"

Compared with visible and infrared sensors, it is not limited by light, weather, and climate conditions and has all-weather and multi-angle data acquisition capability. With the development of SAR imaging technology, SAR image has been widely used in the military field for intelligence detection, navigation guidance, ocean ship detection, etc. Through the detection of ship target in the SAR image, the ship information of the sea surface, port, and other locations can be obtained quickly, which improves border prevention ability. The traditional methods of SAR ship detection have difficulty in detecting small-scale ships and avoiding the interference of inshore complex background. Moreover, the quality of SAR images needs to be high, and the images need to be preprocessed before detection. In addition, the robustness and generalization of most SAR images are not good enough for specific scenes, and they are susceptible to speckle noise, which has certain limitations. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning has been introduced into the SAR image target detection field. Deep learning is an enhanced version of machine learning. Recently, it has been gradually applied for ship detection in SAR images, but some problems need to be addressed. First, the near shore ships are seriously disturbed by the buildings on the shore. The existing detection methods cannot effectively distinguish the ship target from the background, so it is easy to mix the background with the ship target or mistake the target for the background, resulting in missed detection. Second, the existing algorithm cannot accurately locate the closely arranged ship targets, and the positioning effect is poor. It is easy to regard multiple targets as one target, which leads to wrong detection, resulting in low accuracy of detection results or high constant false alarm rate. To solve these problems, this study proposes a detection method based on bidirectional attention feature pyramid network. Method: Experiments are conducted on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) of the public SAR image ship dataset. This dataset comes from the Naval Aviation University, which is a common dataset in this field in China. Affine, fuzzy, and noisy data enhancement operations are performed to improve the generalization ability of the training model. A new bidirectional feature pyramid network is proposed based on the original fully convolutional one-stage (FCOS) object detection network. By connecting the attention mechanism module with each feature graph of the pyramid network, the features of a large amount of semantic information can be extracted. At the same time, we use convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to refine the stitched feature map and combine the idea of path aggregation network for instance segmentation. The bottom-up pyramid module is added to further highlight the prominent features of targets at different scales, so as to improve the ability of the network to accurately locate ship targets in a complex background. Then, a weighted feature fusion method is proposed, which makes the feature information extracted from different feature maps to have different emphases and then combines the salient features with the global non-fuzzy features to improve the ship detection accuracy. Finally, the fused feature map is fed back to the detection network to obtain the final detection result. In addition, a NVIDIA Titan RTX device is used for the experimental platform in this study, and the operating system is Ubuntu 18.04. The batch size of the training is set to the initialization model, the batch size of the training is 8, the total iteration number is 50 000, the initial learning rate is 0.001, the learning rate attenuation coefficient is 0.000 1, the 2 000 attenuation is once, and the kinetic parameters are analyzed at 0.9 mm. Result: We compared the added modules and found that the added modules have different degrees of improvement compared with the original FCOS method. At the same time, we also compared the experimental results with three other existing models, including SSD, Faster R-CNN (region convolutional neural network), and original FCOS. Experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 9.5% higher than that of the original FCOS method. The detection accuracy of this algorithm reached 90.2% under the same conditions, which was 14.09% higher than that of SSD and 8.5% higher than that of Faster R-CNN. The results show that the model algorithm can obtain accurate results. In addition, in terms of time, the proposed algorithm is 5 ms slower than FCOS. However, the detection speed was 1.6 times higher than that of SSD and 6 times higher than that of Faster R-CNN. In terms of speed, the detection speed of the proposed algorithm is obviously faster than that of other existing methods. From the comparison of experimental results, the proposed algorithm is not only good for the detection of small target ships in deep sea, but also good for the detection of near shore ship targets in the complex background, especially for closely arranged ship targets, with high accuracy of positioning effect. Conclusion: By improving the network features and the feature fusion method, the ship detection algorithm in SAR images is improved on the premise of ensuring the same detection effect of deep-sea ships. Under complex background, the ship positioning effect is compact, and the accuracy of ship detection is effectively enhanced, which is superior to other ship detection methods based on SSDD. © 2021, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm–5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to ~0.1 cm3/cm3 at an intermediate value of ~0.35 cm3/cm3. (2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large variation of ~30 dB and ~80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm3/cm3 to 0.5 cm3/cm3. The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial resolutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval. © 2020","China; Luan River; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellites; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic apertures; Temperature; Vegetation; Watersheds; Airborne experiments; Continuous measurements; L-band active and passive; Optical remote sensing data; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil temperature gradient; Vegetation temperature; Vegetation water content; accuracy assessment; airborne survey; backscatter; experimental study; ground-based measurement; radiometer; satellite altimetry; satellite data; satellite mission; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; water resource; watershed; Soil surveys","Airborne experiment; L-band active and passive; Luan River; Soil moisture; Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078694659"

It has highly flexible antenna beams with powerful beam-steering capability while affecting the consistency of radiometric measurements, especially in the high-squint case. This paper mainly focuses on the antenna pattern effect analysis and correction method of AMAO spaceborne SAR. The antenna pattern characteristics of the squint steering beam are first analyzed. On this basis, an analytical model is developed to quantify the antenna pattern effects in AMAO SAR images. Different from the conventional approach that corrects the elevation antenna pattern, an improved antenna pattern correction method, which accounts for the spatial variation in the two-dimensional antenna pattern, is then proposed for AMAO spaceborne SAR. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the proposed correction method. The results show that the newly proposed method considering the spatial-variant antenna pattern has higher performance than the conventional approach using a reference elevation pattern. © 2022 by the authors.
