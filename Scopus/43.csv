Nevertheless, to our knowl-edge there is not any dataset composed of Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) geo-referenced images. In this paper we present SEN23, a dataset composed of 100 complete multi-spectral S2 and S3 paired images of different locations along Europe from the 2021 summer. The coupled images were obtained with a time difference of three or less days, containing less than a 1 % of cloud coverage and have a resolution difference of × 15.

To achieve this objective, the Copernicus Program features two main components: In- Situ Measurement component, devoted to the provision of Copernicus Services and the Space Segment component. This latter is responsible for the operational provision of Earth Observation data, achieved by a series of ‘Sentinels’ spacecraft and Instruments. Six different families of Sentinels mission have been defined, comprising: a C-band interferometry radar mission (Sentinel-1), a multispectral optical imaging mission (Sentinel-2), a mission with a wide-swath, low medium resolution optical and infrared radiometers and a radar altimeter package (Sentinel-3), two families of atmosphere chemistry monitoring missions (Sentinel-4,- 5), a Sentinel-5 precursor comprising a single satellite mission planned in order to reduce data gaps between Envisat and Sentinel-5 and finally, a Sentinel-6 family to provide high accuracy altimetry for measuring global sea-surface height, primarily for operational oceanography and for climate studies. Sentinels 1A and 2A have been successfully Launched in April 2014 and June 2015 respectively and are already in the Operational phase. The Launch of Sentinel 3A took place in February 2016, consolidating the first lot of Sentinels Launches. In 2016 and 2017 Sentinel-1B, Sentinel-5P, Sentinel-2B and Sentinel-3B should follow, completing the first part of the Copernicus constellation. All the Sentinels missions are regarded as operational missions and as such require a high degree of reliability and availability also at the level of the ground segment while minimizing the operational effort associated to the routine mission phase. This in turn calls for implementation of an advanced on-board autonomy functionality and definition of an innovative operational concept aimed at minimizing ground intervention both in nominal and contingency situations. The Copernicus/Sentinels Ground Segment is composed of the Core Ground Segment, the Collaborative Ground Segment and the Copernicus contributing missions' ground segments. The Core Ground Segment monitors and controls the Sentinel spacecraft, ensures the measurement data acquisition, processing, archiving and dissemination to the final users. In addition, it is responsible for performing conflict-free mission planning according to a predefined operational scenario, and ensures the quality of data products and performance of the space-borne sensors by continuous monitoring, calibration and validation activities, guaranteeing the overall performance of the mission Within the Core Ground Segment, the FOS main responsibility encompasses the spacecraft monitoring and control, including execution of all platform activities and the commanding of the payload schedules. ESOC-Darmstadt was responsible for the design of the Sentinels FOS during the development phase, and will be in charge of operating the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-5P families during LEOP, Commissioning and Routine phase; of the Sentinel-3 LEOP and Commissioning, before handover to EUMETSAT; and of Sentinel-6 during LEOP before handover to EUMETSAT. This paper describes the assumptions and constraints that were taken when starting the definition of a “Common” Copernicus-Sentinels Flight Operations Segment. The paper will then present how the selected architecture has allowed for an incremental FOS design where new Sentinels missions can re-use the Common components and be “plugged” within ESOC FOS infrastructure, reducing testing, integration and validation time. The resulting Operational Concept applied across the Sentinels’ families operated by ESOC will be summarized, highlighting the innovative aspects and the lessons learnt. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This study investigated whether the multispectral vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient of downward irradiance (Kd) gradients could be a good framework for accessing phytoplankton genera. In situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), obtained in an Amazon Floodplain Lake (Lago Grande do Curuai), were used to invert Kd, focusing on Sentinel-3/Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor bands. After that, an analysis based on the organization of three-way tables (STATICO) was applied to evaluate the relationships between phytoplankton genera and Kd at different OLCI bands. Our results indicate that phytoplankton genera are organized according to their ability to use light intensity and different spectral ranges of visible light (400 to 700 nm). As the light availability changes seasonally, the structure of phytoplankton changes as well. Some genera, such as Microcystis, are adapted to low light intensity at 550–650 nm, therefore high values of Kd in this range would indicate the dominance of Microcysts. Other genera, such as Aulacoseira, are highly adapted to harvesting blue-green light with higher intensity and probably grow in lakes with lower concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter that highly absorbs blue light (405–498). These findings are an important step to describing phytoplankton communities using orbital data in tropical freshwater floodplains. Furthermore, this approach can be used with biodiversity indexes to access phytoplankton diversity in these environments. © 2021 by the authors.

While satellite remote sensing has often been used to estimate their distributions and abundance as well as to trace their origins, because the algae mats are often much smaller than the size of an image pixel, it is unclear to what extent they can be detected and discriminated from each other in satellite imagery. Using data collected from laboratory experiments and by the Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) satellite instruments, we conduct simulated experiments to determine the lower detection limit and discrimination limit for these two macroalgae in different water environments and under different atmospheric conditions. For OLCI, the detection limit for both macroalgae is about 0.5% of a pixel, while the discrimination limit varies between 0.8% for clear water and 2% for turbid water. For MSI, the detection limit is about 2%, while the discrimination limit is about 6% for all water types. Below these two limits, detection and discrimination of macroalgae in these regions using the two sensors are subject to large uncertainties, thus requiring additional caution when interpreting algae areas and tracing algae origins. © 2021","China; Eutrophication; Sargassum; Satellite Imagery; Ulva; China; eutrophication; Sargassum; satellite imagery; Ulva","Detection limit; Discrimination limit; East China Sea; MSI; OLCI; Remote sensing; Sargassum horneri; Ulva prolifera; Yellow sea","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102083138"

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques - a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images - were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods - based on different strategies and tools - have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.  © 2021 IEEE.","Hyperspectral imaging; Image fusion; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; Experimental comparison; Hyper-spectral images; Marine observations; Multispectral images; Qualitative analysis; Spatial resolution; State-of-the-art methods; Strategies and tools; Image analysis","Image fusion; Real data; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2 MSI; Sentinel-3 OLCI; Simulations","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112845236"

This requires an accurate separation of the surface spectral reflectance below the cloud and that coming from the ice cloud particle. In this paper, a weighting-function based method is described, which retrieves ice cloud optical thickness (COT) and ice cloud crystal effective radius (CER). The retrieval algorithm belongs to the newly developed eXtensible Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm family, and is called XBAER-ice. The XBAER-ice retrieval uses a surface reflectance parameterization minimizing the impact of surface scattering on the retrieval of optically thin ice cloud properties. A fractal model is used to describe the ice cloud optical properties. The comparison of COT and CER between XBAER-ice and latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products shows good agreement. We note that ice cloud property retrievals are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the ice particle shape. The comparison between satellite derived COTs using both the MODIS C6 product and XBAER-ice algorithm agree well with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) in-situ measurements (with correlation coefficient above 0.9) whereas CERs show poorer agreement (~0.6). The global spatial distribution patterns and values of COT from ice clouds retrieved by using the MODIS C6 and XBAER-ice algorithms show a high degree of consistency. The XBAER-ice derived ice cloud CER values are systematically smaller than the MODIS C6 product, but both products have similar spatial distribution patterns. The XBAER-ice offers a potential alternative algorithm for the synergistic operational retrieval of ice cloud properties from the observations of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3. © 2018","Atmospheric radiation; Clouds; Optical properties; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Spatial distribution; Surface scattering; Atmospheric radiation measurements; Cloud effective radius; Cloud optical thickness; Ice clouds; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Spatial distribution patterns; Surface spectral reflectance; XBAER; accuracy assessment; algorithm; atmospheric dynamics; cloud; instrumentation; MODIS; numerical model; optical property; parameter estimation; parameterization; radiometer; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; Sentinel; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; top of atmosphere; Ice","Cloud effective radius; Cloud optical thickness; Ice cloud; XBAER","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048132161"

True color and multi-spectral images at 10 m resolution are used over 50 × 50 km2 domain centered on the US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site over the Southern Great Plains to recognize green pixels and estimate the vegetation fraction. The GVF retrieved from several spectral bands is compared with Sentinel-2 true color images, Sentinel-3, MODIS vegetation products, and observations from the US DOE research aircraft on selected days from the Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems (HI-SCALE) campaign. Unlike MODIS or Sentinel-3, our approach to retrieve the GVF is independent of absolute reflectance or photosynthetic response. Spatial patterns in vegetation distribution are similar in all three satellite approaches, however MODIS underestimates the vegetation cover by about 10% compared to the Sentinel-2, -3 retrievals over the study domain. The largest contrast in MODIS and Sentinel-2, -3 is found when the GVF is less than 0.2 or greater than 0.9, likely as a result of different retrieval approaches and spectral bands used to estimate the vegetation products. The NDVI retrieved from MODIS is also underestimated compared to the aircraft observations suggesting that MODIS underestimates both NDVI and GVF. In the past, various satellite observations have been used to retrieve the vegetation fraction at medium (0.25–0.50 km) and coarser resolutions (15 km) but our approach is extended to a much higher (10 m) resolution. Our analysis from Sentinel-2 shows large spatial variability in GVF and a clear disparity with estimates from MODIS and Sentinel-3 satellites. The new approach to estimate GVF has the potential to increase spatial accuracy and precision of surface properties relevant for crop and forest management, surface and energy balance processes, and land surface parameterizations in atmospheric models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM); Green vegetation fraction; MODIS; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-3","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134182502"

We address the problem by using multi-spectral sensors, in the near-infrared (NIR) band, correlating the reflectance ratio between a dry and a wet pixel extracted from a time series of images, the C/M ratio, with five river flow-related variables: water level, river discharge, flow area, mean flow velocity and surface width. The innovative aspect of this study is the use of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Sentinel-3 satellites, compared to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) used in previous studies. Our results show that the C/M ratio from OLCI and MODIS is more correlated with the mean flow velocity than with other variables.

However, the synergies between both multi-spectral instruments are often difficult to exploit from an operational perspective. Standard pansharpening algorithms may encounter important disadvantages due to the limited intersensor data availability in actual production environments. Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3. Specifically, we define an inter-sensor image enhancement framework which combines a PCA-based component substitution pansharpening scheme with a CNN-based spatial enhancing super-resolution mapping.

Our model is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the satellites on which it was trained (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) and is able to extrapolate to sensors that it has not seen during training, such as Landsat 7, PerúSat-1, and Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Model performance is shown to improve when multiple satellites are used in training, approaching, or surpassing the performance of specialized, single-sensor models. This work is motivated by the fact that the remote sensing community has access to data taken with a huge variety of sensors. This has inevitably led to labeling efforts being undertaken separately for different sensors, which limits the performance of deep learning models, given their need for huge training sets to perform optimally. Sensor independence can enable deep learning models to utilize multiple datasets for training simultaneously, boosting performance, and making them much more widely applicable.

OC-SMART is a multi-sensor data analysis platform which supports heritage, current, and possible future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors from US, EU, Korea, Japan, and China, including SeaWiFS, Aqua/MODIS, SNPP/VIIRS, ISS/HICO, Landsat8/OLI, DSCOVR/EPIC, Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/OLCI, COMS/GOCI, GCOM-C/SGLI and FengYun-3D/MERSI2. The products provided by OC-SMART include spectral normalized remote sensing reflectances (Rrs values), chlorophyll_a (CHL) concentrations, and spectral in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) including absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton (aph), absorption coefficients due to detritus and Gelbstoff (adg) and backscattering coefficients due to particulates (bbp). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided by OC-SMART. The goal of OC-SMART is to improve the quality of global ocean color products retrieved from satellite sensors, especially under complex environmental conditions, such as coastal/inland turbid water areas and heavy aerosol loadings. Therefore, the atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean IOP algorithms in OC-SMART are driven by extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques.To simulate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances, we solve the radiative transfer equation pertinent for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. For each sensor, we have created about 13 million RT simulations and comprehensive training datasets to support the development of the machine learning AC and in-water IOP algorithms. The results, as demonstrated in this paper, are very promising. Not only does OC-SMART improve the quality of the retrieved water products, it also resolves the negative water-leaving radiance problem that has plagued heritage AC algorithms. The comprehensive training datasets created using multiple atmosphere, aerosol, and ocean IOP models ensure global and generic applicability of OC-SMART. The use of machine learning algorithms makes OC-SMART roughly 10 times faster than NASA's SeaDAS platform. OC-SMART also includes an advanced cloud screening algorithm and is resilient to the contamination by weak to moderate sunglint and cloud edges. It is therefore capable of recovering large amounts of data that are discarded by other algorithms (such as those implemented in NASA's SeaDAS package), especially in coastal areas. OC-SMART is currently available as a standalone Python package or as a plugin that can be installed in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","China; Japan; Korea; United States; Aerosols; Backscattering; Color; Data handling; Information analysis; Machine learning; NASA; Oceanography; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Satellites; Turing machines; Water absorption; Absorption co-efficient; Atmospheric corrections; Backscattering coefficients; Environmental conditions; Inherent optical properties (IOPs); Radiative transfer equations; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite ocean color sensors; absorption; aerosol; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); atmospheric correction; backscatter; Landsat; machine learning; MODIS; ocean color; satellite data; satellite sensor; SeaWiFS; Sentinel; VIIRS; Learning algorithms","Atmospheric correction; Machine learning; OC-SMART; Ocean color; Ocean IOPs; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097789181"

Although recent advances have been obtained with the use of empirical approaches for estimating chlorophyll-a in these environments, the understanding of the relationship between spectral reflectance and chlorophyll-a is based mainly on temperate and subtropical estuarine systems. The potential to apply standard NIR-Red models to productive tropical estuaries remains underexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of several approaches based on multispectral data to estimate chlorophyll-a in a productive tropical estuarine-lagoon system, using in situ measurements of remote sensing reflectance, Rrs. The possibility of applying algorithms using simulated satellite bands of modern and recent launched sensors was also evaluated. More accurate retrievals of chlorophyll-a (r2 > 0.80) based on field datasets were found using NIR-Red three-band models. In addition, enhanced chlorophyll-a retrievals were found using the two-band algorithm based on bands of recently launched satellites such as Sentinel-2/MSI and Sentinel-3/OLCI, indicating a promising application of these sensors to remotely estimate chlorophyll-a for coming decades in turbid inland waters. Our findings suggest that empirical models based on optical properties involving water constituents have strong potential to estimate chlorophyll-a using multispectral data from satellite, airborne or handheld sensors in productive tropical estuaries. © 2017 by the authors.","Chlorophyll; Infrared devices; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Tropics; Chlorophyll a; Empirical approach; In-situ measurement; Multi-spectral data; Remote sensing algorithms; Remote-sensing reflectance; Sentinel; Spectral reflectances; Estuaries","Chlorophyll-a; Remote sensing; Sentinel; Shallow productive estuary","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021160283"

Fusion of a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI datacube) with its corresponding high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI datacube) to reconstruct a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) has been a significant subject in recent years. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve a high quality of spatial and spectral information fusion. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-Scale Learning Model (called DeepSen3) of spatial-spectral information fusion based on multi-scale inception residual convolutional neural network (CNN) for more efficient hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion from ESA remote sensing satellite missions (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images). The proposed DeepSen3 fusion network was applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10, 20 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images.

The use of an incorrect bottom reflectance adversely affects the IOPs and, in part, the depth derived from inversion models. To date, an operational approach that determines the bottom reflectance from multispectral imagery is lacking; development in this area is especially paramount for locations that exhibit temporal variability in the spatial distributions of submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic microalgae. In this work, we develop a multispectral implementation of the HOPE-LUT algorithm (Hyperspectral Optimization Processing Exemplar with benthic Look Up Table), and apply the approach to MERIS imagery of the Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Overall benthic classification accuracy of this approach was 80.0%, revealing the areal coverage of benthic flora can range from 1052.3 km2 to 6169.3 km2 between years in the Exumas, GBB. Comparison of HOPE-LUT IOP retrievals to common inversion model implementations (particularly HOPE, with its default sand endmember) shows that using an incorrect bottom reflectance can lead to over-estimations in aphy(443) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm), of up to 95%, under-estimations of adg(443) (absorption coefficient of detritus and gelbstoff) up to 50%, and over-estimations of depth up to 20%. In addition, the HOPE-LUT parameterizations generate IOPs within the range of those measured in situ. We demonstrate that, at the scale of a MERIS pixel, the dominant substrates of seagrass, unattached bottom macroalgae and benthic microalgae are spectrally unresolvable at the depths that these classes occur in the GBB. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of commonly used atmospheric corrections algorithms for bathymetry estimation and benthic classification accuracy. The combined benthic classification and inversion scheme presented here is autonomous, i.e., it does not require scene-specific thresholds or modifications. Thus, it should be portable to Sentinel 3 OLCI and potentially MODIS Aqua imagery to obtain a continuous time series of changes in IOPs and benthic cover for the shallow waters over the Great Bahama Bank. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Atlantic Ocean; Great Bahama Bank; Algae; Continuous time systems; Image classification; Microorganisms; Optical properties; Remote sensing; Substrates; Table lookup; Absorption co-efficient; Atmospheric corrections; Bathymetry estimations; Classification accuracy; Inherent optical properties (IOPs); Multi-spectral imagery; Shallow water environment; Submerged aquatic vegetations; accuracy assessment; algorithm; bathymetry; benthos; image classification; MERIS; microalga; MODIS; optical property; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shallow water; spatial distribution; spectral reflectance; temporal variation; Reflection","Atmospheric correction; Bathymetry; Benthic classification; Great Bahama Bank; Inherent optical properties; MERIS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088920988"

In 2005 AIM started to provide the competences also for space applications like IR detector units for the SLSTR instrument on board of the Sentinel 3 satellite, the hyperspectral SWIR Imager for EnMAP or pushbroom detectors for high resolution Earth observation satellites. Meanwhile AIM delivered more than 25 Flight Models for several customers. The first European pulse-tube cooler ever operating on-board of a satellite is made by AIM. AIM homes the required infrared core capabilities such as design and manufacturing of focal plane assemblies, detector housing technologies, development and manufacturing of cryocoolers and also data processing for thermal IR cameras under one roof which enables high flexibility to react to customer needs and assures economical solutions. Cryogenically cooled Hg(1-x)CdxTe (MCT) quantum detectors are unequalled for applications requiring high imaging as well as high radiometric performance in the infrared spectral range. Compared with other technologies, they provide several advantages, such as the highest quantum efficiency, lower power dissipation compared to photoconductive devices and fast response times, hence outperforming micro-bolometer arrays. However, achieving an excellent MCT detector performance at long (LWIR) and very long (VLWIR) infrared wavelengths is challenging due to the exponential increase in the thermally generated photodiode dark current with increasing cut-off wavelength and / or operating temperature. Dark current is a critical design driver, especially for LWIR / VLWIR multi-spectral imagers with moderate signal levels or hyper-spectral Fourier spectrometers operating deep into the VLWIR spectral region. Consequently, low dark current (LDC) technologies are the prerequisite for future scientific space and earth observation missions. Aiming, for example at exoplanet or earth atmospheric spectral analysis, significant improvement in LWIR / VLWIR detector material performance is mandatory. LDC material optimization can target different directions of impact: (i) reduction of dark current for a given operational temperature to increase SNR and reduce thermally induced signal offset variations. (ii) operation at elevated temperatures at a given dark current level to reduce mass and power budget of the required cryocooler and to reduce cryostat complexity. (iii) increase the accessible cut-off wavelength at constant detector temperature and dark current level. This paper presents AIM's latest results on n-on-p as well as p-on-n low dark current planar MCT photodiode focal plane detector arrays at cut-off wavelengths >11 μm at 80 K. Dark current densities below Tennant's 'Rule07'1 have been demonstrated for n-on-p and p-on-n devices.

The fluxes are derived at two spatial resolution: fine (20 m) and coarse (around 1 km). At both resolutions the thermal observations from Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on Sentinel-3 and optical observations from Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 are used within a Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) modelling scheme. For the fine resolution estimates, the thermal observations acquired by SLSTR at around 1 km resolution are sharpened using high-resolution (20 m) optical observations taken by MSI and a machine learning algorithm. The results indicate that it is possible to derive fluxes with similar accuracy at both spatial scales, while obtaining more detailed separation of fluxes originating from individual landscape features at the fine scale. © 2018 IEEE","","Land-surface energy fluxes; Machine learning; Sentinel-2; Sentinel-3; Thermal sharpening","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063161439"

However, robust retrieval algorithms still havel to be developed based on a full understanding of light interaction with plastic litter and the other optically active constituents of the atmosphere-water system. To this end, we performed laboratory-based hyperspectral reflectance measurements of submerged macroplastics under varying water clarity conditions (clear - 0 mg/L, moderate - 75 mg/L, very turbid - 321.3 mg/L) and submersion depths. This comprehensive optical dataset was used (i) to relate the plastic-related signal to submersion depth and turbidity parameters, and (ii) to investigate the top-of-atmosphere signal through full radiative transfer calculations. Simulated TOA radiation was used to explore the nominal pixel and spectral requirements based on WorldView-3, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 missions with very high to moderate geo-spatial resolutions. Results showed that plastics remained detectable when submerged in the top ∼1 m of the water column regardless of water clarity conditions. At TOA, uncertainties attached to atmospheric correction were shown to be reasonable and acceptable for plastic detection purposes in the infrared part of the spectrum (> 700 nm). The impact of aerosols on the TOA signal was found to be complex as (i) over large plastic patches. The aerosols produced little impact on satellite observations mostly due to adjacency effects and (ii) optical signature from isolated/small extent plastic patches was critically altered suggesting the atmospheric transmittance should be accurately corrected for in plastic detection algorithms. The sensitivity analyses also revealed that the narrow band widths of Sentinel-3 did not improve detection performance compared to the WorldView-3 coarser band widths. It is proposed that high spatial resolution wavebands such as the pan-chromatic could be advantageously explored for submerged plastic monitoring applications. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement","Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Aquatic environments; Band width; Condition; Critical asset; Multi-spectral; Retrieval algorithms; Satellite remote sensing; Top of atmospheres; Water clarity; Water depth; Aerosols","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129415348"

It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel-3 and GIS.

The proposed VISible-to-thermal IR micro-SATellite (VISIR-SAT) mission addresses many of these limitations, providing multi-spectral imaging data with medium-to-high spatial resolution (80m GSD from 800 km altitude) in the thermal infrared (up to 6 TIR bands, between 8 and 11μm) and in the mid infrared (1 or 2 MIR bands, at 4μm). These MIR/TIR bands will be co-registered with simultaneously acquired high spatial resolution (less than 30 m GSP) visible and near infrared multi-spectral imaging data. To enhance the spatial resolution of the MIR/TIR multi-spectral imagery during daytime, data fusion methods will be applied, such as the Multi-sensor Multi-resolution Technique (MMT), already successfully tested over agricultural terrain. This image processing technique will make generation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) EO products with a spatial resolution of 30 × 30 m2 possible. For high temperature phenomena such as vegetation-and peat-fires, the Fire Disturbance Essential Climate Variables (ECV) ""Active fire location"" and ""Fire Radiative Power"" will be retrieved with less than 100 m spatial resolution. Together with the effective fire temperature and the spatial extent even for small fire events the innovative system characteristics of VISIR-SAT go beyond existingand planned IR missions. The comprehensive and physically high-accuracy products from VISIR-SAT (e.g. for fire monitoring) may synergistically complement the high temperature observations of Sentinel-3 SLSTR in a unique way. Additionally, VISIR-SAT offers a very agile sensor system, which will be able to conduct intelligent and flexible pointing of the sensor's line-of-sight with the aim to provide global coverage of cloud free imagery every 5-10 days with only one satellite (using near real time cloud cover information).

In recent years, the water quality of inland water has deteriorated, the eutrophication has intensified, and the algal blooms frequently occur. The research of remote sensing inversion of PC has attracted more and more attention. Therefore, it is urgent to sort out and write a comprehensive overview paper. In this paper, 178 relevant literatures were reviewed, and the development history and trend of PC remote sensing inversion research of PC in the past 30 years (1990-2020) were comprehensively summarized from the perspectives of PC optical characteristics, development of inversion algorithms, application of satellite sensors, difficulties and interference factors of quantitative remote sensing inversion of PC. This paper helps us to understand the new ideas and new methods emerging at home and abroad, master the new development trends of PC remote sensing inversion in the future, and provide data basis for the monitoring and management of water environment, water quality and water resources. Over the past 30 years, PC remote sensing inversion study number rising, and a breakthrough in the algorithm, has a lot of classic algorithms, such as band ratio method, the baseline method, nested band ratio method, biological optical model, derivative algorithm and machine learning algorithms, algorithm successfully isolated PC spectral characteristic of absorption coefficients at wavelength of 620 nm. Decreased the influence of other optically active substances (Chla、TSM) and obtained the high precision of inversion and validation. In addition, the development of PC inversion algorithms mostly based on in situ hyperspectral data or aerial images (CASI-2, AISA Eagle). In order to meet the needs of PC concentration distribution in a certain space and frequency, satellite image data sources are mostly used. PC. There are many types of multi-spectral satellite data sources to choose, such as Landsat series, MODIS, MERIS, Sentinel-2 MSI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, etc. However, due to the more appropriate band setting, MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI are still the most used data sources for PC remote sensing inversion research. Because PC spectrum signal is weak, and vulnerable to the interference of chlorophyll a, TSM, there is still a major difficult to get an accurate estimation result. Based on the above analysis, the future development direction of PC remote sensing inversion can be summarized as the following aspects: first, an international standard measurement method is urgently needed in PC extraction testing; secondly, the development of algorithm, adhere to the mechanism research related to the inherent optical properties, and the integrating machine learning algorithm to bring higher inversion accuracy; third, the scale of study area water body in space and time will toward a larger geographical space scale, longer time series history tracing and future prediction; fourth, at the aspect of the expansion of application, PC remote sensing inversion is not limited to the quantitative estimation of cyanobacteria biomass, but will predict distribution of algal toxins and related diseases based on the relationships between these parameters and PC concentration, furtherly establish a water risk factor rating system based on remote sensing in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

Because of the multi-spectral limitation, however, it is challenging to derive bathymetry over global shallow waters without reliable mechanistic algorithms. In this contribution, we present and test a physics-based algorithm for improved retrieval of bathymetry with multi-spectral sensors. The algorithm leverages the temporal variation of water-column optical properties in two satellite measurements. By incorporating two remote sensing reflectance spectra in an optimization procedure, it enhances the spectral constraining condition for the optimization, thus leading to improved retrieval accuracy. This scheme is evaluated using synthetic multi-spectral data. It is shown that the new approach can provide accurate estimation of water depths over 0–30 m range with three types of benthic substrates (corals, seagrass, and sand) and for a wide range of water column optical properties. Based on the degree of improvement, Landsat-8 appears to be benefited the most, followed by SNPP, and then Sentinel-3. The application of the new approach is demonstrated with satellite images over shallow waters (0–30 m) dominated with coral reefs, seagrass, and sand, respectively. This proof-of-concept study confirms the promise of multi-spectral satellite sensors for accurate water depth retrieval by accounting for the temporal characteristics in multiple measurements, suggesting a path forward for the derivation of bathymetry from the existing satellites over global shallow waters. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anthozoa; Bathymetry; Optical properties; Orbits; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellites; Multiple measurements; Multispectral sensors; Ocean-color satellites; Optimization procedures; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite measurements; Shallow water bathymetry; Temporal characteristics; algorithm; bathymetric survey; Landsat; ocean color; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shallow water; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; Suomi NPP; temporal variation; water column; Hydrographic surveys","Bathymetry; Landsat-8; Remote sensing reflectance; Sentinel-3; Shallow water; SNPP; Spectral optimization; Temporal variation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089341894"

Multi-source remotely-sensed water quality monitoring can help provide effective water resource management. The research evaluates the retrieval of the water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), over optically different water types. Cross-sensor performance analysis of three satellite data sources: Sentinel-3 Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI), Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), acquired during a 45 min overpass on the Nile Delta coast on 22 March 2020 was performed. Atmospheric correction using the case 2 Regional Coast Color (C2RCC) was applied using local water temperature and salinity averages. Owing to the lack of ground-truth measurements in the coastal water, results were inter-compared with standard simultaneous color products of the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), OLCI water full resolution (WFR), and the MODIS Aqua, in order to highlight the sensor data relative performance in the Nile Delta’s coastal and inland waters. Validation of estimates was carried out for the only cloud-free MSI data available in the 18–20 September 2020 period for the Burullus Lake nearly contemporaneous with in situ measurements in the 22–25 September 2020. Inter-comparison of the retrieved parameters showed good congruence and correlation among all data in the coastal water, while this comparison returned low positive or negative correlation in the inland lake waters. In the coastal water, all investigated sensors and reference data showed Chl-a content average of 3.14 mg m−3 with a range level of 0.39–4.81 mg m−3. TSM averaged 7.66 g m−3 in the range of 6.32–10.18 g m−3. CDOM clarified mean of 0.18 m−1 in the range level of 0.13–0.30 m−1. Analysis of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) clarified that the MSI sensor was ranked first achieving the smallest MAE and RMSE for the Chl-a contents, while the EFR proved superior for TSM and CDOM estimates. Validation of results in Burullus Lake indicated a clear underestimation on average of 35.35% for the Chl-a induced by the land adjacency effect, shallow bottom depths, and the optical dominance of the TSM and the CDOM absorption intermixed in turbid water loaded with abundant green algae species and counts. The underestimation error increased at larger estimates of the algal composition/abundance (total counts, Chlorophyacea, Euglenophycaea, and Bacillariophycaea) and the biological contents (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins), arranged in decreasing order. The largest normalized RMSE estimates marked the downstream areas where the inflow of polluted water persistently brings nutrient loads of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds as well as substantial amounts of detrital particles and sediments discharged from the agricultural and industrial drains and the land use changes related to agricultural practices, resulting in the increase of water turbidity giving rise to inaccurate Chl-a estimates. © 2022 by the author.

The event marked an important milestone on the Copernicus project because the first constellation of Sentinels satellites get completed. Just after four years form the first Sentinel 1A launch, seven satellites have been put into operations to complete the prime Space Segment of the Copernicus Project. Copernicus is the most ambitious Earth observation program to date. It provides accurate, timely and easily accessible information to improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure civil security. Copernicus is the new name for the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security program, previously known as GMES. This initiative is headed by the European Commission (EC) in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel 1 constellation, a polar orbiting twin satellite mission equipped with C-band synthetic aperture radar, was launched on April the 3rd 2014 and April the 25th 2016 with a Soyuz rocket from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana. Sentinel2 constellation, a polar orbiting two satellite mission equipped with multispectral high-resolution imaging mission for land monitoring was launched Sentinel 2A on 23rd of June 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on 7th of March 2017. Sentinel 3 constellation, twin satellites always in polar orbit, 180° apart, carrying four instruments that work in synergy, a multi-spectral band instrument, a temperature radiometer, a radar altimeter, and a microware radiometer, was first delivered to Space on February the 16th 2016 and the twin satellite the 25th of April 2018. Least but not last Sentinel 5P, the Precursor of the future Sentinel 5 constellation, was launched in October the 13th 2017, with a Rockot launcher from Plesetsk, Russia. Currently all are in operations delivering valid and precious science data to the User Community. In fact most of the prime Copernicus services have been activated and relay on precise, continuous and reliable data from Sentinels satellites, among other data (third-party satellites, ground instruments, etc). The federation of seven satellites have been delivered under the control of the European Space Operation Center located here in Darmstadt, making use of different launch pads and rockets, but sharing the same Ground Segment infrastructure. For all Sentinel satellites ESOC took care of the LEOP operations and early commissioning. In most of the cases ESOC is also responsible of the routine operations; Sentinel 3 constellation is with EUMETSAT operation center located always in Darmstadt. The ESOC Flight Dynamics Unit then delivered the LEOP flight dynamic services for all Sentinels and it is currently operating all Sentinels under ESOC control in routine phase. It is therefore time for our Copernicus Flight Dynamics Unit to evaluate and compare retrospectively all operations done so far during LEOP and routine phase. In this paper we will start form a general overview of each Sentinel constellation to highlight commonalities and peculiarities of each Sentinel from Flight Dynamics prospective. Not all satellites are the same. Facts and Figures of each constellation are briefly reported highlighting elements which are driving risk assessment and costs in operations. Finally operations across Sentinels are compared, in particular orbit maintenance maneuvers and Space Debris operations. Some considerations of the LEOP operations are highlighted which are driving factor in defining an orbit injection and a reference orbit acquisition plan, in particular trade-off between reliability and cost-effective operations. And with the same emphasis some aspects of our Space Debris policy and procedures are analyzed, which are today a limiting factor in reducing costs in operations. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The resultant tool will support existing sensor-to-sensor cross-calibration activities carried out under the auspices of CEOS, and is also being used to inform the design specifications for TRUTHS. © 2017 The Authors","Climate change; Earth (planet); Infrared imaging; Observatories; Orbits; Radiometry; Reliability analysis; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Thermography (imaging); Uncertainty analysis; Calibration site; Cross calibration; Earth observation satellites; Operational land imager; Radiometric uncertainties; TRUTHS; Uncertainty contributors; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; accuracy assessment; calibration; climate change; pixel; radiometric method; satellite sensor; spatial analysis; uncertainty analysis; Calibration","Inter-sensor cross-calibration; Pseudo Invariant Calibration Site (PICS); Radiometric uncertainty; TRUTHS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023598665"

In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors, originally designed for agriculture applications, have also enabled water-quality studies of coastal waters. However, since the sea surface is constantly changing, commonly used photogrammetric methods fail when applied to UAV images captured over water areas. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of a five-band multispectral sensor mounted on a UAV to derive scientifically valuable water parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and total suspended solids (TSS), including a new Python workflow for the manual generation of an orthomosaic in aquatic areas exclusively based on the sensor’s metadata. We show water-quality details in two different sites along the Maltese coastline on the centimetre-scale, improving the existing approximations that are available for the region through Sentinel-3 OLCI imagery at a much lower spatial resolution of 300 m. The Chl-a and TSS values derived for the studied regions were within the expected ranges and varied between 0 to 3 mg/m3 and 10 to 20 mg/m3, respectively. Spectral comparisons were also carried out along with some statistics calculations such as RMSE, MAE, or bias in order to validate the obtained results. © 2022 by the authors.","Antennas; Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Image enhancement; Python; Surface waters; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Water quality; Aerial vehicle; Chlorophyll a; Coastal waters; Multi-spectral; Multispectral sensors; Remote-sensing; Total suspended solids; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Water mosaicking; Water quality monitoring; Remote sensing","chlorophyll-a; multispectral; remote sensing; total suspended solids; unmanned aerial vehicles; water mosaicking; water quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145973130"

The fused image can have complementary spatial and spectral resolution characteristics. We suggest a method for fusion of data from Sentinel-2 multi spectral imager (MSI) and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI). In the visible range MSI measures radiance with 10 m resolution at 490, 560 and 665 nm; with 20 m resolution at 705 nm; and with 60 m resolution at 443 nm. In the visible range OLCI measures with 300 m spatial resolution at 400, 412, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, 673, 681, 708 nm.
