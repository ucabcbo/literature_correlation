Identifying the presence of cloud and establishing an accurate cloud cover results is a challenging task. Here, we use data from the PARASOL satellite data. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm to detect cloud based on multi-spectrum and polarization characteristics of the polarization images. This uses the new dynamic thresholds obtained by statistics for different atmosphere models and underlying surfaces in different time and areas. Aiming at improving the accuracy of the final cloud detection, especially for those special scenes, such as bright land surface and severe haze. Also, an ice/snow detection algorithm has been adapted from the cloud detection algorithm. A validation for the new cloud detection results has been carried out. In comparisons with other satellite instruments, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO) and CloudSat. Experiment results show the new dynamic cloud detection algorithm has obvious advantages over the official cloud detection algorithm to the whole track results in accuracy, especially when in some areas covered by the bright cloud-free objects. The overall accuracy compared with CloudSat/CALIPSO is 95.07%. The new algorithm improves the accuracy of cloud detection results and constructs a new theoretical model for the cloud detection algorithm of the multi-angle polarization satellite image, such as the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) launched onboard the GF-5 (GaoFen-5) Satellite. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clouds; Polarization; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Signal detection; Cloud detection; Cloud detection algorithms; Dynamic threshold; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-spectrum; PARASOL; Polarization characteristics; Radiative transfer model; algorithm; CALIPSO; cloud cover; CloudSat; detection method; PARASOL; polarization; radiative transfer; satellite imagery; threshold; Image enhancement","Cloud detection; Dynamic threshold; Multi-spectrum and polarization; PARASOL","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055654479"

However, sampling the bidirectional reflectance of forest canopies at a small fixed angular interval over a certain observation plane is still difficult at present, and capturing hotspot and dark spot images is especially challenging. The objectives of this study are (1) to obtain bidirectional hyperspectral reflectance images, including hotspot and dark spot, at the principal plane for two conifer forest canopies, (2) to analyze the observed canopy BRDF characteristics, and (3) to compare and validate the observation with four-scale geometric optical model simulation. The two coniferous forest sites are located in the Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm in Hebei Province in northern China. A multiangle hyperspectral observation method was developed on the basis of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging platform. A hyperspectral imaging sensor was mounted on the multirotor UAV with a rotatable gimbal. The View Zenith Angle (VZA) of the hyperspectral sensor was controlled by adjusting the pitch angle of the gimbal at each observation point over the flight of the UAV. The VZAs ranged from 60° backward to 60° forward with an interval of 10°, along with the hotspot and dark spot angles. The observed UAV images were processed from digital numbers to reflectance by using a standard gray panel with known reflectance placed in the observation area. The UAV images were then resampled to 60 m to examine the reflectance at the canopy scale. Canopy reflectance was also simulated with the four-scale model and compared with the observation. Bidirectional reflectance, including hotspot and dark spot, images of conifer forest canopies were effectively observed using the developed multiangle UAV observation method. This method has the advantage of making hyperspectral and multiangular observations at the same time. The canopy reflectance values are higher at backward observation and highest at the hotspot direction compared with those at forward directions. The observed BRDF shapes differ at the two study sites with different canopy structure and leaf optical properties. The bowl effect with increasing reflectance with VZA is observed when the VZAs are larger than 40°. The results are as follows: (1) The BRDF shapes and canopy reflectance simulated using a four-scale model are consistent with the observation, except for a minimal underestimation at the hotspot in the red spectral bands and some deviation in the near infrared (NIR) bands at large VZAs in the forward direction; (2) The BRDF shapes differ in forests with different canopy structure and leaf optical properties; (3) The observed bidirectional reflectance of the two coniferous forests demonstrates distinct spectral variability of BRDF effects. The reflectance anisotropy is highest in the red bands and lowest in the NIR bands; and (4) Anisotropy of vegetation indices, including normalized difference vegetation index, photochemical reflectance index, MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index, and enhanced vegetation index, is observed due to the spectral variability of BRDF effects. The multiangle UAV platform is able to capture bidirectional reflectance images effectively, especially in the hotspot and dark spot directions. Compared with satellite-based, aerial, and tower- or ground-based multiangle observation methods, the UAV platform is more effective and flexible with a much lower labor and financial cost. However, the application of this UAV platform at a large spatial scale is limited due to the small coverage of UAV images compared with satellite images. The multiangle UAV platform has great potential in the research of bidirectional characteristics of various targets. © 2021, Science Press.

Assessing the uncertainties associated with these LAI products is essential for their proper application. In validation activities, LAI reference maps serve as the bridge to upscale the field measurements to coarse resolution. Currently, the temporally continuous validation is attracting increasing attention. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for the temporally continuous LAI reference maps. However, two main problems hinder the generation of temporally continuous LAI reference maps: 1) How to obtain temporally continuous field measurements, effectively and inexpensively? 2) How to obtain temporally continuous and fine spatial resolution satellite images which are synchronous with the field measurements? This paper proposed a method to address the above two problems based on the combination of the wireless sensor network technology and a data blending approach. Firstly, the temporally continuous effective LAI was obtained through the analysis of multi-angle gap fraction measured by LAINet observation system (developed with wireless sensor network technology), and the temporally continuous NDVI was reconstructed through CACAO (Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations, a data blending approach). Then, a transfer function relating reconstructed NDVI to field measured LAI was calibrated through exponential function fitting. Finally, the temporally continuous LAI reference maps were generated by applying the calibrated transfer function to the reconstructed NDVI. Performances of the proposed method were evaluated over a crop site. Results show that the reconstructed LAI reference maps agree well with the original LAI reference maps derived from the Landsat-8 OLI NDVI (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.27 at 30 m resolution, R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.09 at 1 km resolution). The derived temporally continuous LAI reference maps were then used as benchmark to validate the MOD15A2 LAI product. Generally, the MOD15A2 LAI has a relatively high accuracy (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.31), and captures the overall vegetation phenology well. But its value shows an obvious underestimation with a bias of −0.30. The results of this study contribute to the assessment of temporal dynamics of uncertainty in LAI products, which will benefit the long-term vegetation monitoring and data assimilation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","data assimilation; land surface; Landsat; leaf area index; map; model validation; MODIS; NDVI; observational method; phenology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; transfer function","Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations (CACAO); LAINet observation system; Leaf area index (LAI); Temporal continuity; Validation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000631005"

Traditional methods require a large number of ground control points(GCPs) which consuming lots of manpower and financial resources. With the resolution up to 0.8m, the original geo-positioning accuracy of the Chinese Gaofen(GF-2) multi-angle imagery is about 90m which means a limited application in geometric processing. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the geometric performance of the multi-angle satellite imagery based on the geometric error sources of this experimental dataset without GCPs. Under the condition of weak intersection of our test dataset, we use a DEM-assisted approach to acquire a more accurate initial position accuracy of all tie points, and all extracted data is clustered by the Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN) algorithm in order to eliminate points or impages with large positioning error automatically. Then, the error-based block adjustment model are proposed and investigated to improved the geometric performance of the experimental dataset. Based on our proposed method, 142 multi-angle GF-2 satellite images covering the western Beijing area are experimented and the root mean square error(RMSE) of the geometric accuracy is improved up to about 12m in plane and 6m in height, which shows a significantly improvement in geo-positioning accuracy of these multi-angle GF-2 remote sensing imagery. © 2019 IEEE.","Errors; Geology; Geometry; Large dataset; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Statistical tests; Block adjustment; DBSCAN; Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; geometric performance; Ground control points; Multi angle; Remote sensing imagery; Root mean square errors; Image enhancement","DBSCAN; error-based block adjustment; geometric performance; multi-angle; RFM","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077724155"

Local anomalies of wind, waves, currents or surfactants appear on the images as local anomalies of brightness. A quantitative interpretation of those brightness anomalies must relate them to slope properties of the wave field, which are to the lowest order described by the mean square slope (mss). The prevailing paradigm for such interpretation is that of the critical zenith angle. It states that, for sub-critical zenith view angle, brightness and mss anomalies have opposite signs, and this defines the so-called inversion region. This prevailing paradigm implicitly builds on the assumption that the mss decomposition between upwind and crosswind components is conserved. The mss anomalies are then isotropic and can be reduced to a scalar (i.e. one-dimensional) quantity. In such a case, one single sunglint image would be sufficient to retrieve the mss anomaly. This isotropic case likely applies for surface wave changes induced by varying wind speed or by surfactants. Yet, satellite and airborne observations at multiple view angles recently revealed anisotropic mss anomalies, e.g. with mss increase in the upwind direction and decrease in the crosswind direction. This anisotropic behavior likely characterizes wave modulations by anisotropic surface current gradients. This paper details the expected properties of such anisotropic mss modulations. It is shown that: 1) The classical concept of critical angle does not systematically hold, neither for frontal current shear nor for internal wave divergence. 2) At least two sunglint images at different zenith and azimuth angles are needed to retrieve the mss anomalies, and a single observation is not sufficient. 3) A satellite with radiometers looking at multiple zenith angles is capable of providing a geometry favorable to retrieve mss anomalies. An illustration is discussed with internal waves observed by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), where the upwind and crosswind components of the retrieved mss anomalies are anisotropic. Those results provide guidelines to interpret available observations and to help refine strategy for future satellite missions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Anisotropy; Luminance; Modulation; Oceanography; Radiometers; Salinity measurement; Satellites; Surface active agents; Surface roughness; Surface waters; Surface waves; Synthetic aperture radar; Wind; Mean square slopes; Multi angle; SAR Images; Sea surface roughness; Sun glint; Surface current; Surface slope; Wave current interaction; brightness temperature; data interpretation; decomposition analysis; image resolution; MISR; observational method; quantitative analysis; radiometer; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea surface; surfactant; synthetic aperture radar; turbulence; wave-current interaction; zenith angle; Shear flow","Mean square slope; Multi-angle radiometers; SAR images; Sea surface roughness; Submesoscale turbulence; Sun glint imagery; Surface current gradients; Surface slope distribution; Surfactants; Wave-current interaction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049329024"

The boundary of a lake can be extracted from the remote sensing satellite image or the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) orthophoto, but the information of the lake and its surroundings, which is supposed to be three-dimensional, is recorded in two dimensions in this way. When the tall and dense vegetation are projected on the lake, the extracted lake boundary from orthophoto would be smaller than reality, which results in lower value of the lake water storage. UAV oblique photogrammetry can solve this problem by recording multi-angle images of the lake and its surroundings. Based on aerial photogrammetry theory, a real 3D model of the lake can be constructed by combing UAV oblique photogrammetric images. The model can accurately present the actual scene of the lake, and the extracted lake boundary can be very close to reality. In this study, UAV and Unmanned Surface Boats (USB) have been employed to collect UAV oblique photogrammetric images and lakebed terrain data, respectively. The lake boundary has been extracted based on the UAV real 3D model. The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of lakebed terrain has been built based on lakebed terrain data collected by USB. Finally, the water storage of the lake is estimated based on the boundary and DEM. Experiments show that a real 3D model based on UAV data can depict lake boundaries accurately, which could eliminate the impact of vegetation shied around the lake. Utilizing the UAV and USB can be a standard method for estimating the water storages of small lakes. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","lake water; orthophoto; photogrammetry; three-dimensional modeling; unmanned vehicle; water storage","lake; real 3D model; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); Unmanned Surface Boat (USB); water storage","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114895959"

However, most of these existing studies conclude assessments based only on a few/single stereo-images lacking a systematic evaluation on how robust DL methods are on satellite stereo-images with varying radiometric and geometric configurations. This paper provides an evaluation of four DL stereomatching methods through hundreds of multi-date multi-site satellite stereopairs with varying geometric configurations, against the traditional well-practiced Census-semi-global matching (SGM), to comprehensively understand their accuracy, robustness, generalisation capabilities, and their practical potential. The DL methods include a learning-based cost metric through convolutional neural networks (MC-CNN) followed by SGM, and three end-to-end (E2E) learning models using Geometry and Context Network (GCNet), Pyramid Stereo Matching Network (PSMNet), and LEAStereo. Our experiments show that E2E algorithms can achieve upper limits of geometric accuracies, while may not generalise well for unseen data. The learning-based cost metric and Census-SGM are rather robust and can consistently achieve acceptable results. All DL algorithms are robust to geometric configurations of stereopairs and are less sensitive in comparison to the Census-SGM, while learning-based cost metrics can generalise on satellite images when trained on different datasets (airborne or ground-view). © 2022 The Authors.

Therefore, cloud detection of remote sensing images is an indispensable part of image preprocessing and image availability screening. Aiming at the lack of short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands in ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images resulting in the poor detection effect, considering the obvious differ-ence in geographic height between cloud and ground surface objects, this paper proposes a thick and thin cloud detection method combining spectral information and digital height model (DHM) based on multi-scale features-convolutional neural network (MF-CNN) model. To verify the importance of DHM height information in cloud detection of ZY-3 multi-angle remote sensing images, this paper implements cloud detection comparison of the data set with and without DHM height information based on the MF-CNN model. The experimental results show that the ZY-3 multi-angle image with DHM height information can effectively improve the confusion between highlighted surface and thin cloud, which also means the assistance of DHM height information can make up for the disadvantage of high-resolution image lacking short wave infrared and thermal infrared bands. © 2022 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Image enhancement; Infrared radiation; Neural network models; Object detection; Remote sensing; Actual use; Cloud detection; Convolutional neural network; Digital height models; Multi-angle remote sensing; Multi-scale features; Neural network model; Remote sensing images; Short wave infrared; Thermal infrared bands; artificial neural network; detection method; image processing; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; ZiYuan; Convolutional neural networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147330204"

The large uncertainty of the magnitude of global warming is dominated by the possible cooling effect of particulate air pollution, which makes the clouds brighter and allows them to live longer, thereby reflecting more solar radiation and energy back to space. This cooling effect counters part of the warming due to the manmade emissions of greenhouse gasses such as C02 and methane, but to a poorly known extent. This uncertainty did not change substantially within the succession of 5 reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) during the recent decades. The fundamental cause for this stagnation in our inability to use satellites to globally quantify the aerosol effect on clouds and, consequently, the Earth energy budget, stems from the fact that cloud properties are determined primarily by the rising air that cools aloft and condenses the excess moisture into cloud drops. The aerosol particles are the sites on which the cloud drops form, thus clouds in polluted air are composed of larger numbers of smaller drops, which are slower to coalesce into raindrops and result in longer living and brighter clouds that reflect more solar energy back to space. An emerging new capability to measure both updraft speeds and aerosols that can nucleate cloud drops can provide a clear vision to the future, which hopefully will lead to informed decision making. Here we show new ways to perform these critical satellite measurements that were considered impossible until now. This is done in part by novel use of existing satellites, and by development of a new satellite mission, in cooperation with NASA. The new mission is designed to measure cloud vertical motions by mapping the time evolution of the topography of cloud tops by photogrammetric methods that will be applied to multi-angle overlapping high resolution satellite images. Early results show the feasibility of measuring both updrafts and CCN. This represents the beginning of a revolution in the way that we will use satellites for weather and climate applications. This will improve predictions at all scales, from predicting weather at a scale of several hours to predicting possible climate changes at scales of decades and beyond.","Aerosols; Budget control; Climate change; Decision making; Drops; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; NASA; Reconfigurable hardware; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Solar energy; Aerosol particles; High resolution satellite images; Informed decision; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Man-made emissions; Particulate air pollution; Satellite measurements; Satellite observations; Weather satellites","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991826681"

Thus, remote sensing is no longer far away. With the rapid development of aerospace and aviation remote sensing technology, a new era of three-dimensional, multi-level, multi-angle, omni-directional, and all-weather earth observation has arrived. How to activate the value of data and better serve industry applications so as to meet the rapidly growing demand for remote sensing applications has become an urgent issue for remote sensing companies. As a bridge between remote sensing data and industry applications, remote sensing image processing software plays an irreplaceable role in the process of remote sensing industrialization. With the implementation of major strategic projects such as ""China's High-Resolution Earth Observation System"" (high-score special project) and ""National Medium-term to Long-term Civilian Space Infrastructure Development Plan (2015-2025)"", domestic high-score remote sensing data is becoming more abundant. Whether these valuable data can play its value and how much value it can play depends on the conversion process from high-scoring remote sensing data to effective information and application services. The value of remote sensing data requires excellent remote sensing image processing software for mining and analysis. At the same time, vigorously developing independent and controllable remote sensing image processing software has increasingly become an urgent requirement to ensure national information security, implement the strategy of aerospace power, enhance technological innovation, and serve social development. Through the research and analysis of the development process of remote sensing satellite data and remote sensing software in China and abroad, the domestic remote sensing software has experienced three stages of development: the budding period, the catch-up period, and the independent innovation period. The remote sensing image processing software pixel information expert (PIE) is taken as an example to illustrate the development progress, typical applications, and future technological development directions of domestic remote sensing software. PIE, a domestically made remote sensing image processing software, was independently developed by PIESAT Information Technology Co., Ltd. (http: //www.piesat.cn/). While opening the application of cloud service platform, PIE has evolved from a single general-purpose software plug-in architecture to 3S integration, multi-platform, and multi-load cluster processing; from pure satellite remote sensing image processing to aerospace integrated platform; and from optical load to application mode of optics, radar, and hyperspectral full spectrum. PIE6.0 has developed from a general remote sensing image processing software to PIE-Basic remote sensing image processing software, PIE-Ortho satellite image surveying and mapping processing software, PIE-SAR radar image data processing software, PIE-Hyp hyperspectral image data processing software, PIE-UAV unmanned aerial vehicle image data processing software, PIE-SIAS scale set image analysis software, PIE-AI remote sensing image intelligent processing software, PIE-Map geographic information system software, and many other ""families"". PIE6.0 has five core capabilities: comprehensive support for multi-source remote sensing loads, intelligent extraction of full-spectrum element information, deep integration of multi-industry and full-business chains, rapid processing of massive remote sensing data, and complete control of independent property rights programs. In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for remote sensing applications, we should build an intelligent, high-performance, and practical remote sensing image processing system; provide a wider, more refined, and more in-depth special service; and gradually develop and improve market mechanisms to establish sustainable development of remote sensing industry capabilities. Domestic remote sensing software continues to develop key technologies, such as remote sensing spatiotemporal big data storage management, intelligent synthesis, incremental cascading update, cleaning analysis and mining, and information security, to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing and knowledge mining and decision support capabilities and to build shared data and codes. The open platform of methods promotes multi-source heterogeneous data sharing and interoperability. In the future, domestic remote sensing software will closely follow industry applications and public needs, advanced technology integration and collaboration, remote sensing on-orbit intelligent real-time processing, and one-stop refined remote sensing cloud services. PIE will continue to increase the contribution rate of science and technology; promote the modernization of remote sensing application capabilities; strengthen the cross-integration of remote sensing applications with big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and other cutting-edge technologies; continue to improve remote sensing data analysis and processing, knowledge discovery, and decision support capabilities; and realize the on-demand acquisition of remote sensing data, the rapid transmission of data, and the focused services of thematic information, so that multi-source remote sensing data can truly become a powerful weapon to promote resource investigation, environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and so on. © 2021, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

Satellite remote sensing is presented as a feasible means in order to monitor these forests. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is amongst major tools for studying this region. Nevertheless, MODIS operative surface variable retrieval was reported to be impacted by cloud contamination effects. A proper cloud masking is a major consideration in order to ensure accuracy when analysing Amazonian tropical forests current and future status. In the present study, the potential of supervised machine learning algorithms in order to overcome this issue is evaluated. In front of global operative MODIS cloud masking algorithms (MYD35 and the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC)) these algorithms benefit from the fact that they can be optimized to properly represent the local cloud conditions of the region. Models considered were: Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These algorithms are able to provide a continuous measure of cloud masking uncertainty (i.e. a probability estimate of each pixel belonging to clear and cloudy class) and therefore can be used for probabilistic cloud masking. Truth reference dataset (a priori knowledge) requirement was satisfied by considering the collocation of Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) observations with MODIS sensor. Model performance was tested using three independent datasets: 1) collocated CPR/CALIOP and MODIS data, 2) MODIS manually classified images and 3) in-situ ground data. For satellite image and in-situ testing results were additionally compared to current operative MYD35 (version 6.1) and MAIAC cloud masking algorithms. Satellite image and in-situ testing results show that machine learning algorithms are able to improve MODIS operative cloud masking performance over the region. MYD35 and MAIAC tend to underestimate and overestimate the cloud cover over the study region, respectively. Amongst the models considered, probabilistic algorithms (LDA, GNB and in less extent QDA) provided better performance than RF, SVM and MLP machine learning algorithms as they were able to better deal with the viewing conditions limitation that resulted from collocating MODIS and CPR/CALIOP observations. In particular, best performance was obtained for LDA with a difference in Kappa coefficient (model minus MODIS operative algorithm) of 0.293/0.155 (MYD35/MAIAC, respectively) considering satellite image testing validation. Worst performance was obtained for MLP with a difference in Kappa coefficient of 0.175/0.037. For in-situ testing, models overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient values are higher than MYD35/MAIAC respective values. Models are computationally efficient (swath image calculation time between 0.37 and 9.49 s) and thus being able to be implanted for remote-sensing vegetation retrieval processing chains over the Amazonian tropical forests. LDA stands out as the best candidate because of its maximum accuracy and minimum computational associated. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Amazonia; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Image enhancement; Machine learning; Optical radar; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarizations; Computationally efficient; Linear discriminant analysis; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-angle implementation of atmospheric corrections; Quadratic discriminant analysis; Satellite remote sensing; Supervised machine learning; algorithm; cloud cover; computer simulation; evergreen forest; machine learning; MODIS; satellite data; satellite imagery; support vector machine; tropical forest; Learning algorithms","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068638824"
