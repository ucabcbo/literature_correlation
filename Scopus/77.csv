By fully utilizing the correlation between SAR image patches, the synthesized sea-ice imagery can not only successfully preserve the non-homogeneous textures and multi-scale structural characteristics, but also approach more realistic-looking SAR sea-ice imagery. Based on region-based posterior sampling, the algorithm first adaptively selects the synthesis region size according to the similarity between image patches and obtains the best matching patches; then, the minimum error boundary cut path at the boundary of adjacent patches is calculated to achieve seamless splicing and eliminate artificial defects. The experiments on real SAR sea-ice imagery indicate that compared with existing algorithms the proposed algorithm can synthesize more natural SAR sea-ice imagery and ground-truth map. The synthesized images have a positive significance to the evaluation of arctic SAR sea-ice image segmentation and classification algorithm.","Defects; Image segmentation; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Adaptive; Artificial defects; Cut-path; Ground truth; Image synthesis; Radar imaging","Adaptive; Artificial defect; Ground-truth map; Minimum error boundary cut path; Sea-ice image synthesis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908045691"
