The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI. Linear regression models are created for the estimation of FYI and MYI roughness from NDAI, and FYI roughness from backscatter. Results suggest that using a combination of Sentinel-1 backscatter for FYI and MISR NDAI for MYI may be optimal for mapping winter sea-ice roughness in the CAA. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, continuous observations in the Canada Basin from March through December 2014 were used to investigate spatial differences and temporal changes in under-ice roughness and momentum transfer as the ice cover evolved seasonally. Observations of wind, ice, and ocean properties from four clusters of drifting instrument systems were complemented by direct drill-hole measurements and instrumented overhead flights by NASA operation IceBridge in March, as well as satellite remote sensing imagery about the instrument clusters. Spatially, directly estimated ice-ocean drag coefficients varied by a factor of three with rougher ice associated with smaller multi-year ice floe sizes embedded within the first-year-ice/multi-year-ice conglomerate. Temporal differences in the ice-ocean drag coefficient of 20–30% were observed prior to the mixed layer shoaling in summer and were associated with ice concentrations falling below 100%. The ice-ocean drag coefficient parameterization was found to be invalid in September with low ice concentrations and small ice floe sizes. Maximum momentum transfer to the ice occurred for moderate ice concentrations, and transfer to the ocean for the lowest ice concentrations and shallowest stratification. Wind work and ocean work on the ice were the dominant terms in the kinetic energy budget of the ice throughout the melt season, consistent with free drift conditions. Overall, ice topography, ice concentration, and the shallow summer mixed layer all influenced mixed layer currents and the transfer of momentum within the air-ice-ocean system. The observed changes in momentum transfer show that care must be taken to determine appropriate parameterizations of momentum transfer, and imply that the future Arctic system could become increasingly seasonal. © 2017 The Author(s).

We have developed a method for mapping sea ice surface roughness using angular reflectance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness < 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice. Because of its coarser spatial scale, MISR-estimated roughness data have a variance about half that of ATM roughness data. © 2019 by the authors.","","MISR; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059938096"

Physical roughness measurements using ship- and helicopter-based laser systems combined with ship-based active microwave backscattering (C-band polarimetric coherences) and dual-polarized passive microwave emission (polarization ratio, PR and spectral gradient ratios, GR at 37 and 89 GHz) are presented to study diverse sea ice types found in the MIZ. Autocorrelation functions are investigated for different sea ice roughness types. Small-scale roughness classes were discriminated using data from a ship-based laser profiler. The polarimetric coherence parameter ρHHVH, is not found to exhibit any observable sensitivity to the surface roughness for all incidence angles. Rubble-ridges, pancake ice, snow-covered frost flowers, and dense frost flowers exhibit separable signatures using GR-H and GR-V at >70° incidence angles. This paper diagnosed changes in sea ice roughness on a spatial scale of ~0.1-4000 m and on a temporal scale of ~1-240 days (ice freeze-up to summer melt). The coupling of MIZ wave roughness and aerodynamic roughness in conjunction with microwave emission and backscattering are future avenues of research. Additionally, the integration of various datasets into thermodynamic evolution model of sea ice will open pathways to successful development of inversion models of MIZ behavior. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Backscattering; Meteorological instruments; Microwaves; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Ships; Surface roughness; Arctic; Data assimilation; Laser profilers; Passive microwaves; Scatterometers; data assimilation; laser; marginal ice zone; microwave radiation; remote sensing; roughness; scatterometer; sea ice; Ice","Arctic; Data assimilation; Laser profiler; Passive microwave; Scatterometer; Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929629302"

Compared with the traditional remote sensing which only views the ground surface in one direction, multi-angle remote sensing provides angle-dimensional information and improves the capability of obtaining vegetation structure parameters. It helps to improve the retrieval accuracy of key biophysical parameters and provides better data support for the research of ecological environment and climate change. After a detailed analysis of the publications in multi-angle remote sensing, we summarize the basic concepts, characteristics, advantages and developments of multi-angle remote sensing. Multi-angle remote sensing platforms vary from ground-based, airborne to spaceborne observation equipment. The first ground-based observation equipment appeared in 1952. All the ground-based equipment is classified as the fixed field of view mode or the changeable field of view mode. For the airborne or spaceborne platforms, only the fixed field of view mode is acceptable due to the heterogeneity of the land surfaces. With the development of UAV technique, the airborne multi-angle remote sensing is becoming more and more popular due to its flexibility and high spatial resolution. The multi-angle models play important roles in parameters inversion. Classic multi-angle remote sensing models include radiative transfer models, geometric optical models, hybrid models, and computer simulation models. They are all physical models which are developed based on some assumptions and theoretical analysis. Semi-empirical models combine the advantages of the empirical model and the physical model, as a result, they are simple and stable in inversion. The most widely used semi-empirical model is the linear kernel driven model used by the operational MODIS BRDF/albedo products algorithm. With the development of observing equipment and models, multi-angle remote sensing is widely used in many applications. Due to the anisotropic reflection characteristic, land surface albedo can only be retrieved by multi-angle remote sensing with high accuracy. Multi-angle remote sensing shows great potentials in vegetation structural parameters inversion which include the clumping index, LAI, FVC profile and canopy height. It has been found to be superior in vegetation type identification than the traditional vertical observation. Multi-angle remote sensing is also very useful in the cloud and aerosol parameters retrieval, such as the cloud albedo, height and types, as well as the aerosol optical depth and shapes. Large difference of optical scattering between the cloud and ice/snow in different viewing directions makes the identification of these covers easier with multi-angle remote sensing. The sea ice roughness can also be retrieved by multi-angle observations. In the last of this paper, we put forward the prospects of multi-angle optical quantitative remote sensing. As the multi-angle remote sensing observation data based on spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms become more and more abundant, the main research direction of multi-angle remote sensing in the future should focus on the following aspects: developing multi-angle reflection/radiation models for complex surfaces, enhancing the preprocessing capabilities of multi-angle remote sensing data, and promoting the comprehensive abilities of multi-source data integration in application, etc. © 2021, Science Press.

Arctic-wide maps that represent spatial patterns of sea ice roughness can be used to better characterize spatial patterns of ice convergence and divergence processes. Sea ice surface roughness can also control and quantify turbulent exchange between sea ice surface and atmosphere and therefore influence surface energy balance at the basin scale. We have developed a data processing system that produces georeferenced sea ice roughness rasters that can be mosaicked to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness. This approach starts with Top-of-Atmosphere radiance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We used red-band angular data from three MISR cameras (Ca, Cf, An). We created a training data set in which MISR pixels were matched with co-located and concurrent lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We used a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with the training data to calibrate the multi-angle data to values of surface roughness and then applied the algorithm to Arctic-wide MISR data for two 16-day periods in April (spring) and July (summer). After georeferencing the roughness rasters, we then mosaicked each 16-day roughness dataset to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness for spring and summer. Assessment of the results shows good agreement with independent ATM roughness data, not used in model development. A preliminary exploration of spatial and seasonal changes in sea ice roughness for two locations shows the ability to characterize the roughness of different ice types and the results align with previous studies. This processing system and its data products can help the sea ice research community to gain insights into the seasonal and interannual changes in sea ice roughness over the Arctic. © 2022 by the authors.","Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Surface roughness; Data-processing system; Ice age; Ice convergences; Ice surface roughness; Ice surfaces; Ice thickness; Influence surfaces; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Remote-sensing; Spatial patterns; Remote sensing","MISR; remote sensing; sea ice; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140027596"

Satellite microwave remote sensing based on microwave reflection signals reflected by the sea ice surface has been playing an essential role in monitoring and analyzing the Arctic SIT and sea ice concentration (SIC) during the past decades. Recently, passive microwave satellites incorporating an L-band radiometer, such as soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) and soil moisture active passive (SMAP), have been used for analyzing sea ice characteristics, in addition to land and ocean research. In this study, we present a novel method to estimate thin SIT and sea ice roughness (SIR) using a conversion relationship between them, from the SMAP and SMOS data. Methodologically, the SMAP SIR is retrieved. The SMAP thin SIT and SMOS SIR are estimated using a conversion relationship between thin SIT data from SMOS data and SMAP-derived SIR, which is obtained from the spatial and temporal collocation of the SMOS thin SIT and the SIR retrieved from SMAP. Our results for the Arctic sea ice during December for four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018, show high accuracy (bias = -2.268 cm, root mean square error (RMSE) = 15.919 cm, and correlation coeffcient (CC) = 0.414) between the SMOS-provided thin SIT and SMAP-derived SIT, and good agreement (bias = 0.03 cm, RMSE = 0.228 cm, and CC = 0.496) between the SMOS-estimated SIR and SMAP-retrieved SIR. Consequently, our study could be effectively used for monitoring and analyzing the variation in the Arctic sea ice. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Earth (planet); Mean square error; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Surface roughness; Microwave remote sensing; Positive and negative effect; Satellite remote sensing; SMAP; SMOS; Soil moisture active passive (SMAP); Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS); Thickness; Soil moisture","Roughness; Satellite remote sensing; Sea ice; SMAP; SMOS; Thickness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076526239"
