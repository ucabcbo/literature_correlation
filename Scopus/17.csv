Hence, water level retrieval requires accurate detection of fractures in the sea ice (leads). This paper describes a thorough assessment of various surface type classification methods, including a thresholding method, nine supervised-, and two unsupervised machine learning methods, applied to Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter data. For the first time, the simultaneously sensed images from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument, onboard Sentinel-3, were used for training and validation of the classifiers. This product allows to identify leads that are at least 300 meters wide. Applied to data from winter months, the supervised Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, Naïve-Bayes, and Linear Discriminant classifiers showed robust results with overall accuracies of up to 92%. The unsupervised Kmedoids classifier produced excellent results with accuracies up to 92.74% and is an attractive classifier when ground truth data is limited. All classifiers perform poorly on summer data, rendering surface classifications that are solely based on altimetry data from summer months unsuitable. Finally, the Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and Bootstrap Aggregation classifiers obtain the highest accuracies when the altimetry observations include measurements from the open ocean. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, they are currently poorly represented in circulation models. One of the reasons is the lack of reliable large-scale observations. A challenge encountered during melt pond retrieval from optical satellite observations is the filtering of cloud which in the visible range of spectrum look similarly bright as the sea ice surface. Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR. The AATSR swath only covers the central half of the MERIS swath but the masking procedure extends the filtering scheme to the outer parts of the MERIS swath so that the full swath can be used for melt pond retrieval. © 2016 IEEE.","","AATSR; cloud filtering; Melt ponds; MERIS; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel-3","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007413734"

Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions. © 2022 American Geophysical Union.

Its suite of instruments for measuring surface topography includes a Microwave Radiometer (MWR) and SRAL, the first delay-Doppler instrument to provide global coverage. SRAL promises fine spatial resolution and reduced noise levels that should together lead to improved performance over all Earth surfaces. The Sentinel-3 Mission Performance Centre (S3MPC) has been developing the methodology to evaluate the accuracy of retrievals, monitor any changes and develop solutions to known problems. The S3MPC monitors internal temperatures, path delays and the shape of the generated pulses to assess the instruments health. The MWR records over known reference surfaces are compared with those from other spaceborne instruments. Over the ocean the SRAL's return pulses are analysed to give range to the sea surface, wave height and signal strength (which can be interpreted as wind speed). The metocean data are regularly contrasted with records from in situ measurements and the output from meteorological models, which rapidly highlights the effects of any changes in processing. Range information is used to give surface elevation, which is assessed in three ways. First, flights over a dedicated radar transponder provide an estimate of path delay to within ∼10 mm (r.m.s.). Second, measurements are compared to GPS-levelled surfaces near Corsica and over Lake Issyk-kul. Third, there are consistency checks between ascending and descending passes and with other missions. Further waveform analysis techniques are being developed to improve the retrieval of information over sea-ice, land-ice and inland waters. © 2017 SPIE.","Aneroid altimeters; Hydrophilicity; In situ processing; Meteorological instruments; Microwave devices; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sea level; Space optics; Surface topography; Surface waters; Wind; Calibration/validation; Climate monitoring; Cryosphere; Inland waters; Ocean dynamics; Sea surface height; Sentinel; Ice","Altimeter; Calibration/validation; Climate monitoring; Cryosphere; Inland waters; Ocean dynamics; sea level; Sea surface height; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038439753"

Current spatio-temporal resolution of radar freeboard is limited as 30ĝ€¯d are required in order to generate pan-Arctic coverage from CryoSat-2 and 27ĝ€¯d are required from Sentinel-3 satellites. This therefore hinders our ability to understand physical processes that drive sea ice thickness variability on sub-monthly timescales. In this study we exploit the consistency between CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B radar freeboards in order to produce daily gridded pan-Arctic freeboard estimates between December 2018 and April 2019. We use the Bayesian inference approach of Gaussian process regression to learn functional mappings between radar freeboard observations in space and time and to subsequently retrieve pan-Arctic freeboard as well as uncertainty estimates. We also employ an empirical Bayesian approach towards learning the free (hyper)parameters of the model, which allows us to derive daily estimates related to radar freeboard spatial and temporal correlation length scales. The estimated daily radar freeboard predictions are, on average across the 2018-2019 season, equivalent to CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards to within 1ĝ€¯mm (standard deviationsĝ€¯<6ĝ€¯cm), and cross-validation experiments show that errors in predictions are, on average, ≤ĝ€¯4ĝ€¯mm across the same period. We also demonstrate the improved temporal variability of a pan-Arctic daily product by comparing time series of the predicted freeboards, with 31ĝ€¯d running means from CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards, across nine sectors of the Arctic, as well as making comparisons with daily ERA5 snowfall data. Pearson correlations between daily radar freeboard anomalies and snowfall are as high as +0.52 over first-year ice and +0.41 over multi-year ice, suggesting that the estimated daily fields are able to capture real physical radar freeboard variability at sub-weekly timescales.  © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic Ocean; Satellites; Bayesian analysis; CryoSat; observational method; satellite data; sea ice; Sentinel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108713285"

As a dominant optical component of the AO, the variations in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration affect the physiological state marine organisms. In this study, machine learning retrieval model based on in situ data and mixture density network (MDN) was developed. Compared to other models, MDN model performed better on test data (R2 = 0.83, and root mean squared error = 0.22 m−1) and was applied to Sentinel-3 OLCI data. Afterward, the spatiotemporal distribution of CDOM during the ice-free (June–September) from 2016 to 2020 in the Beaufort Sea was obtained. CDOM concentration generally exhibited an upward trend. The maximum monthly average CDOM concentration appeared in June and gradually decreased thereafter, reaching its lowest value in September of each year. The maximum value appeared in June 2020 (0.91 m−1), and the minimum value was observed in September 2017 (0.81 m−1). The CDOM concentration nearshore was higher than that in other areas; and gradually decreased from offshore to the open sea. CDOM was highly correlated with salinity (R2 = 0.49) and discharge (R2 = 0.53), and the tight correlation between salinity and CDOM further suggested that terrestrial inputs were the main source of CDOM in the Beaufort Sea. However, sea level pressure contributed to the spatial variations in CDOM. When southerly wind prevailed and wind direction was aligned with the CDOM diffusion direction, the wind accelerated the diffusion of CDOM into the open sea. Meanwhile, seawater was diluted by the sea ice melting, resulting in decrease in CDOM concentration. Herein, this paper proposed a robust and near real-time method for CDOM monitoring and influence factor analysis, which would promote the understanding of AO CDOM budgets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved Organic Matter; Environmental Monitoring; Oceans and Seas; Salinity; Seawater; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Marine biology; Mean square error; Melting; Mixtures; Offshore oil well production; Sea ice; Sea level; chromophoric dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic matter; ice; unclassified drug; sea water; Arctic ocean; Beaufort sea; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Controlling factors; High Latitudes; Hydrological cycles; Mixture density; Mixture density network; Regional climate; Sentinel-3; concentration (composition); dissolved organic matter; satellite data; seawater; Sentinel; spatial variation; Article; Beaufort Sea; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diffusion; dilution; factor analysis; machine learning; melting point; mixture density network; model; salinity; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; trend study; wind; environmental monitoring; procedures; sea; spectrofluorometry; Budget control","Beaufort Sea; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Mixture density network; Sentinel-3","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135865633"

However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008–2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States.

This process, similar to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems, reduces the along-track resolution down to the theoretical limit equal to half the antenna length. We call this the fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) altimetry processing. The technique is directly applicable to SAR altimetry missions such as CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, or Sentinel-6/Jason-CS. The footprint of an FF-SAR altimeter measurement is a narrow strip on the surface, which is pulse limited across track and SAR focused along track. Despite the asymmetry of the altimeter footprint, the fully focused technique may be useful for applications in which one needs to separate specific targets within highly heterogeneous scenes, such as in the case of sea ice lead detection, hydrology, and coastal altimetry applications. In addition, over rough homogeneous surfaces, such as the ocean or ice sheets, the improved multilooking capability of FF-SAR leads to a significant increase in the effective number of looks with respect to the delay/Doppler processing, resulting in better geophysical parameter estimation. The proposed processing technique was verified by processing full bit rate CryoSat-2 SAR mode data over the Svalbard transponder. Hydrology, sea ice, and open ocean applications are also demonstrated in this paper, showing the improvement of this technique with respect to conventional and delay/Doppler altimetry. © 2016 IEEE.","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Chemical detection; Hydrology; Ice; Image resolution; Meteorological instruments; Radar; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Altimeter measurements; Coherent processing; Geophysical parameters; Homogeneous surfaces; Lead detection; Processing technique; Theoretical limits; Track resolution; asymmetry; CryoSat; data processing; Doppler radar; ice lead; imaging method; Jason; open ocean; satellite altimetry; satellite mission; sea ice; Sentinel; spectral resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Altimetry; delay/Doppler altimetry; SAR altimetry; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990868168"

This paper deals exclusively with the effort devoted to the altimeter and microwave radiometer, both components of the Surface Topography Mission (STM). The altimeters on Sentinel-3A and-3B are the first to operate in delay-Doppler or SAR mode over all Earth surfaces, which enables better spatial resolution of the signal in the along-track direction and improved noise reduction through multi-looking, whilst the radiometer is a two-channel nadir-viewing system. There are regular routine assessments of the instruments through investigation of telemetered housekeeping data, calibrations over selected sites and comparisons of geophysical retrievals with models, in situ data and other satellite systems. These are performed both to monitor the daily production, assessing the uncertainties and errors on the estimates, and also to characterize the long-term performance for climate science applications. This is critical because an undetected drift in performance could be misconstrued as a climate variation. As the data are used by the Copernicus Services (e.g., CMEMS, Global Land Monitoring Services) and by the research community over open ocean, coastal waters, sea ice, land ice, rivers and lakes, the validation activities encompass all these domains, with regular reports openly available. The S3MPC is also in charge of preparing improvements to the processing, and of the development and tuning of algorithms to improve their accuracy. This paper is thus the first refereed publication to bring together the analysis of SAR altimetry across all these different domains to highlight the benefits and existing challenges. © 2020 by the authors.","Meteorological instruments; Microwave devices; Radiometers; Sea ice; Space flight; Topography; Uncertainty analysis; Climate variation; European Space Agency; Long term performance; Microwave radiometers; Monitoring services; Research communities; Sentinel-3 Mission; Spatial resolution; Space-based radar","Altimeter; Buoys; Calibration; Coastal zone; Copernicus/sentinel-3; Cryosphere; Microwave radiometer; Model comparison; Ocean; Radar transponders; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086459179"

The SAR data also allows for a more detailed study of the ocean surface, since these make small-scale variations visible. Combined, data from the Sentinel-3 satellites creates a tremendous possibility for improving tidal models and mean sea surfaces near the coast, where these models are currently using extrapolation to provide information. However, some challenges are also becoming more apparent in areas where satellite altimetry have not previously been available. Such as the discrepancies between tidal models near the coast, which are amplified because the Sentinel-3 satellites fly in a sun-synchronous orbit. Acquiring satellite altimetry data in coastal and sea ice covered areas also highlights some issues with the current wet tropospheric correction, calculated from measurements by the on-board microwave radiometer, leading us to the conclusion that it is safest to use a WTC from a model – at least in coastal and sea ice prone areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Aneroid altimeters; Microwave devices; Orbits; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Coastal altimetry; FES2014; GOT4.10; Microwave radiometers; Satellite altimetry; Satellite altimetry data; Sentinel-3; Sun synchronous orbits; Satellites","Coastal altimetry; FES2014; GOT4.10; MSS; Sentinel-3; SLA","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081549281"

It is commonly assumed that radar pulses from satellite-mounted Ku-band altimeters penetrate through the snow and reflect from the snow-ice interface. We would therefore expect a negative correlation between snow accumulation and radar freeboard measurements, as increased snow loading weighs the ice floe down. In this study we produce daily resolution radar freeboard products from the CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 altimeters via a recently developed optimal interpolation scheme. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between radar freeboard anomalies and modeled snow accumulation. This suggests that, in the period after snowfall, radar pulses are not scattering from the snow-ice interface as commonly assumed.

This innovative mode is capable of successfully tracking the backscatter signal over rapidly varying terrains, and thus it overcomes one of the limitations of the closed-loop Poseidon-2 tracker on board Jason-1. DIODE/DEM achieves this improvement thanks to a predetermined DEM on board that, when combined with DIODE orbit ephemeris, provides improved acquisition timing and reduced data loss in the coastal zone. As a further enhancement, Jason-3 and the Sentinel-3 programs will be capable of autonomously switching to this innovative mode in selected regions. To help recommend how these missions should utilize DIODE/DEM, the authors studied the impact of the tracker mode on the accuracy and precision of wave heights and wind speed, the continuity of the sea level climate data record, and the coverage in coastal regions. The results show close agreement between the open- and closed-loop tracker modes over the open ocean with the exception of some differences at high-tidal variability areas, the coastal zone, and sea ice regions. The DIODE/DEM tracker shows better performance than the closed-loop tracker mode at the coast and in the presence of sea ice. Jason-2, when operating in open-loop mode, allows for an approximately 5% increase of successful acquisitions at the ocean-to-land transition. However, open-loop tracking exhibits more variability in regions of high tides than closed-loop. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Coastal zones; Diodes; Sea ice; Sea level; Waves; Wind; Accuracy and precision; Altimetry; Backscatter signals; Climate data records; Elevation models; Microwave observations; Oceanic; Open loop tracking; Jason; ocean wave; satellite altimetry; sea level; tracking; wind; Geodetic satellites","Altimetry; Microwave observations; Oceanic; Sea level; Waves; Wind","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995505505"

In this study, we monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 by developing sea ice information indexes using 300 m resolution Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) images. We assessed and validated the index performance using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images with higher spatial resolution. The results indicate that the proposed Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (NDSIIIOLCI), which is based on OLCI Bands 20 and 21, can be used to rapidly and effectively detect sea ice but is somewhat affected by the turbidity of the seawater in the southern Bohai Sea. The novel Enhanced Normalized Difference Sea Ice Information Index (ENDSIIIOLCI), which builds on NDSIIIOLCI by also considering OLCI Bands 12 and 16, can monitor sea ice more accurately and effectively than NDSIIIOLCI and suffers less from interference from turbidity. The spatiotemporal evolution of the Bohai Sea ice in the winter of 2017-2018 was successfully monitored by ENDSIIIOLCI.

It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel-3 and GIS. The subject of the study is to demonstrate the dynamics, during the summer season from 2015 to 2019, around the coastline of Livingston Island, New Shetland Islands in Antarctica and Longyearbyen in the Arctic.

The thickness of iceberg D28 was estimated by utilizing data from altimeters on Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3, and ICESat-2.

Spaceborne optical instruments allow the continuous monitoring of the occurrence, distribution, and amount of Chl-a. In recent years, the Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3 (S3) A and B satellites were launched, which provide data about various aquatic environments on advantageous spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions with high SNR. Although S3 OLCI could be favorable to monitor high northern latitude waters, there have been several challenges related to Chl-a concentration retrieval in these waters due to their unique optical properties coupled with challenging environments including high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. In this work, we aim to overcome these difficulties by developing a machine-learning (ML) approach designed to estimate Chl-a concentration from S3 OLCI data in high northern latitude optically complex waters. The ML model is optimized and requires only three S3 OLCI bands, reflecting the physical characteristic of Chl-a as input in the regression process to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy in terms of the bias (five times improvements.) The ML model was optimized on data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, and showed promising performance. Finally, we present the performance of the optimized ML approach by computing Chl-a maps and corresponding certainty maps in highly complex sub-Arctic and Arctic waters. We show how these certainty maps can be used as a support to understand possible radiometric calibration issues in the retrieval of Level 2 reflectance over these waters. This can be a useful tool in identifying erroneous Level 2 Remote sensing reflectance due to possible failure of the atmospheric correction algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","Chlorophyll; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Signal to noise ratio; Arctic; Atmospheric correction algorithm; Chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Ocean color; Remote-sensing reflectance; Sentinel 3 OLCI; Spaceborne optical instruments; Machine learning","Arctic; Chlorophyll-a; Machine-learning; Ocean color monitoring; Sentinel 3 OLCI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072647161"

The classification of altimeter waveforms is generally performed using statistical parameters on the echo power or machine learning approaches directly on the waveforms. The validation and optimization of such algorithms can be carried out using a set of reference cases provided by Earth Observation images. In this paper, we first developed a new lead detector based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A robust and consistent methodology for the joint assessment of Altimeter and SAR leads detector is then provided. We propose to fully account for the 2-D geometric problem when comparing the 1-D altimeter track and 2-D SAR image. The surface of the lead intersecting the altimeter footprint and its distance to nadir are considered here. Based on collocated Sentinel-3 (S-3) altimeter data and S-1 images, the performance of our S-3 lead detector is fully assessed. A new parameterization is found resulting in a better tradeoff between good detection and false alarm rate. A similar analysis is performed using AltiKa altimeter data, showing enhanced performance for S-3 altimeter data acquired in Delay-Doppler mode with reduced off-nadir returns. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Aneroid altimeters; Chemical detection; Lead; Learning systems; Meteorological instruments; Sea ice; Synthetic aperture radar; Altimeter waveform; Altimetry; Comparative evaluations; Earth observation images; Geometric problems; Machine learning approaches; Statistical parameters; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; data acquisition; detection method; Doppler radar; ice thickness; lead; machine learning; nadir; satellite altimetry; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; waveform analysis; Radar imaging","Altimetry; lead; sea ice; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066604266"

The conventional pulse-limited radar altimeters have a relatively large ground footprint, which limits their capability to retrieve surface elevation information over small and medium-sized water bodies. A new generation of satellite radar altimeter system, a dual-frequency SAR radar altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite, has produced densely sampled elevation measurements with a smaller footprint for the Earth's surfaces since June 2016, owing to the Delay-Doppler processing technique. Four standard SRAL SAR altimetry waveform retracking algorithms (known as retrackers) have been designed to retrieve elevation measurements for different types of surfaces: Ice-Sheet retracker for polar ice sheets, SAMOSA-3 retracker for open ocean and coastal zones, OCOG retracker for sea-ice margins, and Sea-Ice retracker for sea ice. In this research, we evaluated the performances of the Sentinel-3 SRAL SAR altimetry retrackers over lakes, particularly over seasonally ice-covered lakes in one hydrological cycle. For 15 lakes and reservoirs with different sizes and at varying latitudes in the northern hemisphere, we compared the lake water levels estimated by each of standard SRAL SAR retrackers against in-situ water level measurements for different seasons (a full hydrologic cycle) during 2016–2017. Our evaluation shows that Sea-Ice retracker was unable to provide continuous estimates of lake water levels, as a result of the high rate of missing data. Although the precision and relative accuracy of lake water level estimates from these three standard SRAL SAR retrackers are similar, the SAMOSA-3 retracker has the least bias in comparison with ground-based gauge measurements. When the lakes in the mid- and high-latitude regions were covered by ice in the winter season, these three standard SAR retrackers generated erroneous lake water level measurements, significantly lower than the true lake water levels recorded by in-situ gauge stations. The measurement errors of these three standard retrackers increase with the growth of the lake ice thickness. To address the negative effect of the seasonal ice cover, we developed a new bimodal correction algorithm. We demonstrate that our bimodal correction algorithm can retrieve the ice thickness and reliably estimate water levels for the ice-covered lakes in winter, hence enabling the generation of temporally consistent lake water level measurements throughout all seasons for lake hydrological analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Aneroid altimeters; Coastal zones; Gages; Glaciers; Lakes; Level measurement; Meteorological instruments; Radar equipment; Radar measurement; Radio altimeters; Satellites; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Ice cover; Lake water level; SAR altimetry; Sentinel-3; Wave forms; algorithm; data processing; Doppler radar; hydrological cycle; ice cover; lake water; radar altimetry; sea ice; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; tracking; water level; waveform analysis; Reservoirs (water)","Ice cover; Lake water levels; SAR altimetry; Sentinel-3; Waveform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077944930"
