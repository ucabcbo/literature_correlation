One of the solutions to this is sparse representation. The idea of sparsity has been receiving much attention recently from many researchers in the areas such as satellite image processing, signal processing, medical image processing, microscopy image processing, pattern recognition, neuroscience, seismic imaging, etc. Many algorithms have been developed for various areas of sparse representation. The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive study and highlight the challenges in the area of sparse representation which will be helpful for researchers. Also, the current challenges and opportunities of applying sparsity to image reconstruction, namely, image super-resolution, image denoising and image restoration are discussed. This survey on sparse representation categorizes the existing methods into three groups: dictionary learning approach, greedy strategy approximation approach and deep learning approach.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Deep learning; Image denoising; Medical imaging; Pattern recognition; Approximation approach; Dictionary learning; Greedy strategies; Image super resolutions; Learning approach; Microscopy images; Satellite image processing; Sparse representation; Image reconstruction","compressive sensing; denoising; restoration; Sparse representation; super-resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097913358"

For the processing of satellite videos, the commonly employed deep-learning-based single-frame SR (SFSR) framework has limited performance without using complementary information between the video frames. On the other side, the multiframe SR (MFSR) can utilize temporal subpixel information to super-resolve the high-resolution (HR) imagery. However, although deeper and wider deep learning network provides powerful feature representations for SR methods, it has always been a challenge to accurately reconstruct the boundaries of ground objects in video satellite images. In this article, to address these issues, we propose an edge-guided video SR (EGVSR) framework for video satellite image SR, which couples the MFSR model and the edge-SFSR (E-SFSR) model in a unified network. The EGVSR framework is composed of an MFSR branch and an edge branch. The MFSR branch is used to extract the complementary features from the consecutive video frames. Concurrently, the edge branch acts as an SFSR model to translate the edge maps from the low-resolution modality to the HR one. At the final SR stage, the DBFM is built to focus on the promising inner representations of the features of the two branches and fuse them. Extensive experiments on video satellite imagery show that the proposed EGVSR method can achieve superior performance compared to the representative deep-learning-based SR methods.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Edge detection; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sols; Deep learning; Edge prior; Features extraction; Image edge detection; Images reconstruction; Remote-sensing; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; Video satellite; coupling; image resolution; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Feature extraction","Deep learning; edge prior; super-resolution (SR); video satellite","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118256263"

This work proposes an alternative to improve the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 images to the reference of Sentinel-2 images, by applying a Super Resolution (SR) approach based on the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models for image processing, as an alternative to traditional methods to achieve higher resolution images, hence, remote sensing applications could take advantage of this new information and improve its outcomes. We used two datasets to train and validate our approach, the first composed by images from the DIV2K open access dataset and the second by images from Sentinel-2 satellite. The experimental results are based on the comparison of the similarity between the Landsat-8 images obtained by the super resolution processing by our approach (for both datasets), against its corresponding reference from Sentinel-2 satellite image, computing the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Structural Similarity (SSIM) as metrics for this purpose.

Multitudes of solutions have been proposed in this arena, yet there is a significant need for much better and flawless outputs. In this chapter, we expound on a two-level solution-Edge Boxes and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of targets in satellite imagery, Super resolution of the image using Dense-skip-connections. In the first level, the military objects are detected from the satellite image using Edge Boxes. In satellite imagery, the edge data of targets contains very prominent and concise attributes. The traditionally engineered features such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Hough transform and Gabor feature do not work well for huge datasets. However, the Edge Boxes technique generates contours around the target objects and discards the remaining. The output of this level is fed to the second level, wherein, the proposed targets undergo image super resolution. The presented deep learning model tends to inherently learn an end-to-end mapping between images of lower resolution and higher resolution. This level can be portrayed as one which takes a low-resolution input image and constructs an up-sampled high-resolution image as the output. Unlike traditional methods (sparse coding based method, bicubic method) that handle each component separately, this method aims to optimize all the layers at once. Furthermore, for assuaging the vanishing gradient problem that is common to very deep networks, Dense-skip-connections are employed. These enable the building of shorter paths directly within multiple layers. Though the proposed model has a light weighted structure, it exhibits state-of-the-art restoration quality. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Hough transforms; Object detection; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; High resolution image; Higher resolution; Histogram of oriented gradients; Image super resolutions; Lower resolution; State of the art; Super resolution; Vanishing gradient; Military photography","Deep CNN; Dense-skipconnections; EdgeBoxes; Gabor feature; HOG; Hough transform; Super resolution of image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097653630"

However, due to the limitations of current remote sensing imaging technology and the influence of the external environment, the resolution of remote sensing images often struggles to meet application requirements. In order to obtain high-resolution remote sensing images, image super-resolution methods are gradually being applied to the recovery and reconstruction of remote sensing images. The use of image super-resolution methods can overcome the current limitations of remote sensing image acquisition systems and acquisition environments, solving the problems of poor-quality remote sensing images, blurred regions of interest, and the requirement for high-efficiency image reconstruction, a research topic that is of significant relevance to image processing. In recent years, there has been tremendous progress made in image super-resolution methods, driven by the continuous development of deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of deep-learning-based image super-resolution methods. Specifically, we first introduce the research background and details of image super-resolution techniques.

However, since the early 2010s, there have been efforts to apply ICT to various fields such as aerospace, life science, energy, and automobiles. Recently, artificial intelligence and big data technologies have also been applied in the aerospace field, among others. In the field of aerospace, earth observation attracts the most interest. One reason earth observation attracts such interest is that the availability of a satellite constellation allows more frequent observations of objects of interest. Another reason is the improvement of technologies that can process massive satellite images such as data cubes for urban change detection, disaster monitoring, and traffic analysis. When performing earth observation using satellite images, it is necessary to process a large amount of satellite information in real-time and analyze satellite images with artificial intelligence. Such research is continuing in various ways. The field of interest in this study is the processing technology for storing and retrieving large volumes of satellite images.

Hydrographic surveys and acoustic surveys are time-consuming and expensive. The limited availability and high cost of the high-resolution images require a different methodology to accurately estimate the water-spread area of the reservoir. In this study, 30 m resolution hyperspectral image (hyperion) and multi-spectral image (The Earth Observing One (EO-1) advanced land imager) are used to estimate the water-spread area of the Peechi Reservoir, South India. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-based super-resolution mapping approach is developed and demonstrated, which incorporates the multi-objective GA and Hopfield neural network (HNN). The hybrid GA-based super-resolution mapping approach gives a global optimum solution in half of the original computation time. Furthermore, mapping approach gives an error of 6.38% for the multi-spectral image and a lesser error of 3.86% for the hyperspectral image, while the HNN-based super-resolution mapping approach gives an error of 8.23% for the multi-spectral image and 5.71% for the hyperspectral image.

In most cases, the datasets for small object detection in remote sensing images are inadequate. Many researchers used scene classification datasets for object detection, which has its limitations; for example, the large-sized objects outnumber the small objects in object categories. Thus, they lack diversity; this further affects the detection performance of small object detectors in RS images. This paper reviews current datasets and object detection methods (deep learning-based) for remote sensing images. We also propose a large-scale, publicly available benchmark Remote Sensing Super-resolution Object Detection (RSSOD) dataset. The RSSOD dataset consists of 1,759 hand-annotated images with 22,091 instances of very high-resolution (VHR) images with a spatial resolution of ∼ 0.05 m. There are five classes with varying frequencies of labels per class; the images are annotated in You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Common Objects in Context (COCO) format. The image patches are extracted from satellite images, including real image distortions such as tangential scale distortion and skew distortion. The proposed RSSOD dataset will help researchers benchmark the state-of-the-art object detection methods across various classes, especially for small objects using image super-resolution. We also propose a novel Multi-class Cyclic super-resolution Generative adversarial network with Residual feature aggregation (MCGR) and auxiliary YOLOv5 detector to benchmark image super-resolution-based object detection and compare with the existing state-of-the-art methods based on image super-resolution (SR). The proposed MCGR achieved state-of-the-art performance for image SR with an improvement of 1.2 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the current state-of-the-art non-local sparse network (NLSN). MCGR achieved best object detection mean average precisions (mAPs) of 0.758, 0.881, 0.841, and 0.983, respectively, for five-class, four-class, two-class, and single classes, respectively surpassing the performance of the state-of-the-art object detectors YOLOv5, EfficientDet, Faster RCNN, SSD, and RetinaNet. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Large dataset; Object recognition; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Deep learning object detection; Image super resolutions; MCGR; Multiclass GAN; Object detection in remote sensing; Remote sensing benchmark; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Small object detection; Object detection","Deep learning object detection; MCGR; multiclass GAN; Object detection in remote sensing; Remote sensing benchmark; Small object detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125859223"

To analyze the lower resolution of satellite images there are some technical issues such as reduction of noise, misclassification of object recognition. Therefore, high-resolution images are necessary. However, high-resolution satellite images are expensive, and its images may not be available in the past satellite images. Super-resolution which is introduced in image processing is a method to solve these problems. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are effective, and there is a need for models that can perform super-resolution with higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for super-resolving satellite images, based on the improved the RCAN (residual channel attention network) model with SRM (style-based recalibration module). The proposed method improves the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) by 0.0181 dB compared to the conventional RCAN model.  © 2022 ICROS.","Convolution; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Object recognition; Optical resolving power; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Convolutional neural network; Image-based; Lower resolution; Network models; Recalibrations; Residual channel attention network; Resolution images; Satellite images; Style-based recalibration module; Superresolution; Convolutional neural networks","Convolutional Neural Network; Residual Channel Attention Network; Satellite Images; Style-based Recalibration Module; Super-Resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146557504"

Generally speaking, high resolution is usually achieved by increasing the density and accuracy of the sensor. However, such an approach is quite expensive for equipment and design. In particular, increasing the density of satellite sensors must be undertaken great risks. Inspired by EEGAN and based on it, the Ultra-Dense Subnet (UDSN) and Edge Enhanced Network (EEN) were modified. Among them, the UDSN is used for feature extraction and obtains high-resolution results that look clear in the intermediate but are deteriorated by artifacts, and the Edge-Enhanced Subnet (EESN) is used to purify, extract and enhance the image contour and use mask processing to eliminate images contaminated by noise. Finally, the restored intermediate image and the enhanced edge are combined to produce a high-resolution image with high credibility and clear content. We use Kaggle and AID open experimental datasets to test and compare the results among different methods.

In a remote sensing field, conventional SR methods required high-quality satellite images as the ground truth. However, in most cases, high-quality satellite images are difficult to acquire because many image distortions occur owing to various imaging conditions. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive image quality modification method to improve SR image quality for the KOrea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3). The KOMPSAT-3 is a high performance optical satellite, which provides 0.7-m ground sampling distance (GSD) panchromatic and 2.8-m GSD multi-spectral images for various applications. We proposed an SR method with a scale factor of 2 for the panchromatic and pan-sharpened images of KOMPSAT-3. The proposed SR method presents a degradation model that generates a low-quality image for training, and a method for improving the quality of the raw satellite image. The proposed degradation model for low-resolution input image generation is based on Gaussian noise and blur kernel. In addition, top-hat and bottom-hat transformation is applied to the original satellite image to generate an enhanced satellite image with improved edge sharpness or image clarity. Using this enhanced satellite image as the ground truth, an SR network is then trained. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing it with other SR methods in multiple ways, such as edge extraction, visual inspection, qualitative analysis, and the performance of object detection. Experimental results show that the proposed SR method achieves improved reconstruction results and perceptual quality compared to conventional SR methods. © 2021 by the authors.

While single-image super-resolution has been intensively explored with many advancements proposed attributed to the use of deep learning, multi-image reconstruction remains a much less explored field. The first solutions based on convolutional neural networks were proposed recently for super-resolving multiple Proba-V satellite images, but they have not been validated for enhancing natural images so far. Also, their sensitiveness to the characteristics of the input data, including their mutual similarity and image acquisition conditions, has not been explored in depth. In this paper, we address this research gap to better understand how to select and prepare the input data for reconstruction.

These methods focused on various types of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures, which were trained by simply minimizing a spectral loss between network outputs and the corresponding high-resolution (HR) multi-spectral (MS) target images. However, owing to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times, HR panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution MS image pairs tend to have large pixel misalignments, especially for moving objects in the images. Conventional CNNs trained with only the spectral loss with these satellite image data sets often produce PS images of low visual quality including double-edge artifacts along strong edges and ghosting artifacts on moving objects. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, called a spectral-spatial structure (S3) loss, based on the correlation maps between MS targets and PAN inputs.

Several very high-resolution optical satellites with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 1 m and smaller are currently active. Not all of these satellites take images worldwide. Nevertheless, it is not a problem to obtain up-to-date satellite images with a very high resolution. Mapping projects not only need to consider access and quality, but also cost-effectiveness. Of course, the economic framework conditions are decisive for the decision as to whether space images or very high-resolution satellite images should be used. With a total 21 SkySat satellites, low-cost satellites with very high resolution have changed the economic conditions. To keep costs and weights down, the Skysat satellites were not designed to offer the best direct geo-referencing performance, but this problem can be solved by automatic orientation in relation to existing orthoimages.In North Rhine-Westphalia, the cadastral maps must be checked at regular intervals to ensure that the buildings are complete. A test project examined whether this is possible with SkySat images. The geometric conditions and the image quality with the effective ground resolutions are investigated. Experiences from earlier publications could not be used. First the specific problem had to be solved, the resolution of the SkySat images was improved by lowering the satellite orbit altitude from 500 km to 450 km and by a better super resolution with 0.50 m ground sampling distance for the SkySat Collect orthoimages and in addition Planet improved their generation of Collect images.

It is known that conventional keypoint detection, description, and matching methods do not work well between images with different spatial resolutions, such as those captured by drones and satellites. Thus, we propose a method to improve the geometric accuracy of image registration through an adaptive combination of super-resolution and low- resolution images and downscaling to high-resolution images based on the assumption that artificial structures are perceived as relatively simple shapes in top-view images. If the superresolution factor is too high, artifacts are generated, and the accuracy of the corresponding matching points will be decreased. Thus, estimating the highest super-resolution factor while avoiding the artifacts is necessary. Using the super-resolution factor, super-resolution processing of satellite images and downscaling to drone images are simultaneously performed. This is followed by corresponding points matching to achieve high estimation accuracy in the image registration process. Through quantitative evaluation experiments performed using pairs of images with 12 times difference in spatial resolutions, we demonstrated that high-accuracy image registration is possible by applying super-resolution processing at a factor of 4 to 6. © 2020 IEEE.","Aircraft detection; Big data; Drones; Image registration; Optical resolving power; Adaptive combinations; Adaptive image scaling; Artificial structures; High resolution image; Low resolution images; Quantitative evaluation; Registration process; Spatial resolution; Image enhancement","drones; generative adversarial networks; image registration; satellite images; super-resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103823868"

In this work, we propose an end-to-end model for accomplishing single satellite image colorization and SR simultaneously.

First, the residual receptive field block structure is introduced in features extraction network to learn better feature representations for image colorization and SR. Residual Receptive Field Block(RRFB) is improved by expanding the receptive field and enhancing the context connection from inception model. Second, the extracted features are transformed to a color high-resolution image by a recovery architecture. In this work, U-net is employed as the key structure of the recovery architecture.

A hybrid fusion method that integrates image blending (i.e., spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, STARFM) and super-resolution (i.e., very deep super resolution, VDSR) techniques for the spatiotemporal fusion of 8 m Formosat-2 and 30 m Landsat-8 satellite images is proposed. Two different fusion approaches, namely Blend-then-Super-Resolution and Super-Resolution (SR)-then-Blend, were developed to improve the results of spatiotemporal fusion. The SR-then-Blend approach performs SR before image blending. The SR refines the image resampling stage on generating the same pixel-size of coarse-and fine-resolution images. The Blend-then-SR approach is aimed at refining the spatial details after image blending. Several quality indices were used to analyze the quality of the different fusion approaches. Experimental results showed that the performance of the hybrid method is slightly better than the traditional approach. Images obtained using SR-then-Blend are more similar to the real observed images compared with images acquired using Blend-then-SR. The overall mean bias of SR-then-Blend was 4% lower than Blend-then-SR, and nearly 3% improvement for overall standard deviation in SR-B. The VDSR technique reduces the systematic deviation in spectral band between Formosat-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images. The integration of STARFM and the VDSR model is useful for improving the quality of spatiotemporal fusion. © 2021 by the authors.

It is challenging in the medium spatial resolution. This work proposes a novel methodology named ‘6+’ for improving building extraction in 10 m medium spatial resolution multispectral satellite images. Data resources used are Sentinel-2A satellite images and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The proposed methodology merges the available high-resolution bands, super-resolved Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) bands, and an Enhanced Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (ENDISI) built-up index-based image to produce enhanced multispectral satellite images that contain additional information on impervious surfaces for improving building extraction results. The proposed methodology produces a novel building extraction dataset named ‘6+’. Another dataset named ‘6 band’ is also prepared for comparison by merging super-resolved bands 11 and 12 along with all the highest spatial resolution bands. The building ground truths are prepared using OSM shapefiles. The models specific for extracting buildings, i.e., BRRNet, JointNet, SegUnet, Dilated-ResUnet, and other Unet based encoder-decoder models with a backbone of various state-of-art image segmentation algorithms, are applied on both datasets. The comparative analyses of all models applied to the ‘6+’ dataset achieve a better performance in terms of F1-Score and Intersection over Union (IoU) than the ‘6 band’ dataset. © 2022 by the authors.

However, it is difficult for a single satellite to obtain such images due to technical and cost constraints. Therefore, spatiotemporal image fusion based on deep learning has received extensive attention in recent years. This article proposes a multicooperative deep convolutional neural network (MCDNet) for spatiotemporal satellite image fusion. This method is a new multinetwork model in which multiple networks work together to reconstruct the predicted image. The multinetwork model consists of a super-resolution network, a difference reconstruction network, and a collaborative training network. First, the super-resolution network uses the combination of a novel multiscale mechanism and dilated convolutions to make full use of the spectral information of the coarse image and upgrade it to a transitional image that matches the fine image. The difference reconstruction network uses structural relevance to complete the reconstruction of the fine difference image. The collaborative training network extracts the hidden information from the fine image and uses the time relevance to restrict the training of the difference reconstruction network. Finally, the fine difference image and the known fine image are combined to complete the image fusion. The new compound loss function can help multinetwork models better complete cooperative training. Through experiments on two datasets and comparison with existing fusion algorithms, the subjective and objective results prove that MCDNet can effectively reconstruct higher-quality prediction images. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellites; Collaborative training; High spatial resolution; Multiscale mechanisms; Reconstruction networks; Remote sensing satellites; Science applications; Spatiotemporal images; Spectral information; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; training; Image fusion","Convolutional neural network (CNN); dilated convolution; multiscale mechanism; spatiotemporal fusion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115163134"

In this research, we aim to check the effect of super resolution on object detection. Super resolution is a software method that increases the resolution of an image. Unpaired super resolution network is used to improve Sentinel-2's spatial resolution from 10 m to 3.2 m. Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, and S2ANet were used to detect vessels in the Sentinel-2 images. We experimented the change in vessel detection performance when super resolution is applied. As a result, the Average Precision (AP) improved by at least 12.3% and up to 33.3% in the ship detection models trained with the super-resolution image. False positive and false negative cases also decreased. This implies that super resolution can be an important pre-processing step in object detection, and it is expected to greatly contribute to improving the accuracy of other image-based deep learning technologies along with object detection. © Korean Journal of Remote Sensing.

There are three red-edge bands (705 nm, 740 nm, 783 nm) for Sentinel-2 satellite images, which are very sensitive to vegetation growth. Unfortunately, the spatial resolution of these three red-edge bands (20 m) is inconsistent with that of visible and near infrared bands (10 m), which limits the application of Sentinel-2 images. For solving this problem, the six bands with spatial resolution of 20 m was reconstructed into the spatial resolution of 10 m by using super-resolution for multispectral multiresolution estimation (SupReMe) algorithm.

However, due to the limited resolution and chromatic information, the satellite images, especially the panchromatic images, are not capable of being used for accurate earth observations, such as road extraction, vehicle detection, and building segmentation. In this research, we propose a cascaded fully convolutional network (CFCN) consists of a residual dense super-resolution network (RDSRN) for grayscale image super-resolution (SR) and a residual deconvolution colorization network (RDCN) for grayscale image colorization. The unique architecture can simultaneously learn texture detail and color information from aerial images and then transfer to enhance panchromatic images. Furthermore, we also introduce an indirect evaluation metric, learned extraction similarity (LES), to estimate the image quality of the generated image in the absence of the ground truth. Experiments on a multispectral image dataset demonstrate that panchromatic images enhanced by the proposed CFCN are with both texture and color fidelity as compared to aerial image. For pre-trained U-Net, compared to the performance on raw panchromatic images, the CFCN enhanced images increase 12.8% of LES of overall accuracy (96.4% versus 83.6%). © 2022 IEEE.","Antennas; Color; Color image processing; Deep learning; Extraction; Image quality; Image segmentation; Image texture; Observatories; Optical resolving power; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Convolutional networks; Deep learning; Earth observations; Gray scale; Image color analysis; Image colorizations; Learn+; Learned extraction similarity; Superresolution; Image enhancement","Buildings; Gray-scale; Image color analysis; Image quality; Measurement; Satellites; Superresolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123362143"

Currently, the most effective SR models are mainly based on deep learning, especially the generative adversarial network (GAN). Models based on GAN need to be trained on LR–HR image pairs. In this paper, a two-step super-resolution generative adversarial network (TS-SRGAN) model is proposed. The first step is having the GAN train the degraded models. Without supervised HR images, only the 10 m resolution images provided by Sentinel-2 satellites are used to generate the degraded images, which are in the same domain as the real LR images, and then to construct the near-natural LR–HR image pairs. The second step is to design a super-resolution generative adversarial network with strengthened perceptual features, to enhance the perceptual effects of the generated images. Through experiments, the proposed method obtained an average NIQE as low as 2.54, and outperformed state-of-the-art models according to other two NR-IQA metrics, such as BRISQUE and PIQE. At the same time, the comparison of the intuitive visual effects of the generated images also proved the effectiveness of TS-SRGAN. © 2022 by the authors.","","generative adversarial network; remote-sensing image; super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141875470"

Generally speaking, high resolution is usually achieved by increasing the density and accuracy of the sensor. However, such an approach is quite expensive for equipment and design. In particular, increasing the density of satellite sensors must be undertaken great risks. Inspired by EEGAN and based on it, the Ultra-Dense Subnet (UDSN) and Edge Enhanced Network (EEN) were modified. Among them, the UDSN is used for feature extraction and obtains high-resolution results that look clear in the intermediate but are deteriorated by artifacts, and the Edge-Enhanced Subnet (EESN) is used to purify, extract and enhance the image contour and use mask processing to eliminate images contaminated by noise. Finally, the restored intermediate image and the enhanced edge are combined to produce a high-resolution image with high credibility and clear content. We use Kaggle open experimental dataset to test and compare the results among different methods. It proves the performance of the proposed model is better than other SR methods.  © 2022 IEEE.","Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Satellites; Statistical tests; Generative adversarial network; High resolution; High-resolution images; Image super resolutions; Image-based; Residual in residual dense block; Satellite images; Subnets; Superresolution; Two-dimensional; Optical resolving power","generative adversarial network (GAN); residual in residual dense block (RRDB); satellite images; Super-resolution(SR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127085207"

The price for satellite images depends on the sensor quality and revisit rate. This work proposes to bridge the gap between image quality and the price by improving the image quality via super-resolution (SR). Recently, a number of deep SR techniques have been proposed to enhance satellite images. However, none of these methods utilize the region-level context information, giving equal importance to each region in the image. This, along with the fact that most state-of-the-art SR methods are complex and cumbersome deep models, the time taken to process very large satellite images can be impractically high. We, propose to handle this challenge by designing an SR framework that analyzes the regional information content on each patch of the low-resolution image and judiciously chooses to use more computationally complex deep models to super-resolve more structure-rich regions on the image, while using less resource-intensive non-deep methods on non-salient regions. Through extensive experiments on a large satellite image, we show substantial decrease in inference time while achieving similar performance to that of existing deep SR methods over several evaluation measures like PSNR, MSE and SSIM. © 2020 IEEE.","Aerospace industry; Big data; Costs; Image quality; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Context information; Evaluation measures; Low resolution images; Regional information; Salient regions; Satellite images; State of the art; Super resolution; Image enhancement","Deep Neural Networks; Fast Super-Resolution; Satellite Imagery","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097217088"

Most of the traditional CNN-based approaches treat all the channels equitably and cannot learn the correlation. Attention mechanism which can learn the correlations among the channels has been proven to be effective in super-resolution and object detection tasks.

Notably, the spatial resolution of the medium-wave infrared channel in GF-4 satellite imagery is much lower than the corresponding visible near-infrared channels of the same scene. The resolution of the medium-wave infrared channel needs to be improved. In this study, a deep learning method termed as GF-4 Super-Resolution Network (GF-4-SRN) is proposed for super-resolution GF-4 satellite imagery. First, a convolutional regression network is designed for preliminary reconstruction of the original image. The convolutional regression network is trained using eight times down-sampled visible near-infrared channels and the original low-resolution medium-wave infrared channel. Thus, the correspondence between the visible near-infrared channels and the medium-wave infrared channel is developed. Second, a convolutional reconstruction network is designed to further reconstruct the preliminary results. This network is trained using the low-resolution preliminary reconstruction results and the original medium-wave infrared image. Notably, the convolutional reconstruction network can build the relationship between the preliminary reconstruction results and the medium-wave infrared image. Finally, the original visible near-infrared channels in GaoFen-4 satellite imagery are fed into the trained GF-4-SRN. The final super-resolution reconstruction results can be obtained by the relationship between visible near-infrared images and the medium-wave infrared image. Experiments are performed on two real-world GF-4 satellite images acquired from Hubei and Jiangxi regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GF-4-SRN method can effectively enhance the spatial resolution of the medium-wave infrared image. Compared with the root mean square error of state-of-the-art methods, that of the GF-4-SRN is reduced by at least 7.54. Moreover, the visual effects are much clearer and more natural. Therefore, the GF-4-SRN contributes to expanding the application range of the GF-4 satellite imagery. This paper proposes a deep learning-based super-resolution method for GF-4 satellite imagery. The proposed GF-4-SRN is composed of preliminary reconstruction by convolutional regression network and further reconstruction by convolutional reconstruction network. Experimental results on Hubei and Jiangxi regions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GF-4-SRN. The spatial resolution is increased by fully utilizing the information provided by the visible near-infrared images. The root mean square error, erreur relative globale adimensionnelle de synthèse, and spectral angle mapper are lower than those of other methods. Meanwhile, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is higher than those of the competitors. Moreover, the visual effect of the results provided by the GF-4-SRN is much clearer and the reconstruction results contain more details. Notably, the deep learning-based method has great potential in super-resolution GF-4 satellite imagery. In the future, we will improve the GF-4-SRN by adopting various window sizes in the convolutional kernel. The network connection mode and optimization method can also be changed to improve the speed and performance of the network. The GF4-SRN will also be extended to other application areas, such as disaster monitoring. © 2020, Science Press.

The low-resolution bands can be upsampled to match the high resolution bands to extract valuable information at higher spatial resolution. This paper presents a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) based approach named as DSen2-WGAN to super-resolve the low-resolution (i.e., 20 m and 60 m) bands of Sentinel-2 images to a spatial resolution of 10 m. A proposed generator is trained in an adversarial manner using the min-max game to super-resolve the low-resolution bands with the guidance of available high-resolution bands in an image. The performance evaluated using metrics such as Signal Reconstruction Error (SRE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art method, DSen2 as the DSen2-WGAN reduced RMSE by 14.68% and 7%, while SRE improved by almost 4% and 1.6% for 6 (Formula presented.) and 2 (Formula presented.) super-resolution. Lastly, for further evaluation, we have used trained DSen2-WGAN model to super-resolve the bands of EuroSAT dataset, a satellite image classification dataset based on Sentinel-2 images.

SR has multiple residual network frameworks in deep learning that have improved performance and can extend thousands of layers in the system. However, each layer improves accuracy by doubling the number of layers, although training thousands of layers are too expensive, the process is slow, and there are functional recovery issues. To address these issues, we propose a super-resolution wide remote sensing residual network (WRSR), in which we increase the width and reduce the depth of the residual network, due to decreasing the depth of the network our model reduced memory costs.

A sequence of observations is assumed to be defined on a low resolution spatio-temporal grid. It is further assumed that the sequence is generated by blurring of a captured scene with a spatio-temporal convolution kernel and is degraded by noise. Our method simultaneously exhibits deconvolution of the sequence of images from the effects of spatio-temporal blur, denoising of the data, and upsampling of the low-resolution sequence to a high resolution spatio-temporal grid. We perform the super-resolution in the space-time domain, as opposed to super-resolving the sequence separately and sequentially to a higher spatial and then temporal resolution grid. Simultaneous space-time optimization achieves a more efficient and more accurate reconstruction than reconstructing a sequence frame by frame. The proposed super-resolution methodology is based on total variation regularization and computes the solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers.

In particular, multispectral and hyperspectral images have been fused to generate images with a high spatial and spectral resolution. In literature, there are several approaches for this task, nonetheless, those techniques still present a loss of relevant spatial information during the fusion process. This work presents a multi scale deep learning model to fuse multispectral and hyperspectral data, each with high-spatial-and-low-spectral resolution (HSaLS) and low-spatial-and-high-spectral resolution (LSaHS) respectively. As a result of the fusion scheme, a high-spatial-and-spectral resolution image (HSaHS) can be obtained. In order of accomplishing this result, we have developed a new scalable high spatial resolution process in which the model learns how to transition from low spatial resolution to an intermediate spatial resolution level and finally to the high spatial-spectral resolution image.

SR has multiple residual network frameworks in deep learning that have improved performance and can extend thousands of layers in the system. However, each layer improves accuracy by doubling the number of layers, although training thousands of layers are too expensive, the process is slow, and there are functional recovery issues. We proposed a transferred wide residual Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) remote sensing deep neural network model (WRSR). By increasing the width and reducing the residual network depth, the proposed approach has dramatically reduced memory costs. As a result, our model reduced memory costs by 21% in Enhanced Deep Residual Super-Resolution (EDSR) and 34% in SRResNet as a direct consequence of the in-depth reduction.

There are many potential applications that can directly benefit from this technique. A convolutional neural network (CNN) has been recently explored in image restoration and achieved remarkable performance. However, most deep CNN architectures in the literature do not properly handle the inherent trade-off between localization accuracy and the use of global context, which is vital for satellite images covering a ultrabroad area. We present a stacked lossless deconvolutional network (SLDN) for remote sensing image restoration. We fully exploit global context information while guaranteeing the recovery of fine details. Specifically, we design a lossless pooling by reformulating the pixel shuffle operator and incorporate it with a shallow deconvolutional network. The resulting lossless deconvolution blocks are stacked one by one to enlarge the receptive fields without any information loss. We further propose an attentive skip connection and progressive learning scheme to improve gradient flows throughout the SLDN. The SLDN can reconstruct high-quality satellite images without noticeable artifacts.

There are many types of resolution, such as spatial, spectral, and temporal. Still, in our case, we concentrated on spatial image resolution to super resolve the images from low-resolution images. For remote sensing image super-resolution fast wavelet-based super-resolution (FWSR), we propose a novel, fast wavelet-based plexus framework that performs super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN)-like extraction of features based on three hidden layers. First, wavelet sub-band images are combined into a pre-defined full-scale data training factor, including approximation and interchangeable stand-alone units (frequency sub-bands). Second, to speed up image recovery, mapping the sub-band image of the wavelet is then measured using its approximate image. Third, the added sub-pixel layer at the end of the network model is intended to reproduce image quality using a plexus framework. The approximation sub-band images obtained after discrete wavelet transform wavelet decomposition are used as input rather than the original image because of their high-frequency data and preserved characteristics. Five current super-resolution neural network approaches are compared with the proposed technique and tested on three pubic satellite image datasets and two benchmark datasets. The experimental findings are well compared qualitatively and quantitatively. © 2021 The Authors.

But high quality images of space object are difficult to obtain due to the large number of cosmic rays in the space environment, as well as the limitations of optical lenses, detectors and transmission links on satellites. Image denoising and super-resolution reconstruction are the most economical and effective methods to solve this problem. This paper presents an unpaired denoising and super-resolution reconstruction method for optical remote sensing images which could obtain the images has higher quality than dataset itself.

In order to improve the target recognition and classification capabilities by using GF-4 satellite image, the super-resolution reconstruction method is adopted. In this chapter, the GF-4 image quality enhancement software based on contour-consistent image super-resolution enhancement method is used to enhance the spatial resolution of GF-4 satellite PMS image. Under the condition of the same spatial resolution enhancement capability, the number of suitable image frames needed for multi-frame image super-resolution enhancement is analyzed quantitatively by selecting multiple evaluation indexes. Maximum likelihood classification method is used to classify land cover using GF-4 satellite resolution enhancement image and original image, respectively. Classification map of GF-1 satellite WFV image with 16 m resolution in the same classification method is used as reference data to evaluate the classification accuracy of GF-4 satellite images. Taking Kunshan City, Jiangsu Province as an experimental area, nine high-frequency imaging GF-4 satellite PMS images are selected for experiments. The experimental results show that with the increase of the number of GF-4 satellite PMS images participating in super-resolution enhancement, the radiation performance of the image after super-resolution enhancement presents an overall improvement trend. In addition, the GF-4 satellite PMS image after super-resolution enhancement not only improves the spatial resolution, but also improves the visual effect of the image. Combined with the characteristics of GF-4 satellite image and the geographical situation of Kunshan City, the land cover type is divided into residential land, water body, and vegetation. The classification results show that the overall accuracy of the classification based on the GF-4 satellite super-resolution enhanced image is higher than that based on the single-frame GF-4 satellite image. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Classification (of information); Disaster prevention; Geostationary satellites; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Maximum likelihood; Optical resolving power; Quality control; Software quality; Earth observation satellites; Environmental Monitoring; GF-4; Image quality enhancements; Image quality evaluation; Maximum likelihood classifications; Spatial-resolution enhancement; Super resolution reconstruction; Image enhancement","GF-4; Image quality evaluation; Land classification; Super resolution reconstruction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080941952"

However, the observed images from satellite sensors often suffer from low-resolution (LR), making it difficult to meet the requirements for further analysis. Super-resolution (SR) aims to increase the image resolution while providing finer spatial details, which perfectly remedies the weakness of satellite images. Therefore, in this article, we propose an innovative mixed high-order attention network (MHAN) for remote sensing SR. It comprises two components: a feature extraction network for feature extraction, and a feature refinement network with high-order attention (HOA) mechanism for detail restoration. In the feature extraction network, we replace the elementwise addition with weighted channelwise concatenation in all skip connections, which greatly facilitates the information flow. In the feature refinement network, rather than exploring the first-order statistics (spatial or channel attention), we introduce the HOA module to restore the missing details. Finally, to fully exploit hierarchical features, we introduce the frequency-aware connection to bridge the feature extraction and feature refinement networks. Experiments on two widely used remote sensing image data sets demonstrate that our MHAN not only obtains better accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods but also shows the superiority in terms of running time and GPU cost.

This paper presents a very deep convolutional neural network (VDCN) based spatiotemporal fusion approach to effectively handle massive remote sensing data in practical applications. Compared with existing shallow learning methods, especially for the sparse representation based ones, the proposed VDCN-based model has the following merits: (1) explicitly correlating the MODIS and Landsat images by learning a non-linear mapping relationship; (2) automatically extracting effective image features; and (3) unifying the feature extraction, non-linear mapping, and image reconstruction into one optimization framework. In the training stage, we train a non-linear mapping between downsampled Landsat and MODIS data using VDCN, and then we train a multi-scale super-resolution (MSSR) VDCN between the original Landsat and downsampled Landsat data. The prediction procedure contains three layers, where each layer consists of a VDCN-based prediction and a fusion model. These layers achieve non-linear mapping from MODIS to downsampled Landsat data, the two-times SR of downsampled Landsat data, and the five-times SR of downsampled Landsat data, successively. Extensive evaluations are executed on two groups of commonly used Landsat-MODIS benchmark datasets. For the fusion results, the quantitative evaluations on all prediction dates and the visual effect on one key date demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves more accurate fusion results than sparse representation based methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Image reconstruction; Mapping; Neural networks; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Massive remote sensing datum; Nonlinear mappings; Optimization framework; Quantitative evaluation; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatio-temporal fusions; Image fusion","Non-linear mapping; Spatiotemporal fusion; Very deep convolutional neural network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075368174"

Most previous studies only consider several integer magnification factors and focus on obtaining a specific SR model for each scale factor. However, in the real world, it is a common requirement to zoom the videos arbitrarily by rolling the mouse wheel. In this article, we propose a unified network for arbitrary scale SR (ASSR) of video satellite images. The proposed ASSR consists of two modules, i.e., feature learning module and arbitrary upscale module. The feature learning module accepts multiple low-resolution (LR) frames and extracts useful features of those frames by using many 3-D residual blocks. The arbitrary upscale module takes the extracted features as input and enhances the spatial resolution by subpixel convolution and bicubic-based adjustment. Different from existing video satellite image SR methods, ASSR can continuously zoom LR video satellite images with arbitrary integer and noninteger scale factors in a single model. Experiments have been conducted on real video satellite images acquired by Jilin-1 and OVS-1. Quantitative and qualitative results have demonstrated that ASSR has superior reconstruction performance compared with the state-of-The-Art SR methods. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","China; Jilin; Machine learning; Optical resolving power; Satellites; Arbitrary integer; Feature learning; Magnification factors; Quality of videos; Satellite images; Spatial resolution; State of the art; Super resolution; detection method; reconstruction; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Image enhancement","Arbitrary scale; deep learning; super-resolution (SR); video satellite","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097399936"

We implement image super-resolution for satellite images using a residual dense network (RDN). RDN is a CNN-based model, but unlike most CNN-based super-resolution models, it utilizes the hierarchic features from the input low resolution (LR) images and combines both the specific and general features present in the image, therefore resulting in a better performance. The novelty of our work lies in two aspects. First, we apply the residual dense network to remote sensing data to obtain higher structure similarity index metric (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values than the existing models. Second, we use transfer learning due to the lack of training samples in remote sensing domain. Our RDN is first trained using an external dataset DIVerse2K (DIV2K). This model is then used to obtain high-resolution(HR) images of the remote sensing U.C Merced dataset, and the corresponding PSNR and SSIM values are computed for different scaling factors such as 2, 4 and 8.

Super-resolution reconstruction is a way to improve image resolution. Satellite imagery has a wide imaging range. The scale of the ground target varies greatly and the texture information is diversified, which brings new challenges to the existing image super-resolution technology. A multi-scale residual deep neural network is proposed for the multi-scale characteristics of satellite imagery in this paper.

Deep learning algorithms have remarked as an entity for developing single image high-quality reconstruction. Super-resolution with Deep Learning algorithms has demonstrated state of the art approaches for reconstructing sharper and more accurate images. Satellite images are highly prone to lose minute details of the image when subjected to algorithmic modeling. Thus, it is necessary to preserve the details of image. In this paper, an attempt is made to incorporate the state of the art approaches for reconstructing the satellite images. This requires careful conditioning of validating parameters like bias value, weights, appropriate usage of filters and scaling factors. The existing super-resolution algorithms such as Bicubic interpolation, Super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), fast Super resolution convolutional neural network (FSRCNN) and Deep Laplacian Pyramid (LapSRN) are simulated to reconstruct the satellite images obtained from benchmark data sets of Indian and International satellite sensors.

Therefore, it is essential to establish a robust and automated framework for large-scale building extraction. However, the characteristic of remote sensing images complicates the application of the instance segmentation method based on the Mask R-CNN model, which ought to be improved toward extracting and fusing multi-scale features. Moreover, open-source satellite image datasets with wider spatial coverage and temporal resolution than high-resolution images may exhibit different coloration and resolution. This study proposes a large-scale building extraction framework based on super-resolution (SR) and instance segmentation using a relatively lower-resolution (>0.6 m) open-sourced dataset. The framework comprises four steps: color normalization and image super-resolution, scene classification, building extraction, and scene mosaicking. We took Hyogo Prefecture, Japan (19,187 km2) as a test area and extracted 1,726,006 (29.12 km2) of the 3,301,488 buildings (32.46 km2), where the number of buildings and footprint area increased by 3.0 % and 5.0 % respectively. The result indicated that the color normalization and image super-resolution could improve the visual quality of open-source satellite images and contribute to building extraction accuracy.

The convolutional sparse coding based superresolution method uses the translation invariance of the convolution filter to directly encode the entire image, maintaining consistency and good performance. In this article, we propose a novel approach to single-image superresolution reconstruction based on hybrid nonlocal similarity constrained convolution sparse coding. We first decompose the input image into a smooth part and a texture part. The Bayesian nonparametric model can use more prior information of the original image, so we replace the previous bicubic interpolation with this method to better reconstruct the residual high-frequency information in the smooth part. When reconstructing the texture part, this article proposes a nonlocal similarity constrained convolutional sparse coding method, which transforms the reconstruction of the texture part to minimize the convolution sparse coding noise of the feature maps and classifies the image patches in the search space by using the correlation coefficients as the structural information, avoiding unnecessary weight calculation. Several methods were tested on satellite images extensively. Both visual inspection and quantitative analysis results demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and increases noise immunity effectively. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Image coding; Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Textures; Bayesian nonparametric modeling; Correlation coefficient; High-frequency informations; Single-image super-resolution reconstruction; State-of-the-art methods; Structural information; Superresolution methods; Translation invariance; Bayesian analysis; correlation; image resolution; reconstruction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Image texture","Bayesian nonparametric model; convolution sparse coding; correlation coefficient; nonlocal (NL) similarity structure; superresolution (SR) reconstruction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107344094"

The deep learning-based STF algorithms focus on spatial dimensions to build a super-resolution (SR) model or the temporal dimensions to build a change prediction (CP) model, or the task itself to build a data-driven end-to-end model. The multi-source images used for STF usually have large spatial scale gaps and temporal spans. The large spatial scale gaps lead to poor spatial details based on a SR model; the large temporal spans make it difficult to accurately reconstruct changing areas based on a CP model. We propose a weighted dual-branch spatiotemporal fusion network based on complementarity between super-resolution and change prediction (WDBSTF), which includes the SR branch and CP branch, and a weight module representing the complementarity of the two branches. The SR branch makes full use of edge information and high-resolution reference images to obtain high-quality spatial features for image reconstruction. The CP branch decomposes complex problems via a two-layer cascaded network, changes features from the difference image, and selects high-quality spatial features through the attention mechanism. The fusion result of the CP branch has rich image details, but the fusion accuracy in the changing area is low due to the lack of detail. The SR branch has consistent and excellent fusion performances in the changing and no-changing areas, but the image details are not rich enough compared with the CP branch due to the large amplification factor. Next, a weighted network was designed to combine the advantages of the two branches to produce improved fusion results. We evaluated the performance of the WDBSTF in three representative scenarios, and both visual and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based edge-enhancement network (EEGAN) for robust satellite image SR reconstruction along with the adversarial learning strategy that is insensitive to noise. In particular, EEGAN consists of two main subnetworks: an ultradense subnetwork (UDSN) and an edge-enhancement subnetwork (EESN). In UDSN, a group of 2-D dense blocks is assembled for feature extraction and to obtain an intermediate high-resolution result that looks sharp but is eroded with artifacts and noises as previous GAN-based methods do. Then, EESN is constructed to extract and enhance the image contours by purifying the noise-contaminated components with mask processing. The recovered intermediate image and enhanced edges can be combined to generate the result that enjoys high credibility and clear contents.

Estimation of water-spread area and volume of the reservoirs using traditional methods like field surveys, acoustic surveys and hydrographic surveys is time-consuming, laborious and expensive. To overcome these problems, many researchers have used satellite images and the per-pixel (hard classification), the sub-pixel (soft classification) and the super resolution mapping approaches. The conventional hard and soft classification approaches do not give accurate results due to the presence of mixed pixels in the image scene of the periphery of the reservoir. In this work, a per-pixel algorithm (Maximum Likelihood), a sub-pixel algorithm (Fuzzy C Means) and a super resolution mapping algorithm (Genetic algorithm) are developed and the water-spread area is estimated for the reservoir using multi-date Landsat8 OLI images. The volume of the reservoir at different water levels are estimated using the water-spread area and the Trapezoidal formula. The capacity estimated from satellite image-derived area is compared with the capacity data obtained from the Poondi reservoir authority. The error in estimation due to the per-pixel approach is 16.74%, while it is 9.06% for the sub-pixel approach and a mere 3.25% for the super-resolution approach. Thus, the super-resolution mapping approach results in minimum error when compared to the sub-pixel approach which in turn gives lesser error result when comparing with the per-pixel approach. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chennai; India; Tamil Nadu; computer simulation; drinking water; fuzzy mathematics; genetic algorithm; research work; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; water quality","satellite image; sub-pixel mapping; Super resolution mapping; water-spread area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074952062"

Spatial resolution is an element of crucial impact on the usage of remote sensing imagery. High spatial resolution means satellite images provide more detailed information. To improve the spatial resolution at the sensor level, many factors are ought to be taken into consideration, such as the manufacturing process. Moreover, once the satellite is launched, no further action can be taken from the perspective of hardware. Therefore, a more practical solution to improve the resolution of a satellite image is to use Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques. This research proposal deals with the re-design, implementation, and evaluation of SISR technique using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Skip Connections and Network in Network (DCSCN) for enlarging multispectral remote sensing images captured by DubaiSat-2 (DS-2) and estimating the missing high frequency details. The goal is to achieve high performance in terms of quality, and to test whether training the network using luminance channel only, which is extracted from YCbCr domain, can achieve high quality results. For this purpose, DCSCN is trained, evaluated, and tested using a dataset collected from DS-2. A single low resolution DS-2 image is used to construct its high resolution version by training the model from scratch and fine-tuning its hyper-parameters to produce optimal results. The performance is evaluated using various quality indices, such as Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Wavelet domain Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WSNR). The performance is compared to other state-of-the-art methods, such as Bil-inear, Bi-cubic, and Lanczos interpolation. © 2019 SPIE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Multi-spectral; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structure similarity; Super resolution; Wavelet domain; Signal to noise ratio","Deep Learning; Image Reconstruction; Multispectral; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Structure Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM).; Super Resolution; Wavelet domain Signal to Noise Ratio (WSNR)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078179533"

During the pre/post-processing, when converting from level 1R images to level 1G images, geometric correction is essential. An interpolation method necessary for geometric correction is inevitably used, and the quality of the level 1G images is determined according to the accuracy of the interpolation method. Also, it is crucial to speed up the interpolation algorithm by the level processor. In this paper, we proposed a lightweight CNN-based interpolation method required for geometric correction when converting from level 1R to level 1G. The proposed method doubles the resolution of satellite images and constructs a deep learning network with a lightweight deep convolutional neural network for fast processing speed. In addition, a feature map fusion method capable of improving the image quality of multispectral (MS) bands using panchromatic (PAN) band information was proposed. The images obtained through the proposed interpolation method improved by about 0.4 dB for the PAN image and about 4.9 dB for the MS image in the quantitative peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) index compared to the existing deep learning-based interpolation methods. In addition, it was confirmed that the time required to acquire an image that is twice the resolution of the 36,500×36,500 input image based on the PAN image size is improved by about 1.6 times compared to the existing deep learning-based interpolation method. © 2022 Sami Publishing Company.

The trained GAN is used to sample from the high-resolution prior and a particle filter along with the low-resolution data (as observation) is used to obtain the posterior high-resolution geophysical field.

The new algorithm is applied to downscale sea surface temperature fields in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Results show consistent performance across different downscaling ratios.

Recent models of convolutional neural networks (CNN) are very suitable for applications with image processing, like resolution enhancement of images; but in order to obtain an acceptable result, it is important, not only to define the kind of CNN architecture but the reference set of images to train the model. Our work proposes an alternative to improve the spatial resolution of HR images obtained by Sentinel-2 satellite by using the VHR images from PeruSat1, a peruvian satellite, which serve as the reference for the super-resolution approach implementation based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, as an alternative for obtaining VHR images.

Specifically, we propose an artifact removal network with a self-adaption difference convolution (SDC) to fully exploit the structure prior in the LR image and predict the artifact map. Considering that the artifact map and the high-frequency map share a similar pattern, we introduce the supervised structure correction (SSC) block that establishes a bridge between the high-frequency generation process and the artifact removal process. Experimental results on satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method owns an improved tradeoff between the performance and the computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art satellite and natural SR methods.

In recent years, we use deep learning-based convolutional neural networks to improve the spatial resolution of images more reasonably. To train such deep learning models, we use training samples consisting of the original HR images and LR images obtained by bicubic downsampling. However, this method of training data using downsampling has a negative impact when applying the trained model to real images. That is because the downsampling function that occurs in the real image is unknown, and the hypothetically created LR image does not represent the resolution degradation that can realistically occur. Therefore, SISR methods that use realistic degradation called real-world super-resolution (RWSR) have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate how such RWSR methods using realistic degradation affect the SISR performance of satellite images. The results of applying the trained model to optical satellite images show that the RWSR method is not the most effective way to handle optical satellite images when compared to the deep learning method without modeling the degradation. In particular, we showed that the effect of RWSR with not only upsampling but also noise and blur removal is significant in the visibility of optical satellite images. Moreover, pre-trained RWSR models can be an aid in visually deciphering ground objects.  © Authors 2022","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Satellites; Signal sampling; BSRGAN; Down sampling; Image super resolutions; Optical satellite images; Real ESRGAN; Real-world; Satellite images; Single images; Superresolution; SWIN IR; Optical resolving power","BSRGAN; Image Restoration; Real ESRGAN; Satellite Image; Super Resolution; SWIN IR","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131963538"

In recent years, the deep-learning-based STF algorithm has become a research hotspot with comparatively higher accuracy and robustness. However, due to the lack of sufficient high-quality images for training and the huge resolution gap between low-resolution images and high-resolution images, it is difficult to recover detailed information, especially for areas of land-cover change. In this paper, we propose a two-layers super-resolution based generation adversarial spatiotemporal fusion model(TLSRSTF) using smaller inputs to reduce pressure on data requirements and a mutual affine convolution to reduce model parameters. Specifically, we only use a pair of high-resolution and low-resolution images and a high-resolution image at any time.

At present, the method of spatiotemporal fusion using convolutional neural networks has been proposed, but the network is shallow, so the fusion performance is limited. Aiming at the most widely used one-pair image spatiotemporal fusion, a new spatiotemporal fusion method based on deep neural network is established. Firstly, the basic network framework consists of two cascaded upsamplers with quadruple magnification to approximate the spatial difference and sensor difference between Landsat and MODIS satellites. Then, the residual error between the reconstructed image and the real image is learned by the convolutional neural network to make the reconstructed image closer to the real image. Moreover, the time prediction is carried out by highpass moduation strategy. Finally, the proposed method is tested on different Landsat and MODIS satellite images and compared with many spatiotemporal fusion algorithms. The experimental results show that, compared with the existing fusion algorithms, the reconstruction effect of the proposed method is better and the processing speed is faster. © 2021 Universitat zu Koln.

The spatial structure quality of HS images can be improved by fusing them either with higher-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images, or with higher-resolution multispectral (MS) images. Fusion of HS images can be done with fusion methods that are designed to fuse MS and PAN images, and the fusion methods developed for the fusion of HS and MS images. A wide variety of HS-MS and MS-PAN image fusion techniques can be used for the fusion of HS images, which leads the users to a hesitation as to which method(s) should be used for optimal fusion performance. Hence, the current study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the HS image fusion performances of a total of 15 MS-PAN image fusion methods and 17 state-of-the-art HS-MS image fusion techniques within four experiments, with the hope to give some clues on the performances of the fusion techniques used. Experiments showed that the HS-MS fusion methods exhibited much better HS image fusion performance, compared to the MS-PAN fusion methods used. It was also concluded that the coupled nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF), convolutional neural network (CNN) denoiser-based method (CNN-D), HS super-resolution (HySure) and fast fusion based on Sylvester equation with naive Gaussian prior (FUSE-G) techniques provided the most robust fusion results. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Hyperspectral imaging; Image fusion; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Fusion methods; Fusion performance; High resolution; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image fusions; Image fusion methods; Image fusion techniques; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Remote-sensing; image analysis; image classification; image resolution; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; Image enhancement","hyperspectral imaging; image enhancement; Image fusion; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136524797"

In this regard, several flood diagnoses have been developed using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, especially in large water bodies. However, one of the main challenges is still related to floods, where water surfaces have sizes similar to the spatial resolution of the analyzed satellite images, being difficult to detect and map. Therefore, the present study developed a combined methodology for flood mapping in small-sized water bodies using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery. The method consisted of evaluating the effectiveness of the application and combination of (a) a super-resolution algorithm to improve image resolution, (b) a set of seven spectral indices for highlighting water-covered areas, such as AWE indices, and (c) two methods for flood mapping, including a machine learning method based on unsupervised classification (EM cluster) and 14 thresholding methods for automatic determination. The processes were evaluated in the Carrión River, Palencia, Spain. It was determined that the approach with the best results in flood mapping was the one that combined AWE spectral indices with methods such as Huang and Wang, Li and Tam, Otsu, moment preservation, and EM cluster classification, showing global accuracy and Kappa coefficient values higher than 0.88 and 0.75, respectively, when applying the quantitative accuracy index. © 2022 by the authors.

However, to maintain high temporal resolution, video satellite images usually sacrifice their spatial resolution. Therefore, super-resolution (SR) plays a vital role in improving the quality of video satellite images. In this article, we propose a multiframe video SR neural network (MVSRnet) for video satellite image SR reconstruction. The proposed MVSRnet consists of three main subnetworks: an optical flow estimation subnetwork (OFEnet), an upscaling subnetwork (Upnet) and an attention-based residual learning subnetwork (ARLnet). The OFEnet aims to estimate low-resolution (LR) optical flow of multiple image frames. Upnet is then constructed to enhance the resolution of both input frames and the estimated LR optical flows. Motion compensation is subsequently performed according to the high-resolution (HR) optical flows. Finally, the compensated HR cube is fed to the ARLnet to generate SR results. Different from existing video satellite image SR methods, the proposed MVSRnet is a multiframe-based method with an attention mechanism, which can merge the motion information among adjacent frames and highlight the importance of extracted features. Experiments conducted on Jilin-1 and OVS-1 video satellite images demonstrate that the proposed MVSRnet significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art SR methods.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Image enhancement; Motion compensation; Optical flows; Optical resolving power; Satellites; Attention mechanisms; High temporal resolution; Motion information; Optical flow estimation; Quality of videos; Spatial resolution; State of the art; Video image sequences; artificial neural network; image resolution; satellite imagery; videography; Image reconstruction","Attention; Multiframe super-resolution (SR); Optical flow estimation; Remote sensing; Residual learning; Video satellite","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107180087"

Sparsity can reduce the noises and improve the resolution. Super resolution in medical and satellite imagery is essential because low resolution image analysis is very difficult. Sparsity techniques have significant influence on computer vision specially when the main objective is extracting the meaningful information. The success of sparsity is related to the nature of signals such as image and sound which are naturally sparse because they were founded based on Wavelet and Fourier equations. In this research, we proposed a method for restoring a clear image from the related low-resolution parts of both MRI and satellite images. First, we proposed a widespread structure for learning the couple low rank and sparse main characteristic representation. Combined optimization of the nuclear and L1 norms extracts the total low rank formation and the local patterns lodged in the image. In that case the reconstructed image will be more informative and matrix decomposition problem can recover a noisy observation matrix into an approximation of low rank matrix and a second matrix which contains some low dimensional structure. We assumed that by removing the blur and noise from these images, they would be reconstructed in the highest quality. The proposed method was compared with a variety dictionary learning approaches which addressed super resolution problem, such as tensor sparsity, Generative Bayesian and TV based methods. We demonstrated the results of applied method on MRI and satellite images, showing both visual and psnr improvements. Dealing with complex data in best manner shows the robustness of the proposed method. © Author(s) 2023.

In stereophotogrammetry, the disparity map is essential in extracting the digital terrain model (DTM) and thus obtaining a 3D spatial mapping, which is necessary for a better analysis of planetary surfaces. However, the entire reconstruction process performed with the stereo-matching algorithm can be time consuming and can generate many artifacts. Coupled with the lack of adequate stereo coverage, it can pose a significant obstacle to 3D planetary mapping. Recently, many deep learning architectures have been proposed for monocular depth estimation, which aspires to predict the third dimension given a single 2D image, with considerable advantages thanks to the simplification of the reconstruction problem, leading to a significant increase in interest in deep models for the generation of super-resolution images and DTM estimation. In this paper, we combine these last two concepts into a single end-to-end model and introduce a new generative adversarial network solution that estimates the DTM at 4× resolution from a single monocular image, called SRDiNet (super-resolution depth image network). Furthermore, we introduce a sub-network able to apply a refinement using interpolated input images to better enhance the fine details of the final product, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of its benefits through three different versions of the proposal: SRDiNet with GAN approach, SRDiNet without adversarial network, and SRDiNet without the refinement learned network plus GAN approach.

Although deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed for this purpose in recent years have outperformed relatively shallow models, enormous parameters bring the risk of overfitting. In addition, due to the different scale of objects in images, the hierarchical features of deepCNNcontain additional information for SR tasks, while most CNN models have not fully utilized these features. In this paper, we proposed a deep yet concise network to address these problems. Our network consists of two main structures: (1) recursive inference block based on dense connection reuse of local low-level features, and recursive learning is applied to control the model parameters while increasing the receptive fields; (2) a bidirectional convolutional LSTM (BiConvLSTM) layer is introduced to learn the correlations of features from each recursion and adaptively select the complementary information for the reconstruction layer. Experiments on multispectral satellite images, panchromatic satellite images, and nature high-resolution remote-sensing images showed that our proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art methods while utilizing fewer parameters, and ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of a BiConvLSTM layer for an image SR task. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Object detection; Object recognition; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; BiConvLSTM; Convolutional neural network; Dense connection; High resolution remote sensing images; Multispectral satellite image; Recursive neural networks; State-of-the-art methods; Super resolution; Long short-term memory","BiConvLSTM; Dense connection; Recursive neural network; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074190624"

Therefore, a reliable super-resolution method which is optimized for accurate and detail BDD is fundamental one for advancing the BDD analysis even when we can use only low-resolution images after a disaster. Based on Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) and U-Net convolutional network, an efficient and novel BDD framework is proposed in this paper for obtaining upsampled BDD results from low-resolution post-disaster images. We trained the framework using two disasters from the xBD dataset and tested three different structures.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated current mainstream approaches. However, the utilization of pixel-based loss function hinders achieving realistic perceptual results at large upscale factors. Recently, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) attained more realistic, crisp results in natural image, but the complex nature of satellite images limits the performance. In this work, we address these challenges equipped with the promising results of Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) in classification tasks. A Spatial and Channel Squeeze-and-Excitation GAN (SCSE-GAN) is introduced. The proposed generator stacked SCSE block after each residual block to recalibrate and ensure features flow and amplify high-frequency details. In addition, skip/residual connection was utilized in the GAN generator network to further boost the performance. Wasserstein distance with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) was adopted to stabilize training and avoid gradient vanishing phenomena. Finally, we conducted various experiments on two open-source benchmarks namely: RSSCN7 and Kaggle datasets, to systematically evaluate the proposed framework performance. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach excels other approaches quantitatively and visually. Quantitatively, the results show a boost by a considerable margin of 2%, and 3% in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), respectively. Visually, the proposed method shows a sharper, less smooth image compared with benchmark SISR approaches. © 2021, The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.","Benchmarking; Convolutional neural networks; Image resolution; Open systems; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Adversarial networks; Classification tasks; High frequency HF; Peak signal to noise ratio; Sensor capability; Structural similarity index measures (SSIM); Super resolution; Wasserstein distance; Signal to noise ratio","Deep Learning (DL); Generative Adversarial Network (GAN); Gradient penalty (WGAN-GP); Single Image Super Resolution (SISR); Spatial and Channel Squeeze-and-Excitation (SCSE); Wasserstein distance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108651959"

Nowadays, it is conceivable that a large production of DSMs from satellite images can become the primary source of 3D information on a global scale. However, in urban areas, DSMs produced with current technology suffer from poor quality. Indeed, even using very high resolution (VHR) images, there is too little information to generate disparity maps that reproduce very well defined shaped objects such as buildings. To address this issue, one solution may be to artificially increase image resolution beyond the sensor limits. Super resolution (SR) algorithms are designed to recover high frequencies, introducing significant information in a scene characterized by strong and frequent discontinuities such as a city. State-of-the-art methods relying on Deep Learning have shown remarkable results in this sense. The aim of this work is therefore to assess the contribution of single image SR Deep Learning techniques to the stereo matching and DSMs generation in an urban context, highlighting potential advantages and limitations that can show up when introducing such a technology in a multi-view stereo pipeline. The proposed contributions are: a methodology for super resolution of VHR data that takes into account realistic simulation of a satellite product; a testbed for the evaluation of the impact of super resolution on 3D photogrammetric reconstruction; a local analysis of the consequences of deep learning SR of VHR images on stereo matching.  © 2022 N.

Thanks to its high temporal resolution, video satellite has been extensively used for environmental detection, especially for dynamic target monitoring. However, limited by the imaging device, it sacrifices some of its spatial resolution. Therefore, the super-resolution (SR) technology applied to these images is crucial. Based on deep residual learning, which has obtained a great success in the single-image SR, we propose a SR network structure which consists of two main steps. First, we use multi-scale feature extraction to exploit more contextual information on video satellite imagery, which is aimed at inferring high frequency components. Then, we utilize a series of residual blocks to learn the mapping between low resolution and high resolution images in a deeper and more stable network.

By constructing an image algorithm based on compressed sensing, the performance of image recognition and analysis can be effectively improved. Quorum sensing (QS) is the physiological behavior of bacteria that can be regulated by gene expression through the proliferation of small molecule tautological signal molecules to perceive cell population density changes. On this basis, the population induction effect of acid red soil on plant rhizosphere microorganisms was analyzed. The results include: (1) The dynamic changes of Awls content in rhizosphere soils of different plant species in acid soils at different growth stages were studied. (2) The molecular mechanism of plant-soil-microorganism interaction under acid stress was explored.

Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Learning systems; Optical resolving power; Spectroscopy; Earth observation data; Higher resolution images; Learning techniques; Multispectral images; Posterior analysis; Reference satellites; Spectral radiometry; Super-resolution models; Image enhancement","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Multi-spectral image; Sentinel-2; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091855430"

Due to differences in imaging characteristics between digital cameras and remote-sensing cameras, the existing network models cannot get the best super resolution (SR) results of satellite images. In response to the requirements of remote-sensing image production, we propose a single image super-resolution (SISR) reconstruction method for specific type of remote-sensing satellite. First, we measure and model the imaging degradation phenomenon of remote-sensing satellite, including the image blur and noise model. Then, high-quality aerial images are down-sampled and degraded to construct paired training image datasets. We chose the most popular Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) as the basic structure and optimized the number of Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) modules to further improve the processing efficiency. Finally, we perform a series of quantitative measurements of the SR image results, including image interpretation capability, reconstruction accuracy, ground resolution distance, and data processing efficiency, using higher resolution remote-sensing images as the benchmark.

Despite recent advances, much remains to be done for CNNs to learn a better representation of image samples. Therefore, constant optimizations should be provided on CNNs. To achieve a good performance on classification, intuitively, samples' interclass separability, or intraclass compactness should be simultaneously maximized. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a new network, named separability and compactness network (SCNet) to rectify this problem. SCNet minimizes the softmax loss and the distance between features of samples from the same class under a jointly supervised framework, resulting in simultaneous maximization of interclass separability and intraclass compactness of samples. Furthermore, considering the convenience and the efficiency of the cosine similarity in face recognition tasks, we incorporate it into SCNet's distance metric to enable sample features from the same class to line up in the same direction and those from different classes to have a large angle of separation. We apply SCNet to three different tasks: visual classification, face recognition, and image superresolution. Experiments on both public data sets and real-world satellite images validate the effectiveness of our SCNet. © 2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Image resolution; Job analysis; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Personnel training; Satellites; Societies and institutions; Convolutional neural network; Face; Image super-resolution; Loss measurement; Task analysis; article; facial recognition; satellite imagery; Face recognition","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); cosine distance loss; image superresolution (SR); satellite video; softmax loss","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060931387"

To the best of our knowledge, it is important to explore a deep-learning approach to delineate high-resolution semantic maps of buildings from middle-resolution satellite images. The approach is termed as super-resolution semantic segmentation in this paper. Specifically, we design a neural network with integrated low-level image features of super-resolution and high-level semantic features of super-resolution, which is trained with Sentinel-2A images (i.e., 10 m) and higher-resolution semantic maps (i.e., 2.5 m). The network, based on super-resolution semantic segmentation features is called FSRSS-Net. In China, the 35 cities are partitioned into three groups, i.e., 19 cities for model training, four cities for quantitative testing and the other 12 cities for qualitative generalization ability analysis of the learned networks. A large-scale sample dataset is created and utilized to train and validate the performance of the FSRSS-Net, which includes 8597 training samples and 766 quantitative accuracy evaluation samples. Quantitative evaluation results show that: (1) based on the 10 m Sentinel-2A image, the FSRSS-Net can achieve super-resolution semantic segmentation and produce 2.5 m building recognition results, and there is little difference between the accuracy of 2.5 m results by FSRSS-Net and 10 m results by U-Net. More importantly, the 2.5 m building recognition results by FSRSS-Net have higher accuracy than the 2.5 m results by U-Net 10 m building recognition results interpolation up-sampling; (2) from the spatial visualization of the results, the building recognition results of 2.5 m are more precise than those of 10 m, and the outline of the building is better depicted. Qualitative analysis shows that: (1) the learned FSRSS-Net can be also well generalized to other cities that are far from training regions; (2) the FSRSS-Net can still achieve comparable results to the U-Net 2 m building recognition results, even when the U-Net is directly trained using both 2-meter resolution GF2 satellite images and corresponding semantic labels. © 2021 by the authors.

There are many potential applications that can directly benefit from this technique. A convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved great success for image super-resolution (SR). However, most deep CNN architectures do not properly handle the inherent trade-off between localization accuracy and the use of global context. In this paper, we propose a stacked lossless deconvolutional network (SLDN) for remote sensing SR. We fully exploit global context information while guaranteeing the recovery of fine details. Specifically, we design a lossless pooling by reformulating the pixel shuffle operator, and incorporate it with a shallow deconvolutional network. The resulting lossless deconvolution blocks (LDBs) are stacked one by one to enlarge the receptive fields without any information loss. We further design an attentive skip connection to improve gradient flows throughout the LDB. The SLDN can reconstruct high-quality satellite images without noticeable artifacts. We also provide an extensive ablation study showing that all the components proposed in this paper are useful for the remote sensing SR.

Over time, the fields of application have expanded in scope. The SISR method is also applied in the field of intelligent satellite imagery. In recent years, research applications based on intelligent satellite images have mostly focused on imaging, classification, and segmentation. They have rarely been used in actual observation problems. This article proposes a new intelligent neural network model, the Laplacian pyramid residual dense network, for the super-resolution of hyperspectral satellite medical geographic small-targets. This study proceeds in three steps. First, the three-layer Laplacian pyramid structure is designed to increase the depth of the image at the feature extraction stage. Second, the residual mode is improved and updated; a new residual block is proposed for constructing the residual dense network to enhance the feature details of the image during the training process. In the third step, an end-to-end network is established directly through the residual structure for eliminating unnecessary visualization during the process and for ease of training. According to the experimental results, it has been proved that the deep intelligent neural network method proposed here has achieved good results in the application for super-resolution of medical geographic small-target intelligent satellite images. c 2021 Society for Imaging Science and Technology. © Society for Imaging Science and Technology 2021","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Laplace transforms; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Small satellites; End-to-end network; Hyperspectral satellite; Laplacian Pyramid; Neural network method; Neural network model; Research applications; Residual structure; Science and Technology; Neural networks","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106535318"

We refer to such a sensing paradigm as remote urban sensing. In this paper, we focus on a migratable satellite image super-resolution problem in remote urban sensing applications. Our goal is to reconstruct satellite images of a high resolution in a target area where the high-resolution training data is not available by transferring a super-resolution model learned in a source area where such data is available. This problem is motivated by the limitation of current solutions that primarily rely on a rich set of high-resolution satellite images in the studied area that are not always available. Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) the target and source areas often have very different urban characteristics that prevent the direct application of a super-resolution model learned from the source area to the target area; ii) it is not a trivial task to ensure effective model migration with desirable quality without sufficient high quality training data. To address the above challenges, we develop TransRes, a deep adversarial transfer learning framework, to effectively reconstruct high-resolution satellite images without requiring any ground-truth training data from the studied area. We evaluate the TransRes framework using the real-world satellite imagery data collected from three different cities in Europe. The results show that TransRes consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by achieving the lowest perception errors under various application scenarios.  © 2020 IEEE.","Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Transfer learning; Application scenario; High resolution satellite images; Image super resolutions; Learning frameworks; Satellite imagery data; Super-resolution models; Urban characteristics; Urban environments; Deep learning","Migratable Image Super-Resolution; Remote Sensing; Transfer Learning; Urban Sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091995745"

To address this challenge, we propose a deep unfolding method (LDUM) that includes two major components: 1) the pretreatment network and 2) the unfolding blocks. The main responsibility of the pretreatment network is to generate initial high-resolution images. Further, we model high-resolution images with the prior information, which can be seen as a combination of low-resolution and high-frequency residual images, and solve the optimization problem via the iterative proximal strategy. Specifically, we unfold the iterative process into a deep neural network to refine the reconstructed results, as each layer serves as an iterative step of the proposed optimization model. Thus, the proposed method is able to iteratively generate residual maps and high-resolution images by combining the powerful feature extraction capability of data-driven deep-learning-based methods and the interpretability of traditional model-driven algorithms.

In the Yellow River Delta (YRD), the rapid expansion of S. alterniflora has caused serious negative ecological effects. Current studies have concentrated primarily on mapping the distribution of S. alterniflora with medium-resolution satellite imagery at the regional or landscape scale, which have a limited capability in early detection and monitoring of the invasive process at the patch scale. In this study, we proposed a framework for monitoring the early stage invasion of S. alterniflora patches in the YRD using multiyear multisource high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery with various ground sampling distances (WorldView-2, SPOT-6, GaoFen-1, GaoFen-2, and GaoFen-6 from 2012 to 2019). First, we proposed to use deep-learning-based image super-resolution models to enhance all images to submeter (0.5 m) resolution. Then, we adopted stepwise evolution analysis-based image segmentation and object-based classification rules to detect and delineate S. alterniflora patches from the super-resolved imagery. By investigating Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (SRCNN) and Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (FSRCNN) and comparing these methods with the conventional bicubic interpolation method for image resolution enhancement, we concluded that FSRCNN was superior in constructing spectral and structural details from the 1 m/1.5 m/2 m resolution images to 0.5 m resolution. FSRCNN, in particular, was more effective and efficient in discerning and estimating the size of small S. alterniflora patches (<50 m2). Using our method, 76 of 83 field-measured small patches were accurately detected and the delineated S. alterniflora patch perimeters agreed well with the field-measured patch perimeters (root mean square error [RMSE] = 8.29 m, mean absolute percentage error [MAPE] = 23.46 %). The invasion process showed fast expansion from 2012 to 2015 and slow growth from 2016 to 2019. We observed that the landward limits of S. alterniflora patches were influenced by elevation and vicinity to tidal creeks. © 2020 The Authors","China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta; Spartina alterniflora; artificial neural network; biological invasion; grass; introduced species; invasive species; monitoring; sampling; satellite imagery; spatial resolution","Deep learning; High-resolution satellite image; Image; Invasive plants; Spartina alterniflora; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100380009"

Pansharpening is prone to spectral distortions based on the nature of the panchromatic band. If the spatial features are unclear in the panchromatic image, the pan-sharpened image will not be able to produce clear images. Super-Resolution (SR) is a technique that enhances minute details of the features in the image, thereby improving spatial information in the image. By fusing the Multispectral image with the super-resolved panchromatic image, there is a chance for producing high-quality multispectral imagery (pan-sharpened image). In this paper, ten state-of-the-art super-resolution based on deep learning techniques are tested and analyzed using ten different publicly available panchromatic datasets. On analysis, a feedback network for image super-resolution (SRFBN) technique outperforms the other algorithms in terms of sharp edges and pattern clarity, which are not visible in the input image. The proposed method is the fusion of SR applied PAN image with the MS image using a benchmarked Band Depended Spatial Detail (BDSD) pansharpening algorithm. The proposed method experiments with six datasets from different sensors. On analysis, the proposed technique outperforms the other counterpart pansharpening algorithms in terms of enhanced spatial information in addition to sharp edges and pattern clarity at reduced spectral distortion. Hence, the super-resolution based pansharpening algorithm is recommended for high spatial image applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

While most research focuses on the processing of photographs consisting only of RGB color channels, little work can be found concentrating on multi-band, analytic satellite imagery. Satellite images often include a panchromatic band, which has higher spatial resolution but lower spectral resolution than the other bands. In the field of remote sensing, there is a long tradition of applying pan-sharpening to satellite images, i.e. bringing the multispectral bands to the higher spatial resolution by merging them with the panchromatic band. To our knowledge there are so far no approaches to super-resolution which take advantage of the panchromatic band. In this paper we propose a method to train state-of-the-art CNNs using pairs of lower-resolution multispectral and high-resolution pan-sharpened image tiles in order to create super-resolved analytic images. The derived quality metrics show that the method improves information content of the processed images. We compare the results created by four CNN architectures, with RedNet30 performing best. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Monitoring these forest areas is more effective with the help of satellite imagery, since ground operations are hampered by vegetation density and height, making them less productive and more expensive. However, nowadays, freely available imagery from Sentinel-2 satellite has a maximum spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel, a low resolution to identify small or thin structures in the image, such as roads, bridges, buildings, rivers, fuel breaks, among others. To improve image’s resolution, a new super-resolution algorithm, named KGEONP – K Geographically Nearest Pixels, is proposed in this paper. It benefits from Sentinel-2 regular observations (it has a revisit of 5 days) and the georeferencing error of its images (whose maximum value is 1.5 pixels). KGEONP seeks to add as much information as possible to the super-resolved image, by using data from K-nearest pixels and their spatial distance for computing each new pixel’s value. KGEONP was applied to Sentinel-2 images to increase resolution by a factor of 10 and was compared to state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques. It showed quite satisfactory results, with the capacity of increasing resolution and maintaining the structural data of the source images. © 2021 IEEE.","Deforestation; Errors; Image enhancement; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Earth observations; Geolocations; Georeferencing; Georeferencing error; Image super resolutions; Multi-images; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; Super resolution algorithms; Superresolution; Pixels","Earth Observation; Georeferencing Error; Satellite Imagery; Sentinel-2; Super-Resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125673913"

Image super-resolution plays an important role in remote sensing image processing. However, existing methods show that increasing network depth will inevitably lead to the dramatic increase of model parameters and the over-fitting problem. Besides, most methods treat different types of information (low-frequency and high-frequency) equally. Motivated by these observations, we propose a fused recurrent network via channel attention (CA-FRN) in this paper. The basic module, recursive channel attention block (RCAB), pays enough attention to the high-frequency information and diminishes the low-frequency information adaptively through channel attention. Based on RCAB, we render our model effective by retaining and fusing hierarchical local information of both low-resolution and high-resolution, and we enhance the network performance simply by increasing the number of RCABs without adding extra parameters. We evaluate the proposed model on satellite images from different datasets, and the proposed CA-FRN is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

However, improper linear fitting tends to produce unsatisfactory results with notable artifacts. To relieve the improper linear fitting and reuse the hierarchical features, we propose an end-to-end locally linear embedding super-resolution network, termed as LLE-Net, based on the assumption that the local geometric relationship in the low-resolution manifold space also exists in high-level feature manifold space. The proposed LLE-Net includes two major components: 1) the local linear embedding block (LLEB) and 2) the hierarchical non-local block (HNB). In particular, LLEB searches sparse and similar feature maps and embeds the geometric relationship into the high-level feature space, allowing more attention to be paid to objects’ textural details. To promote the representation ability, the proposed HNB is able to explore layer- and pixel-level interdependencies. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the superiority of LLE-Net via two groups of experiments: (1) super-resolution tasks on two satellite image datasets and a satellite video image dataset, and (2) the subsequent high-level image processing tasks (i.e., satellite semantic segmentation). The proposed method achieves an 0.7 dB improvement in PSNR value on the Draper dataset and 0.07% segmentation accuracy improvement.

Moreover, supervised learning approaches rely on many high-resolution and low-resolution image pairings to reconstruct missing information based on their association, developed by complex long hours of deep neural network training. Additionally, the trained model&#x0027;s generalizability on various image datasets with various distributions is not guaranteed. To overcome this challenge, we proposed our novel Self-FuseNet, particularly for extremely poor-resolution satellite images. Also, the network exhibits strong generalization performance on additional datasets (both &#x201C;Ideal&#x201D; and &#x201C;Non-Ideal&#x201D; scenarios). The network is especially for those image datasets suffering from two significant limitations: (1) non-availability of ground truth high-resolution images and (2) limitation of a large count of the unpaired dataset for deep neural network training. The benefit of the proposed model is threefold: First, it does not require any significant extensive training data, either paired or unpaired but only a single low-resolution image without prior knowledge of its distribution. Secondly, it is a simple and effective model for super-resolving very poor-resolution images, saving computational resources and time. Third, using UNet, the processing of data is accelerated by the network&#x0027;s wide skip connections, allows image reconstruction with fewer parameters. Rather than using an inverse approach, as common in most deep learning scenarios, we introduced a forward approach to super-resolve exceptionally low-resolution remote sensing images. This demonstrates its supremacy over recently proposed state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised single real-world image blind super-resolution.

In general, high resolution is often accomplished by increasing the accuracy and density of the sensor. However, such an approach is too expensive on the design and equipment. Particularly, increasing the sensor density of satellites incurs great risks. Inspired by EEGAN, some parts of networks: Ultra-Dense Subnet (UDSN) and Edge-Enhanced Subnet (EESN) are modified. The UDSN is used to extract features and obtain high-resolution images which look clear but are deteriorated by artifacts in the intermediate stage, while the EESN is used to purify, enhance and extract the image contours and uses mask processing to eliminate the image corrupted by noise. Then, the restored intermediate image and the enhanced edge are combined to become a high-resolution image with clear contents and high authenticity.

Recently, deep-learning based super resolution has become the mainstream, and applications of these methods are widely used in the remote sensing field. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution method based on the deep back-projection network model to improve the satellite image resolution by the factor of four. In the process, we customized the loss function with the edge loss to result in a more detailed feature of the boundary of each object and to improve the stability of the model training using generative adversarial network based on Wasserstein distance loss. Also, we have applied the detail preserving image down-scaling method to enhance the naturalness of the training output. Finally, by including the modified-residual learning with a panchromatic feature in the final step of the training process. Our proposed method is able to reconstruct fine features and high frequency information. Comparing the results of our method with that of the others, we propose that the super-resolution method improves the sharpness and the clarity of WorldView-3 and KOMPSAT-2 images. © 2020 Annals of Laparoscopic and Endoscopic Surgery.

Most MISR techniques are currently based on the aggregation of samples from registered low resolution images. A promising research trend aimed at incorporating natural image priors in MISR consists in using data-driven neural networks. However, due to the unavailability of ground truth high resolution data, these networks cannot be trained on real satellite images. In this paper, we present a framework for training MISR algorithms from bursts of satellite images without requiring high resolution ground truth. This is achieved by adapting the recently proposed frame-to-frame framework to process bursts of satellite images. In addition we propose an architecture based on feature aggregation that allows to fuse a variable number of frames and is capable of handling degenerate samplings while also reducing noise. On synthetic datasets, the proposed self-supervision strategy attains results on par with those obtained with a supervised training. We applied our framework to real SkySat satellite image bursts leading to results that are more resolved and less noisy than the L1B product from Planet. © 2021 IEEE.","Computer vision; Optical resolving power; Cost of operations; Ground truth; Image super resolutions; Low resolution images; Low-costs; Multi-images; Optical satellites; Research trends; Resolution techniques; Satellite images; Satellites","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116038018"

This paper provides a rationale for image super-resolution for small objects by improving the current super-resolution (SR) framework by incorporating a cyclic generative adversarial network (GAN) and residual feature aggregation (RFA) to improve detection performance. The novelty of the method is threefold: first, a framework is proposed, independent of the final object detector used in research, i.e., YOLOv3 could be replaced with Faster R-CNN or any object detector to perform object detection; second, a residual feature aggregation network was used in the generator, which significantly improved the detection performance as the RFA network detected complex features; and third, the whole network was transformed into a cyclic GAN. The image super-resolution cyclic GAN with RFA and YOLO as the detection network is termed as SRCGAN-RFA-YOLO, which is compared with the detection accuracies of other methods. Rigorous experiments on both satellite images and aerial images (ISPRS Potsdam, VAID, and Draper Satellite Image Chronology datasets) were performed, and the results showed that the detection performance increased by using super-resolution methods for spatial resolution enhancement; for an IoU of 0.10, AP of 0.7867 was achieved for a scale factor of 16. © 2021 by the authors.

These techniques increase various surveillance applications by providing finer spatial details than data from original sensors. Satellite images obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observation offer essential information about the earth's landscape, ocean, and ecosystem, contributing to monitoring various applications in the scientific field. The spatial resolution of satellite images has a significant impact on image accuracy. This paper focuses on improving image resolution by training a convolutional neural network to produce super-resolution images from low-resolution images. We present an implementation of Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN), a GAN-based approach that uses a perceptual loss function that includes an adversarial loss and a content loss. Using a discriminator network that is designed for discerning between super-resolved images and original photo-realistic images, the adversarial loss drives the solution of this architecture to natural images. Moreover, the content loss is driven by perceptual similarity rather than pixel space similarity. We used this architecture to satellite images collected from NASA MODIS devices and found satisfactory results.

To evaluate the quality of super-resolution, the reconstruction outcome is compared with a ground-truth reference image, and the dissimilarity between them is commonly treated as a determinant of the reconstruction quality. While this is straightforward for simulated data, it becomes more challenging for real-world scenarios, in which reference images and the reconstruction inputs are acquired using different imaging sensors. In such cases, the dissimilarity also results from other factors concerned with different sensor characteristics. In a recently organized Proba-V Super Resolution Challenge, the reconstruction quality was assessed using a modified peak signal-to-noise ratio which compensates for small shifts and global changes in the brightness. In the study reported here, we investigate a number of image similarity metrics to verify their robustness against different levels of distortions applied to Proba-V images. We expect that the reported results will help in choosing appropriate metrics while developing new super-resolution solutions aimed at real-world scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.","Geology; Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Appropriate metrics; Image spatial resolution; Peak signal to noise ratio; Real-world scenario; Reconstruction quality; Satellite images; Sensor characteristics; Super resolution reconstruction; Image enhancement","image similarity; satellite imaging; Super-resolution reconstruction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102002547"

Despite their success, low-high resolution image pairs are usually difficult to obtain in certain scenarios, and these methods are limited in the actual scene (unknown or non-ideal image acquisition process). In this paper, we proposed a novel unsupervised learning framework, termed Enhanced Image Prior (EIP), which achieves SR tasks without low/high resolution image pairs. We first feed random noise maps into a designed generative adversarial network (GAN) for satellite image SR reconstruction. Then, we convert the reference image to latent space as the enhanced image prior. Finally, we update the input noise in the latent space with a recurrent updating strategy, and further transfer the texture and structured information from the reference image. Results on extensive experiments on the Draper dataset show that EIP achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised SR methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Specifically, red-edge (RE) satellite images can be used in this context to reduce the influence of soil background at early stages as well as saturation due to crop leaf area index (LAI) at later stages. However, the availability of high-resolution RE satellite image products for research and application globally remains limited. This study uses the weight-and-unmixing algorithm as well as the SUPer-REsolution for multi-spectral Multi-resolution Estimation (Wu-SupReME) approach to combine the advantages of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial resolution and generate a high-resolution RE product. The resultant fused image is highly correlated (R2 > 0.98) with Sentinel-2 image and clearly illustrates the persistent advantages of such products. This fused image was significantly more accurate than the originals when used to predict heterogeneous wheat LAI and therefore clearly illustrated the persistence of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial advantage, which indirectly proved that the fusion methodology of generating high-resolution red-edge products from Planet and Sentinel-2 images is possible.

In this paper we propose a data augmentation technique that can further boost the performance of satellite image super resolution tasks. A super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) was adopted as a state-of-the-art deep learning model to test the proposed data augmentation technique. Different augmentation techniques were studied to investigate their relative importance and accuracy gains. We categorized the augmentation methods into instance based and channel based augmentation methods. The former refers to the standard approach of creating new data instances through applying image transformations to the original images such as adding artificial noise, rotations and translations to training samples, while in the latter we fuse auxiliary channels (or custom bands) with each training instance, which helps the model learn useful representations. Fusing auxiliary derived channels to a satellite image RGB combination can be seen as a spectral-spatial fusion process as we explain later. Several experiments were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed fusion-based augmentation method compared with traditional data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flip and noisy training inputs. The reconstruction quality of the high resolution output was quantitatively evaluated using Peak-Signal-To-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and qualitatively through visualisation of test samples before and after super-resolving. © 2019 ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences.

Sentinel-2 images provide multi-spectral information every 5 days for each location. However, the maximum spatial resolution of its bands is 10m for RGB and near-infrared bands. Increasing the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images without additional costs, would make any posterior analysis more accurate. Most approaches on super-resolution for Sentinel-2 have focused on obtaining 10m resolution images for those at lower resolutions (20m and 60m), taking advantage of the information provided by bands of finer resolutions (10m). Otherwise, our focus is on increasing the resolution of the 10m bands, that is, super-resolving 10m bands to 2.5m resolution, where no additional information is available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution and deep learning-based approaches have become the state-of-the-art for this problem on standard images. Obviously, models learned for standard images do not translate well to satellite images. Hence, the problem is how to train a deep learning model for super-resolving Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exist (Sentinel-2 images at 2.5m). We propose a methodology for learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentinel-2 image super-resolution making use of images from other sensors having a high similarity with Sentinel-2 in terms of spectral bands, but greater spatial resolution. Our proposal is tested with a state-of-the-art neural network showing that it can be useful for learning to increase the spatial resolution of RGB and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

Since land surfaces are heterogeneous, the actual albedo of the surface where the solar photovoltaic panel is placed can vary widely and its temporality and sparsity present a significant challenge for renewable energy engineers. This paper develops a new image super-resolution deep learning model based on convolutional neural network to generate high resolution spatial representations of surface albedo from coarse resolution remote sensing-based data. For selected Australian locations, we generated a higher resolution surface albedo using imagery from PROBA-V/SPOT Earth Observation satellites. We proposed a Deep Downscaling Spectral Model with Attention (DDSA) with the capability of processing 10-day albedo images captured at a relatively low (≈ 1 km) resolution. The proposed DDSA was then applied to downscale observed surface albedo and generate predicted albedo at 500 m, 333 m and 250 m resolutions. The proposed model was benchmarked with alternative deep learning, super-resolution approaches: Super-Resolution Convolution Neural Network (SRCNN), Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution network (EDSR), Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network (ESPCN) and Residual Dense Network (RDN). The results showed that the proposed DDSA model outperformed all comparative models in terms of the mean square error (MSE) $\approx ~0.0041$ , signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) $\approx ~39.471$ , Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) $\approx ~0.999$ vs. an MSE $\approx $ [0.0140-0.0387], PSNR $\approx $ [29.761-33.850], SSIM $\approx $ [0.9994-0.999]). We also cross-validated the downscaled images with satellite imagery and ground-based observations, which reaffirmed the proposed DDSA model's ability to produce high resolution surface albedo maps and its potential applications for granular scale tracking and mapping solar energy where bifacial solar photovoltaic panels are placed. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Signal to noise ratio; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Surface measurement; Surface waters; Bifacial solar photovoltaic system; Depth-wise separable convolution; Down-scaling; Energy resolutions; Image super resolutions; Land surface; Predictive models; Remote-sensing; Sea surfaces; Solar photovoltaic system; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; Surface albedo; Surface albedo downscaling; Convolution","bifacial solar photovoltaic system; depth-wise separable convolution; image super resolution; Surface albedo downscaling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147314822"

However, in the PROBA-V dataset the low-resolution image corresponding to the high-resolution target is not identified. We argue that in doing so, the challenge ranks the proposed methods not only by their MISR performance, but mainly by the heuristics used to guess which image in the series is the most similar to the high-resolution target. We demonstrate this by improving the performance obtained by the two winners of the challenge only by using a different reference image, which we compute following a simple heuristic. Based on this, we propose PROBA-V-REF a variant of the PROBA-V dataset, in which the reference image in the low-resolution series is provided, and show that the ranking between the methods changes in this setting. This is relevant to many practical use cases of MISR where the goal is to super-resolve a specific image of the series, i.e. the reference is known. The proposed PROBA-V-REF should better reflect the performance of the different methods for this reference-aware MISR problem. © 2021 IEEE","Computer vision; Deep learning; Heuristic methods; Image enhancement; Satellites; Deep-learning; High resolution; Image super resolutions; Low resolution images; Multi-image super-resolution; Multi-images; Performance; PROBA-V challenge; Satellite images; Superresolution; Optical resolving power","Deep-learning; Multi-image super-resolution; PROBA-V challenge; Satellite images","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130069795"

High-quality space object images are very important for space object recognition. Because of the large number of cosmic rays in the space environment and the inadequacy of optical lenses and detectors on satellites to support high-resolution imaging, most of the images obtained are blurred and contain a lot of cosmic-ray noise. So, denoising methods and super-resolution methods are two effective ways to reconstruct high-quality space object images. However, most super-resolution methods could only reconstruct the lost details of low spatial resolution images, but could not remove noise. On the other hand, most denoising methods especially cosmic-ray denoising methods could not reconstruct high-resolution details. So in this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single space object image denoising and super-resolution reconstruction method is presented. The noise is removed and the lost details of the low spatial resolution image are well reconstructed based on one very deep CNN-based network, which combines global residual learning and local residual learning. Based on a dataset of satellite images, experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method in enhancing the spatial resolution and removing the noise of the space objects images. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Deep neural networks; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Lenses; Neural networks; Object recognition; Optical resolving power; Convolutional neural network; De-noising; High-resolution imaging; Residual learning; Space objects; Spatial resolution images; Super resolution; Super resolution reconstruction; Image denoising","CNN; Cosmic-ray; Denoising; Residual learning; Space object; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071582951"

In contrast, relatively low-resolution images have better spatial and temporal availability but cannot directly contribute to fine-and/or high-resolution building ex-traction. In this paper, based on image super-resolution and segmentation techniques, we propose a two-stage framework (SRBuildingSeg) for achieving super-resolution (SR) building extraction using relatively low-resolution remotely sensed images. SRBuildingSeg can fully utilize inherent information from the given low-resolution images to achieve high-resolution building extraction. In contrast to the existing building extraction methods, we first utilize an internal pairs generation module (IPG) to obtain SR training datasets from the given low-resolution images and an edge-aware super-resolution module (EASR) to improve the perceptional features, following the dual-encoder building segmentation module (DES). Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of achieving high-resolution (e.g., 0.5 m) building extraction results at 2×, 4× and 8× SR. Our approach outperforms eight other methods with respect to the extraction result of mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) values by a ratio of 9.38%, 8.20%, and 7.89% with SR ratio factors of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. The results indicate that the edges and borders reconstructed in super-resolved images serve a pivotal role in subsequent building extraction and reveal the potential of the proposed approach to achieve super-resolution building extraction. © 2021 by the authors.

Most of the existing techniques for formation of the super-resolution image exhibit the loss of quality and deviation from the original multi-spectral LR image. Thus, this paper aims at proposing an efficient super-resolution method using the hybrid model. The hybrid model is developed using the support vector regression model and multi-support vector neural network (MSVNN), and the weights of the MSVNN is tuned optimally using the proposed algorithm.

A universal method to solve this problem is difficult to construct at present. A new SR reconstruction method of mixed sparse representation model (MSR-SRR) combined with the sparse representation and non-convex high-order total variational regularizer has been proposed to solve this problem. In this method, the sparse representation of remote sensing images in multiple transform domains is regarded as a prior probability model, and the SR reconstruction is completed by regularization. The obtained image not only retains the edge information of the image result by SR reconstruction, but also smoothens the“ladder effect”of the image. The efficiency of operation and the quality of SR reconstruction results are improved by an effective re-weighted l1 alternating direction method. Results show that the sharpness of the image increases by 31.74% on the average, the half-peak width of PSFs is the largest, and the Gaussian variance value reaches 1.8415. The GF-4 satellite images have been selected to carry out validation experiment to verify the feasibility and validity of MSR-SRR. The reconstruction results show that the images using the MSR-SRR method have better definition, richer details, and higher quality than those with non-uniform interpolation, the POCS method, and IBP method. The support vector machine method is used to classify and evaluate the accuracy of the images before and after SR reconstruction. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the reconstructed super-resolution image are improved more significantly than the original image classification results. The OA value increases by 5.96%, and the Kappa coefficient increases by 9.7%. The findings confirmed that the MSR-SRR method is effective and feasible and has extensive practical value. © 2022 Chinese Society of Forestry.

Thus, satellite images covering large-scale area often show conspicuous color differences, resulting in poor color continuity of the mosaicked satellite image. This study proposes a novel combined model color correction (CMCC) method for high-resolution optical satellite images, which constructively combines a defogging model with a radiation correction model. First, this study analyzed the feasibility of using easily available low-resolution satellite images as external references to correct the color of high-resolution images and describes the selection criteria for external references. Second, considering the negative effects of atmosphere on the color and clarity of remote sensing images, we proposed an optical satellite image enhancement method, which is based on the content characteristics of remote sensing images and the dark channel prior defogging method. Finally, we designed a two-stage color correction process: 1) correcting the color of downsampled images via low-frequency modeling and replacement and 2) mapping the color of downsampled images to original images through local modeling and super-resolution color correction. Furthermore, this study proposes an indicator of quality considered mean absolute error (QCMAE) for quantitative evaluation of the color correction result. We selected 328 Gaofen-1 (GF-1) high-resolution images for the experiments.

As the world's first high resolution optical remote sensing satellite for geosynchronous orbit, GF-4 satellite has high time resolution, medium spatial resolution and multispectral land detection capability, which provides a new data resource for residential monitoring. Closely combining with the detection characteristics of the GF-4 satellite, this paper proposes a remote sensing identification method based on GF-4 satellite, and the recognition ability of the GF-4 satellite to the residential area is analyzed. The remote sensing recognition of residential areas is mainly divided into four steps. First, Super-resolution image enhancement technology is used to improve the spatial resolution of GF-4 satellite PMS image. Then, the resolution enhanced image is processed by geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction. Third, the existing land use and land cover data are selected as prior knowledge to select typical sample areas. Based on the spectral characteristics and spectral relationship of different objects in GF-4 satellite image, decision tree classification method is used to eliminate the obvious non-residential areas such as cloud, vegetation, water and shadow, so as to reduce the subsequent data processing and reduce the false recognition rate in residential area. Finally, SVM classifier is selected for the classification of residential areas. Taking GF-4 satellite data in Jiashan county as experiment, the result shows that the user accuracy of resident recognition by this method is 89.96%, which is significantly higher than that without resolution enhancement in the same method. Besides, the spatial scope of the county and township residents can be effectively identified in GF-4 enhanced image. © 2018 IEEE.","Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Disaster prevention; Housing; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Land use; Observatories; Optical resolving power; Orbits; Satellites; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree classification; Detection characteristics; GF-4; Radiometric calibrations; Remote sensing information; Remote sensing technology; Residential areas; Spectral characteristics; Remote sensing","GF-4; Remote sensing information extraction; Residential area recognition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061817473"

Because of this, how to reconstruct super resolution (SR) video satellite data is particularly important. Based on the proposed SR Residual Network (SRResNet), we proposed a Pyramid Residual Network (PySRResNet) model, using a pyramid structure to obtain features of different scales, including 1, 1/2 and 1/4, and concatenate them together to provide more detailed information for SR reconstruction. In addition, we reduced the number of blocks and removed the batch normalization layer to achieve good performance.

However, its high temporal resolution comes at the expense of spatial resolution. In recent years, deep learning (DL) based super-resolution (SR) methods have played an essential role to improve the spatial resolution of video satellite images. Instead of fully considering the degradation process, most existing DL-based methods attempt to learn the relationship between low-resolution (LR) satellite video frames and their corresponding high-resolution (HR) ones. In this paper, we propose model-based deep neural networks for video satellite imagery SR (VSSR). The VSSR is composed of three main modules: Degradation estimation module, intermediate image generation module, and multi-frame feature fusion module. First, the blur kernel and noise level of LR video frames are flexibly estimated by the degradation estimation module. Second, an intermediate image generation module is proposed to iteratively solve two optimal subproblems and the outputs of this module are intermediate SR frames. Third, a three-dimensional (3D) feature fusion subnetwork is leveraged to fuse the features from multiple video frames. Different from previous video satellite SR methods, the proposed VSSR is a multi-frame-based method that can merge the advantages of both learning-based and model-based methods. Experiments on real-world Jilin-1 and OVS-1 video satellite images have been conducted and the SR results demonstrate that the proposed VSSR achieves superior visual effects and quantitative performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate the capacity of the reservoirs in an inexpensive and less laborious way. In this paper, a super resolution mapping based on hybrid approach was developed and applied to Landsat OLI image of the Puzhal reservoir, Chennai city, southern India and the reservoir water-spread area was estimated. The estimated water-spread was used to find the capacity of the reservoir using Trapezoidal formula. The hybrid approach uses New Fuzzy Cluster Centroid (NFCC) algorithm for sub-pixel mapping and multi-objective genetic algorithm for super resolution mapping. The super resolution mapping is an advanced classification technique which accurately maps the location of classes within a pixel. The capacity determined from the image processing technique is compared with that estimated from the field survey data with a meagre 1.35% error. Hence, it is observed that the super resolution mapping is a prominent methodology to estimate the water-spread area of the reservoir which in turn increases the accuracy of the estimation capacity of the reservoir. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","","Satellite image; Sub-pixel mapping; Super resolution mapping; Water-spread area","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108094564"

Firstly, MSR-NCHOTV is employed to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution time-series images obtained from the Gaofen-4 (GF-4) geostationary orbit satellite. Secondly, a support vector machine (SVM) method was used to classify the results of SRR using the GF-4 geostationary orbit satellite images. Two sets of GF-4 satellite image data were used for experiments, and the MSR-NCHOTV SRR result obtained using these data was compared with the SRR results obtained using the bilinear interpolation (BI), projection onto convex sets (POCS), and iterative back projection (IBP) methods. The sharpness of the SRR results was evaluated using the gray-level variation between adjacent pixels, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the SRR results was evaluated by using the measurement of high spatial resolution remote sensing images. For example, compared with the values obtained using the BI method, the average sharpness and SNR of the five bands obtained using the MSR-NCHOTV method were higher by 39.54% and 51.52%, respectively, and the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the classification results obtained using the MSR-NCHOTV method were higher by 32.20% and 46.14%, respectively. These results showed that the MSR-NCHOTV method can effectively improve image clarity, enrich image texture details, enhance image quality, and improve image classification accuracy. Thus, the effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed SRR method to improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing images was verified. © 2020 by the authors.","Geostationary satellites; Image classification; Image reconstruction; Image texture; Iterative methods; Mapping; Optical resolving power; Orbits; Remote sensing; Set theory; Signal to noise ratio; Support vector machines; Textures; Geostationary orbit satellite; Iterative back projections; Multispectral satellite image; Projection onto convex sets; Resolution enhancement; Super resolution; Super resolution reconstruction; Total variation; Image enhancement","Mapping; Remote sensing; Resolution enhancement; Super-resolution; Total variation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080870793"

This issue is particularly related to the choice of the objective loss function. In particular, recent works proposed the use of a VGG loss which consists in minimizing the error between the generated high resolution images and ground-truth in the feature space of a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG19), pre-trained on the very “large” ImageNet dataset. When considering the problem of super-resolving images with a distribution “far” from the ImageNet images distribution (e.g., satellite images), their proposed fixed VGG loss is no longer relevant. In this paper, we present a general framework named Generative Collaborative Networks (GCN), where the idea consists in optimizing the generator (the mapping of interest) in the feature space of a features extractor network. The two networks (generator and extractor) are collaborative in the sense that the latter “helps” the former, by constructing discriminative and relevant features (not necessarily fixed and possibly learned mutually with the generator). We evaluate the GCN framework in the context of SISR, and we show that it results in a method that is adapted to super-resolution domains that are “far” from the ImageNet domain. © 2019","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Large dataset; Neural networks; Textures; Collaborative network; Convolutional neural network; GANs; High resolution image; Images distribution; Relevant features; Satellite images; Super resolution; article; deep learning; satellite imagery; Optical resolving power","Deep learning; GANs; Perceptual loss; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066897861"

First, a pansharpening process is adopted to make full use of two MODIS bands with 250 m spatial resolution. Second, a super-resolution process enhances the spatial information that existed in coarse-resolution images to alleviate the enormous spatial resolution gap between MODIS and Landsat images. Third, combining the aforementioned two auxiliary processes, a progressive spatiotemporal fusion framework is proposed to generate deliberate and robust fusion results. Experiments are conducted using two MODIS-Landsat datasets of distinctive landforms to evaluate the performance of DPSTFN.

Many remote sensing applications require the spatial resolutions of all data to be at the highest resolution possible, i.e., 10 m for S2. To address this demand, researchers have proposed various methods that exploit the spectral and spatial correlations within multispectral data to sharpen the S2 bands to 10 m.

However, most hyperspectral image super-resolution reconstruction methods usually use all spectral bands simultaneously, leading to a mismatch of spectral properties between reconstructed HSI bands. Therefore, we proposed a new method of spatial-spectral dual path residual network (SGDPRN) based on spectral response function (SRF) to address the above problem. The SGDPRN is composed of the SRF guided grouping part, the spatial-spectral feature extraction part, and the final reconstruction part. Firstly, the reconstructed features for different spectral ranges are identified separately using SRF as a guide. Then, based on the grouping results, a spatial-spectral dual-path residual block is used to explore the spatial and spectral features by the designed parallel structure simultaneously. The spatial path is designed to extract sharp edges and realistic textures, and the spectral path is designed to model inter-spectral correlations to refine spectral features. At last, the third block of SGDPRN concatenates features of all groups and finishes the reconstruction of HSISR. QUST-1 satellite images have been applied in experiments, and the results showed that SGDPRN produced a higher peak signal to noise ratio, structural similarity metric, correlation coefficient, and lower spectral angle mapper, root mean square error than the other methods. This demonstrates that our method can effectively maintain the correlation of spectral bands while improving the spatial resolution. © 2022 The Author(s).

So far, mainstream algorithms of SISR are mainly divided into three categories: interpolation-based methods, reconstruction-based methods and learning-based methods. Because of the high performance of in-depth learning, Deep Learning for Single Image Super-Resolution has attracted much attention in the past five years.

However, compared to the integer magnification model for super-resolution, research on arbitrary magnification has been overlooked. In addition, the importance of single image super-resolution at arbitrary magnification is emphasized for tasks such as object recognition and satellite image magnification. In this study, we propose a model that performs arbitrary magnification while retaining the advantages of integer magnification. The proposed model extends the integer magnification image to the target magnification in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) spectral domain. The broadening of the DCT spectral domain results in a lack of high-frequency components. To solve this problem, we propose a high-frequency attention network for arbitrary magnification so that high-frequency information can be restored. In addition, only high-frequency components are extracted from the image with a mask generated by a hyperparameter in the DCT domain. Therefore, the high-frequency components that have a substantial impact on image quality are recovered by this procedure. The proposed framework achieves the performance of an integer magnification and correctly retrieves the high-frequency components lost between the arbitrary magnifications.

In this paper, we focus on a single-image super-resolution (SISR) problem in remote sensing, where the objective is to generate a reconstructed satellite image of high quality (i.e., a high spatial resolution) from a satellite image of relatively low quality. This problem is motivated by the lack of high quality satellite images in many remote sensing applications (e.g., due to the cost of high resolution sensors, communication bandwidth constraints, and historic hardware limitations). Two important challenges exist in solving our problem: i) it is not a trivial task to reconstruct a satellite image of high quality that meets the human perceptual requirement from a single low quality image; ii) it is challenging to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of the results of an SISR scheme in the absence of ground truth data. To address the above challenges, we develop PQA-CNN, a perceptual quality-assured conventional neural network framework, to reconstruct a high quality satellite image from a low quality one by designing novel uncertainty-driven neural network architectures and integrating an uncertainty quantification model with the framework. We evaluate PQA-CNN on a real-world remote sensing application on land usage classifications. The results show that PQA-CNN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art super-resolution baselines in terms of accurately reconstructing high-resolution satellite images under various evaluation scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.","Image reconstruction; Network architecture; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Quality of service; Satellites; Communication bandwidth; High resolution satellite images; High resolution sensors; High spatial resolution; Network frameworks; Perceptual quality; Remote sensing applications; Uncertainty quantifications; Remote sensing","Convolutional Neural Network; Perceptual Quality; Super-Resolution; Uncertainty-Aware","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094797763"

These methods often fail to produce convincing results in real-world data since the actual degradation is much more complex than manually designed. This paper presents a deep learning framework to model the degradation process of microsatellite image. To this end, we first introduce remote sensing dataset consisting of WorldView (0.4m) and PlanetScope (3m) satellite images. They are aligned to the same coordinate, but are collected at different days/times. Using such data, we design Degradation Network (DegNet), generating realistic micro-satellite images from its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. A degradation loss using an optimal transport distance is proposed which makes the empirical distribution, i.e., histogram of outputs to be similar to that of real microsatellite images. It faithfully reflects the degradation characteristic of micro-satellite while preserving the content of an input. Finally, a SR network is trained with the generated LR-HR pairs. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly improves the SR performance on real-world data. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep learning; DNA sequences; Micro satellites; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Degradation characteristics; Degradation loss; Degradation process; Empirical distributions; Learning frameworks; Low resolution images; Optimal transport; Satellite images; Image processing","degradation learning; generative models; Micro-satellite image; optimal transport distance; satellite image super-resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098624735"

However, synergistic use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 for generating frequent and consistent NDVI data remains challenging as they have different spatial resolutions and spectral response functions. In this letter, we developed an attentional super resolution convolutional neural network (ASRCNN) for producing 10-m NDVI time series through fusion of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images. We evaluated its performance in two heterogeneous areas. Quantitative assessments indicated that the developed network outperforms five commonly used fusion methods [i.e., enhanced deep convolutional spatiotemporal fusion network (EDCSTFN), super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN), spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM), and flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF)].

This paper demonstrates a hybrid approach of genetic algorithm and Hopfield neural network which can not only speed up the process but also identify the exact global optimal solution using super-resolution mapping. The experiments are carried out for Landsat ETM + image of different dimensions (10 × 10, 25 × 25, 64 × 64, 128 × 128 and 256 × 256) and with map sizes of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

The overall accuracy is 89.44%, 90.25%, 91.09%, 92.56%, and 93.62%, respectively, for map sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, thus showing an increase of nearly 2% accuracy for hybrid genetic algorithm. The time taken was also reduced by half of that for the genetic algorithm.

Especially in Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) detectors used in satellite imaging cameras, which suffer from dropouts in pixel and line direction in raw data. With the recent development in generative adversarial networks and its vast application in inpainting the missing data, the possibility to predict and fill in the missing data accurately with contextual attention has become prevalent. This paper presents SN-GANs (SN-generative adversarial networks) which is two-staged architecture, and it is based on the concept of feed forward neural networks with contextual attention layers. While reconstructing the corrupted part of the images, the model takes surrounding pixels into consideration. Moreover, this architecture is adept enough to fill in the multiple lines and pixel dropouts efficiently even in super-resolution satellite images. The available traditional methods fail to address the loss of data that incurs, while inpainting a 16-bit raw image because they are effective enough for 8-bit RGB images. SN-GANs have effectively resolved this issue with a lossless image inpainting method for 16-bit satellite images as it retains the features of non-corrupted data. The performance of the model is evaluated using similarity metrics like structural similarity index measure (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean-squared error (MSE). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","","Column-dropouts; Deep learning; GANS; Image reconstruction; Satellite imagery; SN-GANs; SWIR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119013878"

Spatial resolution is an element of crucial impact on the usage of remote sensing imagery. As such, increasing the spatial resolution of an image is an important pre-processing step that can improve the performance of various image processing tasks, such as segmentation. Once a satellite is launched, the more practical solution to improve the resolution of its captured images is to use Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques. In the recent years, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been recognized as a highly effective tool to reconstruct a High Resolution (HR) image from its Low Resolution (LR) counterpart, which is an open problem due to the inherent difficulty of estimating the missing high frequency components. The aim of this research paper is to design and implement a satellite image SISR algorithm by estimating high frequency details through training Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNNs) with respect to wavelet analysis. The goal is to improve the spatial resolution of multispectral remote sensing images captured by DubaiSat-2 satellite.

It seems natural to wonder whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling. We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote sensing datasets.

However, we discover that most existing methods are biased to synthesize fake details or enhanced textures and fail to learn representations of object shape. They are often misguided to recover the shape of small objects and focus on generating less meaningful high-frequency components. This is problematic when super-resolving satellite imagery since it contains many relatively small and clustered objects in a broad area. In this letter, we propose a new perceptual-driven SR method that has a stronger preference toward shape information. We integrate the scale-space filtering with the discriminator to attenuate high-frequency components in its decision space. It effectively encourages our discriminator to concentrate on structural shape information in differentiating real and fake images. We also devise a cross-scale aggregation network for the generator architecture.

Hence, the proposed work aims to increment the compression ratio (CR) of digital images in general. While emphasis is made on aerial images, the same principle may find applications to other types of raster based images. The process described here involves the application of pre-defined low-pass filters (i.e. kernels) prior to applying standard image compression encoders. Low-pass filters have the effect of increasing the dependence between neighbouring pixels which can be used to improve the CR. However, for this pre-filtering process to be considered as a compression instrument, it should allow for the original image to be accurately restored from its filtered counterpart. The development of the restoration process presented in this study is based on the theory of least squares and assumes the knowledge of the filtered image and the low-pass filter applied to the original image. The process is a variant of a super-resolution algorithm previously described, but its application and adaptation to the filtering and restoration of images, in this case (but not exclusively) aerial imagery, using a number of scales and filter dimensions is the expansion detailed here. An example of the proposed process is detailed in the ensuing sections. The example is also indicative of the degree of accuracy that can be attained upon applying this process to gray-scale images of different entropies and coded in a lossy or lossless mode. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Digital image storage; Image reconstruction; Low pass filters; Restoration; Aerial Photographs; Degree of accuracy; Gray-scale images; ITS applications; Restoration of images; Restoration process; Satellite images; Super resolution algorithms; Image compression","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088505602"

It provides great opportunity for researchers not to select between solving the task with high-resolution data on small territory or on global scale, but with low-resolution satellite images. Due to high spectral and spatial resolution of the data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are very popular sources of information. Nevertheless, in practice if we would like to receive final product in 10 m resolution we should use bands with 10 m resolution. Sentinel-2 has four such bands, but also has other bands, especially red-edge 20 m resolution bands that are useful for vegetation analysis and often are omitted due to lower resolution. Thus, in this study we propose methodology for enhancing resolution (super-resolution) of the existing low-resolution images to higher resolution images. The main idea is to use advanced methods of deep learning-Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and train it to increase the resolution for the satellite images. Experimental results for the Sentinel-2 data showed that this approach is efficient and could be used for creating high resolution products. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning; Image enhancement; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellites; Deep learning; Global scale; High resolution data; High spatial resolution; High spectral resolution; Lower resolution; Satellite data; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; Superresolution; Generative adversarial networks","deep learning; GAN; Generative Adversarial Networks; Sentinel-2; super-resolution","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140369300"

Specifically, we enhance satellite imagery beyond its native resolution, and test if we can identify various types of vehicles, planes, and boats with greater accuracy than native resolution. Using the Very Deep Super-Resolution (VDSR) framework and a custom Random Forest Super-Resolution (RFSR) framework we generate enhancement levels of 2x, 4x, and 8x over five distinct resolutions ranging from 30 cm to 4.8 meters. Using both native and super-resolved data, we then train several custom detection models using the SIMRDWN object detection framework. SIMRDWN combines a number of popular object detection algorithms (e.g. SSD, YOLO) into a unified framework that is designed to rapidly detect objects in large satellite images. This approach allows us to quantify the effects of super-resolution techniques on object detection performance across multiple classes and resolutions. We also quantify the performance of object detection as a function of native resolution and object pixel size. For our test set we note that performance degrades from mean average precision (mAP) = 0.53 at 30 cm resolution, down to mAP = 0.11 at 4.8 m resolution. Super-resolving native 30 cm imagery to 15 cm yields the greatest benefit; a 13-36% improvement in mAP. Super-resolution is less beneficial at coarser resolutions, though still provides a small improvement in performance. © 2019 IEEE.","Computer vision; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Object recognition; Optical resolving power; Satellite imagery; Signal detection; Coarser resolution; Detection framework; Detection models; Detection performance; Object detection algorithms; Satellite images; Super resolution; Unified framework; Object detection","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078789972"

However, they still exhibit limitations in producing high-quality pansharpening outputs. To that end, we propose a new self-supervised learning framework, where we treat pansharpening as a colorization problem, which brings an entirely novel perspective and solution to the problem compared with the existing methods that base their solution solely on producing a super-resolution version of the multispectral image. Whereas the CNN-based methods provide a reduced-resolution panchromatic image as the input to their model along with the reduced-resolution multispectral images and, hence, learn to increase their resolution together, we instead provide the grayscale transformed multispectral image as the input and train our model to learn the colorization of the grayscale input. We further address the fixed downscale ratio assumption during training, which does not generalize well to the full-resolution scenario. We introduce a noise injection into the training by randomly varying the downsampling ratios. Those two critical changes, along with the addition of adversarial training in the proposed PanColorization generative adversarial network (PanColorGAN) framework, help overcome the spatial-detail loss and blur problems that are observed in CNN-based pansharpening. The proposed approach outperforms the previous CNN-based and traditional methods, as demonstrated in our experiments. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Electrical engineering; Geology; Adversarial networks; Full resolutions; Multispectral images; Noise injection; Panchromatic images; Reduced resolution; Satellite images; Super resolution; data set; image analysis; image resolution; multispectral image; panchromatic image; satellite imagery; Convolutional neural networks","AI; colorization; convolutional neural networks (CNNs); deep learning; generative adversarial networks (GANs); image fusion; PanColorization generative adversarial network (PanColorGAN); pansharpening; self-supervised learning; super-resolution (SR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103340930"

A compound annual growth rate of 17% is estimated during the period between 2020 and 2025. Low-cost satellites can send a vast amount of images to be post-processed at the ground to improve the quality and extract detailed information. In this domain lies the resolution enhancement task, where a low-resolution image is converted to a higher resolution automatically. Deep learning approaches to Super Resolution (SR) reached the state-of-the-art in multiple benchmarks; however, most of them were studied in a single-frame fashion. With satellite imagery, multi-frame images can be obtained at different conditions giving the possibility to add more information per image and improve the final analysis. In this context, we developed and applied to the PROBA-V dataset of multi-frame satellite images a model that recently topped the European Space Agency’s Multi-frame Super Resolution (MFSR) competition. The model is based on proven methods that worked on 2D images tweaked to work on 3D: the Wide Activation Super Resolution (WDSR) family. We show that with a simple 3D CNN residual architecture with WDSR blocks and a frame permutation technique as the data augmentation, better scores can be achieved than with more complex models. Moreover, the model requires few hardware resources, both for training and evaluation, so it can be applied directly on a personal laptop. © 2020 by the author.

Deep learning provides a better solution to improve its resolution compared to many sophisticated algorithms; hence, a deep attention-based SRGAN network is proposed. The GAN network consists of an attention-based SR generator to hallucinate the missing fine texture detail, a discriminator to guess how realistic is the generated image. The SR generator consists of a feature reconstruction network and attention mechanism. Feature reconstruction network consists of residually connected RDB blocks to reconstruct HR feature. The attention mechanism acts as a feature selector to enhance high-frequency details and suppress undesirable components in uniform region. The reconstructed HR feature and enhanced high-frequency information are fused together for better visual perception.

We designed a multiple dilation fully convolutional network (MD-FCN) for AFB detection from Sentinel-2 images at 10 m resolution. Furthermore, we developed a novel super-resolution semantic contour detection network (named SRC-Net) using a transposed convolutional layer in the FCN architecture to enhance the spatial resolution of the AFB output from 10 m to 5 m resolution. The SRC-Net also improves the AFB maps at 5 m resolution by exploiting the spatial-contextual information in the label space.

Thus, they cannot fully meet the requirements of object identification and analysis. To utilize the multi-scale characteristics of objects fully in remote sensing images, this paper presents a multi-scale residual neural network (MRNN). MRNN adopts the multi-scale nature of satellite images to reconstruct high-frequency information accurately for super-resolution (SR) satellite imagery. Different sizes of patches from LR satellite images are initially extracted to fit different scale of objects. Large-, middle-, and small-scale deep residual neural networks are designed to simulate differently sized receptive fields for acquiring relative global, contextual, and local information for prior representation. Then, a fusion network is used to refine different scales of information. MRNN fuses the complementary high-frequency information from differently scaled networks to reconstruct the desired high-resolution satellite object image, which is in line with human visual experience (""look in multi-scale to see better""). Experimental results on the SpaceNet satellite image and NWPU-RESISC45 databases show that the proposed approach outperformed several state-of-the-art SR algorithms in terms of objective and subjective image qualities. © 2019 by the authors.","Image reconstruction; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; High resolution satellites; High-frequency informations; Multi-scale image; Object identification; Satellite remote sensing; Subjective image quality; Super resolution; Deep neural networks","Convolutional neural network; Multi-scale image; Residual network; Satellite imagery; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068504707"

In order to access to the data with both high spatial and high temporal resolution, spatio-temporal fusion (STF) of remotely sensed images came into being. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully adopted in this field and some efficient STF methods based on CNNs were developed. However, these methods require a significant number of training image pairs, where each pair generally consists of a high spatial resolution image and a low spatial resolution image. Such a requirement limits the applicability of STF methods to real scenarios, as in many cases there is no wide availability of image pairs for training. To overcome this important limitation, in this paper we introduce a single image pair-based method (based on CNNs) for STF of remotely sensed images. Our method, called SS-CNN, uses the spatial information provided by the average image (obtained across the available spectral bands) of the high spatial resolution image to perform CNN-based super-resolution mapping (SRM) between the low and high spatial resolution images. Three experiments, including two simulated and one real ones, were used to evaluate the STF accuracy of SS-CNN. The obtained experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed method. © 2022 Science Press.

We also construct a feature extraction and tuning block (FETB) for fine feature expression. In particular, a novel two-dimension dense unit (DU) and a mapping attention unit (MAU) are constructed for building multi-level mappings in different stages. With our strategies, an HR image is reconstructed directly from the input image using multi-level mappings. Extensive experiments on Kaggle Open Source Dataset and Jilin-1 video satellite images exhibit superior reconstruction performance when compared with the state-of-the-art SR approaches. © 2019 IEEE.","Deep learning; Mapping; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Adversarial learning; Attention unit; Multi-level mapping; Remote sensing imagery; Super resolution; Image reconstruction","Adversarial learning; Attention unit; Multi-level mapping; Remote sensing imagery; Super resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071032705"

A sequence of images collected by satellites often has plenty of views and a long time span, so integrating multiple low-resolution views into a high-resolution image with details emerges as a challenging problem. However, most MISR methods based on deep learning cannot make full use of multiple images. Their fusion modules are incapable of adapting to an image sequence with weak temporal correlations well. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end framework called TR-MISR. It consists of three parts: An encoder based on residual blocks, a transformer-based fusion module, and a decoder based on subpixel convolution. Specifically, by rearranging multiple feature maps into vectors, the fusion module can assign dynamic attention to the same area of different satellite images simultaneously. In addition, TR-MISR adopts an additional learnable embedding vector that fuses these vectors to restore the details to the greatest extent. TR-MISR has successfully applied the transformer to MISR tasks for the first time, notably reducing the difficulty of training the transformer by ignoring the spatial relations of image patches. Extensive experiments performed on the PROBA-V Kelvin dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model that provides an effective method for transformers in other low-level vision tasks.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Image fusion; Job analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Deep learning; End-to-end network; Features extraction; Features fusions; Image super resolutions; Multi-image super-resolution; Multi-images; Remote-sensing; Superresolution; Task analysis; Transformer; digital mapping; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Image resolution","Deep learning; end-to-end networks; feature extraction and fusion; multiimage super-resolution (MISR); remote sensing; transformers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123378888"

In the training stage, we build two five-layer CNNs to deal with the problems of complicated correspondence and large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS and Landsat images. Specifically, we first learn a nonlinear mapping CNN between MODIS and low-spatial-resolution (LSR) Landsat images and then learn a super-resolution CNN between LSR Landsat and original Landsat images. In the prediction stage, instead of directly taking the outputs of CNNs as the fusion result, we design a fusion model consisting of high-pass modulation and a weighting strategy to make full use of the information in prior images. Specifically, we first map the input MODIS images to transitional images via the learned nonlinear mapping CNN and further improve the transitional images to LSR Landsat images via the fusion model; then, via the learned SR CNN, the LSR Landsat images are supersolved to transitional images, which are further improved to Landsat images via the fusion model. Compared with the previous learning-based fusion methods, mainly referring to the sparse-representation-based methods, our CNNs-based spatiotemporal method has the following advantages: 1) automatically extracting effective image features; 2) learning an end-to-end mapping between MODIS and LSR Landsat images; and 3) generating more favorable fusion results. To examine the performance of the proposed fusion method, we conduct experiments on two representative Landsat-MODIS datasets by comparing with the sparse-representation-based spatiotemporal fusion model. The quantitative evaluations on all possible prediction dates and the comparison of fusion results on one key date in both visual effect and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can generate more accurate fusion results. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Earth (planet); Image enhancement; Image resolution; Mapping; Neural networks; Personnel training; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Convolutional neural network; MODIS; Nonlinear mappings; Spatial resolution; Spatiotemporal phenomena; Temporal resolution; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; image analysis; Landsat; mapping; nonlinearity; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; Image fusion","Convolutional neural network (CNN); nonlinear mapping (NLM); spatial resolution; temporal resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042131669"

The major challenge is the relatively limited number of thermal satellite images available for a given location, which makes the possible magnification factor extremely low for landmine detection. To facilitate the study, we generate equivalent satellite images for various landmine distributions.

The proposed SR algorithm mainly consists of dictionary training and image reconstruction. Wavelet preprocessing is used to establish four subbands, i.e., low frequency, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal high frequency, for an input image. As compared to the traditional approaches involving the direct training of image patches, the proposed approach focuses on the training of features derived from these four subbands. The proposed algorithm is verified using different spectral remote sensing images, e.g., moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with different bands, and the latest Chinese Jilin-1 satellite images with high spatial resolution. According to the visual experimental results obtained from the MODIS remote sensing data, the SR images using the proposed SR algorithm are superior to those using a conventional bicubic interpolation algorithm or traditional SR algorithms without preprocessing. Fusion algorithms, e.g., standard intensity-hue-saturation, principal component analysis, wavelet transform, and the proposed SR algorithms are utilized to merge the multispectral and panchromatic images acquired by the Jilin-1 satellite. The effectiveness of the proposed SR algorithm is assessed by parameters such as peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, correlation coefficient, root-mean-square error, relative dimensionless global error in synthesis, relative average spectral error, spectral angle mapper, and the quality index Q4, and its performance is better than that of the standard image fusion algorithms. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Errors; Image fusion; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Mean square error; Optical resolving power; Principal component analysis; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrometers; Wavelet transforms; Intensity hue saturations; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Peak signal to noise ratio; Sparse representation; Structural similarity indices; Super resolution; Super resolution algorithms; Wavelet transformations; Remote sensing","Chinese Jilin-1 satellite imagery; image fusion; moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer; sparse representation; super-resolution; wavelet transformation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021652863"

The characteristics of satellite staring imaging are analyzed based on the active view, and the degraded model is established based on the staring imaging. In order to solve the inverse process of the degraded model, the residual constraint set and the corresponding point projection operators in the intermediate degradation process are set up based on the convex set theory. The gray value of the high resolution image is corrected by the point projection operators, and finally the reconstructed high resolution image is constrained to the intersection of convex sets. The experimental results show that the new algorithm improves the image resolution by nearly 30%, and overcomes the disadvantages of the similar algorithms such as projection error and overlapping artifact.

Potential benefits of SRR are evident, when images of high resolution are required, but are unavailable due to technological limitations or economic reasons. Obviously, this is inherent to satellite imagery—medium or high resolution data (e.g., Sentinel-2 images) could be processed to obtain images of higher resolution, whose accessibility is much lower due to their price, lower coverage and longer revisit times. Although SRR is a well-studied problem of computer vision, to the best of our knowledge, no satisfactory solution exists that would allow for enhancing satellite images in practice. One of the pivotal obstacles we identified, is concerned with the evaluation methodology commonly adopted while developing the SRR techniques—an image of high resolution (ℎ) is downscaled using different offsets and degradation operators to obtain a set of low-resolution images { ()}. The goal is to reconstruct the original image from {()} and the similarity between the outcome ′(ℎ) and(ℎ), commonly measured with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), is used to evaluate the quality of SRR. While such procedure is sufficient to verify some aspects of the algorithms, the assumptions imposed on the degradation model may actually not hold. Unfortunately, there are no benchmarks encompassing the real images acquired at different resolutions, which could correspond to the real-world conditions. In this paper, we intend to fill the aforementioned gap with our validation framework, encompassing (i) synthetic images, (ii) satellite images degraded using known operators, and (iii) images covering roughly the same area acquired using sensors of different resolution ({()} is composed of either multiple images of the same area, or different spectra of a hyper-spectral image). Furthermore, we extend the measures used to compare ′(ℎ) with (ℎ)—not only do we rely on various similarity measures (such as PSNR), but also we explore how to exploit landmark detectors to assess whether and how SRR reduces the ground sampling distance (GSD). Importantly, we utilize the elaborated evaluation metrics while defining the objective function, whose optimization allows for reconstructing the super-resolution image. In the work reported here, we optimize that function using evolutionary computation and we present the initial, yet very encouraging results, obtained for real-world data, including Sentinel-2 images. This allows us to outline the future research pathways which will lead to developing effective SRR methods suitable for practical applications. © 2018 International Astronautical Federation IAF.

Traditionally, these two steps are treated independently, which is adequate for natural images. However, for satellite images, which commonly suffer from focal plane distortion and unrecorded spacecraft jitter, it is always difficult to achieve satisfactory image registration or PSF estimation. Consequently, the errors brought by these two processes significantly affect each other and degrade the quality of the subsequent high-resolution (HR) reconstruction. In this paper, a novel joint image registration and PSF estimation method is proposed to produce HR images from a set of degraded low-resolution (LR) satellite images. The joint SR approach is formulated as a convex optimization problem which minimizes the combination of these two parts. It is aimed at achieving PSF estimation and registration simultaneously and progressively, to handle the error in different levels. In addition, the proposed method adopts a more generic observation model, including both geometric motion and radiation difference, which makes the model more universal. Moreover, an iterative scheme based on alternating minimization (AM) is developed to solve the presented cost function via simultaneous low-rank and total variation (LRTV) regularizations.

Potential benefits of applying SRR to satellite imagery are evident, as it may enhance the capacities of images characterized with lower resolution, shorter revisit times, and of higher availability. Unfortunately, the existing SRR approaches are not sufficiently mature to allow for broad real-life applications. One of the main obstacles we identify is that the evaluation procedure commonly adopted while developing new SRR techniques does not reflect the operational conditions. In this paper, we present our validation framework based on real satellite images acquired at different native resolutions, and we elaborate on measuring the reconstruction quality. We argue that this is critical to developing new and tuning the existing SRR methods to adapt them to real-world conditions. We investigate a number of well-established measures, and we also introduce our new metrics that allow for robust evaluation of the SRR outcome given a reference image of higher resolution. In addition to the quantitative tests, we also report qualitative results in which the reconstruction quality measures are used as an objective function in our evolutionary algorithms applied to adapt the SRR methods to a specific imaging model.

The features of staring imaging and high temporal resolution enable the super-resolution of multiple images of the same scene. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution (SR) technique to reconstruct a higher-resolution image from multiple low-resolution (LR) satellite images. The method first performs image registration in both the spatial and range domains. Then the point spread function (PSF) of LR images is parameterized by a Gaussian function and estimated by a blind deconvolution algorithm based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP). Finally, the high-resolution (HR) image is reconstructed by a MAP-based SR algorithm. The MAP cost function includes a data fidelity term and a regularized term. The data fidelity term is in the L2 norm, and the regularized term employs the Huber-Markov prior which can reduce the noise and artifacts while preserving the image edges.

This fact limits the use of the satellite images only to the scientific community, restricting their use in other applications. The need to alleviate this limitation motivated this work, developed under the framework of a coordinate project, which aimed at offering a list of Level2 products to the Ingenio/SEOSAT user community. In this paper, we present the different methodologies developed to produce the proposed Level2 products, from surface reflectance at nominal sensor spatial resolution to images with higher spatial resolution or the possibility to create spatial and temporal mosaics. On the one side, for the surface reflectance product, we proposed an atmospheric correction algorithm based on using the spatial information, linked to a cloud screening algorithm and including morphological and topographic shadow corrections. On the other side, to enhance the image spatial resolution, we applied different fusion techniques using the multispectral and the panchromatic band, as well as some of the so-called “super-resolution” techniques.

However, previous CNN-based algorithms with simple direct or skip connections are of poor performance when applied to remote sensing satellite images SR. In this study, a simple but effective CNN framework, namely deep distillation recursive network (DDRN), is presented for video satellite image SR. DDRN includes a group of ultra-dense residual blocks (UDB), a multi-scale purification unit (MSPU), and a reconstruction module. In particular, through the addition of rich interactive links in and between multiple-path units in each UDB, features extracted from multiple parallel convolution layers can be shared effectively. Compared with classical dense-connection-based models, DDRN possesses the following main properties. (1) DDRN contains more linking nodes with the same convolution layers. (2) A distillation and compensation mechanism, which performs feature distillation and compensation in different stages of the network, is also constructed. In particular, the high-frequency components lost during information propagation can be compensated in MSPU.

Nonlinear interpolation methods like New Edge Directed Interpolation (NEDI), Curvature based interpolation, neural network based interpolation enhance image but has limitations like several artifacts. In this paper, a novel innovative approach is proposed in which using dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT), low and high frequency sub bands are generated. High frequency sub band images are interpolated using improved NEDI which is NEDI with circular window and dynamic window. Improved NEDI (INEDI) algorithm proposed in the paper gives better results on high frequency components which lead to high resolution image without artifacts. Inverse DT-CWT is applied on interpolated sub bands to reconstruct high resolution image. Registration is applied on both images and shift adaptable bilinear interpolation is applied which reconstructs image into 4 interpolation factor.

The cores of the technology are high precision matching between images and high detail information extraction and fusion. In this paper puts forward a new image super resolution model frame which can adaptive multi-scale enhance the details of reconstructed image. First, the sequence images were decomposed into a detail layer containing the detail information and a smooth layer containing the large scale edge information by bilateral filter. Then, a texture detail enhancement function was constructed to promote the magnitude of the medium and small details. Next, the non-redundant information of the super reconstruction was obtained by differential processing of the detail layer, and the initial super resolution construction result was achieved by interpolating fusion of non-redundant information and the smooth layer. At last, the final reconstruction image was acquired by executing a local optimization model on the initial constructed image. Experiments on ZY-3 satellite images of same phase and different phase show that the proposed method can both improve the information entropy and the image details evaluation standard comparing with the interpolation method, traditional TV algorithm and MAP algorithm, which indicate that our method can obviously highlight image details and contains more ground texture information. A large number of experiment results reveal that the proposed method is robust and universal for different kinds of ZY-3 satellite images.","","adaptive detail enhancement; image fusion; multi-scale decomposition; super resolution","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043252013"

Traditional method to enhance the spatial satellite imaging resolution is strengthening the camera hardware such as sensor, lens and the like, which produces an expensive cost (up to hundreds of millions of dollars) and brings about a long development cycle. Proposing an efficient solution of space super-resolution (SR) imaging plays a significant role for the academia, industries and space agencies. This paper proposes a spatial super-resolution imaging strategy applying the SR algorithms to Sandroid CubeSat platform based on its computing power which realizes the goal of obtaining high-quality images with lower possible cost. First of all, the progress of satellite space imaging and SR technology is surveyed respectively. Subsequently, the principles of representative and state-of-the-art SR approaches are explained in details, then they are applied to the satellite images, afterwards advantages and defects of different SR algorithms in terms of visual results and objective measures are discussed systematically. Following the experiment, the feasibility of SR algorithms for satellite images is analyzed. Ultimately, according to the comprehensive analysis, the paper proposes a spatial super-resolution imaging strategy. The outstanding contribution of this paper is to integrate Sandroid CubeSat with powerful computation ability and the existing SR technology to upgrade the resolution of space imaging, which can achieve the target of using a smaller, lighter, cheaper camera to obtain HR image. © 2016 IEEE.","","Image Processing; Sandroid CubeSat; Space imaging; Super Resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983770731"

Hence, such surveys cannot be carried out periodically. To overcome this issue, satellite images are used, wherein the reservoir water-spread is estimated by conventional per-pixel classification such as the maximum likelihood and minimum distance to mean approaches that often results in inaccurate estimate of water-spread area due to the presence of mixed pixels. High cost and non-availability of high resolution images demands the use of an alternative approach that can give accurate information about the reservoir water-spread area. In this work, IRS, LISS III images of moderate (24 m) resolution were used for accurate estimation of the water-spread area of Singoor reservoir, southern India. The reservoir water-spread areas were extracted using per-pixel classification, sub-pixel classification and super resolution mapping approaches. These results were validated with the water-spread areas obtained from field data of the same dates. The error produced by the per-pixel approach was 6.66%, while it was 4.37% for the sub-pixel approach and a meagre 1.71% for the super-resolution approach. Fairly less error produced by the super resolution mapping technique implies that it is an efficient approach for accurate quantification of reservoir water-spread area. The estimated water-spread can be used in a simple volume estimation formula to estimate the capacity of the reservoir. © 2017, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","India; estimation method; image classification; image resolution; mapping method; pixel; reservoir; satellite imagery","Per-pixel classification; Reservoir water-spread area estimation; Sub-pixel classification; Super resolution mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015661771"

In classical classification problems, crowd-sourced data are represented as points that may or not be located within the same pixel. This discrepancy can result in having mixed pixels that could be unjustly classified. Moreover, it leads to failure in retaining sufficient level of details from data inferences. In this paper we propose a method that can preserve detailed inferences from remote sensing datasets accompanied with crowd-sourced data. We show that advanced machine learning techniques can be utilized towards this objective. The proposed method relies on two steps, firstly we enhance the spatial resolution of the satellite image using Convolutional Neural Networks and secondly we fuse the crowd-sourced data with the upscaled version of the satellite image. However, the covered scope in this paper is concerning the first step.

Our study aims at producing a spatial model for oil palm biomass estimation, at different scales of spatial analysis. The study was carried out in the industrial plantations of the Cameroonian Society of Palm Groves (SOCAPALM). The developed methodology combined: (i) the mapping of palm groves (Kumar, 2015), (ii) the characterisationof palm groves (Gadal, 2013), (iii) biomass estimation, and (iv) the comparison of the obtained results with Spot6, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images from 2001 to 2015. The first results were obtained for the mapping of the SOCAPALM industrial palm groves between 2001 and 2015. The obtained maps were highly correlated (Kappa of 0.91 for Spot 6, 0.92 for Landsat 7 and 0.82 for Lansat8), however, because of the presence of mixed pixels, some confusion between oil palm and other classes were observed. One of the factors affecting biomass estimation is spatial accuracy. Several improvements have been suggested: (1) mapping palm groves at a subpixel scale using super-resolution mapping; (2) developing a classification system of cartographic products. The use of satellites images with different spatial resolutions may also help to generate new data taking into account the level of spatial analysis.","","Biomass; Energy; Modelling; Palm groves; Remote sensing; Spatial accuracy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026513859"

In this paper, a modified discrete wavelet transform and interpolation based technique is proposed for enhancing the resolution of satellite images having low resolution in such a way that a highly resolved satellite image can be obtained without losing any image information. The advent of DWT has given a major impetus to many techniques based on achieving super resolution starting with a single low resolution image. In the proposed method, DWT is employed on the input satellite image to decompose it into sub-bands then the high frequency sub-bands and the input low resolution satellite image have been interpolated to obtain four interpolated images which are later combined after minor alterations to the interpolated input image using IDWT. The quantitative peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and classification results show that the resolution has been enhanced to a good scale without losing any information content present in the satellite image. The quality assessment parameters also illustrate the supremacy of the proposed technique over the conventional techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Discrete wavelet transforms; Image compression; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Satellites; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Classification results; Conventional techniques; Information contents; Low resolution images; Peak signal to noise ratio; Resolution enhancement; Satellite images; Topographic analysis; Image enhancement","Discrete wavelet transform; Resolution enhancement; Satellite images","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924267256"

Satellite images coupled with a very high spectral resolution, and are suitable for detection and classification of surfaces and different elements in the observed image. The main problem with high resolution data for these applications is the (relatively) low spatial resolution, which can vary from a few to tens of meters. In the case of classification purposes, the major problem caused by low spatial resolution is related to subpixels, i.e., pixels in the image where more than one land cover class is within the same pixel. In such a case, the pixel cannot be considered as belonging to just one class, and the assignment of the pixel to a single class will inevitably lead to a loss of information, no matter what class is chosen. A new super resolution mapping (SRM) algorithm by combining pixel and subpixel-level spatial dependences with colorimetry is proposed in this paper. The pixel-level dependence is measured by the spatial attraction model with either surrounding or quadrant neighborhood, while the subpixel-level dependence is characterized by either the mean filter or the exponential weighting function. Both pixel-level and subpixel-level dependences are then fused as the weighted dependence for quickly obtaining the optimal spatial distribution of subpixels by employing the colorimetric algorithm. Synthetic imagery and a QuickBird image are tested for validation of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve results with greater accuracy than two traditional subpixel mapping (SPM) methods and the mixed spatial attraction model method. Meanwhile, the proposed method needs considerably less computation time than the conventional mixed spatial attraction model method, and hence it provides a new solution to subpixel land cover mapping. © 2014, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","algorithm; colorimetry; land cover; mapping method; pixel; QuickBird; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; spatial resolution","Colorimetry; Spatial dependences and satellite imagery; Subpixel classification; Super resolution mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929993156"

For single-image superresolution (SR) processing, previous CNN-based methods have led to significant improvements, when compared to the shallow learning-based methods. However, these CNN-based algorithms with simply direct or skip connections are not suitable for satellite imagery SR because of complex imaging conditions and unknown degradation process. More importantly, they ignore the extraction and utilization of the structural information in satellite images, which is very unfavorable for video satellite imagery SR with such characteristics as small ground targets, weak textures, and over-compression distortion. To this end, this letter proposes a novel progressively enhanced network for satellite image SR called PECNN, which is composed of a pretraining CNN-based network and an enhanced dense connection network. The pretraining part is used to extract the low-level feature maps and reconstructs a basic high-resolution image from the low-resolution input. In particular, we propose a transition unit to obtain the structural information from the base output. Then, the obtained structural information and the extracted low-level feature maps are transmitted to the enhanced network for further extraction to enforce the feature expression. Finally, a residual image with enhanced fine details obtained from the dense connection network is used to enrich the basic image for the ultimate SR output.

The study also analysed the change in land cover over a period of 41 years in a coal mining area. A dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based image super-resolution technique was used to enhance Landsat images of 1975 and 2016. Separating pixels with similar spectral response is an enigmatical task, especially when those pixel represent different ground features. Therefore, an advanced neural net supervised classifier was used to minimize classification errors. Accuracy of the classified images (both super-resolved and original) were measured using confusion matrices and kappa coefficients. A significant improvement of more than 10% was observed in the overall classification accuracy for the image of 1975, highlighting that the classification accuracy of earlier generation satellite data can be improved substantially. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","artificial neural network; coal mining; detection method; image classification; land cover; land use change; long-term change; transform; wavelet analysis","artificial neural network; change detection; coal mining; complex wavelet transform; Image enhancement","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020161319"

To overcome this issue, satellite images are used, where the area estimation is made by the conventional per-pixel classification algorithms. These techniques, however, result in inaccurate estimation of reservoir capacity because the per-pixel classification techniques assume one class per pixel and classify the remotely sensed images. This paper presents a super resolution mapping technique, which predicts and maps the location of several land cover classes within the pixels of the images of Poondi and Chembarambakkam reservoirs of Chennai city. The Hopfield Neural Network algorithm was developed and applied Landsat OLI image of the reservoirs. The fraction images of the reservoir sites, obtained by sub-pixel classification, were subjected to super resolution mapping to accurately estimate the water-spread area and the capacity of the reservoirs. Thus, the pixels with mixed land cover classes along the periphery of the reservoirs were accurately classified in terms of the abundance of water. The water-spread area estimated using super resolution mapping approach can be used as an input in the volume estimation equation to estimate the volume at different water levels of the reservoirs. Super-resolution Mapping approach gives minimum error when compared to sub-pixel approach which inturn gives less erroneous result when comparing per-pixel approach.","Classification (of information); Hopfield neural networks; Optical resolving power; Pixels; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Satellites; Water levels; Neural network algorithm; Pixel-classification techniques; Remotely sensed images; Reservoir capacity; Satellite images; Spread areas; Sub-pixel classification; Super-resolution mappings; Mapping","Classification; Hopfield Neural Network; Reservoir capacity; Satellite image; Super resolution mapping; Water-spread area","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018249287"

Space-borne systems are most likely to be affected by a lack of spatial resolution, due to their natural disadvantage of a large distance between the sensor and the sensed object. Thus, methods for single-image super resolution are desirable to exceed the limits of the sensor. Apart from assisting visual inspection of datasets, post-processing operations-e.g., segmentation or feature extraction-can benefit from detailed and distinguishable structures. In this paper, we show that recently introduced state-of-The-Art approaches for single-image super resolution of conventional photographs, making use of deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), can successfully be applied to remote sensing data. With a huge amount of training data available, end-To-end learning is reasonably easy to apply and can achieve results unattainable using conventional handcrafted algorithms. We trained our CNN on a specifically designed, domain-specific dataset, in order to take into account the special characteristics of multispectral remote sensing data. This dataset consists of publicly available SENTINEL-2 images featuring 13 spectral bands, a ground resolution of up to 10m, and a high radiometric resolution and thus satisfying our requirements in terms of quality and quantity. In experiments, we obtained results superior compared to competing approaches trained on generic image sets, which failed to reasonably scale satellite images with a high radiometric resolution, as well as conventional interpolation methods.","Convolution; Feature extraction; Image resolution; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Radiometry; Space optics; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Multispectral remote sensing; Optical remote sensing; Radiometric resolution; Sentinel-2; Single images; State-of-the-art approach; Remote sensing","Convolutional Neural Networks; Deep Learning; Sentinel-2; Single-Image Super Resolution","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978081674"

However, a critical challenge confronting the further development of STIF is to systematically and robustly address complex land surface changes, which include land cover changes without shape changes (e.g., crop rotation) and land cover changes with shape changes (e.g., urban expansion), in addition to conventional land surface changes (e.g., phenological changes of vegetation). This paper presents the Robust Adaptive Spatial and Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) to tackle this challenge with one prior pair of MODIS-Landsat images. In RASTFM, land surface changes are reorganized into non-shape changes (including phenological changes and land cover changes without shape changes) and shape changes (i.e., land cover changes with shape changes), which are handled differently. However, both non-shape changes and shape changes are predicted through a Non-Local Linear Regression (NL-LR) of the subject pixel's similar neighbors. A regression based high-pass modulation is also performed as a post-processing step to improve both the spatial details and spectral fidelity of the predicted Landsat image. Unlike other STIF models (e.g., the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM), RASTFM can find similar neighboring pixels more precisely through a non-local searching strategy and derives the weights of similar neighbors more rigorously via a linear regression model. As both non-shape and shape changes are treated based on the regression of similar neighboring pixels, the land surface changes are processed in a unified manner. Experiments that use one simulated and three actual MODIS-Landsat datasets featured by different types of land surface changes were conducted to demonstrate the performance of RASTFM. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art STIF models, including weighted function, unmixing and dictionary-learning methods, show that NL-LR based RASTFM can capture the land surface changes in various landscapes more accurately and robustly in a unified manner, thereby facilitating the continuous and detailed monitoring of complex and diverse land surface dynamics. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Image enhancement; Image processing; Linear regression; Pixels; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Critical challenges; Feasible alternatives; Image super resolutions; Linear regression models; Phenological changes; Shape change; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatio-temporal fusions; complexity; experimental study; feasibility study; image resolution; land cover; land surface; Landsat; MODIS; performance assessment; pixel; regression analysis; satellite imagery; sensor; shape; spatiotemporal analysis; Image fusion","Image super-resolution; NL-LR; Non-shape change; Shape change; Spatiotemporal fusion","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042030427"

Therefore, it is now feasible to detect vehicles directly from these satellite images, which has attracted extensive research attentions for both academic and industrial applications. However, it is not an easy task at all, mainly due to the difficulty to obtain training data to train vehicle detectors. On the contrary, there has been sufficient amount of labeled information regarding vehicle regions in the domain of aerial images. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting vehicles on highway satellite images, without the time-consuming step of collecting sufficient training data in this domain. Our key idea is to adopt a novel transfer learning technology that transfers vehicle detectors trained in the aerial image domain to the satellite image domain. In doing so, several cutting-edge vehicle detection algorithms can be directly applied. More specifically, our transfer learning scheme is based on a supervised super-resolution algorithm, which learns mutually correlative sparse coefficients between high and low resolution image patches. Then, a linear SVM based detector is trained, the loss function of which is integrated into the sparse coding operation above.

Low resolution satellite images consists a lot of mixed pixels which degrade the detection and recognition of the information. However, high resolution images play a key role in many image processing applications. In this paper we proposed novel satellite image enhancement technique based on the half band polynomial sub bands image fusion and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. First the input image is decomposed into two low resolution images based on the half band polynomial. The two low resolution images are registered at a specific shift from one another by using quincunx sampling and dyadic integer coefficient wavelet filter is used to restore the resolution lost by CCD array of cameras and then, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization is applied for contrast enhancement. The proposed method has been tested on different satellite images.

Firstly, by employing a variational Bayesian analysis, the unknown high resolution image, the acquisition process, the motion parameters and the unknown model parameters are built together in a single mathematical model with a Bayesian formula, and then the distributions of all unknowns are jointly estimated. Without any parameter adjustment, an HR image is adaptively reconstructed from multiple frame low resolution (LR) images. Secondly, by taking the above HR image as input, a higher resolution image can be rebuilt utilizing the statistical correlation between the HR and LR images which is obtained via the DL method. The VB method effectively uses non-redundant information between LR images to recover HR satellite images. Benefit from the dictionary training of magnanimity image, the DL algorithm is able to provide more high-frequency image details, which means this hybrid of VB and DL method combines the above advantages. The experiments show that this proposed algorithm can effectively increase the image resolution of remote sensing images by 0.5times at least comparing with low resolution image. © 2015 SPIE.","Algorithms; Data compression; Data handling; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellites; Target tracking; Dictionary learning; Multiple-frame; Single frames; Super resolution reconstruction; Variational bayesian; Image processing","Dictionary Learning (DL); multiple frame; single frame; Super Resolution Reconstruction; Variational Bayesian (VB)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938866872"

However, for most commercial space usages, such as virtual display of urban traffic flow, virtual interaction of environmental resources, one drawback of satellite imagery is its low spatial resolution, failing to provide the clear image details. Moreover, in recent years, synthesizing the color for grayscale satellite imagery or recovering the original color of camouflage sensitive regions becomes an urgent requirement for large spatial objects virtual reality interaction. In this work, unlike existing works which solve these two problems separately, we focus on achieving image super-resolution (SR) and image colorization synchronously. Based on multi-task learning, we provide a novel deep neural network model to fulfill single satellite imagery SR and colorization simultaneously. By feeding back the color feature representations into the SR network and jointly optimizing such two tasks, our deep model successfully achieves the mutual cooperation between imagery reconstruction and image colorization. To avoid color bias, we not only adopt the non-satellite imagery to enrich the color diversity of satellite image, but also recalculate the prior color distribution and the valid color range based on the mixed data. We evaluate the proposed model on satellite images from different data sets, such as RSSCN7 and AID. Both the evaluations and comparisons reveal that the proposed multi-task deep learning approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods, where image SR and colorization can be accomplished simultaneously and efficiently. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Color; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Optical resolving power; Remote sensing; Satellites; Virtual reality; Environmental resources; Image super resolutions; Multitask learning; Neural network model; Satellite images; State-of-the-art methods; Virtual interactions; Virtual reality interactions; Satellite imagery","Deep neural networks; Image super-resolution; Multi-task learning; Satellite image colorization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043229610"

One is that there are always errors between the high-resolution panchromatic (HRP) image and the linear weighted high-resolution multispectral (HRM) image, resulting in spatial and spectral information lost. The other is that the dictionary construction process depends on the nontruth training samples. These problems have limited applications to CS-based pan-sharpening algorithm. To solve these two problems, we propose a pan-sharpening algorithm via compressed superresolution reconstruction and multidictionary learning. Through a two-stage implementation, compressed superresolution reconstruction model reduces the error effectively between the HRP and the linear weighted HRM images. Meanwhile, the multidictionary with ridgelet and curvelet is learned for both the two stages in the superresolution reconstruction process. Since ridgelet and curvelet can better capture the structure and directional characteristics, a better reconstruction result can be obtained. Experiments are done on the QuickBird and IKONOS satellites images. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is competitive compared with the recent CS-based pan-sharpening methods and other well-known methods. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Compressed sensing; Compressive sensing; Dictionary constructions; Directional characteristic; IKONOS satellite; multidictionary learning; Pan-sharpening; Spectral information; Super-resolution reconstruction; Optical resolving power","compressed superresolution reconstruction; multidictionary learning.; pan-sharpening","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041124723"

However, the detector performance has been significantly degenerated due to the low resolutions of satellite images, as well as the limited training data. In this paper, a robust domainadaptive vehicle detection framework is proposed to bypass both problems. Our innovation is to transfer the detector learning to the high-resolution aerial image domain, where rich supervision exists and robust detectors can be trained. To this end, we first propose a super-resolution algorithm using coupled dictionary learning to ""augment"" the satellite image region being tested into the aerial domain. Notably, linear detection loss is embedded into the dictionary learning, which enforces the augmented region to be sensitive to the subsequent detector training. Second, to cope with the domain changes, we propose an instance-wised detection using Exemplar Support Vector Machines (E-SVMs), which well handles the intra-class and imaging variations like scales, rotations, and occlusions. With comprehensive experiments on large-scale satellite image collections, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly boost the detection accuracy over several state-of-The-Arts. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Identifying and mapping the vegetation specifically trees is a significant issue in remote sensing applications where the lack of height information becomes a hard monocular recognition task. The density and shape of the trees gets affected by other man-made objects which gives rise to an erroneous recognition. The quality of recognition may be affected by various terms like resolution, visibility, sizes or scale. Predicting trees when they are partially blocked from view is also a challenging task. A common problem associated with the application of satellite images is the frequent occurrence of mixed pixels. The motivation of this work is to extract trees using pixel swapping method. Pixel-swapping algorithm is a simple and efficient technique for super resolution mapping to change the spatial arrangement of sub-pixels in such a way that the spatial correlation between neighboring sub-pixels would be maximized. Soft classification techniques were introduced to avoid the loss of information by assigning a pixel to multiple land-use/land-cover classes according to the area represented within the pixel. This soft classification technique generates a number of fractional images equal to the number of classes. Super resolution mapping was then used to know where each class is located within the pixel, in order to obtain detailed spatial patterns. The aim of supper resolution mapping is to determine a fine resolution map of the trees from the soft classification result. The experiment is conducted with images of Madurai city obtained from WorldView2 satellite.

Such fused data are required to provide a comprehensive understanding of Earth's surface land cover dynamics. In this research, a novel Spatial-Temporal Fraction Map Fusion (STFMF) model is proposed to produce a series of fine-spatial-temporal-resolution land cover fraction maps by fusing coarse-spatial-fine-temporal and fine-spatial-coarse-temporal fraction maps, which may be generated from multi-scale remotely sensed images. The STFMF has two main stages. First, FR fraction change maps are generated using kernel ridge regression. Second, a FR fraction map for the date of prediction is predicted using a temporal-weighted fusion model. In comparison to two established spatial-temporal fusion methods of spatial-temporal super-resolution land cover mapping model and spatial-temporal image reflectance fusion model, STFMF holds the following characteristics and advantages: (1) it takes account of the mixed pixel problem in FR remotely sensed images; (2) it directly uses the fraction maps as input, which could be generated from a range of satellite images or other suitable data sources; (3) it focuses on the estimation of fraction changes happened through time and can predict the land cover change more accurately. Experiments using synthetic multi-scale fraction maps simulated from Google Earth images, as well as synthetic and real MODIS-Landsat images were undertaken to test the performance of the proposed STFMF approach against two benchmark spatial-temporal reflectance fusion methods: the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) and the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) model. In both visual and quantitative evaluations, STFMF was able to generate more accurate FR fraction maps and provide more spatial detail than ESTARFM and FSDAF, particularly in areas with substantial land cover changes. STFMF has great potential to produce accurate time-series fraction maps with fine-spatial-temporal-resolution that can support studies of land cover dynamics at the sub-pixel scale. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Image enhancement; Optical resolving power; Photomapping; Pixels; Reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Kernel ridge regressions; Land cover; Quantitative evaluation; Remotely sensed images; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial temporals; Spectral unmixing; Super-resolution mappings; benchmarking; land cover; Landsat; mapping; MODIS; prediction; regression analysis; remote sensing; research work; satellite data; satellite imagery; sensor; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; Image fusion","Fraction maps; Land cover; Spatial-temporal fusion; Spectral unmixing; Super-resolution mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047057538"
