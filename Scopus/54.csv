Since the date of reactivation, a modern monitoring system has been implemented with the installation of in-situ geodetic automated tracking total stations (ATTS), an inclinometer and two piezometers. Here, we describe two distinctive methods, the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) and the Vector Inclination Method (VIM) used to characterize the landslide from the kinematic and geometrical point of view. The main input data, used for both methods, derive from processing a stack of several Sentinel-1 differential interferograms with the Multiple Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) 2D and 3D algorithms. BFAST allowed highlighting the seasonality of the phenomenon from the analysis of the time series as well as the trend and the breakpoints that iden-tify the landslide reactivation phases. These latter were then correlated with the main triggering factors such as rain and snow melting. The application of the VIM through the exploitation of the MSBAS displacement vectors allowed the reconstruction of the depth of the landslide slip surface along both the longitudinal and transversal direction and, in turn, the evaluation of the volumes of material mobilized by the landslide. The results obtained further prove that procedures for the in-depth analysis of Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) data can contribute to slow-moving landslide characterization, which represents a fundamental step for landslide hazard assessment within quantitative risk analyses. © 2022 by the authors.

Ground-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been successfully applied for decades, reaching very high standards for data quality and accuracy. However, routine campaigns and long inspection times are required for data collection and their implementation into reliable infrastructure management systems (IMSs). On the other hand, satellite remote sensing techniques, such as the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method, have proven effective in monitoring ground displacements of transport infrastructure (roads, railways and airfields) with a much higher temporal frequency of investigation and the capability to cover wider areas. Nevertheless, the integration of information from (i) satellite remote sensing and (ii) ground-based NDT methods is a subject that is still to be fully explored in civil engineering. This paper aims to review significant stand-alone and combined applications in these two areas of endeavour for transport infrastructure monitoring.

Freely available satellite data allow significant possibilities for the use of remote sensing techniques, particularly multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR), for surface deformation monitoring. However, track records and field demonstrations of InSAR-based tunneling-related deformation monitoring are limited, particularly in identifying the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation and causal factors thereof from construction activities. Therefore, this study explores the feasibility of using satellite SAR data to monitor the surface deformation associated with different tunnel construction phases. Tunneling-related surface deformation was analyzed using the persistent scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1B SAR data; the PS-InSAR results were compared with those from the conventional leveling method. The velocity map of the study site revealed a localized subsidence trough associated with the construction of vertical shafts and shield tunneling. The cumulative time-series displacement map successfully tracked the spatial and temporal progression of ground deformations related to the phases of tunnel construction activities. The maximum subsidence rate in the radar line-of-sight direction was estimated to exceed 40 mm/yr, with maximum cumulative subsidence of ∼ 200 mm. The results clearly showed that dewatering during tunneling aggravated the subsidence phenomenon. The consequent compaction and consolidation of the compressible soil layers due to the lowered groundwater table were the main causes of subsidence. Our results demonstrate the viability of the PS-InSAR technique based on the C-band Sentinel-1 product as a monitoring method to examine the spatiotemporal evolution of ground deformation patterns during tunneling activities and as a possible preliminary surveying tool to identify ongoing abnormal settlement prior to tunnel construction. © 2022","South Korea; deformation; dewatering; induced response; monitoring system; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; tunneling; underground construction","Dewatering; Ground subsidence; Monitoring; PS-InSAR; Sentinel-1; Tunneling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126430781"

In this paper, we first simulated, extracted, and analyzed the scattering intensity of two types of rice of six temporal CP synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data under three transmitting modes. Then, during different phenology stages, the optimal parameters for distinguishing transplanting hybrid rice (T–H) and direct-sown japonica rice (D–J) were acquired. Finally, a decision tree classification model was established based on the optimal parameters to carry out the fine classification of the two types of rice and to verify the results. The results showed that this strategy can obtain a high classification accuracy for the two types of rice with an overall classification accuracy of more than 95% and a kappa coefficient of more than 0.94. In addition, and importantly, we found that the CP parameters in the 1103 period (harvest stage) were the best CP parameters to distinguish the two types of rice, followed by the 0730 (seedling–elongation stage), 0612 (seedling stage), and 0916 (heading–flowering stage) periods. © 2022 by the authors.

Measuring carbon sequestered in the terrestrial ecosystem and monitoring its dynamics is one of the key objectives in sustainable development goals. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has evolved as a key satellite technology in measuring and monitoring terrestrial carbon sink stored as biomass in plants. This study attempts to model forest above-ground biomass (AGB) using a random forest machine-learning approach where the predictor variables are from C-band (Radarsat-2), L-band (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), and multi-temporal spaceborne LiDAR data from the GEDI platform. Training and validation data for the machine learning approach are obtained from the field measured inventory campaigns to evaluate the modeled forest biomass accuracies. The results show that variables from L-band (HH, HV), C-band (HV), and canopy height from the GEDI LiDAR platform performed effectively to model forest AGB with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.81 and root mean squared error (rmse) of 19.35 Mg/ha (%rmse – 17.17). In the case of single frequency SAR data, the analysis shows that the model derived from the L-band SAR data and LiDAR performed comparably better than the combination of C-band SAR and LiDAR data with an R2 of 0.78 and rmse of 21.36 Mg/ha (%rmse – 18.94). The results, thus, demonstrate the potential of SAR data (both single frequency and multiple frequencies) in combination with GEDI LiDAR data in effectively modeling AGB over highly biodiverse tropical forest regions.

In this framework, anomalies of movement, i.e., accelerations or deceleration as seen by the time series of displacement of radar targets, are identified. In this work, a Machine Learning algorithm such as the Random Forest has been used to assess the probability of occurrence of the anomalies induced by slope instability and subsidence. About 20,000 anomalies (about 7000 and 13,000 for the slope instability and the subsidence, respectively) were collected between 2018 and 2020 and were used as input, while ten different variables were selected, five related to the morphological and geological setting of the study area and five to the radar characteristics of the data. The resulting maps may provide useful indications of where a sudden change of displacement trend may occur, analyzing the contribution of each factor. The cross-validation with the anomalies collected in a following timespan (2020–2021) and with official landslide and subsidence inventories provided by the regional authority has confirmed the reliability of the final maps. The adoption of a map for assessing the probability of the occurrence of MTInSAR anomalies may serve as an enhanced geohazard prevention measurement, to be periodically updated and refined in order to have the most precise knowledge possible of the territory. © 2022 by the authors.

Consequently, it is very difficult and time-consuming to manually collect enough training samples when extracting water body from multi-temporal PolSAR images. To this problem, transfer learning is used to reduce the labor cost of querying new samples and improve the timeliness of water body extraction of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Methods Firstly, an optimal source domain image from multi-temporal images is automatically selected according to the distribution difference between images, and the other images are taken as target domain images. Secondly, a group of training samples are queried in the source domain image as source sample set, and the same number of unlabeled samples are randomly sampled from each target domain image as their target domain sample set. And the knowledge of source domain samples is transferred to target domain samples via the transfer learning method. Finally, a random forest classifier-based water body extraction model is trained using the target domain sample set, and is used for the water body extraction of target domain images. Results We have conducted experiments using six PolSAR images and two kinds of transfer learning methods, the results show that: (1) The label transfer accuracy and the water body extraction accuracy are positively correlated. (2) Inductive transfer learning methods achieve higher label transfer accuracy and lower standard deviation. (3) A smaller distribution difference between source and target domain images indicate a greater transferability, and thus a better water body extraction accuracy. (4) The water body extraction results of inductive transfer learning methods have a higher rate of missing detection, while the results of transductive transfer learning methods have a higher rate of false detection. Conclusions In the water body extraction of multi-temporal PolSAR images, the use of transfer learning methods can significantly reduce the number of manually labeled samples needed to construct high-performance classifiers, while maintaining the water body extraction accuracy at a high level. It has great application potentiality in the emergency response of flood disaster. © 2022 Wuhan University.

The study explores the potential of dual polarization Sentinel–1 backscatter parameters to investigate its sensitivity with various biophysical parameters of paddy crop. Temporal profile of crop growth parameters such as fresh biomass, dry biomass, vegetation water content (VWC) and plant height of paddy crop are assessed with respect to SAR parameters such as VV, VH, VH/VV and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI). Temporal Sentinel–1A SAR data during June to November 2018 was considered for this study. Regression analysis using linear and logarithmic models reveal that the sensitivity of Sentinel–1A backscatter parameters with crop biophysical parameters is best when the crop is at early vegetation stage i.e. between tillering to booting stages with maximum R2 value of 0.68 for liner regression with VH and 0.69 for multiple regression for crop height followed by other biophysical parameters. At later vegetation stage i.e. ripening stage maximum R2 value of 0.52 for liner regression with VH and multiple regression for crop biomass is observed. There is no significant correlation for peak vegetation stage. The results are indicative for the potential use of dual-polarimetric SAR parameters as input parameters for multiple regression models to improve the prediction of biophysical parameters at different phenolgical stages. © 2022 COSPAR","Backscattering; Binary alloys; Biophysics; Crops; Regression analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Backscatter; Biophysical parameters; Crop growth; Growth parameters; Multi-temporal; Multiple regressions; Radar data; Rice crops; Sentinel-1; Vegetation water content; Biomass","Backscatter; Biomass; Multi–temporal; Sentinel–1; VWC","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126763871"

On 17 June 2020, a rainstorm hit Danba County, Sichuan Province, and triggered the catastrophic Aniangzhai landslide. The impact of this rainstorm on landslide kinematics in this region has seldom been investigated. We used a time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis to map the active slopes in Danba County using one ascending (2015–2021) and one descending (2018–2021) Sentinel-1 dataset. A total of 36 landslides (63.1 km2) were detected along riverbanks. The time series of eastward and vertical displacements during 2018–2021 were retrieved by integrating the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets. The maximum eastward and vertical displacement rates obtained are 229 and −75 mm/yr, respectively. Seasonal accelerations are correlated with concentrated rainfall. We suggest that the 2020 rainstorm and the abundant precipitation during the water year 2020 altered the long-term displacement trends of active landslides. We further constrained the volumes of the Niela and Gaoding landslides in the order 3.6–6.9 × 107 m3 and 5.4–6.0 × 108 m3, respectively, using 2D displacement rates and mass conservation equations. Our results demonstrate that multi-temporal and multi-orbit InSAR measurements can provide insights into the evolution and mechanism of landslides. © 2022 The Author(s)","China; Danba; Sichuan; displacement; landslide; radar interferometry; rainfall; rainstorm; Sentinel; slope; synthetic aperture radar; time series","InSAR; Rainfall; Sliding depth; Slow-moving landslides","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141982276"

In order to cost-effectively handle huge amount of data, we design a semi-automatic procedure to quickly identify, map and inventory ground and infrastructures displacements by means of spatial clustering performed over very large-scale Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) datasets. The detected deforming areas are then evaluated against the Line of Sight (LOS) velocity vector decomposition and the accessible ancillary layers for a preliminary classification of the triggering factors.

Combining spaceborne optical and microwave data is essential for accurate classification in areas with frequent cloud cover, such as tropical regions. In this study, we investigate the possible improvements, when SAR data is incorporated into the classification process along with optical data. We used MSI/Sentinel-2 and SAR/Sentinel-1 to provide LULC mapping in the Roraima State, Brazil, in 2019. This State is located in a tropical area, where the cloud cover is frequent over the year. Cloud cover becomes substantial, especially during the May-August period when crops are grown. Twenty-nine scenarios involving a combination of optical- and SAR-based features, as well as times of data acquisition, were considered in this study. Our results showed that optical or SAR data used individually are not enough to provide accurate LULC mapping. The best results in terms of overall accuracy (OA) were achieved using metrics of multi-temporal surface reflectance and vegetation index (VI) for optical imagery, and values of backscatter coefficient in different polarizations and their ratios yielding an OA of 86.41 ± 1.74%. Analysis of three periods of data (January to April, May to August, and September to December) used for classification allowed us to identify the optimal period for distinguishing specific classes. When comparing our LULC map with a LULC product derived within the MapBiomas project we observed that our method performed better to map annual and perennial crops and water classes. Our methodology provides a more accurate LULC for the Roraima State, and the proposed technique can be applied to benefit other regions that are affected by persistent cloud cover. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Nowadays, deep learning approaches produce state of the art results in single-image SAR restoration. Nevertheless, huge multi-temporal stacks are now often available and could be efficiently exploited to further improve image quality. This paper explores two fast strategies employing a single-image despeckling algorithm, namely SAR2SAR [1], in a multi-temporal framework. The first one is based on Quegan filter [2] and replaces the local reflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress speckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the form of a 'super-image', i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series. Experimental results on Sentinel-1 GRD data show that these two multi-temporal strategies provide improved filtering results while adding a limited computational cost. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning; Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Signal encoding; Speckle; Deep learning; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal series; Physical parameters; Sentinel-1; Single images; Speckle reduction; Synthetic aperture radar images; Synthetic aperture radar imaging; Temporal speckle; Synthetic aperture radar","deep learning; multi-temporal series; SAR imaging; speckle reduction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140408402"

In this way, the accurate identification of their growing areas is the basis for agricultural decision-making and planting structure adjustment, which are of great significance to the national food security. Currently, there is insufficient research on the identification of soybean, using remote sensing, under complex agricultural planting structures. In this paper, Guoyang County, a typical soybean-producing region in the north of Anhui Province, China, was selected as the study area, and then the multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 (S-1/2) microwave and optical multispectral data were integrated to obtain the spatial distribution of the planting areas, via a stepwise hierarchical extraction strategy. Considering the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, August 18 (i.e., the early pod setting stage) was correspondingly determined as more appropriate for soybean extraction, compared with other time phases. For this purpose, a set of rules were established to eliminate the non-cropland pixels, and the total distribution of the field vegetation was derived accordingly. In total, 30 candidate features (viz. 10 spectral bands, 11 vegetation indices, 4 texture features, and 5 microwave polarization features) were selected, and their importance was evaluated based on the ReliefF algorithm. With the support of the typical cover type samples, the weight assessment method for the ReliefF feature was further bundled with three machine-learning (ML) algorithms, namely, the random forest (RF), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the support vector machine (SVM), to single out the optimum subset of the features for soybean identification. The results finally revealed that the ReliefF-RF model outperformed the other two. With nine optimum features, Kappa coefficient also reached up to 0.77–0.85. Furthermore, the extraction accuracy produced by the optimum subset of the features was significantly greater than the original 10 spectral bands (Kappa coefficient of 0.75–0.84), albeit slightly lower than the effect of the total 30 features (Kappa coefficient of 0.78–0.85). © 2022","Anhui; China; assessment method; identification method; machine learning; mapping method; polarization; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soybean; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar","Crop mapping; Feature selection; Machine learning; Sentinel-1/2 data; Soybean","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139370805"

A comprehensive approach for the processing, interpretation and proper use of satellite radar interferometry data for structural analyses at urban and single-construction scales is proposed. Following a brief literature review, highlighting the most relevant applications in this field, some aspects concerning DInSAR techniques are shortly summarized, particularly focusing on the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach applied to perform advanced analyses at structural level. Then, the main issues of the DInSAR measurements exploitation for structural applications are discussed, focusing on the use of both one or two datasets relevant to ascending and descending satellite passes. Analysis at the scale of single construction (i.e., building, bridge, etc.) of displacements time series and mean deformation velocities is discussed, in order to identify scenarios that may become potentially critical for the structures. Some application examples are provided, employing COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) datasets relative to the urban area of Rome (Italy), acquired during the 2011–2019 time interval and processed through the SBAS algorithm. Specific considerations related to the use of DInSAR measurements for structural monitoring and assessment are then proposed, also discussing possible approaches for preliminary and detailed evaluation of structural damages. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bridges; Damage detection; Deformation; Interferometry; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Time series analysis; Deformation velocity; DInSAR; Displacement time series; Mean deformation velocity; Monitoring and assessment; Satellite radar interferometry; Settlement damage; Small baseline subsets; Structural assessments; Structural monitoring; Satellites","DInSAR; Displacement time series; Mean deformation velocity; SBAS; Settlement damages; Structural assessment; Structural monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120181622"

Accordingly, policymakers and planners often consider a special place in the agricultural economy and economic development for this essential commodity. Typically, a sample survey is carried out through field observations and farmers’ consultations to estimate annual rice yield. Studies show that these methods lead to many errors and are time-consuming and costly. Satellite remote sensing imagery is widely used in agriculture to provide timely, high-resolution data and analytical capabilities. Earth observations with high spatial and temporal resolution have provided an excellent opportunity for monitoring and mapping crop fields. This study used the time series of dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 ESA’s Copernicus program to extract rice cultivation areas in Mazandaran province in Iran. A novel multi-channel streams deep feature extraction method was proposed to simultaneously take advantage of SAR and optical imagery. The proposed framework extracts deep features from the time series of NDVI and original SAR images by first and second streams. In contrast, the third stream integrates them into multi-levels (shallow to deep high-level features); it extracts deep features from the channel attention module (CAM), and group dilated convolution. The efficiency of the proposed method was assessed on approximately 129,000 in-situ samples and compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results showed that combining NDVI time series and SAR data can significantly improve rice-type mapping. Moreover, the proposed methods had high efficiency compared with other methods, with more than 97% overall accuracy. The performance of rice-type mapping based on only time-series SAR images was better than only time-series NDVI datasets. Moreover, the classification performance of the proposed framework in mapping the Shirodi rice type was better than that of the Tarom type. © 2022 by the authors.","","attention modules; deep learning; multi-temporal; NDVI; rice mapping; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144724642"

However, its measurement accuracy is largely limited by the complex atmospheric delay distortion in alpine valley regions, resulting in poor performance of landslides detection and monitoring. Particularly, the spatial atmospheric heterogeneity over wide areas cannot be accurately reflected by conventional empirical phase-elevation models or external data-based methods. In this study, we proposed a multi-temporal moving-window linear model (MMLM) to correct the tropospheric delay for wide-area landslides investigation. This is a linear regression model based on the elevation-phase relationship for modeling multi-temporal phases within a sliding local window. It mitigates the influence of local turbulent phase, local landslide deformation, and phase unwrapping error on parameter estimation, providing precise heterogeneous atmospheric corrections for wide-area InSAR landslide identification and monitoring. A simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the sensitivity of model parameters settings and evaluate the effectiveness of the MMLM model. Furthermore, we demonstrated the performance of the MMLM model through a comparison with the ERA5, GACOS, spatial-temporal filtering, and traditional linear model using descending and ascending Sentinel-1 data over the reservoir area of the Lianghekou hydropower station. Among the above-mentioned methods, the standard deviation of original unwrapped phases achieved the largest decrease of more than 35% and 50% after correction by the MMLM model for the descending and ascending Sentinel-1 tracks, respectively. In addition, the accurate deformation corrected by the MMLM model improved the landslides investigation, not only can help for delineating landslide boundaries in space but also retrieving movement evolution in time. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Alpine County; California; United States; Deformation; Regression analysis; Troposphere; Landslide monitoring; Linear modeling; Moving window; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal moving-window linear model; SAR interferometry; SAR-interferometry; Time series Inc SAR interferometry; Times series; Tropospheric delays; correction; deformation; heterogeneity; identification method; landslide; monitoring system; precision; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; troposphere; turbulence; Landslides","Landslides; Multi-temporal moving-window linear model; Time series InSAR; Tropospheric delay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127334602"

Time series data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites make it possible to identify small rates of motion over large areas of the Earth’s surface with high spatial resolution, which is key to detecting high-deformation areas. Santiago de Chile’s metropolitan region comprises a large Andean foothills basin in one of the most seismically active subduction zones worldwide. The Santiago basin and its surroundings are prone to megathrust and shallow crustal earthquakes, landslides, and constant anthropogenic effects, such as the overexploitation of groundwater and land use modification, all of which constantly affect the ground stability. Here, we recorded ground deformations in the Santiago basin using a multi-temporal differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) from Sentinel 1, obtaining high-resolution ground motion rates between 2018 and 2021. GNSS stations show a constant regional uplift in the metropolitan area (~10 mm/year); meanwhile, DInSAR allows for the identification of areas with anomalous local subsistence (rates < −15 mm/year) and mountain sectors with landslides with unprecedented detail. Ground deformation patterns vary depending on factors such as soil type, basin geometry, and soil/soil heterogeneities. Thus, the areas with high subsidence rates are concentrated in sectors with fine sedimentary cover and a depressing shallow water table as well as in cropping areas with excess water withdrawal. There is no evidence of detectable movement on the San Ramon Fault (the major quaternary fault in the metropolitan area) over the observational period. Our results highlight the mechanical control of the sediment characteristics of the basin and the impact of anthropogenic processes on ground stability. These results are essential to assess the stability of the Santiago basin and contribute to future infrastructure development and hazard management in highly populated areas. © 2022 by the authors.","Faulting; Groundwater; Hazards; Land use; Synthetic aperture radar; Deformation monitoring; Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Geohazards; Geological hazards; GNSS; Ground deformations; Ground stability; High resolution; Metropolitan area; Urban areas; Landslides","DInSAR; geohazard; GNSS; ground deformation; landslides","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143748327"

In this work the historical geodetic levelling measurements and satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data archive are integrated to assess the accuracy of Atmospheric Delay and Deformation Rate estimations obtained through Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PSI) techniques. Tree levelling measurement datasets acquired in 1990, 1997 and 2004 are used in order to obtain the precise deformation rate at the benchmarks for two periods of 1990-1997 and 1997-2004.

For the Amazon rainforest, automated mapping is of critical importance, as land cover is changing rapidly due to forest degradation and deforestation. Several research groups have addressed this challenge by conducting local surveys and producing maps using freely available remote sensing data. However, automating the process of large-scale land cover mapping remains one of the biggest challenges in the remote sensing community. One issue when using supervised learning is the scarcity of labeled training data. One way to address this problem is to make use of already available maps produced with (semi-) automated classifiers. This is also known as weakly supervised learning. The present study aims to develop novel methods for automated LULC classification in the cloud-prone Amazon basin (Brazil) based on the labels from the MapBiomas project, which include twelve classes. We investigate different fusion techniques for multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time-series from 2018. The newly designed deep learning architectures—DeepForest-1 and DeepForest-2—utilize spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as multi-scale representations of the data. In several data scenarios, the models are compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) models, such as U-Net and DeepLab. The proposed networks reach an overall accuracy of up to 75.0%, similar to the SotA models. However, the novel approaches outperform the SotA models with respect to underrepresented classes. Forest, savanna and crop were mapped best, with F1 scores up to 85.0% when combining multi-modal data, compared to 81.6% reached by DeepLab. Furthermore, in a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the classifiers sometimes outperform the inaccurate labels. © 2022 by the authors.","Automation; Data fusion; Deep learning; Deforestation; Land use; Mapping; Modal analysis; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Supervised learning; Tropics; Amazon rain forest; Deep learning; Land-use and land-cover classifications; Multi-modal; Multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Tropic; Weak supervision; Synthetic aperture radar","Amazon rainforest; data fusion; deep learning; land use and land cover classification; multi-modal and multi-temporal data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; tropics; weak supervision","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140030738"

The results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method using both simulated and real SAR data. © 2022 IEEE.","Interferometry; Closure phase; Fading signal; Ground displacement; Interferograms; Mitigation methods; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal InSAR algorithm; Phase bias; Phase closure; Short base lines; Synthetic aperture radar","Fading signals; Multitemporal InSAR algorithms; phase closure","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140374513"

However, the historical seismicity in the area indicates no severe damage from past earthquakes. For this reason, studies are needed to monitor the slow ground movements and their triggering factors. Since about two decades ago, satellite observations by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and the multi-temporal (MT-InSAR) technique have provided a tool for monitoring slow and extremely slow ground displacements. In this study, 2D decomposition of InSAR outputs revealed a sliding surface at two regions located 12 km apart, indicating slow motion rather than fast movement along the damaged area. We concluded that the factors leading to surface displacement in the investigated area include the triggering earthquakes, precipitation, terrain topography and soil moisture.

Multiple satellite remote sensing observations, in-situ measurements, and geophysical approaches have been jointly implemented to monitor and interpret the life cycle of landslides and their failure mechanisms from various perspectives. In this work, we propose a framework where satellite optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing techniques are combined with feature extractions using independent component analysis (ICA) and a mathematical relaxation model to assess the complete four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal patterns of post-failure slope evolution. The large, deep-seated Aniangzhai landslide in Southwest China that occurred on 17 June 2020 is comprehensively analyzed and characterized for its post-failure mechanism. Time series of Planet high-resolution optical images are first explored to derive the large horizontal motions for the first six months after the failure. Spatiotemporal dynamics of line-of-sight (LOS) displacement in the landslide body are then derived between November 2020 and February 2022 by combining 40 TerraSAR-X (TSX) High-resolution Spotlight (HS) images and 76 medium-resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR datasets using Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) method. The InSAR-derived results are subsequently analyzed with ICA to find common deformation components of points between optical and MTI results, indicating the same temporal evolution in the deformation pattern. Finally, the complete 4D deformation field for the whole post-failure period is modeled using a decaying exponential model representing stress relaxation after the failure by integrating multiple remote sensing datasets. Cross-correlation analysis of Planet imagery shows a decaying exponential pattern of post-failure displacements with an approximately 94% reduction in the deformation rate after six months with respect to the co-failure event. MTI analysis suggests a maximum LOS displacement rate of approximately 30 cm/year over the main failure body from November 2020 to February 2022; while the high-resolution TSX datasets show irreplaceable advantages in choosing the number of measurement points in MTI analysis with the number of measurement points being five times larger than those obtained by S1 datasets. The ICA analysis reveals three main types of kinematic patterns in the temporal evolution of post-failure deformation in MTI results, the dominant one being an exponential declining pattern similar to the results from Planet observations. Integrated 4D deformation modeling suggests that the most significant post-failure displacement mainly occurred toward the west, amounting to 28 m during the entire post-failure acquisitions from June 2020 until February 2022. Additionally, maximum displacements of 17 m and 19 m occurred in this period toward the north and downward, respectively. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To reduce water scarcity in arid regions, recently, remote sensing and GIS techniques have been successfully applied to predict areas with prospective water resources. Thus, this study attempted to spatially reveal groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) and to conduct change detection on the desert fringes of Wadi Asyuti, a defunct tributary of Egypt’s Nile basin in eastern Sahara. Eleven influential groundwater factors generated from remote sensing imagery, and geological, hydrological, and climatic conditions were combined after giving a weight to each factor through a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with the weighted overlay technique (WOT). The results revealed six distinctive zones with scores ranging from very low (10.59%) to excellent (3.03%). Thirty-three productive groundwater wells, Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD), a land use map derived from Sentinel-2, and the delineated flooding zone derived from Landsat-8 data were used to validate the delineated zones. The GWPZs indicated that 48% of the collected wells can be classified as consistent to excellent. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and image classification were applied to the multi-temporal Landsat series and Sentinel-2 along with the InSAR CCD data derived from Sentinel-1 images to reveal dramatic changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) in terms of agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in the structurally downstream area, which is the most promising area for future developments. Overall, the integration of radar and multispectral data through the GIS technique has the ability to provide valuable information about water resources in arid regions. Thus, the tested model is a promising technique, and such information is extremely significant for the guidance of planners and decision makers in the area of sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors.","Egypt; Agriculture; Arid regions; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Groundwater resources; Land use; Planning; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Groundwater potentials; Interferometry synthetic aperture radars; LANDSAT; Modeling; Prospectives; Remote sensing and GIS; Remote-sensing; Water monitoring; Waters resources; arid region; detection method; environmental monitoring; human activity; image classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; mapping method; NDVI; numerical model; radar altimetry; remote sensing; water resource; Groundwater","arid region; change detection; GIS; groundwater; modeling; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136959766"

When an agricultural area constantly received low rainfall during the sowing and growing season of crop, the soil moisture of the cropland goes down and the crop began to wilt, the situation is known as agricultural drought. Present study, used the multi-temporal Sentinel 1 SAR and Landsat optical data to assess the agricultural drought in the part of Odisha state. Initially, to establish the methodology, correlation between NDVI and SAR backscattering has been carried out for the demarcated agricultural landscape of MODIS images derived landcover map of 2019. The drought assessment has been carried out for the month of Jun-July of 2020 and 2021 which is the kharif crop growing season. Thereafter, the backscattering vale range has been identified as a threshold value to delineate the agricultural drought affected areas from other SAR images of various vintages. The study area was more affected by the drought in 2020 compared to 2021. In this study, it is observed that although the area is drought affected, received less rainfall, but due to location in coastal region this area is mostly under cloud cover, therefore, it is very difficult assess the agricultural drought using optical remote sensing data. SAR data is also sensitive to soil moisture condition; therefore, it can be potentially to be used for drought assessment for the coastal agricultural area. © 2022 COSPAR","Backscattering; Crops; Cultivation; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Rain; Soil moisture; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural areas; Agricultural drought; Case-studies; Growing season; Multi-spectral data; Multi-temporal; Natural hazard; NDVI; Radar data; Remote-sensing; Drought","Agricultural drought; NDVI; Remote Sensing; SAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132853708"

Here, we aimed to estimate the various paddy/rice attributes (particularly, acreage and PD) using the Sentinel-1A observations, and assessing the impact of such key parameters on end-of-season yields. The method comprises: (1) a multi-temporal time-series analysis algorithm of Sentinel-1A observations for rice mapping, (2) a PD retrieval algorithm, and (3) rice yield estimation using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-derived PD in a modeling system. Our study was implemented over the rainfed paddy fields in Cambodia between 2017 thru 2020. We demonstrated that the backscatter ratio ([Formula presented]) from Sentinel-1A can improve the accuracy of rice mapping, while σVH0 backscatter can provide PD estimations. Our results showcased reasonable/good performance in mapping the paddy fields and estimating PD in the study area. PD found in March and April were indicative of irrigation application in some parts of Cambodia, specifically in the southeastern part (also part of the Mekong delta) where irrigation in paddy fields is a common practice. Differences between the crop-calendar based PD (June 1) and the SAR-derived PD can range as much as 75 days. In the rice-dominated provinces such as Banteay-Meanchey and Svay-Rieng of Cambodia, when SAR-derived PD are used, rice yield normalized bias improved compared to the fixed PD data by a mean of 7–12 % and 30–48 % respectively within the study period. In addition, the PD derived from SAR also significantly reduced the uncertainty in yield estimation. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential of using the SAR-derived PD in improving the rice yield estimation over rainfed paddy fields. © 2022","Cambodia; crop yield; paddy farming; rainfed agriculture; seasonal variation; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; yield response","Cambodia; Crop modeling; Planting date; Rainfed Paddy; Sentinel-1A; Yield estimation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139865519"

However, the acquisition of optical images is significantly unstable due to the influence of cloudy and rainy weather, which seriously restricts the application of this method in practice. To solve this problem, this study proposed an optical-SAR imagery-based rice mapping method which has the advantages of less dependence on optical images, easy operation and high classification accuracy. To account for the trait of sparse availability of optical images, this method only needs one clear sky optical image in the rice growth period and combined it with multi-temporal SAR images to achieve a high accuracy rice mapping result. Meanwhile, this paper also proposed a comprehensively multi-scale segmentation parameter optimization algorithm, which considers the area consistency, shape error and location difference between the segmented object and reference object, and adopts an orthogonal experiment approach. Based on the optical image, the boundaries of the parcel objects can be segmented, which were subsequently used to perform the object-oriented classification. The results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed method in Yangzhou City is 94.64%. Moreover, according to a random pick test, it is encouraging that the proposed method has strong robustness in response to the instability of the acquisition time of SAR images. A relatively high overall accuracy of 90.09% suggested that the proposed method can provide a reliable rice mapping result in cloudy and rainy areas. © 2022 by the authors.","","data fusion; multi-scale image segmentation; operational system; rice mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144863617"

Following recent bridge collapses, including the ""Polcevera Bridge""in Genoa, Italy, the Ministry of Infrastructures and Sustainable Mobility (MIMS) issued in 2020 specific Guidelines on the classification and risk management, safety assessment and monitoring of existing bridges. In this context, the creation of information catalogues for the mapping of structures and the implementation of innovative procedures for monitoring, appear to be a crucial step for public bodies and managing bodies end of assessing the state of the civil structures such as bridges and identifying the priorities maintenance actions. To date, monitoring operations of bridges are typically conducted through visual inspections, coring and punctual measurements carried out by specialized operators and, more rarely, through the use of Non-Destructive Technologies (NDT). On the other hand, in recent years, satellite radar remote sensing techniques have always been applied much more effectively at monitoring infrastructures, civil works, bridges and viaducts. Among the modern techniques, Multi-Temporal Satellite Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) is currently established as a reliable tool for control and monitoring of deformation phenomena of the soil and large-scale infrastructures, capable of returning information with millimetre accuracy. Moreover, the knowledge about structural materials, structural elements and defect state of the bridge collected by onsite inspection, is crucial to verify the stability to actual traffic and dynamic loads, not expected in the design phases. This work reports a methodology useful for evaluating the viaducts and bridges stability at the network-scale level, proposing a multi-level monitoring protocol from the integration of information from different sources and technologies, including ground-based, structural and remote sensing information. The activities are carried out as a part of the ""MLAZIO""project, approved and supported by the Lazio Region. The first phase of this project involves the creation of a vector database for bridges mapping and localization, and the development of an informatic catalogue for the management of works, also including a view of the geo-eGovernment of the infrastructures. Such a system is developed on a platform interoperable in a Geographical Information System (GIS), already prepared for the expected integrations in the later stages of the project, which includes on-site inspections, NDTs ground-based and satellite remote sensing investigations. This project aims to create a reliable and effective methodology for the risk assessment and management of existent bridges. This study paves the way for optimizing the planning procedures of the interventions of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance activities by developing a prototype for the development of a Bridge Management System (BMS) at a regional level, increasing the resilience of the investigated infrastructures and bridges.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.","Bridges; Deformation; Deterioration; Dynamic loads; Information management; Inspection; Interferometry; Mapping; Risk assessment; Risk management; Space-based radar; Structural health monitoring; Synthetic aperture radar; Bridge management system; Bridge monitoring; Ground based; Groundbased investigation; Laser scanner UAV; Laserscanners; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal InSAR; Nondestructive assessment; Remote-sensing; Structural information; Remote sensing","Bridge Managements Systems; Bridge Monitoring; Groundbased investigations; Laser Scanners UAVs; multi-temporal InSAR; Non-destructive assessment; Remote Sensing; Structural information","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142622808"

Etna is one of the world's most active volcanoes and its activity is characterized both by explosive eruptive episodes and by effusive activity. On 24 December 2018 a new lateral eruption of Etna began. The phenomenon was caused by the intrusion of a magmatic dike in the upper eastern flank of the volcano which produced an intense seismic swarm and strong gaseous emissions from the summit craters. In this work Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission were elaborated adopting the Small Baseline Subset technique (SBAS).

Tremendous progress has been achieved in the domain of single-image despeckling. Latest techniques rely on deep neural networks to restore the various structures and textures peculiar to SAR images. The availability of time series of SAR images offers the possibility of improving speckle filtering by combining different speckle realizations over the same area. The supervised training of deep neural networks requires ground-truth speckle-free images. Such images can only be obtained indirectly through some form of averaging, by spatial or temporal integration, and are imperfect. Given the potential of very high-quality restoration reachable by multitemporal speckle filtering, the limitations of ground-truth images need to be circumvented. We extend a recent self-supervised training strategy for single-look complex (SLC) SAR images, called MERLIN, to the case of multitemporal filtering. This requires modeling the sources of statistical dependencies in the spatial and temporal dimensions as well as between the real and imaginary components of the complex amplitudes. Quantitative analysis on datasets with simulated speckle indicates a clear improvement of speckle reduction when additional SAR images are included. Our method is then applied to stacks of TerraSAR-X images and shown to outperform competing multitemporal speckle filtering approaches.

In two examples, the 2018 Hokkaido landslides in Japan and the 2017 Putanpunas landslide in Taiwan, we utilize the Growing Split-Based Approach to obtain Bayesian probability maps for such a performance evaluation. Our result shows that the high-resolution, full-polarimetric data offers superior detection capability for landslides in forest areas, followed by single-polarimetric datasets of high spatial resolutions at various radar wavelengths. The medium-resolution single-polarimetric data have comparable performance if the landslide occupies a large area and occurs on bare surfaces, but the detection capability decays significantly for small landslides in forest areas. Our result also indicates that large local incidence angles may not necessarily hinder landslide detection, while areas of small local incidence angles may coincide with layover zones, making the data unusable for detection. The best area under curve value among all datatypes is 0.77, suggesting that the performance of SAR-based landslide detection is limited. The limitation may result from radar wave’s sensitivity to multiple physical factors, including changes in land cover types, local topography, surface roughness and soil moistures. © 2022 by the authors.

However, a substantial amount of effort and infrastructure is still required for the generation of analysis-ready data (ARD) from the low-level products provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). Here, a flexible Python framework able to generate a range of consistent ARD aligned with the ESA-recommended processing pipeline is detailed. Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are radiometrically calibrated, speckle-filtered and terrain-corrected, and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data resampled in order to harmonise the spatial resolution between the two streams and to allow stacking with multiple scene classification masks. The global coverage and flexibility of the framework allows users to define a specific region of interest (ROI) and time window to create geo-referenced Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, or a combination of both with closest temporal alignment. The framework can be applied to any location and is user-centric and versatile in generating multi-modal and multi-temporal ARD. Finally, the framework handles automatically the inherent challenges in processing Sentinel data, such as boundary regions with missing values within Sentinel-1 and the filtering of Sentinel-2 scenes based on ROI cloud coverage. © 2022 by the authors.

It is of great significance to monitor the real surface deformation of the unstable slopes for the hazard prevention by using the InSAR technology owing to its high precision and frequent revisit. However, the decorrelation effect and atmospheric delay caused by dense vegetation and alpine terrain result in less effective targets to monitor the full deformation of karst landslides. Besides, the derived deformation along one line-of-sight (LOS) direction can result in the misunderstanding of the real kinematics landslide process. In this study, we combine the multi-temporal distributed scatterer InSAR technology (DS-InSAR) and the multi-platform SAR measurements to derive the multi-dimension deformation time series of Zongling landslides. First, both ALOS/PALSAR-2 datasets and Sentinel-1A images from ascending and descending orbits are employed to acquire the deformation along the LOS direction using the DS-InSAR method, where dense effective targets can be achieved, and the deformation patterns can be revealed. Then, the multi-dimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) method is used to retrieve the horizontal and vertical deformation of Zongling landslides, which further improve the temporal sampling of the deformation time series. Finally, the comprehensive analyses of driving factors and failure mode are conducted according to the spatial–temporal deformation characteristics, and field investigation. The results indicate that this technical route can not only retrieve the landslide deformation with high spatial–temporal sampling density, but also provide new insight into the driven effect of natural factors and mining activities on karst landslides. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Landforms; Landslides; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Deformation time-series; Distributed scatterers; Karst landslide; Line of Sight; Lines-of-sight; Multi dimensional; Multi-dimensional deformation; Multi-platform; SAR interferometry; SAR-interferometry; deformation mechanism; hazard management; landslide; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation type; Deformation","Distributed scatterers; Failure mode; Karst landslides; Multi-dimensional deformation; SAR interferometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126804239"

Its application is widespread, especially in emergency situations caused by natural disasters. To address the limitations of existing methods such as susceptibility to noise, manually selecting samples, and time-consuming computation, we propose a change detection method for heterogeneous images based on image transformation using Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM). In our method, a HELM transformation model between heterogeneous images is constructed, which transforms the image features of one image into the feature space of the other one. Consequently, the transformed multi-temporal images could be comparable. Specifically, first, the logarithmic transformation of SAR images is carried out to obtain the same noise distribution model with the optical image. These heterogeneous images are smoothed to reduce the impact of image noise. Then, through image segmentation, the unchanged areas are selected as training samples. And a correction model for training samples is constructed to avoid manual selection of samples and improve the accuracy of image transformation. Subsequently, the corrected training samples are used to train the HELM to obtain the multi-temporal transformation images, which avoids the parameter adjustment of neural networks. Finally, the changes could be extracted by comparing the transformed multi-temporal images. To prove the effectiveness of the method, two sets of heterogeneous images (Google Earth and Sentinel 1 images) are used for experimental validation in this paper. The results show that the kappa coefficients of the method for the two data sets are improved by 6.19% and 8.94%, respectively, compared with the existing methods, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022, Science Press.

Thus, it is vitally important to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence and clarify the coupling of deep groundwater change and land subsidence for land subsidence disasters prevention and control. In this study, we apply the multi-temporal InSAR method to detect the spatiotemporal variations of land deformation in the Handan plain with Sentinel-1A data from 2015 to 2019, and analyze the aquifer system response to hydraulic head changes. Seasonal signals in land deformation and head data are isolated by harmonic function to derive the spatially heterogeneous elastic skeletal storativity. Moreover, according to the one-dimensional head change-delayed land deformation model, we estimate the inelastic skeletal storativity and time constant. The results indicate that: (1) The Handan plain is dominated by land subsidence with the maximum rate of 14 cm·a-1. Comparison between the subsidence and head change suggests that the subsidence is mainly caused by the head drop in aquifers and delayed drainage of water from aquitards. (2) The seasonal fluctuation in head leads to the obviously seasonal deformation, the amplitude of seasonal deformation can reach up to 25 mm, and the peak time ranges from January to March. (3) The values of elastic skeletal storativity range from 1.51×10-3~4.05×10-3 that agree well with those derived from pumping tests, the inelastic skeletal storativity is 3.62×10-2~4.57×10-2 and the time constant is 0.47~0.77 years.

The hazard map produced by the spatiotemporal probability analysis is usually static with false-negative and false-positive errors due to limited data resolution. Here we propose a new method to obtain dynamic landslide hazard maps over the Wushan section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area by introducing the ground deformation measured by the spaceborne Copernicus Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected from 9/30/2016 to 9/13/2017. We first determine the spatial probability of landslide occurrence predicted by the support vector machine algorithm. We also conducted the statistical analysis on the temporal probability of landslide occurrence under various rainfall conditions (0, 0–50, 50–100, and > 100 mm for the antecedent 5-day total). We initialize a preliminary landslide hazard map by combining the spatial and temporal landslide probabilities. Meanwhile, the ground deformation velocities during the representative dry and wet seasons can be extracted from multi-temporal interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR). Thereafter, the landslide hazard map can be finalized by an empirical assessment matrix considering both the preliminary landslide hazard map and deformation velocities. Our results demonstrate that false-negative and false-positive errors in the landslide hazard map can be effectively reduced with the assistance of the deformation information.

Tengiz oilfield was selected as a study area because of its historically reported continuous subsidence and limited up-to-date studies during recent years. The small baseline subset time-series technique was used for the interferometric processing of radar images acquired for the period of 2018–2020. The geospatial and statistical analyses allowed to determine the existing hotspots of the subsidence processes induced by oil extraction in the study area. Ground deformation measurements derived from the Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed satellite missions showed that the Tengiz oilfield continuously subsided during 2018–2020 with the maximum annual vertical displacement velocity around −77.4 mm/y and −71.5 mm/y, respectively. The vertical displacement velocities derived from the Sentinel-1 and the COSMO-SkyMed images showed a good statistical relationship with R2≥0.73 and RMSE ≤3.68 mm. The cumulative vertical displacement derived from both satellites for the most subsiding location also showed a good statistical relationship with R2 equal to 0.97 and RMSE = ± 4.69. The observed relative differences of measurements by both satellites were acceptable to determine the ongoing vertical surface displacement processes in the study area. These studies demonstrated a practical novelty for the petroleum industry in terms of the comparative assessment of surface displacement measurements using time-series of medium-resolution Sentinel-1 and high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed radar images.

Although the SBAS technique can relieve the requirement of the amount of SAR data, dozens of SAR acquisitions could be regarded as the minimum requirement. However, due to the limitation of the imaging capability of the spaceborne SAR system, the amount of available SAR data acquired from only one SAR sensor is often not enough to satisfy the requirement for phase unwrapping based on the Nyquist sampling assumption. Fortunately, there sometimes may be more than one SAR stack, that is, stacks of SAR data acquired from different SAR systems. In this study, we propose a methodology to detect ground deformation by combining multiple SAR images acquired from different satellite systems for MT-InSAR analysis. First, the low-pass deformation is estimated based on time series SAR acquisitions with low spatial resolution and long wavelengths such as ENVISAT ASAR (ASAR). This information is then incorporated into the processing of time series of SAR acquisitions with high spatial resolution and short wavelength, such as TerraSAR-X (TSX). Specifically, the low-pass deformation will be subtracted from each differential interferogram generated from short-wavelength SAR images, and the rest of the MT-InSAR analysis will be based on the double-differentiation interferograms. Then, the residual deformation will be calculated from these double-differentiation interferograms and together with the low-pass deformation forms the full deformation. As the principal component of deformation has already been subtracted, the phase gradient of those double-differentiated interferograms will be smooth enough to facilitate the phase unwrapping. Between January 2009 and September 2010, 14 ASAR images and 11 TSX images acquired from Tianjin, China are selected as the test data. A root means square error (RMSE) of 9.1 mm/year is achieved from 11 TSX images, while a root means square error of 3.7 mm/year is achieved from 14 ASAR images. However, an RMSE of 1.6 mm/year is achieved when integrating 11 TSX images and 14 ASAR images for MT-InSAR analysis. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively detect ground deformation.

However, its multi-temporal and all-weather features are used in maritime applications like rescue, monitoring and vessel transportation supervision. Constant false alarm rate algorithm is use for SAR image target detection in common. It has the simple algorithm structure, but the complex and uneven distribution of ocean clutter types can cause missing detection. In the case of multiple targets, it is easy to appear that the reference unit contains target information, so the amplitude of target signal may be greater than the clutter amplitude, resulting in the estimated threshold is far greater than the real threshold. The constant false alarm rate algorithm cannot obtain the ideal detection effect. In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, object detection algorithms based on deep learning have achieved good results in optical image object detection. SAR images are different from optical images in that the targets in SAR images are mostly small-scale ships with bright spots and lack obvious details. Similar targets such as islands, buildings and so on will form similar ship shapes after electromagnetic wave reflection. Therefore, the application of optical detection models directly to SAR images cannot achieve ideal results. Feature pyramid network adopts top-down layer by layer fusion, so the high-level feature map lacks spatial location information, and the fusion of each level largely loses the semantic information contained in high-level features, while the semantic information of low-level features is insufficient. In order to improve the model detection accuracy and make the model more robust, a SAR image detection model with adaptive weight pyramid and branch strong correlation is proposed in this paper. Method The high-level features extracted by ResNet101 contain rich semantic information, and the underlying features contain rich spatial information. To have a better detection effect of target detection model, the feature map is required to contain semantic information and spatial location information both. Therefore, the featured information needs to be adopted based on a more effective fusion mechanism for fusion. It is necessary to use effective weights to guide the fusion mechanism for to the integration of more effective information. Our adaptive weight pyramid module is demonstrated, which first samples the feature map to make it have the same scale, then stitches concatenation the feature map after each layer of sampling into channel dimensions, adjusts the number of channels by 1 × 1 convolution, and generates the weight in the end through the Softmax function. To get a feature map of the layer, multiply each layer feature by the corresponding weight, and the other layers are analogy. Its fusion removes some redundant information under the weighting of machine learning. Multiple features are extracted through 1 × 1 and 3 × 3 symmetric convolution kernels and 1 × 3 and 3 × 1 asymmetric convolution kernels, following the feature fusion of classification branch and regression branch by the branch correlation module. The feature diagram contains the classification branch information in the regression branch based on the fused classification and regression features. In the detection phase, the candidate boxes are removed related to accurate positioning and low classification confidence, which reduces the detection accuracy of the model greatly. In order to solve this problem, the intersection over union (IoU) detection head is constructed in the regression branch, and IoU it is used for classification branch, thus avoiding the problem of the candidate box with high IoU low classification confidence being suppressed. In order to balance the IoU branch and the classification branch, the constrained balance factor is designed sand can guide the regression branch optimization candidate box better. Result Our model is evaluated on the public remote sensing dataset SSDD (SAR ship detection), which had 1 160 pictures, including 2 456 vessel targets. The dataset is divided dataset into training sets and test sets by a ratio of 7 ∶ 3, and enhanced the learning ability of the model by rotating, flipping, brightness and increasing Gaussian noise. All the experimental environments are based on ubuntu16. 04 LTS operating system, equipped with CPU for lntel (R) Core (TM) i7-7700@ 3. 6 GHz × 8, graphics card for NVIDIA GTX1080Ti memory for 11 GB, running under the Tensorflow framework, through CUDA8. 0 and cuDNN5. 0 accelerated training. Our model learning rate is set to 0. 000 5, the learning rate is attenuated by 1 / 10 per 40 k iterations, and the network is convergent at 80 k iterations completely. The non-maximum suppression threshold is 0. 5 and the predicted probability threshold is 0. 6. The recall rate, accuracy rate, average accuracy, F1 value and detection speed are represented as the evaluation indexes of the model. The model realizes the best detection effect in terms of equilibrium factor takes 0. 4. The final recall rate is increased from 89. 17% to 93. 63%, the accuracy rate is increased from 87. 94% to 95. 08%, the average accuracy is increased from 86. 91% to 90. 53%, F1 value is increased from 88. 55% to 94. 53%, and the detection speed reached 20. 14 frame / s. Conclusion Our experimental results demonstrate that the feature map targets fused by adaptive weight pyramids are more prominent, and the strong correlated branches module enhances the correlation between the classification branch and the regression branch, and improves the candidate box regression ability. Our model has it potential to meet the real-time detection requirement of SAR imaging. © 2022 Journal of Image and Graphics.

This subsidence has caused extensive damage to buildings and other infrastructures. By exploiting 1650 images from 33 ALOS-1 paths during 2007–2011 using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) techniques, we have constructed, for the first time, a deformation map over 500,000 km2 of the 1900-km-long GC, with an RMSE of <10 mm/yr. The GC is generally stable, but numerous land deformation zones have been discovered, including at least 30 subsidence patterns and 14 uplift features. The maximum rate of subsidence measured is about 56 mm/yr at Stratton Ridge Oil Field, Texas. Most of the identified ground instabilities are newly discovered as a result of this study. The land deformation along GC is caused by both regional geological conditions and human activities that have influenced natural surroundings and consequentially exacerbated ground instability. Depressurization of petroleum reservoirs and aquifer compaction related to groundwater withdrawal are the principal impactors on observed subsidence.

Change detection (CD) methods that rely on the exploitation of SAR data are, generally, made of three distinctive steps: (1) pre-processing of the SAR images; (2) comparison of the pairs of SAR images; and (3) the automatic extraction of the “changed areas”, employing proper thresholding algorithms. Within this general framework, the reduction in speckle noise effects, which can be obtained by applying spatial multi-looking operations and ad hoc noise filters, is fundamental for the better detecting and classifying of changed regions. Usually, speckle noise filters are singularly and independently applied to every SAR image without the consideration of their inherent temporal relationships. In particular, most use local (spatial) approaches based on determining and averaging SAR backscattered signals related to neighboring SAR pixels. In this work, conversely, we explore the potential of a joint 3D space-time non-local mean filter (NLMF), which relies on the discrimination of similar features in a block of non-local SAR pixels extracted from the same or different SAR images. The theory behind non-local-mean filters is, first, shortly revised. Then, the developed space-time NLMF is applied to a real test case for the purposes of identifying flooded zones due to the massive inundations that hit the Kerala region, India, during the summer of 2018. To this aim, a set of 18 descending SAR images collected from the European (EU) Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S-1) sensor was exploited. The performance of the developed NLMF has also been assessed. It is worth remarking that the proposed method can be applied for the purposes of analyzing a heterogenous set of natural and/or artificial disastrous conditions. Further, it can also be helpful during the pre-processing stages of the sequences of SAR images for the purposes of CD applications. © 2022 by the author.","Change detection; Floods; Land use; Pixels; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Speckle; 3D spaces; Change detection; Floodings; Land changes; Non-local mean filters; Non-local-mean-filter; Spacetime; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar images; Synthetic aperture radar","change detection (CD); flooding; non-local-mean-filter (NLMF); synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143770717"

For the analysis, the threshold intensity of 13.8 dB is selected as an optimum value for the delineation of the water surface area with an R-value of 0.826. A power-law relationship between the series of water areas and the corresponding river discharge was established for three selected gauging sites and the performances of the developed models were compared with NSE and RMSE indices. A clear relationship is developed for all three-gauge stations out of which one is hindered with hydraulic structure (Indrapuri D/s). The NSE ranges from 0.844 to 0.909 during calibration period, 0.869–0.995 during testing period and 0.617–0.979 during validation period for the three selected gauging stations.

Change detection (CD) technology can quickly identify the change information on the ground and has developed into an important means of disaster monitoring and assessment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the characteristics of periodic observation and wide coverage. Moreover, SAR has the advantages of penetrating, all-day and all-weather observation, which plays an important role in disaster monitoring. Due to the rapid development of satellite sensors, the available CD data has been greatly enriched. This situation provides an opportunity for deep learning change detection (DLCD) techniques. However, SAR data are affected by speckle noise and lack of available labeled samples, it remains challenging to precisely locate the change information with high efficiency. This paper focuses on several commonly used and outstanding networks in the DLCD field to evaluate their performance and develop them to SAR data. In addition, Transfer learning experiments are designed to evaluate the generalization performance of each network for the CD task. The experimental results show that the Siamese CD network encoding multi-temporal data separately has the best ability to detect changes and generalization performance. In addition, adding high quality explicit difference guidance information to the network is more specific for the CD task, which can further improve network performance and refine the boundaries of changed ground objects on change map.  © Copyright: ","Change detection; Deep learning; Disasters; Network coding; Radar imaging; Change detection; Convolutional networks; Detection tasks; Disaster monitoring; Encoder-decoder; Generalisation; Generalization performance; Radar data; Siamese network; Transfer learning; Synthetic aperture radar","Change Detection; Encoder-Decoder; Generalization; SAR; Siamese network; Transfer learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142370792"

Recently, efforts have been made to use Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) for landslide monitoring. However, it is still difficult to effectively and automatically identify slow-moving landslides distributed over a large area due to phase unwrapping errors, decorrelation, troposphere turbulence and computational requirements. In this study, we develop a new approach combining phase-gradient stacking and a deep-learning network based on YOLOv3 to automatically detect slow-moving landslides from large-scale interferograms. Using Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from 2014 to 2020, we developed a burst-based, phase-gradient stacking algorithm to sum up phase gradients in short-temporal-baseline interferograms along the azimuth and range directions. The stacked phase gradients clearly reveal the characteristics of localized surface deformation that is mainly caused by slow-moving landslides and avoids the errors due to phase unwrapping in partially decorrelated areas and atmospheric effects. Then, we trained the improved Attention-YOLOv3 network with stacked phase-gradient maps of manually labeled landslides to achieve quick and automatic detection. We applied our method in an ∼180,000 km2 area of southwestern China and identified 3,366 slow-moving landslides. By comparing the results with optical imagery and previously published landslides in this region, the proposed method can achieve automatic detection over a large area precisely and efficiently. From the derived landslide density map, we determined that most landslides are distributed along the three large rivers and their branches. In addition to some counties with known high-density landslides, approximately 10 more counties with high landslide density were exposed, which should attract more attention to their risks for geohazards. This application demonstrates the potential value of our newly developed method for slow-moving landslide detection over a nation-wide area, which can be employed before applying more time-consuming time-series InSAR analysis.

Finding an accurate and reliable interval for preparing mean deformation rate maps (MDRMs) remains challenging. The primary purpose of this paper is to implement an application consisting of three unsupervised clustering algorithms (UCAs) for determining the best interval from SAR-derived deformation data, which can be used to interpret long-term deformation processes, such as subsidence, and identify displacement patterns. Considering Port Harcourt (in the Niger Delta) as the study area, it was essential to remove the sources of error in extracting deformation signals from SAR data, spatially ionospheric and tropospheric delays, before using UCAs to obtain its characteristics and real deformation data. Moreover, another purpose of this paper is to implement the advanced integration method (AIM) for atmospheric phase screen (APS) correction to enhance deformation signals obtained through different SAR processing approaches, including interferometric SARs (two-pass interferometry, InSAR) and multitemporal interferometry SARs (n-pass interferometry, DInSAR; permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI); and small baseline subset (SBAS)). Two methods were chosen to evaluate and find the best technique with which to create an MDRM: The first one was to compare the signals corrected by the AIM and the vertical component of the GPS station, which showed the AIM providing 58%, 42%, and 28% of the matching with GNSS station outputs for InSAR, PSI, and SBAS, respectively. Secondly, similarity measures and Davies–Bouldin index scores were implemented to find an accurate and reliable interval in which the SBAS technique with the unsupervised K-medians method has been chosen. Based on GNSS vertical deformation in a 500 m radius around the station, the SBAS K-medians technique expressed up to 5.5% better deformation patterns than the map of SAR processing techniques. © 2023 by the authors.","Clustering algorithms; Global positioning system; Signal processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced integrated method; Deformation rates; Integrated method; Integration method; Interferometric SAR; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal interferometry SAR; Phase screen; Small baseline subsets; Unsupervised clustering algorithm; Interferometry","advanced integrated method; interferometric SAR; multitemporal interferometry SAR; unsupervised clustering algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146422444"

For the targets with time series changes, the single-temporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm is difficult to provide correct segmentation results for its target recognition, time series analysis and other applications. For this, a new algorithm for multi-temporal PolSAR image segmentation is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the over-segmentation of single-temporal PolSAR images is carried out by the mean-shift algorithm, and the over-segmentation results of single-temporal PolSAR are combined to get the over-segmentation results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Secondly, the edge detectors are constructed to extract the edge information of single-temporal PolSAR images and fuse them to get the edge fusion results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Then, the similarity measurement matrix is constructed based on the over-segmentation results and edge fusion results of multi-temporal PolSAR images. Finally, the normalized cut criterion is used to complete the segmentation of multi-temporal PolSAR images. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified based on three temporal PolSAR images of Radarsat-2, and compared with the segmentation algorithm of single-temporal PolSAR image. Experimental results revealed the following findings: (1) The proposed algorithm effectively realizes the segmentation of multi-temporal PolSAR images, and achieves ideal segmentation results. Moreover, the segmentation details are excellent, and the region consistency is good. The objects which can't be distinguished by the single-temporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm can be segmented. (2) The segmentation accuracy of the proposed multi-temporal algorithm is up to 86.5%, which is significantly higher than that of the singletemporal PolSAR image segmentation algorithm. In general, the segmentation result of proposed algorithm is closer to the optimal segmentation. The optimal segmentation of farmland parcel objects to meet the needs of agricultural production is realized. This lays a good foundation for the further interpretation of multi-temporal PolSAR image. © 2022 PeerJ Inc..

To quantitatively explore the extent and causes of land subsidence in Wuhan, we performed multitemporal interferometry (MTI) analysis using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the TerraSAR-X satellite from 2013 to 2017 and the Sentinel-1A satellite from 2015 to 2017. MTI results reveal four major subsidence zones in Wuhan, namely, Hankou (exceeding −6 cm/yr), Xudong-Qingshan (−3 cm/yr), Baishazhou-Jiangdi (−3 cm/yr), and Jianshe-Yangluo (−2 cm/yr). Accuracy assessment using 106 levelling benchmarks and cross-validation between the two InSAR-based results indicate an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.5 and 3.1 mm/yr, respectively. Geophysical and geological analyses suggest that among the four major subsiding zones, Hankou, Xudong-Qingshan, and Jianshe-Yangluo are located in non-karstic soft soil areas, where shallow groundwater (< 30 m) declines driven by engineering dewatering and industrial water depletion contribute directly to soft soil compaction. Subsidence in the Baishazhou-Jiangdi zone develops in the karst terrain with abundant underground caves and fissures, which are major natural factors for gradual subsidence and karst collapse. Spatial variation analysis of the geological conditions indicates that the stage of karst development plays the most important role in influencing kart subsidence, followed by municipal construction, proximity to major rivers, and overlying soil structure.

Mapping flood-prone areas is an important part of flood disaster management. In this study, a flood susceptibility mapping framework was developed based on a novel integration of nature-inspired algorithms into support vector regression (SVR). To this end, various remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) datasets were applied to the hybridized SVR models to map flood susceptibility in Ahwaz township, Iran. The proposed framework has two main steps: 1) updating the flood inventory (historical flooded locations) using the proposed RS-based flood detection method developed within the google earth engine (GEE) platform. The mosaicked images of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been used in this step; 2) producing flood susceptibility map using the standalone SVR and hybridized model of SVR. The hybridized methods were derived from a novel integration of SVR with meta-heuristic algorithms, hence forming the SVR-bat algorithm (SVR-BA), SVR-invasive weed optimization (SVR-IWO), and SVR-firefly algorithm (SVR-FA). A spatial database of flood locations and 11 conditioning factors (altitude, slope angle, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to stream, curvature, rainfall, soil type, and land use/cover) were built for the susceptibility modelling. The accuracy of the proposed model was evaluated using the statistical and sensitivity indices, such as root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUROC) index. The results indicated that all hybridized models outperformed the standalone SVR. According to AUROC values, the predictive power of the SVR-FA was the highest with the value of 0.81, followed by SVR-IWO, SVR-BA, and SVR with values of 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively. © 2023 The Authors","Ahwaz; Iran; Khuzestan; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Integration; Land use; Mapping; Mean square error; Optimization; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Flood prone area; Flood susceptibility mapping; Multi-temporal; Natural hazard; Nature inspired algorithms; Remote-sensing; Support vector regression; Support vector regressions; Susceptibility mapping; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; algorithm; flood; mapping method; NDVI; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; Floods","Flood susceptibility mapping; Nature-inspired algorithms; Remote sensing; SAR imagery; Support vector regression (SVR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146728701"

To address this situation, this paper considered Wen County, Henan Province, Central China as the research area and fused multi-source features such as backscatter coefficient, vegetation index, and time series based on Sentinel-1 and -2 data to identify crops. Through comparative experiments, this paper studied the feasibility of identifying crops with multi-temporal data and fused data. The results showed that the accuracy of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data increased by 9.2% compared with single-temporal Sentinel-2 data, and the accuracy of multi-temporal fusion data improved by 17.1% and 2.9%, respectively, compared with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Multi-temporal data well-characterizes the phenological stages of crop growth, thereby improving the classification accuracy. The fusion of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data and Sentinel-2 optical data provide sufficient time-series data for crop identification.

Almost all major dams around the world were built for the generation of hydropower. InSAR can enhance dam safety by providing timely settlement measurements at high spatial-resolution. This paper provides a holistic view of different InSAR deformation monitoring techniques such as Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR), Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar (GBInSAR), Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR), Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MTInSAR), Quasi-Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (QPSInSAR) and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS). PSInSAR, GBInSAR, MTInSAR, and DInSAR techniques were quite commonly used for deformation studies. These studies demonstrate the advantage of InSAR-based techniques over other conventional methods, which are laborious, costly, and sometimes unachievable. InSAR technology is also favoured for its capability to provide monitoring data at all times of day or night, in all-weather conditions, and particularly for wide areas with mm-scale precision. However, the method also has some disadvantages, such as the maximum deformation rate that can be monitored, and the location for monitoring cannot be dictated. Through this review, we aim to popularize InSAR technology to monitor the deformation of dams, which can also be used as an early warning method to prevent any unprecedented catastrophe. This study also discusses some case studies from southern India to demonstrate the capabilities of InSAR to indirectly monitor dam health. © 2022 Sinopec Petroleum Exploration and Production Research Institute","India; Dams; Disaster prevention; Hydroelectric power; Interferometry; Monitoring; Petroleum prospecting; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Dam safety; Deformation monitoring; Hydroelectric power projects; Hydropower projects; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Microwave remote sensing; Multi-temporal; Persistent scatterers; Radar technology; Remote sensing techniques; dam; deformation; hydroelectric power; monitoring system; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; Deformation","Dam; Deformation; InSAR; Microwave; RADAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131190270"

This consideration to an even greater extent concerns the nuclear power plants. One of the major threats during their normal operation for this infrastructural objects are the ground motions that could occur, because of several reasons such as seismic activities, geological instabilities to name a few. In this paper proposed is the surface deformations in the area of the nuclear power plant (NPP) Kozloduy to be analyzed using a time series of remotely sensed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 mission of ESA. It should be noted that this is the only way to obtain reliable information about the motions at regular intervals since the zone has restricted access. The justification for carrying out this study is twofold - first the mentioned radar instrument was purposely built for study those phenomena at large scales (regional or country level) and second the provision of the data and the software for their processing are obtained free of charge from the ESA repositories. It also should be underlined that the improved spatial resolution of the sensor compared with similar ones (e.g. ERS-1/2, Envisat) and the short revisiting time (6/12 days) allow production of information with better quality compared to the results obtained up to this moment using remotely sensed data only. In this research the short baseline subsets (SBAS) approach was adopted using the DInSAR technique as main processing method. As final result produced were interferometric maps that reveal the overall ground stability of the studied region and especially for the area surrounding the researched object. Those maps can serve the needs of the competent local authorities as well as to the plant operator in order to increase the safety of the population living in the area.

By synthesizing domestic and foreign literature and related reports, it sorts out the fields of remote sensing data precision processing, remote sensing data spatio-temporal processing and analysis, remote sensing object classification and identification, remote sensing data association mining, remote sensing open source datasets and sharing platforms. Firstly, for the task of precise processing of remote sensing data, the purpose is to image process and calibrate the spectral reflection or radar scattering data obtained by the sensor, and restore them to image products accurately related to some information dimensions of ground objects. This paper reviews the research progress of refined processing from two aspects: the improvement of imaging quality of remote sensing data such as optics and SAR(synthetic aperture radar) and the reconstruction of low-quality images. The research progress of quantitative improvement is analyzed from two aspects: local feature matching and regional feature matching of remote sensing images. The exploration of existing technologies verifies the feasibility of high-precision remote sensing data processing through artificial intelligence technology. Secondly, for the task of spatio-temporal processing and analysis of remote sensing data, through the comprehensive analysis of multi temporal images, compared with single temporal remote sensing images, it can further show the dynamic changes of the earth's surface and reveal the evolution law of ground objects. For remote sensing applications of multi temporal images, such as monitoring of forest degradation, crop growth, urban expansion and wetland loss, the lack of data caused by clouds and their shadows will prolong the time interval of image acquisition, cause the problem of irregular time interval, and increase the difficulty of subsequent time series processing and analysis. This paper reviews its research progress from two aspects: remote sensing image time series restoration and multi-source remote sensing temporal and spatial fusion. Thirdly, for the task of remote sensing object classification and recognition, most of the existing processing and analysis methods do not make full use of the powerful autonomous learning ability of computers, rely on limited information acquisition and calculation methods, and are difficult to meet the performance requirements such as accuracy and false alarm rate. This paper reviews the research progress of typical feature element extraction and multi element parallel extraction. The existing technology explores how to combine artificial intelligence methods on the basis of traditional artificial mathematical analysis methods to quantitatively describe and analyze target models and mechanisms in remote sensing data to improve target interpretation accuracy. Finally, for the task of remote sensing data association mining, the research progress is reviewed from two aspects: data organization association and professional knowledge graph construction. It shows that there are still some problems in the field of remote sensing data, such as scattered application, difficult to form a knowledge graph and realize knowledge accumulation, updating and optimization. Based on massive multi-source heterogeneous remote sensing data, realizing the rapid association, organization and analysis of multi-dimensional information in time and space is an important direction in the future. In addition, facing the development needs of big intelligence analysis technology, this paper also reviews the research progress of remote sensing open source data set and sharing platform. On this basis, the research situation of intelligent analysis and interpretation of remote sensing data is combed and summarized, and the future development trend and prospect of this field are given. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

Although existing studies have extended from bi-temporal data pair to multi-temporal datasets to derive more plentiful information, there are still two problems to be solved in practical applications. First, change indicators constructed from incoherent feature only cannot characterize the change objects accurately. Second, the results of pixel-level methods are usually presented in the form of the noisy binary map, making the spatial change not intuitive and the temporal change of a single pixel meaningless. In this study, we propose an unsupervised man-made objects change detection framework using both coherent and incoherent features derived from multi-temporal SAR images. The coefficients of variation in time-series incoherent features and the man-made object index (MOI) defined with coherent features are first combined to identify the initial change pixels. Afterwards, an improved spatiotemporal clustering algorithm is developed based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and dynamic time warping (DTW), which can transform the initial results into noiseless object-level patches, and take the cluster center as a representative of the man-made object to determine the change pattern of each patch. An experiment with a stack of 10 TerraSAR-X images in Stripmap mode demonstrated that this method is effective in urban scenes and has the potential applicability to wide area change detection.  © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.","Clustering algorithms; Feature extraction; Object detection; Pixels; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Change detection; Clusterings; Coherent and incoherent feature; Imaging mechanism; Man made objects; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar  data; Radar data; Synthetic aperture radar images; Unsupervised change detection; Change detection","change detection; clustering; coherent and incoherent features; multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138477037"

Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i.e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots - California, USA and Rondônia, Brazil – for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74–0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59–0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38–0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondônia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Brazil; California; Rondonia; United States; Computer vision; Deep learning; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Harvesting; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; California; Clear cuts; Cloud cover; Forest harvesting; Landscape pattern; Salvage logging; Sentinel-1; Smart forest management; Transfer learning; Tropical deforestation; cloud cover; deforestation; dry season; environmental disturbance; machine learning; mapping method; radar imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; timber harvesting; time series analysis; Mapping","Clear-cuts; Computer vision; Smart forest management; Transfer learning; Tropical deforestation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120712847"

Accurately identifying its amplitude and time characteristics is important for climate, hydrology, and ecology research in permafrost regions. We used Sentinel-1 SAR data and small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-In-SAR) technology to obtain the characteristics of F-T cycles in the Zonag Lake-Yanhu Lake perma-frost-affected endorheic basin on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2017 to 2019. The results show that the seasonal deformation amplitude (SDA) in the study area mainly ranges from 0 to 60 mm, with an average value of 19 mm. The date of maximum frost heave (MFH) occurred between November 27th and March 21st of the following year, averaged in date of the year (DOY) 37. The maximum thaw settlement (MTS) occurred between July 25th and September 21st, averaged in DOY 225. The thawing duration is the thawing process lasting about 193 days. The spatial distribution differences in SDA, the date of MFH, and the date of MTS are relatively significant, but there is no apparent spatial difference in thawing duration. Although the SDA in the study area is mainly affected by the thermal state of permafrost, it still has the most apparent relationship with vegetation cover, the soil water content in AL, and active layer thickness. SDA has an apparent negative and positive correlation with the date of MFH and the date of MTS. In addition, due to the influence of soil texture and seasonal rivers, the seasonal deformation characteristics of the alluvial-diluvial area are different from those of the surrounding areas. This study provides a method for analyzing the F-T cycle of the AL using multi-temporal InSAR technology. © 2022 by the authors.

Motivated by the recent success of temporal attention-based methods across multiple crop mapping tasks, we propose to investigate how these models can be adapted to operate on several modalities. We implement and evaluate multiple fusion schemes, including a novel approach and simple adjustments to the training procedure, significantly improving performance and efficiency with little added complexity. We show that most fusion schemes have advantages and drawbacks, making them relevant for specific settings. We then evaluate the benefit of multimodality across several tasks: parcel classification, pixel-based segmentation, and panoptic parcel segmentation. We show that by leveraging both optical and radar time series, multimodal temporal attention-based models can outmatch single-modality models in terms of performance and resilience to cloud cover. To conduct these experiments, we augment the PASTIS dataset (Garnot and Landrieu, 2021a) with spatially aligned radar image time series.

Snow measurement using remote sensing data gradually has become mainstream with the continuous development of remote sensing technology. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the capability of all-day, all-weather ground observation, and combines high spatial resolution, interferometry, and polarization imaging. C-band SAR images are more sensitive to snow characteristics and are an effective data source for obtaining the spatial distribution of snow in areas with complex terrain. In recent years, the methods of using machine learning and deep learning to invert snow parameters such as snow depth and snow water equivalent have been widely used. In this paper, the study area is the farmland area of Northeast China. The relationship between snow depth and snow parameters is analyzed by a deep learning algorithm and machine learning algorithm using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data, measured snow depth data, and so on. The inversion model based on the type of farmland subsurface is established to invert the snow depth in the farmland area of northeast China and output the map. The aim is to generate surface-based snow depth inversion results with less error and higher accuracy. The average MAE of the model is 2.06cm, RMSE is 2.96 cm, R2 is 0.72, the maximum absolute error is 10.206 cm, and the minimum absolute error is 0.045cm for the farmland mixed group feature screening dataset. © 2022 SPIE.","Deep learning; Errors; Farms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Agricultural areas; C-bands; Deep learning; Essential elements; Multi-temporal; Northeast China; Sentinel-1; Snow depth inversion; Snow depths; Surface climate; Synthetic aperture radar","Deep learning; SAR; Sentinel-1; Snow depth inversion","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141886939"

In fact, due to the increase and decrease of backscattering coefficients, the changed regions can be further analyzed as two kinds of changes, which is termed as ternary change detection. In this paper, a change detection method based on evolutionary multiobjective optimization is proposed to automatically perform binary and ternary change detection of multitemporal SAR images. First, the log-likelihood function of the Gaussian mixture model and the Bhattacharyya distance are designed as two objectives, respectively. In particular, a novel measurement method based on Bhattacharyya distance is designed for the ternary change detection task. Not only the separability between each two classes is maximized, but also the Bhattacharyya distance between two changed classes and unchanged class is kept closer to obtain a more balanced classification performance. Then a multiobjective optimization method based on non-dominated sorting is used to optimize these two objectives simultaneously. In the proposed approach, chromosome ranking and perturbation probability selection operators are designed to make high-quality solutions with a high probability of being exploited and improve the performance of the algorithm. In addition, a one-step local search strategy based on the expectation–maximization method is integrated into the proposed algorithm to accelerate the convergence.

Although the crop growth models provide accurate yield forecasting, these models are difficult to implement in developing countries like India due to inhomogeneous or/and lack of required information about crop, soil, weather, etc. On the contrary, remotely sensed imagery available homogeneously provides valuable inputs for this purpose. Particularly, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data proved to have great potential for paddy growth monitoring and biophysical parameters retrieval over optical data. Moreover, the effective use of artificial neural network (ANN) may enable us to understand the complex relation between parameters as well as improve the forecasting performance than using empirical-/semiempirical-based approaches. Thus, the study aims to analyze multi-temporal dual-polarization C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data for paddy yield forecasting using ANN model. In this study, smart sampling based on the normalized difference vegetation (NDVI) and normalized difference water index has been considered to obtain in situ yield measurements in the study area. The peak stage signature of backscattering coefficients is considered to estimate yield due to the maximum possibility of signal to interact with crop cover characteristics. It is observed that the VH-polarization-based ANN model provides better accuracy with coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.72 and 600.11 kg/ha, respectively, in comparison with VV polarization which has shown 0.26 and 948.46 kg/ha, respectively. Overall, the study demonstrates that the effective use of ANN model may provide reliable yield estimation accuracy from remotely sensed imagery alone. © 2022, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","artificial neural network; crop yield; forecasting method; paddy field; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar","ANN; Crop yield; Paddy; Remote sensing; SAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124095189"

The airborne array InSAR system is able to acquire a stack of multi-baseline SAR images in a single acquisition, which significantly improves the 3D modeling capability. However, processing the images obtained by the low-altitude platform using the conventional model will lead to geometric approximation (GA) errors, such as flattened phase error and reference error, which degrade the precision of the 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the error sources of the array-InSAR interferograms and design a hybrid 3D phase unwrapping approach for 3D reconstruction. A hypothesis test is developed to identify the phase ambiguity by comparing the initial solution of the least-square with that of the beam-forming. Three indicators are proposed to identify the reliable arcs, achieving a reliable phase unwrapping. The L1 norm approach is adopted to detect the unwrapping errors during the spatial unwrapping and a two-tie network strategy is used to process the data in the individual blocks from the perspective of global optimization. Furthermore, an iterative scheme is recommended to compensate the geometric approximation errors. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is the compensation of the GA error and reliable phase unwrapping. The experimental results by both simulated and real SAR data show that the proposed algorithm can eliminate the GA error and provide a viable solution to rapid 3D SAR imaging with an airborne platform. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This study is based on new geological and geomorphological field investigations, on a new reading of the existing borehole data and new data collected by multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The results obtained reveal that only the areas bordering the Cavallerizzo village are affected by active landslides, whereas, in the historical centre, geomorphological evidence for an active landslide capable of involving the entire settlement is not found. Nowadays, 17 years after the 2005 landslide event, more than 85% of the Cavallerizzo village is completely intact, lacking evidence of instability or important damage to ancient buildings. Furthermore, in the historical urban area, very low ground displacements by InSAR investigation are observed, highlighting that the instability conditions of Cavallerizzo are less severe than those recognised in nearby villages. This evidence along with the strong negative economic and socio-cultural impacts that the village settlement had on the community involved led to the reconsideration of the adequacy of the relocation ordinance issued by the National Civil Protection.

The permafrost on the QTP faces a risk of widespread degradation due to climate change and ecosystem disturbances; thus, monitoring its changes is critical. In this study, we conducted a permafrost surface deformation prediction over the Tuotuo River tributary watershed in the southwestern part of the QTP using the Long Short-Term Memory model (LSTM). The LSTM model was applied to the deformation information derived from a time series of Multi-Temporal Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR). First, we designed a quadtree segmentation-based Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) to monitor the seasonal permafrost deformation from March 2017 to April 2022. Then, the types of frozen soil were classified using the spatio-temporal deformation information and the temperature at the top of the permafrost. Finally, the time-series deformation trends of different types of permafrost were predicted using the LSTM model. The results showed that the deformation rates in the Tuotuo River Basin ranged between −80 to 60 mm/yr. Permafrost, seasonally frozen ground, and potentially degraded permafrost covered 7572.23, 900.87, and 921.70 km2, respectively. The LSTM model achieved high precision for frozen soil deformation prediction at the point scale, with a root mean square error of 4.457 mm and mean absolute error of 3.421 mm.

For the small deformation gradient represented by the permanent GNSS station (4 cm/year), all SBAS techniques appeared to be more accurate than DInSAR, which corresponds to higher redundancy and better removal of the atmospheric signal. In contrast, DInSAR results allowed to capture information about two subsidence basins, which was not possible with SBAS and PSI approaches. © 2023 The Author(s).

The timely and accurate understanding of the distribution of rice can provide an important scientific basis for food security, agricultural policy formulation, and regional development planning. As an active remote sensing system, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has the advantage of working both day and night and in all weather conditions and hence plays an important role in rice growing area identification. This paper focuses on the topic of rice planting area identification using multi-temporal PolSAR images and a deep learning method. A rice planting area identification attention U-Net (RIAU-Net) model is proposed, which is trained by multi-temporal Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric images acquired in different periods of rice growth. In addition, considering the diversity of the rice growth period in different years caused by the different climatic conditions and other factors, a transfer mechanism is investigated to apply the well-trained model to monitor the rice planting areas in different years. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the classification accuracy, with 11–14% F1-score improvement compared with the traditional methods and a pleasing generalization ability in different years. Moreover, the classified rice planting regions are continuous.

Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to detect landslides, often within days of a triggering event, because it penetrates clouds, operates day and night, and is regularly acquired worldwide. Here we present a SAR backscatter change approach in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) that uses multi-temporal stacks of freely available data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites to generate landslide density heatmaps for rapid detection. We test our GEE-based approach on multiple recent rainfall- and earthquake-triggered landslide events. Our ability to detect surface change from landslides generally improves with the total number of SAR images acquired before and after a landslide event, by combining data from both ascending and descending satellite acquisition geometries and applying topographic masks to remove flat areas unlikely to experience landslides. Importantly, our GEE approach does not require downloading a large volume of data to a local system or specialized processing software, which allows the broader hazard and landslide community to utilize and advance these state-of-the-art remote sensing data for improved situational awareness of landslide hazards. © 2022 Alexander L.

The Earth surface above it experienced subsidence over the past six decades because of gas extraction activities. To accurately reveal this surface movement with satellite SAR data, our study first proposes and demonstrates a model-backfeed (MBF) InSAR deformation estimation method to improve InSAR deformation time series modeling. This method allowed us to include a priori knowledge and to iteratively optimize functional and stochastic models. Using this method and employing a spatio-temporal SAR data integration method based upon Monte Carlo and Multiple Hypothesis Testing methods, we retrieved the 20-year subsidence history of the Groningen gas field by integrating 32 ERS-1/2, 68 Envisat and 82 Radarsat-2 SAR images. The results show that the maximum cumulative surface subsidence in this gas field has been as much as 15.5cm between 1995 and 2015. In terms of precision and accuracy, our MBF method offered a better result than the standard Multi-Temporal InSAR analysis method: the Ensemble Coherence increased by 10%–19% and Spatio-Temporal Consistency decreased by 2%–20%. In terms of accuracy, our results better concur with the external GNSS reference observations. We further show that the spatio-temporal SAR data integration method has better links with multi-platform SAR data if the uncertainties of the InSAR geolocation and temporal deformation are included. The study demonstrates that the MBF method optimized the estimation of deformation parameters and mitigated unwrapping errors. © 2022 The Authors","deformation; estimation method; gas field; Monte Carlo analysis; natural gas; synthetic aperture radar; uncertainty analysis","Geolocation uncertainty; Model-backfeed InSAR deformation estimation; Monte Carlo methods; Multi-platform SAR data integration; Multiple Hypothesis Testing","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133293710"

The method is based on the correlation assessment between forest undergrowth biomass and the radar backscattering in L-band as well as the analysis of long-term series of vegetation indices during the presence of snow cover. Data from synthetic aperture radars (SAR) ALOS-1, -2/PALSAR-1, -2, as well as 32-day composites of vegetation indices NDVI and EVI, obtained with the help of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform from multispectral optical images of Landsat-5, -7, -8 satellites were used for the research. Two areas of afforestation were considered for comparative assessment near Lake Baikal, the change of which was tracked using multi-temporal high-resolution data from the Google Earth service. A continuous increase of the radar backscattering from forest young growth for 14–15 years has been shown as a result of the conducted investigations. During this time period the total biomass of undergrowth (trunks and branches) reaches values at which further growth of trees does not affect the level of the radar backscattering, i.e. the «saturation» effect occurs. It is established that in the initial period of growth of young trees, the temporal dynamics of the backscattering intensity on crosspolarization can be described by a linear dependence (the coefficient of determination is greater than 0.9). A certain agreement was found between the dynamics of the EVI index and the radar backscattering intensity for one of the test sites, which is characterized by earlier and uniform afforestation. It is concluded that the proposed approach allows identifying the period of intense growth of forest undergrowth and can be used as a basis for forest classification in determining carbon sequestration. © 2022 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

It is of great significance to monitor the ground object types in the Yellow River Delta wetlands. The classification accuracy based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscattering coefficient is limited by the small difference between some ground objects. To solve this problem, a decision tree classification method for extracting the ground object types in wetland combined time series SAR backscattering and coherence characteristics was proposed. The Yellow River Delta was taken as the study area and the 112 Sentinel-1A GRD data with VV/VH dual-polarization and 64 Sentinel-1A SLC data with VH polarization were used. The decision tree method was established, based on the annual mean VH and VV backscattering characteristics, the new constructed radar backscattering indices, and the annual mean VH coherence characteristics were suitable for extracting the wetlands in the Yellow River Delta. Then the classification results in the Yellow River Delta wetlands from 2018 to 2021 were obtained using the new method proposed in this paper. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed method w5ere 89.504% and 0.860, which were 9.992% and 0.127 higher than multi-temporal classification by Support Vector Machine classifier. Compared with the decision tree without coherence, the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were improved by 8.854% and 0.108. The spatial distributions of wetland types in the Yellow River Delta from 2018 to 2021 were obtained using the constructed decision tree. The spatio-temporal evolution analysis was conducted. The results showed that the area of S. alterniflora decreased significantly in 2020 but it increased to the area of 2018 in 2021. In addition, S. alterniflora seriously affected the living space of Phragmites australis (P. australis) and in 4 years, 10.485 km2 living space of P. australis was occupied by S. alterniflora. The proposed method can provide a theoretical basis for higher accuracy SAR wetland classification and the monitoring results can provide an effective reference for local wetland protection.

The methodology mapped the maximum flood extent of over 25,000 detected water bodies across Ireland over a five-year period (2016–2021). Flood extents were classified using a semi-automatic tile-based histogram thresholding approach and refined using a series of post processing filters. These included multi-temporal filters which exploited the timing and orbit position of the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify likely false positives, and contextual information based filters which used external information such as topography and land use to estimate the likelihood of flooding and constrain its extent. A topographic correction algorithm was also applied to hydrologically-correct flood bodies. The methodology produced a user accuracy of above 0.95 for each annual map when compared to observed flood level data, overall accuracy values above 0.97 and kp values above 0.7 when compared to mapping process based on Sentinel-2 validation imagery, and the capacity to detect over 90% of recorded permanent water bodies larger than 2 ha. As an additional step, confidence information was provided for each flood polygon based on the quantity of consistently flooded pixels used in its definition. The mapping process represents a stable and systematic nonurban flood mapping methodology that enables inter-annual comparison of flood extent at gauged and ungauged sites. © 2022","Ireland; Land use; Mapping; Orbits; Topography; Automated approach; Flood mapping; Ireland; Mapping process; Multi-temporal; Republic of Ireland; SAR data; Sentinel-1; Topographic correction; Waterbodies; algorithm; correction; flood; flooding; mapping method; methodology; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Floods","Flood mapping; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-1; Topographic correction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138472955"

Numerical weather models have been proposed as an alternative technique to mitigate tropospheric delays in InSAR and have become a standard procedure for some multi-Temporal InSAR processing workflows. This study evaluates the viability of three numerical weather models for mitigating tropospheric delay in InSAR for a tropical region. We assess their performance in correcting tropospheric delay in Sentinel-1 interferograms at different spatial wavelengths using variograms. Their performance is validated using GNSS tropospheric delay and our proposed SAR-derived tropospheric delay estimates. The results indicate that numerical weather model estimates do not mitigate short-wavelength turbulent delays, but can mitigate long-wavelength stratified delays to some extent, which may also introduce additional errors in interferograms. At a spatial wavelength of 40 km, 36% of the interferograms showed increased spatial autocorrelation after correction with GACOS, 55% with ERA-5, and 51% with MERRA-2. In contrast the InSAR-derived tropospheric delays resulted in a significant reduction in variance at all wavelengths indicating the ability to mitigate both turbulent and stratified delays. Our study demonstrates the limited potential of numerical weather model estimates to satisfactorily mitigate trophospheric noise in InSAR and the capability of InSAR-derived trophospheric delay to significantly correct tropospheric noise in InSAR.  © Authors 2022.","Numerical models; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Troposphere; InSAR; Interferograms; Model estimates; Numerical weather modelling; Performance; Sentinel-1; Spatial wavelengths; Tropical regions; Tropospheric delays; Weather products; Interferometry","InSAR; Numerical weather models; Sentinel-1; Tropospheric delay","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132010862"

By the natural environmental and human activity factors, migration and accumulation of the salt and crystallization process alternated with dissolving, which makes saline soil with significant seasonal differences appear in the deformation and regional scattering characteristic. These phenomena raise the limitation of conventional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique and consequently high-precision deformation monitoring of strong saline soil subgrade and pavement. To overcome the limitations, this study aimed to propose an advanced MT-InSAR method, which considers the seasonal interferometric coherences caused by precipitation and the temporal physical deformation evolution of the subgrade and pavement over strong saline soil. To present the better performance of the advanced method, a segment of the Qarhan–Golmud Expressway (QGE), which is the first expressway built in the strong saline soil area in China, was selected for this study. Two sets of SAR images acquired from January 2018 to January 2022 from Sentinel-1A ascending and descending orbits over the QGE were utilized, 774 and 928 seasonal filtered interferograms are optimized for deformation monitoring based on the deformation Poisson curve (PC) model. Compared with the method in the previous studies, the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the monitoring results increased dramatically. Subsequently, further discussions are conducted in detail on the regularity of expressway deformation over strong saline soil, especially from physical and chemical perspectives. Findings show that the ratio between Cl− and SO42- determines the deformation distribution and morphology. Also, the precipitation and temperature affect the seasonal characteristics. The contributions of this investigation might provide technical references for related expressway management and policy-making departments to ensure the long-term safe operation and stability of the QGE.

The TOPS data have a frame width of 250 km and have been widely used in surface deformation monitoring. However, traditional Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) methods require large computer memory and time when processing full resolution data with large width and long strips. In addition, they hardly correct atmospheric delays and orbital errors accurately over a large area. In order to solve these problems, this study proposes a data partition strategy based on MT-InSAR methods. We first process the partitioned images over a large area by traditional MT-InSAR method, then stitch the deformation results into a complete deformation result by correcting the offsets of adjacent partitioned images. This strategy is validated in a flat urban area (Changzhou City in Jiangsu province, China), and a mountainous region (Qijiang in Chongqing City, China). Compared with traditional MT-InSAR methods, the precision of the results obtained by the new strategy is improved by about 5% for Changzhou city and about 15% for Qijiang because of its advantage in atmospheric delay correction. Furthermore, the proposed strategy needs much less memory and time than traditional methods. The total time needed by the traditional method is about 20 h, and by the proposed method, is about 8.7 h, when the number of parallel processing is 5 in the Changzhou city case. The time will be further reduced when the number of parallel processes increases. © 2022 by the authors.","Deformation; Orbits; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Block adjustment; Changzhou; Data partition; Ground deformation monitoring; Image partition; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Scan data; Sentinel-1a/B; Data handling","block adjustment; ground deformation monitoring; image partition; MT-InSAR; Sentinel-1A/B","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138721690"

They destroyed many coal resources and triggered various environmental problems. The identification and state assessment of coal fire areas are paramount to coal fire management. In this paper, a method for identifying coal fires by integrating land surface temperatures (LSTs) from multitemporal thermal infrared remote sensing and subsidence information from multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) is proposed. The method primarily consists of estimating the LSTs and subsidence values, normalizing and equidistantly partitioning the LSTs, estimating the thermal anomaly frequency (TAF), extracting high-subsidence areas, determining the thermal anomaly frequency threshold (TAFT), and identifying coal fire areas according to the TAFT. The coal fire ratio index (CRI) was developed to quantitatively evaluate the severity of coal fires and its variations. Midong District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, was selected as the study area. Forty-five Landsat 8 images and sixty-one Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to retrieve LST and subsidence time series, respectively. The proposed method and CRI were applied to identify and evaluate coal fires in the study area. The results demonstrate the satisfactory reliability of these methods compared with field surveys. The maximum CRI was 6.145 × 10-4 (July 28, 2019), and the minimum CRI was 2.685 × 10-5 (January 13, 2020). Coal fires in summer were more severe than those in winter. The CRI profile presented seasonal and annual periodicities and was affected by the local climate. The soil cohesion and humidity are higher in winter due to possible snowmelt, which weakens the interaction between oxygen and coal seams and the subsequent combustion of coal. The LST, thermal anomaly, and deformation information were combined in a time series overlay analysis to reveal the differences in the LSTs and subsidence values among mining areas, coal fire areas, and areas with both mining and coal fires. The results verify the applicability and reliability of the proposed method. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Through cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), SAR imagery can be used in near-real time for rapid flood mapping. This has facilitated the disaster response community to make informed decisions in flood hazard interventions and management plans. However, rapid urban flood mapping using SAR is challenging, due to the complex land cover configuration in urban environments, coupled with complicated backscattering mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel method to utilise SAR imagery and land use-land cover (LULC) products for rapid urban flood mapping. Our approach uses a Land Cover Product to segment the study area into LULC types and differentiate each type with respect to whether double bounce is expected to occur during the flooding events. The normalised difference index was derived using a multi-temporal SAR image stack, and the threshold segmentation method was adopted for flood mapping. In addition, DEM and Surface Water datasets were employed to refine the flood extraction results using a morphological correction approach. We assessed the method quantitatively using two use cases: the 2017 Houston and 2022 Coraki flood events. Based on fine spatial resolution optical imagery, the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 92.7% for the August 2017 Houston flood mapping task and 89% for the March 2022 Coraki flood mapping task, which not only represents at least 13% in accuracy compared to non-LCP based flood extraction method, but also provides strong capability for rapid flood mapping in urban settings.

The proposed method allows to take into account the correlation structure between subbands by modeling the wavelet coefficients through multivariate probability distributions. Two types of correlation are investigated: inter-scale dependence and inter-orientation dependence. The multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to model the interdependencies between wavelet coefficients at different orientations and scales. Kullback-Leibler similarity measures are computed and used to generate the change map. We show that the information residing in the correlation between subbands improve the accuracy of the change map and lead to better performance. © 2022 European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO.

Therefore, it is essential to propose a method for monitoring the distribution of rice yield. Radar remote sensing data sources provide a sustainable solution for rice monitoring challenges in the countries located in the tropical monsoon region like Vietnam. The SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data from the Sentinel-1 satellite provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) is free of charge, has a large coverage and high spatial-temporal resolution. In this paper, rice growing areas in the An Giang province of Vietnam Mekong Delta were analyzed, which demonstrates the potential applications of multi-temporal data and proposes a method to estimate rice yield for agricultural management. The analysis results showed that in 2018 the Winter-Spring rice crop has the highest yield, and the Autumn-Winter crop has the lowest yield. Accurate and timely estimation of rice yield and production can provide important information in terms of spatial distribution and seasonal yield for government and decision-makers in policy making related to import and export. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Most of the region, typically monitored with optical sensors, is hidden by a persistent cloud cover for most of the wet season. The necessity for a consistent and reliable deforestation warning system based on cloud-independent radar data is therefore of particular interest. In this paper, we investigated the potential of combining deep learning with Sentinel-1 (S-1) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) short time series (STS), covering only 24 d of acquisitions, to map endangered areas in the Amazon Basin. To this end, we implemented a U-Net-like convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-layer semantic segmentation, trained from scratch with different sets of input features to evaluate the viability of the proposed approach for different operating conditions. As input features, we relied on both multi-temporal backscatter and interferometric coherences at different temporal baselines. We provide a detailed performance benchmark of the different configurations, also considering the current state-of-the-art approaches based on S-1 STS and shallow learners. Our findings showed that, by exploiting the powerful learning capabilities of CNNs, we outperformed the STS-based approaches published in the literature and significantly reduced the computational load. Indeed, when considering the entire stack of Sentinel-1 data at a 6 d revisit time, we were able to maintain the overall accuracy and F1-score well above 90% and reduce the computational time by more than 50% with respect to state-of-the-art approaches, by avoiding the generation of handcrafted feature maps. Moreover, we achieved satisfactory results even when only S-1 InSAR acquisitions with a revisit time of 12 d or more were used, setting the groundwork for an effective and fast monitoring of tropical forests at a global scale. © 2022 by the authors.

DInSAR and MTInSAR are capable of determining the surface deformation of a rapidly moving landslide. The Vertical Line of Sight (LOS) displacements were estimated with millimeter accuracy using a DInSAR technique followed by phase unwrapping. MTInSAR approaches using APS (Atmospheric Phase Screen) and sparse point processing, on the other hand, measure earth surface displacements and track their trends over time. DInSAR is limited by several difficulties, including phase decorrelation errors, phase unwrapping errors, and atmospheric phase disturbances, all of which reduce the quality of deformation effects. MTInSAR approaches, on the other hand, use data from several different periods within the same temporal baseline. As a result, the effect atmospheric phase disturbances and unwrapping error is greatly decreased when compared to classic DInSAR approaches. After the Kotrupi landslide of August 13, 2017, conventional DInSAR with a single pair of SLC (Single Look Complex) Sentinel-1 SAR images showed a maximum displacement value of about −60 mm to 60 mm in the Kotrupi landslide runoff region. While the advanced MTInSAR results indicate a maximum rate of velocity of about −45 mm/year for the continuous deformation happening in the Kotrupi landslide area. The coherence values along Pathankot National Highway (NH) −154 before and after the landslide were 0.857 and 0.019, respectively. Deformation studies before and after the landslide occurrence are also conducted using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Based on the DEM obtained, erosional and depositional deformations of −3.5 m and +3.0 m have been recorded in the Kotrupi landslide runoff area, resulting in 6–7 m change and material loss. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for MTInSAR DEM 0.787 m and DInSAR DEM 1.026 m was estimated after the DEMs produced from DInSAR and MTInSAR processing were compared with TanDEM-X.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery could detect and map small-scale mining in Ghana by analyzing multi-temporal filtering applied to three SAR datasets and testing five machine-learning classifiers. Using an object-based image analysis approach, we were successful in classifying water bodies associated with small-scale mining. The multi-temporally filtered Sentinel-1 dataset was the most reliable, with kappa coefficients at 0.65 and 0.82 for the multi-class classification scheme and binarywater classification scheme, respectively. The single-date Sentinel-1 dataset has the highest overall accuracy, at 90.93% for the binary water classification scheme. The KompSAT-5 dataset achieved the lowest accuracy at an overall accuracy of 80.61% and a kappa coefficient of 0.61 for a binary-water classification scheme. The experimental results demonstrated that it is possible to classify water as a proxy to identify illegal mining activities and that SAR is a potentially accurate and reliable solution for the detection of SSM in tropical regions such as Ghana. Therefore, using SAR can assist local governments in regulating small-scale mining activities by providing specific spatial information on the whereabouts of small-scale mining locations. © 2022 by the authors.

While soil moisture inversion from time series data can utilize more independent observations, the value of further constraints on the inversion process are widely acknowledged. However, how to constrain a time series retrieval for global soil moisture mapping is still unresolved. In this study, three kinds of time series constraints were further developed and evaluated, including the use of 1) temporal behavior of soil moisture and soil moisture bounds; 2) temporal behavior of vegetation or time-invariant vegetation; and 3) time series ensemble skill. The effect of these constraints was investigated using 4 years (2016–2019) C-band Sentinel-1 data collected over 547 worldwide stations from 17 networks available on the international soil moisture network (ISMN) and intensive ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5). While the effect of these temporal retrieval skills varies in time and space, the global validation yielded four general suggestions: 1) the assumption of time-invariant vegetation contributed negatively even for a short retrieval period of ≤12 days; 2) reliable soil moisture bounds of each retrieval period can substantially improve the retrieval statistics at the cost of an underestimated soil moisture range; 3) the temporal constraints of soil moisture and vegetation need to be used together with the soil moisture bounds for reliable estimation; 4) the use of an ensemble retrieval could partly remove the retrieval uncertainties at the expense of underestimating soil moisture variation. The use of these constraints resulted in a competitive correlation coefficient (R: 0.64), root mean square error (RMSE: 0.072 m3/m3) and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE: 0.052 m3/m3) at a spatial grid of 100 m, with similar performance achieved across a retrieval window up to 132 days. © 2023","Mean square error; Soil surveys; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Vegetation; Decouplings; Global validation; Multi-temporal; Radar data; Soil moisture retrievals; Temporal behavior; Temporal constraints; Time invariants; Time series algorithms; Times series; model validation; satellite data; Sentinel; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; vegetation cover; vegetation mapping; Soil moisture","Global validation; Multi-temporal; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146871837"

The adopted technique employs an InSAR processing chain that exploits a stack of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using a small baseline multitemporal approach. Interferograms with small temporal baselines are first selected, then their network is optimized and reduced to eliminate noisy data, in order to mitigate the effect of decorrelation sources related to seasonal phenomena, i.e., snow and vegetation growth, and to the radar acquisition geometry. The atmospheric disturbance is mitigated using a spatio-temporal filter based on the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform. The estimated displacement maps and time series show the effect of both linear and impulsive ground motion and are validated against global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements. In this context, a significant threat to the built environment is represented by seismic tremors triggered by underground mining activities, which are analyzed using the proposed method to integrate the information gathered by in situ seismometer devices. © 2022 by the authors.

It is well known that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1A imagery provides a reliable data source for crop type identification. However, a single-temporal SAR image does not contain enough features, and the unique physical characteristics of radar images are relatively lack-ing, which limits its potential in crop mapping. In addition, current methods may not be applicable for time-series SAR data. To address the above issues, a new crop type identification method was proposed. Specifically, a farmland mask was firstly generated by the object Markov random field (OMRF) model to remove the interference of non-farmland factors. Then, the features of the standard backscatter coefficient, Sigma-naught (σ0), and the normalized backscatter coefficient by the in-cident angle, Gamma-naught (γ0), were extracted for each type of crop, and the optimal feature combination was found from time-series SAR images by means of Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance analysis. Finally, to make efficient utilization of optimal multi-temporal feature combination, a new network, the convolutional-autoencoder neural network (C-AENN), was developed for the crop type identification task. In order to prove the effectiveness of the method, several classical machine learning methods such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), etc., and deep learning methods such as one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE), etc., were used for comparison. In terms of quantitative assessment, the proposed method achieved the highest accuracy, with a macro-F1 score of 0.9825, an overall accuracy (OA) score of 0.9794, and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) score of 0.9705. In terms of qualitative assessment, four typical regions were chosen for intuitive comparison with the sample maps, and the identification result covering the study area was compared with a contemporaneous optical image, which indicated the high accuracy of the proposed method. In short, this study enables the effective identification of crop types, which demonstrates the importance of multi-temporal radar images in feature combination and the necessity of deep learning networks to extract complex features. © 2022 by the authors.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has generated dense measurement points for large-scale deformation monitoring and risk assessment. However, the applications of InSAR for building deformation and risk level prediction are still rare, especially under complex loading scenarios. In this study, we present an integrated method to monitor and predict building deformation and risk levels using multi-temporal InSAR and numerical modeling. Persistent and distributed scatterers were jointly detected to monitor deformation using TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 images over the Kowloon district of Hong Kong and the Futian district of Shenzhen. First, the building risk level was assessed at the district scale using ground subsidence and angular distortion to identify potentially damaged buildings. 10 out of 807 buildings in the Kowloon and 2 out of 145 buildings in the Futian were classified as medium risk. Back-analysis was used to retrieve the geological and hydrological conditions of buildings at the medium risk level. Then, time-series subsidence of the Lucky and BMW buildings during 2012 to 2016 and the Jingli building during 2010 to 2014 was simulated by numerical modeling, which agreed well with the InSAR measurements. By defining the groundwater level changes and upper loading, the predicted subsidence of the Lucky, BMW, and Jingli buildings reached 47.9, 62.8, and 39.9 mm by 2021, respectively, with a decelerated trend. Time-series results showed that the Lucky and BMW buildings were still at the negligible-to-medium risk level in 2021, and should be constantly inspected; the risk level of the Jingli building became negligible from 2020. This method can be transferred to other rapidly urbanized areas prone to ground subsidence for geohazard assessment and improve the understanding of the dynamic behaviors of anthropogenic activity-induced ground subsidence. © 2022","China; Futian; Guangdong; Hong Kong; Kowloon; Shenzhen; building; COSMO-SkyMed; deformation; groundwater; human activity; numerical model; prediction; risk assessment; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; time series; underground construction; urbanization; water level","Building risk; InSAR; Numerical modeling; Underground construction","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140784079"

However, savannas are changing rapidly due to climate change, fire, animal management, and intense fuelwood harvesting. In southern Africa, large trees (>5 m in height) are under threat while shrub cover (<3 m) is increasing. The collection of multi-date airborne LiDAR (ALS) data, initiated over a decade ago in the Lowveld of South Africa, provided a rare opportunity to quantify the ability of L-band SAR to track changes in savanna vegetation structure and this study is the first to do so, to our knowledge. The objective was to test the ability of ALOS PALSAR 1&2, dual-pol (HH, HV) data to quantify woody cover and volume change in savannas over 2-, 8- and 10-year periods through comparison to ALS. For each epoch (2008, 2010, 2018), multiple PALSAR images were processed to Gamma0 (γ0) at 15 m resolution with multi-temporal speckle filtering. ALS data were processed to fractional canopy cover and volume, and then compared to 5 × 5 aggregated (75 m) SAR mean γ0. The ALS cover change (∆CALS) and volume change between pairs of years were highly correlated, with (R2 > 0.8), thus results for cover change applied equally to volume change. Cover change was predicted using (i) direct backscatter change or (ii) the difference between annual cover map product derived using the Bayesian Water Cloud Model (BWCM) and logarithmic models. The linear relationship between ∆γ0 and ∆CALS varied between year pairs but reached a maximum R2 of 0.7 for 2018–2010 and a moderate R2 of 0.4 for 2018–2008. Overall, 1 dB ∆γ0 corresponded to approximately 0.1 cover change. The three cover change models had very similar uncertainties with mean RMSE = 0.15, which is 13% of the observed cover change range (−0.6 to +0.6). The direct backscatter change approach had less underestimation of positive and negative cover change. The L-band backscatter had a higher sensitivity than suggested by previous studies, as it was able to reliably distinguish cover change at 0.25 increments. The SAR-derived cover change maps detected the loss of stands of big trees, and widespread increases in cover of 0.35–0.65 in communal rangelands due to shrub encroachment. In contrast, the maps suggest that cover generally decreased in conservation areas, forming distinct fence-line effects, potentially caused by significant increases in elephant numbers and frequent, intense wildfires in reserves. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","South Africa; Backscattering; Ecosystems; Forestry; Optical radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Wood products; ALOS PALSAR; ALS datum; L-band; L-band SAR; LiDAR; Savanna; South Africa; Structure change; Vegetation structure; Volume change; carbon sink; ecosystem service; satellite data; savanna; synthetic aperture radar; wildfire; Climate change","ALOS PALSAR; L-Band; LiDAR; SAR; Savannas; South Africa; Vegetation structure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142478890"

The inter-comparison of DEMs can be used to provide estimates of topographic change, for example, volume changes. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be used to generate multitemporal topographic datasets using interferometric SAR (InSAR). Such analyses are often conducted using commercial software; however, a well-structured workflow based on free and open-source software (FOSS) increases the applicability and transferability of the DEM generation method and can facilitate the use of multi-temporal topographic analysis within the Earth Sciences. In this study, we aim to develop an open-source-based workflow for the generation of multi-temporal DEMs from Sentinel-1 data, and to explore their potential for landslide volume estimation using FOSS. We implemented this semi-automated and transferable workflow bundled in the open-source Python package ""SliDEM"", which relies on SNAP, SNAPHU, and several other open-source software for geospatial and geomorphological applications, all distributed within a Docker image. Two major landslides in Austria and Norway were selected to test, evaluate, and validate the workflow in terms of reliability, performance, reproducibility, and transferability. Even if the quality of the Sentinel-1-based DEMs varies among the study areas, the preliminary results are promising. However, there is a need for improvement and thorough analysis of the causes of elevation errors. A comprehensive evaluation of the influence of the perpendicular and temporal baselines, topography, land use/land cover, and other environmental conditions can be systematically assessed within the ""SliDEM""workflow. © Copyright:","Application programs; Land use; Open source software; Open systems; Space-based radar; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Digital elevation model; Digital elevation model generation; Free and open source softwares; Interferometric SAR; Model generation; Multi-temporal; Open-source; Sentinel-1; Volume estimations; Work-flows; Landslides","DEM generation; InSAR; landslide; open-source; Sentinel-1; volume estimation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137180377"

In the past, applications of precise geodetic techniques have been successfully demonstrated for surface deformation analysis in natural hazard monitoring. This study presents, first of its kind in India, site-scale deformation analysis of a half-century old active landslide (Jaggi Bagwan) in Rudraprayag district, Uttarakhand state (India). We present an approach to investigate the spatial variability of surface deformation (i.e. sectors with different kinematics within a landslide) using multi-temporal interferometric Synthetic Aperture radar (MT-InSAR) derived strain map. The maximum negative mean displacement rates obtained by MT-InSAR processing of 30 Ascending and 32 descending Sentinel-1A scenes are 27.56 mm/yr and 1.11 mm/yr, respectively. It indicates the presence of instability at the study site which is further supported by a line of sight (LOS) projected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) displacement rates. Subsequently, a modified least square method is applied to generate strain map using 3D velocity components obtained by multi-geometry LOS decomposition. The interpretation of strain map is further assisted by the instabilities observed at the crown of Jaggi Bagwan using Google Earth imageries from 1996 to 2018 to better correlate the strain pattern. Strain rate map clearly identified the sectors with dominating extension and compression within landslide. The presented approach can be further extended to landslide risk reduction along national highways and valley blockages. © 2022 COSPAR","Deformation; Global positioning system; Kinematics; Landslides; Least squares approximations; Strain rate; Deformation analysis; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Landslide kinematic; Landslide monitoring; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Strain maps; Strain-rates; Surface-deformations; Synthetic aperture radar","Landslide kinematics; Landslide Monitoring; MT-InSAR; Strain Rate","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131372538"

Translational landslides generally slide along a relatively straight surface of rupture. Whether the post-failure spatiotemporal deformation for certain translational landslides follows the pre-failure pattern remains untested. Here, the pre-and post-failure spatiotemporal deformations of the Simencun landslide along the Yellow River in 2018 were analyzed through multi-temporal remote sensing image analysis, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation monitoring and intensive field investigations. The results show that the pre-and post-failure spatial deformations both follow a retrogressive failure pattern. The long time series of the displacement before and after failure is characterized by obvious seasonal and periodic stage acceleration movements. Effective rainfall played an important role in the increase of the displacement acceleration, and the change in temperature might have accelerated the displacement. Finally, there is a possibility that the post-failure spatiotemporal deformation pattern of translational landslides does follow the pre-failure pattern when certain conditions are satisfied. The results are of great significance to improving our understanding of the spatiotemporal deformation pattern of landslides and to post-failure risk prevention and control. © 2022 by the authors.

The seismic cycle of large earthquakes primarily controls changes in the coastal surface level in these zones. Therefore, quantifying temporal and spatial variations in land level after recent earthquakes is essential to understand shoreline variations better, and to assess their impacts on coastal urban areas. Here, we measure the coastal subsidence in central Chile using a multi-temporal differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). This geographic zone corresponds to the northern limit of the 2010 Maule earthquake (Mw 8.8) rupture, an area affected by an aftershock of magnitude Mw 6.8 in 2019. The study is based on the exploitation of big data from SAR images of Sentinel-1 for comparison with data from continuous GNSS stations. We analyzed a coastline of ~300 km by SAR interferometry that provided high-resolution ground motion rates from between 2018 and 2021. Our results showed a wide range of subsidence rates at different scales, of analyses on a regional scale, and identified the area of subsidence on an urban scale. We identified an anomalous zone of subsidence of ~50 km, with a displacement <−20 mm/year. We discuss these results in the context of the impact of recent earthquakes and analyze the consequences of coastal subsidence. Our results allow us to identify stability in urban areas and quantify the vertical movement of the coast along the entire seismic cycle, in addition to the vertical movement of coast lands. Our results have implications for the planning of coastal infrastructure along subduction coasts in Chile. © 2022 by the authors.

In case of InSAR applications for Tengiz Oilfield in Kazakhstan, SBAS-InSAR remote sensing technique followed by 3D and 2D decompositions showed the continuous subsidence at the Tengiz oilfield with increasing velocity. 3D and 2D decompositions of LOS measurements to vertical movement showed that the Tengiz Oil Field 2018-2020 continuously subsided with the maximum annual vertical deformation velocity around 70 mm. The vertical deformation confirmed typical patterns of subsidence caused by oil extraction. However, detected east-west and north-south horizontal movements at the Tengiz field clearly indicated that the study area crossed by seismic faults is also affected by natural tectonic processes. In case of InSAR applications for pipelines, both PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR techniques showed continuous subsidence in the kilometer range of 13-70 crossing two seismic faults. The ground uplift deformations were observed in the pipeline kilometer range of 0-13. Although both PS-InSAR and SBAS measurements were highly consistent in deformation patterns and trends along pipelines, they showed differences in the spatial distribution of ground deformation classes and noisiness of produced results. SBAS showed better performance than PS-InSAR along buried petroleum and gas pipelines in the following aspects: the complete coverage of the measured points, significantly lower dispersion of the results, continuous and realistic measurements and higher accuracy of ground deformation rates against the GPS historical measurements. In case of InSAR applications for Absheron oil and gas fields, PS-InSAR showed the existence of ground deformation processes observed for the period of 2015-2017 with three hotspots of highest subsidence rates and three hotspots of highest uplift rates in oil and gas fields. The determined maximum displacement rates of subsidence and uplift processes were −26 mm/y and +23 mm/y, respectively. However spatial density analysis of deformation velocity presented the natural patterns of uplift and subsidence tectonic processes. This allowed to determine that two oil and gas fields hold a higher probability of being affected by man-made oil and gas exploration activities, whereas the one oil field is affected by both natural and man-made processes. © 2022 SPIE.","Deformation; Faulting; Gas industry; Gases; Geographic information systems; Interferometry; Oil fields; Pipelines; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Seismology; Surface measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Azerbaijan; Ground deformations; Kazakhstan; Oil and gas fields; Oil-and-Gas pipelines; PS-InSAR; Remote surveillance; Remote-sensing; SBAS-InSAR; Surface displacement; Subsidence","GIS; PS-InSAR; Radar; Remote Sensing; SBAS-InSAR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142535978"

This study used satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) optical remote-sensing (ORS) images to track evidence of slope deformation and examine potential geomorphological precursors of five large rockslides in China. The multi-temporal image interpretation results were combined with available pre-sliding slope displacement data derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or field monitoring to study the temporal changes in geomorphological precursors accompanying slope deformation. All the surveyed landslides had cracks or scarps and rockfalls within the landslide source area before the onset of rapid sliding. These precursors can be identified in ORS images taken several years or decades before the rapid slope failure, which provides sufficient time for the landslide early detection in practice. Local topography affects the spatial locations of cracks or scarps. Rockfalls within the landslide source area tend to locate at “key blocks” where slope mass provides forces resisting sliding. The rockfall area ratio, defined as the accumulated area of rockfalls over the landslide source area, ranged from 0.33 to 0.92 before rapid slope failure. The landslides developed on anti-dip and igneous rock slopes show a more significant rise of rockfall area ratio before the slope failure than the landslides on dip slopes. Given the broad availability of ORS data, this study could shed light on the ORS-based landslide early detection and landslide kinematics study. © 2022, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Antennas; Deformation; Image analysis; Optical remote sensing; Rock bursts; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Geomorphological precursor; Landslide early detection; Multi-temporal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Rockfalls; Rockslide; Slope deformation; Slope failure; Source area; deformation mechanism; detection method; igneous rock; landslide; remote sensing; rockfall; slope failure; synthetic aperture radar; Landslides","Geomorphological precursor; Landslide early detection; Multi-temporal analysis; Optical remote sensing; Rockslide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137225294"

We demonstrate this method with a set of 170 million time series of surface deformation generated for the entire Italian territory and derived from ERS, ENVISAT, and COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite constellations. We create a training dataset that has been compared with independently validated data and current state-of-the-art classification techniques.

This study highlights how the proposed approach can accelerate the anomalous points identification step by up to 147 times compared to analytical and other artificial intelligence methods and can be theoretically extended to other geodetic measurements such as GPS, leveling data, or extensometers.

Its high spatial coverage, weather friendly and remote nature are among the advantages of the tool. The multi-temporal differential InSAR (DInSAR) methods in particular estimate the spatio-temporal evolution of deformation by incorporating information from multiple SAR images. Moreover, opportunities from the DIn-SAR techniques are accompanied by challenges that affect the final outputs. Resolving the inherent ambiguities of interferometric phases, especially in areas with a high spatio-temporal deformation gradient, represents the main challenge. This brings the necessity of quality indices as important DInSAR data processing tools in achieving ultimate processing outcomes. Often such indices are not provided with the deformation products. In this work, we propose four scores associated with (i) measurement points, (ii) dates of time series, (iii) interferograms and (iv) images involved in the processing. These scores are derived from a redundant set of interferograms and are calculated based on the consistency of the unwrapped interferometric phases in the frame of a least-squares adjustment. The scores reflect the occurrence of phase unwrapping errors and represent valuable input for the analysis and exploitation of the DInSAR results. The proposed tools were tested on 432,311 points, 1795 interferograms and 263 Sentinel-1 single look complex images by employing the small baseline technique in the PSI processing chain, PSIG of the geomatics division of the Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC).

One of the manifestations of these changes is crater creation with blowouts of a gas, ice and frozen soil mixture. In this context, dynamics studies of long-term heaving mounds that turn into craters as a result are relevant. A workflow for detecting and assessing anomalous dynamics of heaving mounds in the Arctic regions is proposed. Areas with anomalous increase of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering intensity are detected in the first stage. These increases take place due to sudden changes in local terrain slopes when the scattering surface (mound slope) turns toward the radar. Radar backscattering intensity also rises due to depolarization at newly formed frost cracks. Validation of the detected anomaly is carried out at the second stage through a comparison of multi-temporal digital elevation models obtained from bistatic radar interferometry TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data. At the final stage, the deformations are assessed within the detected areas using differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) technique by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. The magnitude of the heaving along the line of sight (LOS) was 22–24 cm in the period from January 2019 to January 2020.

The outcomes of the present study highlight ground consolidation processes that seem to be active over areas settled in the last 30 years with a component contributing to vertical rates up to 3 mm/yr.

Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate large potential landslides along the Jinsha River. In this paper, we inspect the deformation characteristics of a rapid landsliding area along the Jinsha River by using multi-temporal remote sensing, and analyzed its future development and risk to the Sichuan-Tibet railway. Surface deformations and damage features between January 2016 and October 2020 were obtained using multi-temporal InSAR and multi-temporal correlations of optical images, respectively. Deformation and failure signs obtained from the field investigation were highly consistent. Results showed that cumulative deformation of the landsliding area is more than 50 cm, and the landsliding area is undergoing an accelerated deformation stage. The external rainfall condition, water level, and water flow rate are important factors controlling the deformation. The increase of rainfall, the rise of water level, and faster flow rate will accelerate the deformation of slope. The geological conditions of the slope itself affect the deformation of landslide. Due to the enrichment of gently dipping gneiss and groundwater, the slope is more likely to slide along the slope. The Jinsha River continuously scours the concave bank of the slope, causing local collapses and forming local free surfaces. Numerical simulation results show that once the landsliding area fails, the landslide body may form a 4-km-long dammed lake, and the water level could rise about 200 m; the historic data shows that landslide dam may burst in 2–8 days after sliding. Therefore, strategies of landslide hazard mitigation in the study area should be particularly made for the coming rainy seasons to mitigate risks from the landsliding area. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Guizhou; Jinsha; Jinsha River; Sichuan; Xizang; Deformation; Flow of water; Geometrical optics; Groundwater; Railroads; Rain; Remote sensing; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Deformation Characteristics; Jinsha river; Landsliding; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Sichuan; Sichuan-tibet railway; Surface damages; Surface-deformations; Temporal evolution; landslide; precipitation intensity; remote sensing; risk assessment; slope stability; water flow; water level; Landslides","Jinsha River; Landslides; Rainfall; Sichuan-Tibet railway; Temporal evolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122649639"

It was initiated by undercutting of the toe of this landslide resulting from increased discharge of the Xiaojinchuan River caused by the failure of a landslide dam, which had been created by the debris flow originating from the Meilong valley. As a result, 12 townships in the downstream area were endangered leading to the evacuation of more than 20000 people. This study investigated the Aniangzhai landslide area by optical and radar satellite remote sensing techniques. A horizontal displacement map produced using cross-correlation of high-resolution optical images from Planet shows a maximum horizontal motion of approximately 15 meters for the slope failure between the two acquisitions. The undercutting effects on the toe of the landslide are clearly revealed by exploiting optical data and field surveys, indicating the direct influence of the overflow from the landslide dam and water release from a nearby hydropower station on the toe erosion. Pre-disaster instability analysis using a stack of SAR data from Sentinel-1 between 2014 and 2020 suggests that the Aniangzhai landslide has long been active before the failure, with the largest annual LOS deformation rate more than 50 mm/yr. The 3-year wet period that followed a relative drought year in 2016 resulted in a 14% higher average velocity in 2018–2020, in comparison to the rate in 2014–2017. A detailed analysis of slope surface kinematics in different parts of the landslide indicates that temporal changes in precipitation are mainly correlated with kinematics of motion at the head part of the failure body, where an accelerated creep is observed since spring 2020 before the large failure. Overall, this study provides an example of how full exploitation of optical and radar satellite remote sensing data can be used for a comprehensive analysis of destabilization and reactivation of an ancient landslide in response to a complex cascading event chain in the transition zone between the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. © 2021, The Author(s).","China; Danba; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sichuan; Sichuan Basin; Geometrical optics; Kinematics; Optical correlation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Cross-correlations; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal InSAR; NDVI; Optical satellites; Radar satellites; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1/2; Slope failure; creep; debris flow; deformation; instability; kinematics; landslide; radar altimetry; remote sensing; slope failure; synthetic aperture radar; Landslides","Cross-correlation; Landslide; Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI); NDVI; Satellite remote sensing; Sentinel-1/2; Slope failure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120164215"

The combination of human activities and natural factors such as reclamation, invasion of Spartina alterniflora, and sea level rise has led to rapid changes in the structure and spatial distribution of salt marshes in China's coastal zone. Existing optical methods are subject to tidal and cloud interference in the coastal zone. Obtaining large-scale and high-efficiency salt marsh vegetation information using hyperspectral or LiDAR data is difficult.This study took the Yangtze River estuary as the research area and proposed a coastal salt marsh vegetation classification method based on vegetation phenology and multi-temporal radar backscatter feature. Sentinel-1 radar data were used to analyze the annual time-series characteristics of radar backscattering in salt marshes, intertidal forest swamps, mudflats, and water bodies. Based on the phenological characteristics of salt marsh vegetation, the separability between the monthly backscattering characteristics of a typical salt marsh was calculated based on the separation threshold method. According to the optimal time-series radar classification characteristics, the random forest method was used to obtain the species, structure, and spatial distribution of salt marsh vegetation.Results showed the following. (1) The average value of VH polarization backscattering can distinguish water bodies, light beaches, intertidal forest swamps, and salt marshes well. (2) The mean backscattering values of VV polarization in April, VH polarization in November, and VV polarization in March were the optimal characteristics of Scirpus × mariqueter, Spartina alterniflora, and Phragmites australis. (3) Obtained by the optimal characteristics and random forest classification algorithm, the general classification accuracy of salt marsh vegetation was 85% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.80.Compared with optical remote sensing, radar images can effectively obtain the inter-annual and inter-monthly time series backscattering characteristics of salt marsh vegetation, and accurately obtain the spatial dynamics of coastal salt marsh vegetation. This study has shown the application potential of radar images in coastal zone research and provides important technical means and data support for coastal biodiversity conservation, wetland ecosystem function enhancement, and ecological environment management. © 2022, Science Press.

A recursive neural network is used to realize the classification of phenology and use it as prior knowledge of rice phenology to divide and extract the phenological interval and date of rice in 2021. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of neural network phenological interval division reaches 93.5%, and the average error between the extracted and measured phenological date is 3.08 days, which proves the application potential of the method.

Settlement in reclaimed land may delay construction and even damage infrastructures, so accurately predicting the settlement over reclaimed areas is important. However, the limited settlement observation and ambiguous final settlement estimation affect accurate settlement prediction in traditional methods. This study proposes a new strategy to solve these problems by using the Multitemporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) method and takes the Xiamen Xiang’an International Airport, built on reclaimed land, as an example. The MT-InSAR is adopted to process the Sentinel-1 images to obtain the settlement history of the study area. The results show that settlement mainly occurs in the reclaimed areas, with the maximum average settlement rate exceeding 40 mm/y. We use the statistical properties of curve fitting to choose the best curve model from several candidate curve models to predict the settlement time series. The Asaoka method is used to identify the critical state between settlement and stability. We predict the consolidation time of the whole study area and reveal that the deformation rate is positively correlated with the consolidation time. The maximum remaining settlement time is over ten years since 24 December 2019. Therefore, manual compaction operations can be carried out to speed up settlement in the areas that need a long time to consolidate. The proposed method can be used to predict the settlement of similar reclaimed areas, and the predicted results can provide a reference for engineering construction. © 2022 by the authors.

To effectively acquire the subsidence information in low-coherence areas without obvious features in non-urban areas, an MT-InSAR technique, called SqueeSAR, is proposed to improve the density of the subsidence points in the study area by fusing the distributed scatterers (DS). However, SqueeSAR filters the DS points individually during spatial adaptive filtering, which requires significant computer memory, which leads to low processing efficiency, and faces great challenges in large-area InSAR processing. We propose a spatially adaptive filtering parallelization strategy based on the Spark distributed computing engine in a Hadoop distributed cluster environment, which splits the different DS pixel point data into different computing nodes for parallel processing and effectively improves the filtering algorithm’s performance.

In the past, numerous attempts have been made to develop landslide susceptibility maps using various tools. This research work aims to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) by developing a deep multi-layer perceptron network named as DMLP-LSM and to demonstrate it over Srinagar-Rudraprayag region, a landslide prone region recognized by the Geological Survey of India (GSI). Initially, training datasets are generated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) enabled multi-criteria analysis, which involves information from various landslide causative factors. In a first, one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) velocity, one of the critical inputs and prominent indicator for landslide susceptibility, is generated by processing 60 Sentinel-1A scenes using multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) algorithm. The 1D LOS velocity map, generally used for quantitative monitoring slow moving landslides, is used here as a thematic layer. The thematic layers and LSMs were fed to the proposed DMLP-LSM network as input and output, respectively. The developed model reached an accuracy of 91.47% with precision, specificity and ROC_AUC score as 92.11%, 95.55% and 0.9072, respectively. It further identified nearly 15 square km area as susceptible to landslide. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with two well-known machine learning models for LSM preparation, namely support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). In terms of accuracy, DMLP-LSM and RF had similar performance, but better than SVM. The velocity maps derived from MT-InSAR processing played a prominent role in the generation of LSM, supporting model training and performance. The proposed model achieved highest precision and specificity, and its performance would also improve LSM preparation when using larger datasets. The obtained results are promising, and the trained model can help in the rapid generation of LSMs. © 2021 COSPAR","Decision trees; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Deep multi-layer perceptron; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Landslide susceptibility; Multi layer perceptron networks; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Multicriteria analysis; Multilayers perceptrons; Susceptibility maps; Velocity maps; Landslides","Deep multi-layer perceptron; Landslide susceptibility; MT-InSAR; Multi-criteria analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118554796"

However, few surface deformation studies have focused on the distinction between different types of anthropogenic ground deformation. Based on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, this study employs the hybrid multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method to extract the surface deformation of Chaoshan Plain from 2015 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 30 m × 30 m. A series of historical optical satellite images and groundwater extraction data are used to help distinguish different types of human activities that have induced surface deformation. The characteristics of ground deformation induced by different types of anthropogenic activities are explored in the space and time dimensions. Results show that InSAR ground deformation in the study area is mainly caused by three types of human activities: groundwater extraction, land reclamation, and construction. Groundwater extraction has impacted >50% of the regional surface deformation by area. The interannual variability of the surface deformation rate corresponds well to that of groundwater extraction, and the subsidence effect can last for more than five years with seasonal variability. The maximum surface subsidence rate in land reclamation areas reaches ~100 mm/year, with a linear decreasing trend against time. Without extra compaction, the reclamation area can continue to deform almost at the same rate for several years. The rapid increase of overlying loads caused by construction in the reclamation area has led to a sharp decrease in the deformation rate within 2–3 years after the completion of the construction. In areas absent of other human-induced deformation, construction activities are shown to cause surface subsidence of 10–20 mm/year in a relatively short period. In areas experiencing a combination of construction and groundwater extraction, land subsidence rates of >50 mm/year are observed. This study shows that the spatial and temporal analysis of the correlations between human activities and InSAR surface deformation is an effective way to attribute the driven factors of coastal plain deformation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","","Anthropogenic activities; Chaoshan Plain; InSAR; Surface deformation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147565038"

These tasks can be done by visual inspection and by using traditional in situ methods, such as leveling or using traditional mechanical and electrical sensors, but these approaches are costly, labor-intensive and cannot be performed with a high temporal frequency. In recent years, remote sensing has proved to be a very promising methodology in evaluating the health of a structure by assessing its deformation and thermal dilation. The satellite-based Synthetic Aperture Radar Tomography (TomoSAR) technique, based on the exploitation of a stack of multi-temporal SAR images, allows to remotely sense the movement and the thermal dilation of individual structures with a centimeter-to millimeter-level accuracy, thanks to new generation high-resolution satellite-borne sensors. In this paper, the effectiveness of a recently developed TomoSAR technique in assessing both possible deformations and the thermal dilation evolution of man-made structures is shown.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for stable monitoring of marine raft aquaculture areas since it is all-weather, all-day, and cloud-penetrating. However, the scattering signal of marine raft aquaculture areas is affected by speckle noise and sea state, so their features in SAR images are complex. Thus, it is challenging to extract marine raft aquaculture areas from SAR images. In this paper, we propose a method to extract marine raft aquaculture areas from Sentinel-1 images based on the analysis of the features for marine raft aquaculture areas. First, the data are preprocessed using multitemporal phase synthesis to weaken the noise interference, enhance the signal of marine raft aquaculture areas, and improve the significance of the characteristics of raft aquaculture areas. Second, the geometric features of the marine raft aquaculture area are combined to design the model structure and introduce the shape constraint module, which adds a priori knowledge to guide the model convergence direction during the training process.

According to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for PL, besides the number of spatial samples, the time-series coherence magnitude matrix determines the reconstruction performance of the ESM phases. With the abundance of time-series polarimetric SAR data, many polarimetric optimization algorithms for distributed scatterer (DS) have been introduced, mainly the averaged coherence magnitude maximization-based exhaustive search polarimetric optimization (ESPO) algorithm. However, traditional polarimetric optimization algorithms cannot work satisfactorily because of the unstable statistical characteristics. Similarly, the multi-temporal observations of each polarimetric channel contain interferometric information. From the perspective of redundant observation, introducing full-polarization information can increase the number of observations significantly. Therefore, based on the PL theory and the polarimetric optimization, this paper proposes to perform the joint diagonalization method to simultaneously extract the ESM interferometric phases of interest from three time-series coherence matrices in the Pauli basis polarizations, called the joint-polarization phase linking (JPPL) algorithm. In the experiments, the proposed JPPL algorithm can better improve the optimization performance of time-series interferometric phases of DSs than the HH and traditional ESPO algorithms in terms of speckle noise reduction and interferometric phase restoration. © 2022 The Author(s)","algorithm; data processing; interferometry; polarization; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","Distributed scatterer (DS); Joint diagonalization; Phase linking (PL); Polarimetric optimization; Time-series interferometric SAR (TSInSAR)","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133696315"

The physically constrained general model-based decomposition (PCGMD) has proven to be a promising method in comparison with the typical four-component decomposition methods in scattering mechanism interpretation and identifying vegetation types. However, the robustness of PCGMD requires further investigation from the perspective of final applications. This paper aims to validate the efficiency of the PCGMD method on crop classification for the first time. Seven C-band time-series RADARSAT-2 images were exploited, covering the entire growing season over an agricultural region near London, Ontario, Canada. Firstly, the response and temporal evolution of the four scattering components obtained by PCGMD were analyzed. Then, a forward selection approach was applied to achieve the highest classification accuracy by searching an optimum combination of multi-temporal SAR data with the random forest (RF) algorithm. For comparison, the general model-based decomposition method (GMD), the original and its three improved Yamaguchi four-component decomposition approaches (Y4O, Y4R, S4R, G4U), were used in all tests. The results reveal that the PCGMD method is highly sensitive to seasonal crop changes and matches well with the real physical characteristics of the crops. Among all test methods used, the PCGMD method using six images obtained the optimum classification performance, reaching an overall accuracy of 91.83%. © 2022 by the authors.

Three satellite images are analysed by the multitemporal difference-adjusted dispersion threshold approach to capture land cover changes such as demolished buildings and new buildings by applying a threshold. This approach uses synthetic aperture radar data that are rarely considered in previously existing land cover change services.

Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has long been used to map wetlands due to its sensitivity to surface inundation and ability to penetrate clouds, darkness, and certain vegetation canopies. Here, we track boreal wetland inundation by developing a two-step modified decision-tree algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) time-series data as inputs. This approach incorporates temporal as well as spatial characteristics of SAR backscatter and is evaluated for the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta (PAD), and Yukon Flats, Alaska (YF) from May 2017 to October 2019. Within these two boreal study areas, we map spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation classes of Open Water (OW), Floating Plants (FP), Emergent Plants (EP), and Flooded Vegetation (FV). Temporal variability, frequency, and maximum extents of transient wetland inundation are quantified. Retrieved inundation estimates are compared with in-situ field mapping obtained during the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a multi-temporal Landsat-derived surface water map. Over the 2017–2019 study period, we find that fractional inundation area ranged from 18.0% to 19.0% in the PAD, and from 10.7% to 12.1% in the YF. Transient wetland inundation covered ~595 km2 of the PAD, comprising ~9.1% of its landscape, and ~102 km2 of the YF, comprising ~3.6%. The implications of these findings for wetland function monitoring, and estimating landscape-scale methane emissions are discussed, together with limitations and uncertainties of our approach. We conclude that time series of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter, screened with Sentinel-2 MSI optical imagery and validated by field measurements, offer a valuable tool for tracking transient boreal wetland inundation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the land subsidence and predict the future deformation trend to mitigate the damage and take measures for the land reclamation and any in-frastructure. In this paper, a total of 125 SAR images acquired by the C-band Sentinel-1A satellite between June 2017 and September 2021 are collected. The small baseline subsets (SBAS) SAR inter-ferometry (InSAR) method is first conducted to detect the land deformation in Xiamen and Zhang-zhou cities of Fujian Province, China, and the distributed scatterers (DS)-InSAR method is used to recover the complete deformation history of some typical areas including Xiamen Airport in Dadeng Island and Shuangyu Island. Then, the sequential estimation and the geotechnical model are jointly applied to demonstrate the current and future evolution of land subsidence of the con-structed roads on Shuangyu Island. The results show that the maximum cumulative deformation reaches 425 mm of Xiamen Xiang’an Airport and 626 mm of Shuangyu Island, and the maximum deformation is predicted to be as large as 1.1 m by 2026 of Shuangyu Island. This research will provide important guidelines for the design and construction of Xiamen Xiang’an Airport and Shuangyu Island to prevent and control land subsidence. © 2022 by the authors.

The failure rate of phase unwrapping is often much higher in such areas, bringing more biases to the estimated deformation and height values. We propose a new method for MT-InSAR phase unwrapping especially for deformation monitoring in urban areas. The method isolates the propagation path of information by considering the building height information of a study area. Two quality controllers are also developed to refine the arc observation network structure for network adjustment and to correct the phase unwrapping errors.

The identification of homogeneous pixels (HPs) is the first and key step for DS processing to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio condition. Since multi-polarization data are good at describing geometrical structures and dielectric properties of ground objects, they have been applied for HP identification. However, polarimetric information is not enough for identifying areas with similar ground objects but different deformation. We propose a novel DS preprocessing algorithm based on polarimetric interferometric homogeneous pixel (PIHP) identification. Firstly, a novel Polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) similarity that combines polarimetric intensity, interferometric coherence, and phase is proposed, which is readily available in multi-baseline and multi-polarization data and flexible by controlling weighting factors. Secondly, based on the binary partition tree (BPT) framework, object-orientated multi-scale PIHP identification is achieved, which is suitable for complex deformation scenes. Tested with simulated quad-polarization data, our method shows improvement in phase quality and point density, especially in the deformed areas, compared with the traditional HP identification method based on the polarimetric homogeneity (PolHom) test and the method with ground object type map. Tested with 30 quad-polarization Radarsat-2 images over Kilauea Volcano, the point density of our method is three times higher than that of the PolHom test in vegetation areas. Our method is proven to be more sensitive and mechanically more advanced to homogeneous pixels identification than the traditional ones, which is helpful for phase optimization, spatial enlargement of monitoring points, and stability of the MT-InSAR algorithm. © 2022 by the authors.","Binary trees; Deformation; Dielectric properties; Interferometry; Polarimeters; Polarization; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Trees (mathematics); Binary partition Tree; Distributed scatterers; Ground objects; Interferometrics; Multi-baseline; Multi-baseline polarimetric InSAR; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal InSAR; Point density; Polarimetric interferometric homogeneous pixel; Pixels","binary partition tree; distributed scatterer; MT-InSAR; multi-baseline PolInSAR; PIHP","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141830234"

It is hard to identify targets due to strong background inferences. However, targets often change over time while most background scatterers are temporally stable. With the increasing availability of multi-temporal SAR images, one can separate moving targets from the background by analyzing their temporal behavior. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to remove background clutters by developing a stable background mask. First, we investigate the temporal behavior of amplitude time series (TS) of different scatterers using three typical distributions. Then, temporally stable pixels are extracted to generate a stable background mask for the scene. We block the stable regions for each image in the amplitude TS and obtain the processed images where only unstable regions that may include targets are left. Since most background inferences are eliminated, it will help lower false alarms in the target detection procedure. © 2022 IEEE.","Radar imaging; Time series; A-stable; Background removal; Cluttered environments; High-cluttered environment; SAR target detection; SAR time series; Stable background mask; Targets detection; Temporal behavior; Times series; Synthetic aperture radar","High-cluttered environments; SAR target detection; SAR time series; Stable background mask","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140387760"

In recent years, neural networks have made great progress in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) crop classification. However, the insufficient number of labeled samples limits the classification performance of neural networks. In order to solve this problem, a new crop classification method combining geodesic distance spectral similarity measurement and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (GDSSM-CNN) is proposed in this study. The method consisted of: (1) the geodesic distance spectral similarity method (GDSSM) for obtaining similarity and (2) the one-dimensional convolutional neural network model for crop classification. Thereinto, a large number of training data are extracted by GDSSM and the generalized volume scattering model which is based on radar vegetation index (GRVI), and then classified by 1D-CNN. In order to prove the effectiveness of the GDSSM-CNN method, the GDSSM method and 1D-CNN method are compared in the case of a limited sample. In terms of evaluation and verification of methods, the GDSSM-CNN method has the highest accuracy, with an accuracy rate of 91.2%, which is 19.94% and 23.91% higher than the GDSSM method and the 1D-CNN method, respectively. In general, the GDSSM-CNN method uses a small number of ground measurement samples, and it uses the rich polarity information in multi-temporal fully polarized SAR data to obtain a large number of training samples, which can quickly improve the accuracy of classification in a short time, which has more new inspiration for crop classification. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Geodesy; Convolutional neural network; Crop classification; Deep learning; Fully polarimetric; Geodesic distances; Multi-temporal; One-dimensional; Sample limited; Spectral similarity; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","crop classification; deep learning; fully polarimetric; multi-temporal; sample limited; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137777708"

Such delays are caused by the variations of pressure, temperature, and humidity of the troposphere, potentially leading to elevation-dependent phases in interferograms. The atmospheric heterogeneity makes the phase-elevation dependence vary in both space and time, posing challenges on empirical models that estimated the elevation-topography relationship in empirically predefined windows interferogram by interferogram. Moreover, the portion of the deformation that is correlated with topography can be mistaken as tropospheric delays and therefore degrade the performance of linear regression between the tropospheric phase and the elevation. The effectiveness of these methods is further limited by the requisite knowledge presumed of the user, particularly with regard to how to divide the scene and which observation model is suitable. These limitations make reliable isolation of tropospheric delay challenging. We present here a novel approach that combines tropospheric delay, deformation and possible topographic error to a joint model, enabling a precise separation of tropospheric delay. The rationale is rooted in the distinct temporal dependencies of these parameters. To avoid empirical setting of segmentation windows, we employ quadtree to adaptively control the spatial variability of tropospheric properties. We validate the proposed method at two volcanic areas, Bali and Hawaii, where tropospheric delay presents notable variability coupled with elevation-correlated deformation signals. Both ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data over the island of Bali show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional ones. The misfit standard deviation (STD) is reduced by ∼50% at the island of Bali, where elevation-correlated deformation is simulated according to a predefined model. More impressively, at the island of Hawaii, the misfit STD between InSAR and ground truth (i.e., GPS displacements) decreases from 25.1 to 4.5 mm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in reducing the spatially variable tropospheric delay while preserving the elevation-correlated deformation signal. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Bali; Hawaii; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles; Atmospheric humidity; Interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Atmospheric delay; Deformation signal; Elevation-correlated deformation; Interferograms; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Joint models; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Standard deviation; Tropospheric delays; deformation mechanism; displacement; GPS; spatial variation; synthetic aperture radar; troposphere; Troposphere","Elevation-correlated deformation; Joint model; Multitemporal InSAR; Tropospheric delay","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145581203"

Utilizing the near real-time and cloud computing capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), this process facilitates data acquisition and enables large-scale flood monitoring in an expeditious manner.

We demonstrate that constant threshold values for flood extraction from SAR change detection indices are not ubiquitously suitable for all geographies, thus we outline a heuristic that can be used to select thresholds suitable for specific sites through a fully automated sensitivity analysis.

For this, multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Polarimetric (PolSAR) Sentinel-1 imagery and multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data were jointly used. We applied the Cloude–Pottier polarimetric decomposition on PolSAR data to compute 23 polarimetric indicators and extracted vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 time-series to generate a big feature space of 818 features. In order to assess the relevance of the different features for the crop mapping task, we run a number of scenarios using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The model that was trained using only the polarimetric data demonstrates a very promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy over 82%. A genetic algorithm was also implemented as a feature selection method for deriving an optimal feature subset. To showcase the positive effect of using polarimetric data over areas suffering from cloud coverage, we contaminated the original Sentinel-2 time-series with simulated cloud masks. By incorporating the genetic algorithm, we derived a high informative feature subset of 120 optical and polarimetric features, as the corresponding classification model increased the overall accuracy by 5% compared to the model trained only with Sentinel-2 features. The feature importance analysis indicated that apart from the Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, several polarimetric parameters, such as Shannon entropy, second eigenvalue and normalised Shannon entropy are of high value in identifying crops. In summary, the findings of our study highlight the significant contribution of Sentinel-1 PolSAR data in crop classification in areas with frequent cloud coverage and the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm in discovering the most informative features. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Feature Selection; Food supply; Optical remote sensing; Polarimeters; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Vegetation mapping; Cloud cover; Common agricultural policy; Crop classification; Crop type mappings; Features selection; Polarimetric data; Radar polarimetry; Sentinel-1; Times series; Vegetation index; Genetic algorithms","cloud cover; common agricultural policy; crop type mapping; feature selection; genetic algorithm; radar polarimetry; time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142677999"

In this context, remote sensing data provide valuable information on crops. This study investigates the relationship between the variables determined from both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images and crop height. For this purpose, backscatter (σVH, σVV, σVH / σVV) and coherence (ϒVH, ϒVV) of multi-temporal dual-polarized Sentinel-1 and vegetation indices of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data are analyzed. Two indices, namely, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDVI with the red-edge band (NDVIred), are interpreted to identify the contribution of the red-edge band over the near-infrared band. The Zile District of Tokat province in Turkey where dominantly sunflower cultivation is carried out, was selected as the study area. In the analysis of the data, Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were used. In the results of the study, ANN showed the lowest RMSE = 3.083 cm (RMSE%= 11.284) in the stem elongation period. The CNN followed the lowest RMSE for the Inflorescence development and flowering stages 19.223 cm (RMSE%=15.458) and 8.731 cm (RMSE%=5.821), respectively. In the ripening period, XGBoost achieved the lowest RMSE = 8.731 cm (RMSE%=6.091). All the best models in four methods were created using common variables of σVH, σVV, ϒVH, ϒVV and NDVIred, except ANN which exclude coherence variables. The results concluded that NDVIred contributed more than NDVI which is widely interpreted in previous studies. © 2022 COSPAR","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Geometrical optics; Infrared devices; Optical remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Convolutional neural network; Crop height; Edge bands; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; Multiple linear regressions; Normalized difference vegetation index; Red edge; Simple linear regression; Sunflower; Multiple linear regression","Artificial Neural Network; Convolutional Neural Network; Crop Height; EXtreme Gradient Boosting; Multiple Linear Regression; Sunflower","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145334294"

The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of an integrated analysis of multi-temporal remote sensing (photogrammetry, COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar amplitude image) and marine geophysical data (multibeam and side scan sonar data) to characterize the main morphological, textural, and volumetric changes that occurred along the SdF slope in the 2020–2021 period. The analysis showed the marked erosive potential of the 19 May 2021 pyroclastic density current generated by a crater rim collapse, which mobilized a minimum volume of 44,000 m3 in the upper Sciara del Fuoco slope and eroded 350,000–400,000 m3 of material just considering the shallow-water setting. The analysis allowed us also to constrain the main factors controlling the emplacement of different lava flows and overflows during the monitored period.

With all-day and all-weather observing ability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can monitor the distribution of rice in tropical and subtropical areas. To solve the problem of misclassification of rice with no marked signal during the flooding period in subtropical hilly areas, this paper proposes a new feature combination and dual branch bi-directional long short-term memory (DB-BiLSTM) model to achieve high-precision rice mapping using Sentinel-1 time series data. Based on field investigation data, the backscatter time series curves of the rice area were analyzed, and a characteristic index (VV − VH)/(VV + VH) (VV: vertical emission and vertical receipt of polarization, VH: vertical emission and horizontal receipt of polarization) for small areas of hilly land was proposed to effectively distinguish rice and non-rice crops with no marked flooding period. The DB-BiLSTM model was designed, ensuring the independent learning of multiple features and effectively combining the time series information of both (VV − VH)/(VV + VH) and VH features. The city of Shanwei, Guangdong Province, China, was selected as the study area. Experimental results showed that the overall accuracy of the rice mapping results was 97.29%, and the kappa coefficient reached 0.9424. Compared to other methods, the rice mapping results obtained by the proposed method maintained good integrity and had less misclassification, which demonstrated the proposed method’s practical value in accurate and effective rice mapping tasks. © 2022 by the authors.

Various amplitude-based adaptive multilook approaches have been proposed for the improvement of interferometric processing. However, the phase signal, which is fundamental in interferometric systems, is typically ignored in these methods. To fully exploit the information in complex SAR images, a nonlocal adaptive multilooking is proposed based on complex covariance matrix in this work. The complex signal is here exploited for the similiarity measurement between two pixels. Given the complexity of objects in SAR images, structure feature detection is introduced to adaptively estimate covariance matrix. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach are demonstrated with experiments both on simulated and real data.

However, as the work progresses, some urgent problems have been exposed, such as how to define hidden hazards and what types of them, what are the targeted identification technologies, and what is the focus of the next step, etc. Methods: By summarizing a large number of practical cases, the definition of hidden landslide hazards is further clarified. Potential landslides are divided into three categories: Deformation area, historical deformation failure area and potentially unstable slope, and we propose targeted identification techniques for different types. Results: The deformation zone is mainly identified by combining multi‑temporal high resolution optical images and synthetic aperture radar interferometry technology (InSAR), high‑resolution optical remote sensing images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) can be used in the historical deformation and destruction region. Conclusions: Potential unstable slopes are difficult to identify by remote sensing and traditional artificial investigations. It is necessary to vigorously develop aerial and semi‑aerial geophysical prospecting technology to identify the underground structure of the slope quickly, especially the spatial distribution of the base‑cover interface and the groundwater status, and delineate dangerous areas through quantitative analysis of stability. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

However, traditional MT-InSAR approaches always employ a single global threshold to select measurement points (MPs), making it difficult to identify enough MPs in complex land cover areas (e.g., mountainous areas). In this study, to increase the number and spatial distribution density of distributed scatterer (DS) detection while maintaining its quality, we proposed a new MT-InSAR method, named Adaptive Distributed Scatterer InSAR Combined with Land Cover (ADSI-CLC). The key ideas of ADSI-CLC include the introduction of land cover maps as the constraint condition for DS adaptive selection and the employment of coherence weighted spatial adaptive filtering method to estimate optimal phase. Of these, DS adaptive selection method as the most pivotal idea realizes the unification of mathematical, physical, and geographical mechanism in the process of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHP) identification and adaptively adjusts the DS selection thresholds in different land cover areas in the process of DS selection. ADSI-CLC significantly increases the number and spatial distribution density of DS by using the adaptive selection method, and purifies the SHPs populations, and improves the efficiency of SHPs identification through introducing land cover maps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADSI-CLC method, a case study of the Jiaju landslide using 19 scenes ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 L-band data (2006–2011) and 31 scenes Sentinel-1 C-band data (2014–2016) was carried out. The comparison between deformation measurements retrieved by ADSI-CLC and classical StaMPS-SBAS method showed that their distribution pattern is similar, but the ADSI-CLC method can provide more deformation details due to much higher (nearly 10 times) DS density. Quantitative comparisons between the ADSI-CLC results from ALOS-1 data and GNSS measurements also showed that the accuracy of this method is about 11.7 mm/yr in terms of root mean square error (RMSE). These results proved the reliability and effectiveness of ADSI-CLC and indicated its great potential for displacements monitoring in complicated-surface areas with large topographic fluctuations (e.g., mountainous areas). © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The epicenter is located in the middle section of Qilian-Haiyuan fault in the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which is a seismic gap. It is of great significance to study this earthquake for understanding the tectonic deformation mechanism, strain release process and seismic hazards of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Methods: Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) is used to obtain the coseismic deformation along the line of sight (LOS) of the Menyuan earthquake from Sentinel-1 satellite images. The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation are used to obtain the EW coseismic deformation from the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Based on the coseismic deformation field derived from InSAR interferograms, we invert the slip distribution. Results: The LOS deformation fields showed that the Menyuan earthquake caused a surface rupture of about 20 km long and the maximum LOS displacement was 0.75 m. The maximum EW displacement derived from optical images was 2.5 m. The slip distribution model showed that the Menyuan earthquake was dominated by a sinistral strike-slip. The coseismic slip is concentrated at a depth of 0-10 km. The maximum slip was 3.25 m at a depth of 4.89 km and the rake angle was 10.44°. The estimated total seismic moment is 1.07×1019 N·m, corresponding to a magnitude of Mw 6.6. Conclusions: According to the results from aftershock relocation, field investigation and tectonic background, we infer that the seismogenic fault is the Lenglongling fault and the eastern segment of Tuolaishan fault is also ruptured. The stress on the eastern segment of the Lenglongling fault and the western segment of the Tuolaishan fault is enhanced, implying that there is the possibility of strong earthquakes in this region in the future. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

DEM products covering polar regions are critical remote sensing data sources to provide fundamental terrain information for glaciological studies. It is necessary to provide accurate CFs for DEM specific applications, such as mass balance calculation or the substitution of water values with geoid values in the DEM editing process. However, much less attention is paid to automatically delineate CFs from DEM data. In this study, we propose a DEM-based Automatic CF Extraction method (DACE) to efficiently extract the CFs from DEM data. In DACE, a height-sensitive terrain feature is designed to enhance the contrast between the ice sheet and the ocean by combining elevation and roughness information. To improve the CF extraction performance, a two-category image classification based on game theory is proposed that considers the spatial consistency of the feature image created. For validation, DACE was applied to DEM products generated from the single-pass SAR interferometry mission TanDEM-X (TDM) at different posting sizes (12 and 90 m) and to the optical photogrammetry-based Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) with a 2 m posting. The proposed algorithm can achieve a CF extraction accuracy of better than 14, 20, and 70 m for the 2-m REMA, 12- and 90-m TDM DEMs, respectively, when compared with the manually delineated CFs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the CFs from DEM data. DACE can be used to replace water values and edit the DEMs themselves. The CFs extracted from the DEM data can also be used for glacier mass balance calculation with the DEM-based geodetic method and for the temporal analysis of CF changes when multi-temporal DEM data are available. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Data mining; Digital instruments; Extraction; Game theory; Geomorphology; Glaciers; Image enhancement; Landforms; Remote sensing; Surveying; Antarctica; Calfing front; Digital elevation model; Elevation models; Height-sensitive terrain feature; Images classification; Reference elevation model of antarctica; Remote-sensing; TanDEM-X; TanDEM-X digital elevation model; Terrain features; algorithm; digital elevation model; glacier mass balance; ice sheet; image classification; interferometry; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; TanDEM-X; temporal analysis; Image classification","Calving Front; Digital Elevation Model (DEM); Height-sensitive terrain feature; Image classification; REMA; Remote sensing; TanDEM-X DEM","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122627133"

However, databases of landslide events are often spatially biased towards roads or other infrastructure, with few reported in remote areas. In this study, we demonstrate how Google Earth Engine can be used to create multi-temporal change detection image composites with freely available Sentinel-1 and-2 satellite images, in order to improve landslide visibility and facilitate landslide detection. First, multispectral Sentinel-2 images were used to map landslides triggered by a summer rainstorm in Jølster (Norway), based on changes in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between pre-and post-event images. Pre-and post-event multi-temporal images were then created by reducing across all available images within one month before and after the landslide events, from which final change detection image composites were produced. We used the mean of backscatter intensity in co-(VV) and cross-polarisations (VH) for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and maximum NDVI for Sentinel-2. The NDVI-based mapping increased the number of registered events from 14 to 120, while spatial bias was decreased, from 100% of events located within 500 m of a road to 30% close to roads in the new inventory. Of the 120 landslides, 43% were also detectable in the multi-temporal SAR image composite in VV polarisation, while only the east-facing landslides were clearly visible in VH. Noise, from clouds and agriculture in Sentinel-2, and speckle in Sentinel-1, was reduced using the multi-temporal composite approaches, improving landslide visibility without compromising spatial resolution. Our results indicate that manual or automated landslide detection could be significantly improved with multi-temporal image composites using freely available earth observation images and Google Earth Engine, with valuable potential for improving spatial bias in landslide inventories. Using the multi-temporal satellite image composites, we observed significant improvements in landslide visibility in Jølster, compared with conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, and applied this for the first time using VV-polarised SAR data. The GEE scripts allow this procedure to be quickly repeated in new areas, which can be helpful for reducing spatial bias in landslide databases. © 2022 by the authors.

In the present study, an automatic flood inundation mapping approach based on Sentinel-1 SAR datasets was used for the assessment of monsoonal flood events of the Brahmaputra River from 2015 to 2020. Google Earth Engine was used to prepare potential flood inundation maps using a change detection technique by processing SAR images. In total, around 144 SAR images were analysed for the study period, and it was found that the flood inundation extent was more in 2015 and 2016 at about 6 lakh hectares; thereby, it decreased in 2017 and 2018 near to 3.5 lakh hectares. Again, an increase in inundation extent was observed of about 6 lakh hectares in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The results were evaluated by applying binarisation thresholding, removing permanent water bodies and shadows from SAR images to delineate the actual flooded areas. It shows an encouraging overall validation accuracy of 93.6% and 95.15% for the pre-flood events of 2019 and 2020, respectively. There was a change in the trend of inundation extent observed in 2015, and it was confirmed with the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation dataset. The results were further analysed for damage assessment, and it was figured out that the flood event in July 2020 resulted in the highest crop area affected. The present study shows the technological advancements over the traditional approach of flood mapping and focuses on rapid flood assessment. The generated flood extent database can be used further by the hydrologist to generate the inundation probability maps based on the forecasting rainfall and hydrological model generated river discharge measurements.

Groundwater depletion often triggers land subsidence, which threatens manmade infrastructure and activities and aggravates other geohazards. We applied a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique to Sentinel-1 datasets to detect ground motion in the Gioia Tauro plain (Calabria, Southern Italy) from 2018 to 2021. The InSAR data were analysed through the integrated use of groundwater head, stratigraphical and geomorphological data, and land use information to distinguish the potential subsidence divers. The results show that subsiding areas, with a mean rate of about 10 mm/yr, are in the middle of the plain, and their location is influenced by the spatial distribution of compressible sediments included in the shallow aquifer. Furthermore, the subsidence arrangement is spatially accordant with the main groundwater depression area, which can be ascribed to the ongoing and increasing water pumping for predominantly agricultural usage. We also observed that subsidence (up to 10 mm/yr) affects the western dock of the Gioia Tauro harbour, in front of which, in very shallow water, are two submarine canyon heads already affected by slides in the past. © 2022 by the authors.

This method requires a fine-registered multi-temporal dataset with minor time variance and uses similarity estimation to compensate for the time variance. However, constructing such a training dataset is very time-consuming and may not be viable for a certain practitioner. In this article, we propose a novel single-image-capable speckling method that combines the similarity-based block-matching and noise referenced deep learning network. The denoising network designed for this method is an encoder–decoder convolutional neural network and is accommodated to small image patches. This method firstly constructs a large number of noisy pairs as training input by similarity-based block-matching in either one noisy SAR image or multiple images. Then, the method trains the network in a Siamese manner with two parameter-sharing branches. The proposed method demonstrates favorable despeckling performance with both simulated and real SAR data with respect to other state-of-the-art reference filters. It also presents satisfying generalization capability as the trained network can despeckle well the unseen image of the same sensor. The main advantage of the proposed method is its application flexibility. It could be trained with either one noisy image or multiple images. Furthermore, the despeckling could be inferred by either the ad hoc trained network or a pre-trained one of the same sensor. © 2022 by the authors.

To understand these changes through geospatial technique, the fastest moving tidewater Monacobreen Glacier, Svalbard, was studied for the year 2016–2019. It was elucidated that the surge had initiated during 2017–2018 before it the glacier was in quiescence since 2001. Initially, the glacier radar zones, namely percolation refreeze, lower percolation, and clean ice, were identified using the multi-temporal SAR data. These zones were utilized to delineate the equilibrium line altitude, and it was found that it is continuously moving down during surging, unlike the quiescence phase. The accumulation area ratio was always more than 0.67 throughout the analysis. The seasonal change in glacier surface velocity for both the phases was estimated, adapting the most appropriate Offset Tracking approach using the SAR data. The mean velocity over the main trunk was found to vary from 0.5 to 4 m/day. Thereafter, Glen's flow law equation was used to estimate the ice-thickness and found that the glacier has an average thickness range of 216–326 m in quiescence and 136–244 m during the surging. The analysis depicted that the basal shear stresses are increasing with surging, and the viscosity is decreasing.

Sentinel-1 (A/B) satellite provides high-resolution (∼10 m) synthetic aperture radar data, and its high revisit capability (6 days at the equator) with multi-track data provides great potential for global soil moisture monitoring. In this study, an algorithm was proposed for soil moisture retrieval using the Multi-Temporal Dual-Channel (MTDC) Sentinel-1 data. The MTDC algorithm first conducted an incidence angle normalization method based on time series data to normalize backscattering coefficients from multiple tracks. Subsequently, using the vegetation water content obtained through a vegetation index climatology, soil roughness and soil unfrozen water content could be estimated for the freezing period (unfrozen water content in the soil is assumed to be stable for January and December). The changes in total backscatter between successive observations were expressed as a function of the two-way vegetation transmissivity multiplied by the difference between soil backscatter, which was directly related to the changes in soil moisture. Considering the retrieved soil roughness as a constant for the entire year, and the average unfrozen water content as the initial soil moisture, the changes in and absolute values of soil moisture for each observation can be estimated by minimizing a cost function between the modeled and observed changes in total backscatter. Retrieval results were validated against the soil moisture network in a semi-arid watershed of Shandian River with an unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) of 0.06 cm3·cm−3, and a bias of −0.04 cm3·cm−3. With the initial soil moisture from in-situ measurements, a higher accuracy was achieved for the MTDC algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.06 cm3·cm−3; bias = −0.01 cm3·cm−3). Further, comparisons with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced products further verified the efficacy of the proposed algorithm (ubRMSE = 0.03 cm3·cm−3; bias = −0.004 cm3·cm−3), and demonstrated the feasibility of operational soil moisture products using the Sentinel-1 radar dataset. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","China; Luan River; Backscattering; Cost functions; Mean square error; Moisture control; Soil surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Watersheds; Dual channel; Initial soil moisture; Luan river; Multi-temporal; Root mean square errors; Semi-arid watershed; Sentinel-1; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil roughness; Unfrozen water contents; algorithm; backscatter; satellite data; Sentinel; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; watershed; Soil moisture","Dual-channel; Luan River; Multi-temporal; Radar; Sentinel-1; Soil moisture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141332955"

We used a multi-temporal high-resolution strip-map mode X-band satellite image that has a single polarization. Five main classes, i.e., volcanic structures, agriculture, settlement, sand dune and plain bareland are considered depending on the structure of the region. Within the category, the coherence value and DEM value are evaluated. In the accuracy assessment analysis, a reference map produced from aerial photogrammetry is used. Additionally, global DEM TanDEM-X data is also tested in the study region. In the analysis, quality metrics, mean error (ME), root means square error (RMSE), standard deviation (STD), and the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) are used. The results showed that as the temporal baseline increases the coherence values and the quality of the DEM product decrease. The RMSE values range between 2.36 m to 7.09 m in different classes. The TanDEM-X data provided high accuracies over each class range from 0.88 m to 2.40 m. Since the study area is vulnerable to sinkhole formation, sinkhole-like signals were also observed in the interferograms obtained from different and sequential pairs.

The availability of synthetic aperture radar imagery, especially after the launch of Sentinel-1 mission, enables to systematically update landslide inventories covering wide areas in a reduced time frame and at different scales of analysis. In this work, SAR data processed from the fully automatic P-SBAS pipeline have been adopted to update the Italian national landslide database. Specifically, a matrix has been introduced by comparing past landslide state of activity obtained with Envisat data (2003–2010) and that computed with Sentinel-1 (2014–2018). The state of activity was defined by obtaining the projected velocity along the slope dip direction. The analysis involved about 56,000 landslides which showed at least one Sentinel-1 measurement point, of which 74% were classified as dormant, having annual average velocity < 7 mm/year (considering a value of two times the standard deviation) and 26% as active (mean velocity > 7 mm/year). Furthermore, a landslide reliability matrix was introduced on the landslide inventory updated with S1 data, using the measurement point (MP) density within each landslide and the standard deviation of the mean Vslope value of each landslide. In this case, the analysis revealed that more than 80% of landslides has values of reliability from average to very high. Finally, the 2D horizontal and vertical components were computed to characterize magnitude and direction of every type of landslides included in this work, showing that spreadings, deep-seated gravitation slope deformations, and slow flows showed a main horizontal movement, while complex and translational/rotational slides had more heterogeneity in terms of deformation direction. Hence, the work demonstrated that the application of fast and automatically nationwide Sentinel-1 MTInSAR (multi-temporal interferometry SAR) may provide a fundamental aid for landslide inventory update. © 2023, The Author(s).","Interferometry; Matrix algebra; Radar imaging; Risk management; Statistics; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Italy; Landslide inventories; Management planning; Measurement points; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal interferometry SAR; P-SBAS; Risks management; Sentinel-1; Standard deviation; Landslides","Italy; Landslide inventory; MTInSAR; P-SBAS; Sentinel-1","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147781860"

The proposed method allows us to consider the correlation structure between subbands by modeling the wavelet coefficients through multivariate probability distributions. Three types of correlation are investigated: interscale, interorientation, and interpolarization dependences. The multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD) is used to model the interdependencies between wavelet coefficients at different orientations, scales, and polarizations. Kullback-Leibler similarity measures are computed and used to generate the change map. Simulated and real multilook PolSAR data are employed to assess the performance of the method and are compared to the multivariate Gaussian distribution (MGD)-based method. We show that the information embedded in the correlation between subbands improves the accuracy of the change map, leading to better performance. Moreover, the MGGD represents better the correlations between wavelet coefficients and outperforms the MGD. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Change detection; Gaussian distribution; Multivariant analysis; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Computational modelling; Correlation; Kullback Leibler divergence; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar  image; Multivariate generalized gaussian distribution; Multivariate generalized gaussian distributions; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Subband correlation; Subbands; Synthetic aperture radar images; Wavelet domain; Wavelets transform; correlation; detection method; multivariate analysis; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms","Change detection; Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence; multitemporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images; multivariate generalized Gaussian distribution (MGGD); subband correlations; wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140745175"

In this paper, a technical framework is presented for wide area landslide detection: (i) multi-temporal satellite optical images are used to detect landslides with distinguishable geomorphological features; (ii) Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) assisted InSAR stacking is employed to generate annual surface displacement rate maps in radar line of sight using satellite SAR images from both ascending and descending tracks, which are in turn utilized to automatically detect active landslides from ground motion using hotspot analysis, and (iii) the distribution characteristics of the detected landslides are investigated by examining their relationships with topographic and hydrological factors. Three expressways in Sichuan Province, China—namely the Yakang (Ya’an-Kangding), Yaxi (Ya’an-Xichang), and Lushi (Luding-Shimian) expressways—and their surrounding regions (a total area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers) were chosen as the study area. A total of 413 landslides were detected, among which 320 were detected using multi-temporal satellite optical images, and 109 were detected using GACOS-assisted InSAR stacking. It should be noted that only 16 landslides were detected by both approaches; these landslides all exhibited not only obvious geomorphological features but also ground motion. A statistical analysis of the topographic and hydrological factors shows that of the detected landslides: 81% are distributed at elevations of 1000–2500 m, over 60% lie within the elevation range of 100~400 m, and 90% present with medium and steep slopes (20°~45°), and 80% are located within areas seeing an annual rainfall of 950~1050 mm. Nine landslides were found to pose potential safety hazards to the expressways. The research findings in this paper have directly benefitted the Sichuan expressways; equally important, it is believed that the technical framework presented in this paper will provide guidance for hazard mitigation and the prevention of transportation hazards in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","Factor analysis; Feature extraction; Geometrical optics; Hazards; Landslides; Radar imaging; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Area detection; Atmospheric corrections; Generic atmospheric correction online service; Hotspot analyse; Hotspots; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar stacking; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; On-line service; Optical remote sensing; Sichuan; Sichuan expressway; Stackings; Wide area detection; Optical remote sensing","GACOS; hotspot analysis; InSAR stacking; landslide; optical remote sensing; Sichuan expressways; wide area detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137260858"

In this paper, we present how multitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be used to detect drought-affected and fire-endangered forest stands in a spatially and temporally high resolution. Existing approaches for Sentinel-1 based drought detection currently do not allow to deal simultaneously with all disturbing influences of signal noise, topography and visibility geometry on the radar signal or do not produce pixel-based high-resolution drought detection maps of forest stands. Using a novel Sentinel-1 Radar Drought Index (RDI) based on temporal and spatial averaging strategies for speckle noise reduction, we present an efficient methodology to create a spatially explicit detection map of drought-affected forest stands for the year 2020 at the Donnersberg study area in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, keeping the Sentinel-1 maximum spatial resolution of 10 m × 10 m. The RDI showed significant (p < 0.05) drought influence for south, south-west and west-oriented slopes. Comparable spatial patterns of drought-affected forest stands are shown for the years 2018, 2019 and with a weaker intensity for 2021. In addition, the assessment for summer 2020 could also be reproduced with weekly repetition, but spatially coarser resolution and some limitations in the quality of the resulting maps. Nevertheless, the mean RDI values of temporally high-resolution drought detection maps are highly correlated (R2 = 0.9678) with the increasing monthly mean temperatures in 2020. In summary, this study demonstrates that Sentinel-1 data can play an important role for the timely detection of drought-affected and fire-prone forest areas, since availability of observations does not depend on cloud cover or time of day. © 2022 by the authors.","Deforestation; Forest Fires; Risk Assessment; Topography; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Risk assessment; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Drought detection; Endangered forests; Forest; Forest fires; Forest stand; High resolution; High resolution detection; Multi-temporal; Radar data; Sentinel-1; drought; endangered species; forest fire; image resolution; satellite data; Sentinel; stand structure; synthetic aperture radar; Drought","drought; fire; forests; radar; SAR; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144603406"

Flood mapping from SAR images is based on backscattering coefficient differences. The change rules of the backscattering coefficient with different flooding depths of ground objects are essential prior knowledge for flood mapping, while their absence greatly limits the precision. Therefore, minimizing the backscattering coefficient differences caused by non-flood factors is of great significance for improving the accuracy of flood mapping. In this paper, non-flood factor influences, i.e., monthly variations of ground objects and polarization and satellite orbits, on the backscattering coefficient are studied with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images for five ground objects in Kouzi Village, Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China. Sentinel-1 images in different rainfalls are used to study the variation of the backscattering coefficient with flooding depths. Since it is difficult to measure the flooding depth of historical rainfall events, a hydrological analysis based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) is used to estimate the flooding depth. The results showed that the monthly variations of the maximum backscattering coefficients of farmland and construction and the backscattering coefficient differences caused by the satellite orbit were larger than the minimum backscattering coefficient differences caused by inundation.

This research aims to investigate the viability of a novel non-destructive health-monitoring approach based on satellite remote sensing and ground-based techniques for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of damages related to structural subsidence. To this purpose, high-resolution X-Band SAR products were acquired and processed by MT-InSAR technique. Analyses were developed to identify and monitor the structural displacements of the historical ""Ponte Sisto""masonry bridge located in Rome, Italy, crossing the Tiber River. To this extent, the historical time-series of deformations were processed by Persistent Scatterers (PSs) relevant to critical structural elements of the bridge (i.e., bridge piers and arcs). On the other hand, an on-site Ground Penetrating Radar investigation was directly conducted over the masonry bridge. More specifically, several frequencies were implemented for this purpose, with the aim to investigate the condition of the layers of the superstructures at different propagation lengths. A novel data interpretation approach is proposed based on the selection of several PS data-points with coherent deformation trends and location on the bridge, and the analysis of the B-Scan obtained by GPR investigations.

It can take multiple years for the landscape to adjust to the new topography after the earthworks are completed, with subsidence in the fill areas and uplift in the areas of excavation. Understanding the pattern and extent of this differential vertical movement has great importance for ensuring the structural integrity of any infrastructure built on the site. We therefore studied the spatial deformation field of the YND from January 2015 to December 2018 using satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology. Persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) were combined in a two-tier network to overcome problems with temporal decorrelation of the InSAR phase signals. The derived deformation field was validated with in-situ ground leveling and GNSS measurements, and interpreted using a forward geophysical model. The results indicate that our approach provides a more detailed understanding of the deformation than conventional PSI and SBAS methods. Subsidence of up to 87 mm/yr occurred over about 4.4 km2 of the fill region, and uplift of up to 26 mm/yr in the excavated areas. There is a strong linear relationship between these displacements and prior topographic elevation change. The primary cause of subsidence in fill areas is compaction of remoulded loess. Instantaneous elastic and gradual poroelastic deformation are the main causes of uplift in excavated areas. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","China; Loess Plateau; Deformation; Excavation; Foundations; Land reclamation; Land use; Landforms; Reclamation; Sediments; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; China; Chinese Loess Plateau; Deformation field; Geophysical modelling; InSAR; Land subsidence; MT-InSAR; Multi-temporal; Rebound; Yan'an new district; compaction; deformation mechanism; earthworks; excavation; GNSS; land reclamation; landscape; radar interferometry; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; Subsidence","China; InSAR; Land reclamation; Land subsidence; MT-InSAR; Rebound; Yan'an New District","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131758829"

Despite the increasing number of publications on the role of S1 in landslide detection, there is still a need for research to further clarify the capabilities of the sensor and the applicable image analysis techniques. Previous studies have successfully exploited high-resolution ALOS-PALSAR image-based intensity and coherence analysis at the 2018 Hokkaido landslides. Nevertheless, they expressed a clear need to analyse the capabilities of other sensors (such as S1). This raises the question: Do we need SAR imagery with higher spatial resolution (such as ALOS-PALSAR) or are freely available S1 imagery also suitable for rapid landslide detection? The S1 images could provide suitable material for a comparative analysis and could answer the aforementioned question. Therefore, 17 ascending and 19 descending S1 images were analysed to test S1 accuracy on landslide detection. Multitemporal analyses of both intensity and coherence were performed along with coherence differences, multitemporal features (MTF) and MTF differences of coherence images. In addition, the spatial analysis of the classification results was also evaluated to highlight the potential of S1 coherence analysis. S1 was found to have limitations at the site, as single coherence differences provided low-quality results. However, the results were significantly improved by calculating the MTF on coherence and almost reached the success rate of the ALOS-PALSAR-based coherence analysis, even though the improvement of the results with intensity was not possible. Half of the false positives were identified in the 30–45-m buffer zone of the agreement, underlining that the spatial resolution of the S1 is not appropriate for accurate landslide detection. Only an approximation of the landslide-affected area can be given with considerable overestimation. Due to the inclusion of post-event images, the sensor is not perfectly applicable for rapid detection purposes here. © 2022 by the authors.

This study conducted a high spatial-resolution investigation (30-m) on the response of dual-polarization C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) SAR backscatter coefficients (σ°) to temporal changes of surface water depth (dw) and spatial variations of vegetation characteristics in the south Florida Everglades wetlands. We investigated (1) linear relationships between σ° and dw values, and (2) the effects of vegetation density and morphology on σ°-dw relationships. We developed a new method to classify pixels with significant linear relationships of multi-temporal σ° and dw (R2 > 0.5 and p-value <0.04), which were termed “Reliable Scatterer” (RS). RS included positive, negative, and a combination of both positive and negative relationships (corresponding to RS+, RS−, RS±, respectively). Our analysis revealed spatially varying vegetation densities and morphologies had a significant impact on RS types, where we found RS+ type pixels for woody vegetation, RS± for a mix of medium- and high-density herbaceous vegetation using C-band VV (C-VV) data, and RS− for sparse herbaceous vegetation using C-VH data.

An essential procedure in DS interferometry is phase estimation, which reconstructs a consistent phase series from all available interferograms. Influenced by the well-known suboptimality of coherence estimation, the performance of the state-of-the-art phase estimation algorithms is severely degraded. Previous research has addressed this problem by introducing the coherence bias correction technique. However, the precision of phase estimation is still insufficient because of the limited correction capabilities. In this paper, a modified phase estimation approach is proposed. Particularly, by incorporating the information on both interferometric coherence and the number of looks, a significant bias correction to each element of the coherence magnitude matrix is achieved. The bias-corrected coherence matrix is combined with advanced statistically homogeneous pixel selection and time series phase optimization algorithms to obtain the optimal phase series. Both the simulated and Sentinel-1 real data sets are used to demonstrate the superiority of this proposed approach over the traditional phase estimation algorithms. Specifically, the coherence bias can be corrected with considerable accuracy by the proposed scheme. The mean bias of coherence magnitude is reduced by more than 29%, and the standard deviation is reduced by more than 18% over the existing bias correction method. The proposed approach achieves higher accuracy than the current methods over the reconstructed phase series, including smoother interferometric phases and fewer outliers. © 2023 by the authors.","Matrix algebra; Radar measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Bias correction; Coherence matrix; Distributed scatterer; Distributed scatterers; InSAR data; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Phase estimation algorithms; Phase-estimation; Interferometry","coherence matrix; distributed scatterer (DS); multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR); phase estimation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147936358"

Surface deformations in some of these regions have been attributed to aseismic slip-on faults and/or to excessive pumping of groundwater. In this study, we present our investigation on the ground subsidence in Ödemiş town (W. Turkey) located in the Küçük (K.) Menderes Graben where one of the most severe and widespread surface fracturings has been reported. The entire graben is analyzed using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with multi-temporal interferometric SAR techniques. A total of 342 single look complex products acquired in 2015–2018 are processed using the Small Baseline Subset method. Vertical mean velocity fields reveal that K. Menderes Graben is experiencing extensive subsidence at rates reaching as much as 29 cm/year, making it one of the fastest subsiding regions in the world. The spatial correlation between the subsiding regions and the unconsolidated sediments suggests that the subsidence is most probably due to over drafting of the groundwater, which is confirmed by the strong temporal correlation between displacement time series and groundwater level changes. Inelastic/elastic deformation ratios calculated for the entire graben suggest that inelastic deformation is the dominant component in the region, implying an irreversible deformation. Skeletal storage coefficients calculated at well locations also support the idea of inelastic deformation. However, severe inelasticity is not extensive, and the region may still recover from subsidence with correct groundwater management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Central Department; Turkey; Deformation; Digital storage; Groundwater; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Water management; Inelastic deformation; InSAR time series; Kucuk mendere graben; Land subsidence; Radar data; Sentinel-1; Surface fracturing; Surface-deformations; Times series; Western turkey; correlation; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; Time series","InSAR time series; Küçük Menderes Graben; Land subsidence; Sentinel-1; Western Turkey","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127466712"

The information of vegetation type on the water-land ecotone is important for detecting the health of the wetland, and its protection. Seasonal flooding is a key factor in controlling the environment in water-land ecotone. Even preventing direct detection of the flooded vegetation with satellites, seasonal flooding has effects on the distribution of plants, which may provide potential information on vegetation classification with satellites. Therefore, the study induces flooding index in vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with satellites. We applied Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map vegetation in the Dongting Lake with random forest method. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to obtain the flooding index (i.e. inundation frequency), and Sentinel-2 images were applied to acquire the optical characteristic of vegetation. A comparative experiment based on whether the flooding index was added or not during vegetation mapping in the Dongting Lake was carried out to explore the role of flooding index in vegetation mapping. The results concluded that (1) seasonal flooding will hinder vegetation mapping using a single phase of optical information; (2) the classification accuracy of single phase scenario was significantly improved with the aid of flooding index especially in wet season; (3) the classification accuracy can be somewhat improved by adding flooding index for the multi-temporal scenario. The study implies that inundation frequency information can be used for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone, especially for complex regions with insufficient cloud-free satellite images. © 2022 The Author(s)","China; Dongting Lake; Hunan; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Floods; Image classification; Lakes; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Dongting lake; Flooding index; Floodings; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1 & 2 image; Single phasis; Vegetation classification; Vegetation mapping; Water-land ecotone; ecotone; flooding; Sentinel; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; Vegetation mapping","Dongting Lake; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1 & 2 images; Vegetation classification; Water-land ecotone","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138135447"

The Pastaza Marañón Foreland Basin (PMFB), within the Peruvian Amazon, is known to store large amounts of peat, but the remoteness of the region makes field data collection and mapping the distribution of peatland ecotypes challenging. Here we review methods for developing high accuracy peatland maps for the PMFB using a combination of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing in a machine learning classifier. The new map produced has 95% overall accuracy with low errors of commission (1–6%) and errors of omission (0–15%) for individual peatland classes. We attribute this improvement in map accuracy over previous maps of the region to the inclusion of high and low water season SAR images which provides information about seasonal hydrological dynamics. The new multi-date map showed an increase in area of more than 200% for pole forest peatland (6% error) compared to previous maps, which had high errors for that ecotype (20–36%). Likewise, estimates of C stocks were 35% greater than previously reported (3.238 Pg in Draper et al. (2014) to 4.360 Pg in our study). Most of the increase is attributed to pole forest peatland which contributed 58% (2.551 Pg) of total C, followed by palm swamp (34%, 1.476 Pg). In an assessment of deforestation from 2010 to 2018 in the PMFB, we found 89% of the deforestation was in seasonally flooded forest and 43% of deforestation was occurring within 1 km of a river or road. Peatlands were found the least affected by deforestation and there was not a noticeable trend over time. With development of improved transportation routes and population pressures, future land use change is likely to put South American tropical peatlands at risk, making continued monitoring a necessity. Accurate mapping of peatland ecotypes with high resolution (<30 m) sensors linked with field data are needed to reduce uncertainties in estimates of the distribution of C stocks, and to aid in deforestation monitoring. © Copyright © 2021 Bourgeau-Chavez, Grelik, Battaglia, Leisman, Chimner, Hribljan, Lilleskov, Draper, Zutta, Hergoualc’h, Bhomia and Lähteenoja.","Amazonia; Peru; Matthiola; carbon; deforestation; machine learning; PALSAR; peatland; remote sensing; spatial distribution; tropical region","Amazon; carbon; deforestation; L-band radar; PALSAR; peatland; tropical","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119424650"

As a result, the city is suffering from severe surface displacement, which is posing an increasing threat to the safety of the buildings. However, up to date, there is no comprehensive and high-precision displacement map to characterize the spatiotemporal surface displacement patterns in the city of Lanzhou. In this study, satellite-based observations, including optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing, were jointly used to characterize the landscape and topography changes in Lanzhou between 1997 and 2020 and investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of the surface displacement associated with the large-scale MECC projects from 2015 December to March 2021. First, we retrieved the landscape changes in Lanzhou during the last 23 years using multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. Results illustrate that the landscape in local areas of Lanzhou has been dramatically changed as a result of the large-scale MECC projects and rapid urbanization. Then, we optimized the ordinary time series InSAR processing procedure by a “dynamic estimation of digital elevation model (DEM) errors” step added before displacement inversion to avoid the false displacement signals caused by DEM errors. The DEM errors and the high-precision surface displacement maps between December 2015 and March 2021 were calculated with 124 ascending and 122 descending Sentinel-1 SAR images. By combining estimated DEM errors and optical images, we detected and mapped historical MECC areas in the study area since 2000, retrieved the excavated and filling areas of the MECC projects, and evaluated their areas and volumes as well as the thickness of the filling loess. Results demonstrated that the area and volume of the excavated regions were basically equal to that of the filling regions, and the maximum thickness of the filling loess was greater than 90 m. Significant non-uniform surface displacements were observed in the filling regions of the MECC projects, with the maximum cumulative displacement lower than-40 cm. 2D displacement results revealed that surface displacement associated with the MECC project was dominated by settlements. From the correlation analysis between the displacement and the filling thickness, we found that the displacement magnitude was positively correlated with the thickness of the filling loess. This finding indicated that the compaction and consolidation process of the filling loess largely dominated the surface displacement. Our findings are of paramount importance for the urban planning and construction on the Loess Plateau region in which large-scale MECC projects are being developed. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, an approach using ratio-based nonlocal information (RNLI) is proposed for change detection in multitemporal SAR images. First, the RNLI is extracted from a spatial-temporal nonlocal neighborhood where the similarity of two pixels in the nonlocal neighborhood is well characterized by the proposed ratio-based Gaussian kernel function. The parameters of RNLI: noise level and matching window size are adaptively determined to avoid the uncertainty of the change detection result caused by user experience. Second, the difference image is generated by using the RNLI and the ratio operator. Finally, the change map is obtained by segmenting the difference image with a threshold.

However, due to the early development of Taipei City, the development area of the bare site tends to be crowded and turned to slope land for development. The safety of hillside houses and roads is critical due to the increasing population density. The objective is to discover the deformation potential of slopes and use remote sensing methods to detect landslides in the early stage. The current techniques are image interpretation combined with field surveys. Remote sensing techniques can detect surface deformation trends, such as potential large-scale landslide investigations, slope deformation, surface subsidence, seismic deformation observation, volcanic deformation observation, mining area subsidence observation, etc. This study uses differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar analysis technology to conduct a multi-temporal investigation and analyze possible variable slopes to get surface deformation trends to obtain long-term deformation trends. Conjunction with the comparison and analysis of current survey methods and observation data has been executed. The number of deformed points and deformation amount has been used with the slope unit to classify slope potential. To understand the potential landslides in Neihu, Taipei City, the study area was conducted in 2017 with remote measurement technology.

A volume of approximately 3.9 × 106 m3 travelled approximately 1100 m in 27 days, blocking part of the Min River. Multi-temporal InSAR monitoring and interpretation of high-resolution optical images were used to map different phase of mass movements (including rock fall, topple, slide, and flowslide) to characterize the pre-failure deformation of the earthflow. Analysis of displacement patterns indicates that initiation of the earthflow is closely correlated with road construction, intense and long-lasting rainfall (443 mm from April 1, to July 19, 2019), and seismic activity. The potential to forecast the time of failure based on pre-failure deformation patterns observed by InSAR monitoring is demonstrated. Three types of pre-failure deformation are distinguished: steady creep, fluctuating creep, and accelerating creep.

This requires an individual approach which can be time-consuming and costly to do at regular intervals. Remote sensing by satellite has been widely applied for automatic monitoring of the earth surface with many different applications. Specifically, InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) can provide measurements of displacement in the line-of-sight of the satellite over wide geographical areas, to millimetre-scale precision. InSAR can be deployed to take measurements at an interval of multiple days (rather than multiple years) and provide some insights on the behaviour of structures in between inspections. It can also be deployed on city-scale, but requires the development of automatic techniques to spot unusual behaviours and potential problems without manually checking every measurement point out of thousands of points. Deep Learning technologies have risen as the state-of-the-art methods for machine learning due to their ability to learn complex features and model complex non-linear behaviours. In this paper we explore the possibility of adapting a Deep Learning approach to multi-temporal InSAR with the aim of developing methods towards automatic structural health monitoring at scale. © 2021 International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure: Transferring Research into Practice, SHMII.

A general formulation of the least-squares (LS) optimization problem, representing the SB methods implementation’s core, was adopted in this research study. A particular emphasis was placed on the effects of time-uncorrelated phase unwrapping mistakes and time-inconsistent phase disturbances in sets of SB interferograms, leading to artefacts in the attainable InSAR products. Moreover, this study created the theoretical basis for further developments aimed at quantifying the error budget of the time-uncorrelated phase unwrapping mistakes and studying time-inconsistent phase artefacts for the generation of InSAR data products.

For instance, they could be used in order to evaluate and assess civil infrastructures at scale, which is costly due to the fact that typically the existing methods rely on in-situ evaluation. Over the last decade Deep Learning technologies have risen as the state of the art methods for many different machine learning problems due to the fact that they can learn complex features and model complex non-linear behaviours. In this paper we will explore the possibility of using Deep Learning technologies over remote sensing data with the aim of structure health monitoring at scale. We will compare the performance of new Deep Learning technologies with regards to other traditional machine learning methods. For this purpose, we will use InSAR (Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar) data which allow us to measure cumulative surface displacement in the line of sight of the sensor with millimetric accuracy. We will analyse multi temporal InSAR data in order to model ground subsidence.

Notably, in the case of large-scale disasters (e.g., tsunamis and earthquakes), in which a response is highly time-critical, images from both data modalities can complement each other to accurately convey the full damage condition in the disaster aftermath. However, due to several factors, such as weather and satellite coverage, which data modality will be the first available for rapid disaster response efforts is often uncertain. Hence, novel methodologies that can utilize all accessible EO datasets are essential for disaster management. In this study, we developed a global multimodal and multitemporal dataset for building damage mapping. We included building damage characteristics from three disaster types, namely, earthquakes, tsunamis, and typhoons, and considered three building damage categories. The global dataset contains high-resolution (HR) optical imagery and high-to-moderate-resolution SAR data acquired before and after each disaster. Using this comprehensive dataset, we analyzed five data modality scenarios for damage mapping: single-mode (optical and SAR datasets), cross-modal (pre-disaster optical and post-disaster SAR datasets), and mode fusion scenarios. We defined a damage mapping framework for semantic segmentation of damaged buildings based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. We also compared our approach to another state-of-the-art model for damage mapping. The results indicated that our dataset, together with a deep learning network, enabled acceptable predictions for all the data modality scenarios. We also found that the results from cross-modal mapping were comparable to the results obtained from a fusion sensor and optical mode analysis. © 2021 The Author(s)","Varanidae; Buildings; Convolution; Disaster prevention; Earthquakes; Emergency services; Mapping; Observatories; Remote sensing; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; Building damage; Convolutional neural network; Cross-modal; Damage mapping; Disaster damage mapping; Multi-modal; Multi-temporal; Multimodal remote sensing; Optical-; Radar datasets; algorithm; building; damage mechanics; data set; disaster management; EOS; imaging method; machine learning; mapping method; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; Deep neural networks","Deep convolutional neural network; Disaster damage mapping; Multimodal remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102615227"

Identify-ing ARGs has mainly relied on visual interpretation of their geomorphic characteristics with optical remote sensing images, while mapping ARGs from their kinematic features has also become popular in recent years. However, a thorough comparison of geomorphic-and kinematic-based inventories of ARGs has not been carried out. In this study, we employed a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to derive the mean annual surface displacement velocity over the Daxue Shan, Southeast Tibet Plateau. We then compiled a rock glacier inventory by synergistically interpreting the InSAR-derived surface displacements and geomorphic features based on Google Earth images. Our InSAR-assist kinematic-based inventory (KBI) was further compared with a pre-existing geomorphic-based inventory (GBI) of rock glaciers in Daxue Shan. The results show that our InSAR-assist inventory consists of 344 ARGs, 36% (i.e., 125) more than that derived from the geomorphic-based method (i.e., 251). Only 32 ARGs in the GBI are not included in the KBI. Among the 219 ARGs detected by both approaches, the ones with area differences of more than 20% account for about 32% (i.e., 70 ARGs). The mean downslope velocities of ARGs calculated from InSAR are between 2.8 and 107.4 mm·a−1. Our comparative analyses show that ARGs mapping from the InSAR-based kinematic approach is more efficient and accurate than the geomorphic-based approach. Nonetheless, the completeness of the InSAR-assist KBI is affected by the SAR data ac-quisition time, signal decorrelation, geometric distortion of SAR images, and the sensitivity of the InSAR measurement to ground deformation. We suggest that the kinematic-based approach should be utilized in future ARGs-based studies such as regional permafrost distribution assessment and water storage estimates. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the radar technique is not affected by weather conditions, it has a unique advantage in obtaining snow coverage and its bulk parameters. Numerous studies utilized the multitemporal algorithm to identify wet snow coverage, but it suffers from a simple equation and a fixed threshold, resulting in the obvious underestimation at the end of ablation period. As such, this study firstly explores the cause of the significant underestimation through sensitivity analysis (SA), and then presents a wet snow detection approach based on this analysis. The novel approach implemented the Otsu thresholding method to obtain the adaptive thresholds for various land categories, and further refined the wet snow recognition by using terrain information. To verify the feasibility of the method, one Sentinel-1 dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image acquired from March 23, 2019 was selected as the wet snow data. The extent of wet snow was delineated by multitemporal algorithm, combining with land cover type and topographic data. Compared with previous methods (77.2%), the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is up to 94.9%. The results show that the method has a superior recognition on wet snow at the end of snow melting period, and notably reduces the underestimation.  © 2021 IEEE.","Melting; Radar imaging; Sensitivity analysis; Snow; Synthetic aperture radar; Bulk parameters; Land cover; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal algorithm; Radar data; Simple++; Snow coverage; Snow covers; Snow melt; Wet snow; Topography","land cover; multitemporal algorithm; SAR; topography; Wet snow","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119084377"

Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was used for the detection of flood prone area to calibrate HEC-RAS, due to the lack of data validation in the New Cairo City, Egypt. The thresholding water detection method was applied to two Sentinel-1 images, one pre- and one post-flash flood event from April 24 to 27, 2018. The threshold method was used to detect water areas from SAR Sentinel-1 images. Feature statistical agreement F1 and F2 values ranged from 73.4 to 77.7% between water areas extracted based on backscattering values between 19.97 and 16.53 in decibels (dB) and reference water areas obtained using an optical image of the Sentinel-2 satellite. The similarity between simulated HEC-RAS two-dimensional (2D) of water areas and reference water areas based on SAR data ranged between 74.2 and 89.7% using feature statistical agreement values F1 and F2. It provides a clear suggestion that, in the absence of field observations, SAR data can be used to calibrate the model. Two flood hazard maps created based on water velocity and depth were obtained from HEC-RAS 2D simulation. The obtained maps indicated that 11% of the roads and 50% of the buildings in New Cairo City are exposed to high hazard areas. Furthermore, 28% of the bare land is situated in a very high vulnerability area. We recommend the use of obtained hazard map in supporting emergency response, and designing effective emergency plans. © 2021 The Authors.

Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity, and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. Prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understory vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires. Data on prescribed burning are crucial for evaluating whether land management targets have been reached. This research developed a methodology to quantify the effects of prescribed burns using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in the forests of southeastern Australia. C-band SAR datasets were specifically used to statistically explore changes in radar backscatter coefficients with the intensity of prescribed burns. Two modeling approaches based on pre-and post-fire ratios were applied for evaluating prescribed burn impacts. The effects of prescribed burns were documented with an overall accuracy of 82.3% using cross-polarized backscatter (VH) SAR data under dry conditions. The VV polarization indicated some potential to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The findings in this study indicate that the C-band SAR backscatter coefficient has the potential to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed burns due to its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure. © 2021 by the authors.

Experiments were carried out using Sentinel-1 TOPS SAR data and field observations in one of the State General Directorate of Agriculture Enterprise farms in Konya (Central Turkey). The phenological stages of maize, sunflower, and wheat have been analyzed and compared to coherence and backscatter time series of Sentinel-1 data on multiple tracks and polarizations. The results evidence a strong correlation between different phenological stages of the crops and the InSAR coherence. Specifically, the observed coherence values are the highest for the maize (γasc, desc = 0.47) and sunflower (γasc = 0.49, γdesc = 0.48) after plowing the fields and seeding the crops. The coherence decreases with the plants' growth and reaches the lowest values for maize, sunflower, and wheat (γ = 0.08, γ = 0.09 and γ = 0.07, respectively) when the ground is completely covered by plants. Then, a coherence increase is observed after the harvesting time (γ = 0.51, γ = 0.50 and γ = 0.42 for maize, sunflower, and wheat, respectively). In terms of multi-temporal SAR backscattering, we find significant changes of the σ0 values during the crops' growing stages due to the changes in their leaf geometry and physical structure. The highest σ0 values for the maize, sunflower, and wheat are obtained as −9.18 dB, −5.24 dB and −10.05 dB, respectively, for the ascending orbit, in mid growing stages. Results show the improved capacity of SAR-driven measurements for agriculture monitoring and precise farming activities when InSAR coherence and backscattering are synergistically used. Specifically, the coherence allows estimating the main growth stages of the different crop types. Moreover, SAR backscattering provides reliable information on the whole growth stages during the agricultural season, and it might be profitably exploited for crop assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Konya [Turkey]; Turkey; Helianthus; Meleagris gallopavo; Backscattering; Coherent light; Coherent scattering; Crops; Seed; Backscattering analysis; Coherence analysis; Growth stages; InSAR; Interferometric coherence; Multitemporal sentinel-1; Phenological stage; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar backscatterings; Synthetic aperture radar intensity; agricultural production; backscatter; farming system; flower; leaf area; maize; plowing; profitability; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; wheat; Synthetic aperture radar","Agriculture; Coherence; InSAR; Multitemporal Sentinel-1; SAR intensities","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103970589"

In the Alboran Sea, this phenomenon is very common and causes many problems for residential resorts and road infrastructures in coastal areas. In the last two decades, such slope instability processes were the subject of many studies, which employed multidisciplinary approaches to understand their underlying mechanisms and surficial kinematics in Southern Spain and elsewhere in the Mediterranean. However, advanced and new investigation methods and techniques used in these studies have never been performed in Northern Morocco despite the geomorphological, geological and climatic resemblance between the two regions. In this paper we analyze the mechanisms and processes controlling the Tamegaret slow-moving deep-seated landslide (Northern Morocco) in order to bridge this knowledge gap and to understand landslide slope dynamics on their regional context. To do so, Electrical resistivity Tomography, field investigations and multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) were performed to characterize slope instability processes at the study area. The interpretation of Historic aerial photographs and UAV surveys was also conducted to study the major redistribution of mass caused by recent road widening work at the landslide headscarp. Results show that the Tamegaret landslide owes its existence to deep creep processes controlled by a rock flow type gravitational deformation. Extensional tectonic structures and marine erosion processes that eliminate landslide deposits from the foot area constitute the most relevant control factors of this dynamic. InSAR results show that this deep-seated landslide is currently (2017–2019) characterized by very slow displacement rates (2–3 cm/year maximum). Yet, the substantial deformation observed both in the field and on aerial/satellite photographs suggests that the acceleration occurred during the road-widening work which caused major changes to the natural topography in the period (2009–2012). This deformation phase was manifested by local shoreline advancement at the landslide foot area. Such results show that studying historic shoreline variations can be an effective low-cost time-saving tool allowing the reconstruction of active landslide kinematics in coastal areas. On a regional scale, findings of this study highlight the resemblance between the coasts of Southern Spain and Northern Morocco in terms of (i) the geomorphological processes controlling the coastal slope dynamics at the region; (ii) the displacement rates measured in Tamegaret compared to other unstable slopes in the Northern shore of the Alboran Sea and (iii) the bad-engineering on old dormant landslides which compromises their stability. Therefore, we suggest limiting construction work on coastal hillslopes of Northern Morocco in order to prevent bad construction practices from causing economic losses in the Southern shoreline of the Alboran Sea as well. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Alboran Sea; Mediterranean Sea; Morocco; aerial photograph; data interpretation; deformation; human activity; landslide; satellite imagery; shoreline; slope stability; synthetic aperture radar; unmanned vehicle","Deep-seated landslide; ERT; Mediterranean coast; PSInSAR; Shoreline evolution; UAV","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111331971"

The study area chosen is the Cameroon Estuary. This area represents a major ecological transition in the sub-region with the presence of protected natural reserves (mangroves, dense forest, wetlands) but also a strong anthropic activity (construction, agriculture, degraded forest). The methodological approach consisted of a chain of pre-processing and visual image analysis, followed by a combination of the bands from each sensor, a supervised Random Forest classification to draft a land use map and finally a digitization of the coastline. Overall, the results show that the classification with the Sentinel2 images using 10 bands and adding 4 vegetation indices is slightly more accurate (95.75 %) than the classification with the 13 initial bands (91.78 %). The classification performed with the Sentinel-1A multi-temporal image series (dual polarization (VV, VH) and VV/VH ratio) leads to an accuracy of 78.44 %. The combination of Sentinel-2 A&B bands (10 bands and 4 indices) and Sentinel-1 improves the results and leads to an accuracy of 98.76 %. Our results also show that the use of multi-temporal image time series significantly improves the classification accuracy compared to the use of a single image (mono-date), and this for both sensors, i.e. an additional gain of 13 % and 10 % respectively for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1. However, this gain remains small for temporally stable classes. The results of the coastline evolution analysis show that the Cameroon estuary is disturbed by different levels of erosion (Cape Cameroon, North Manoka Island, Sanaga River mouth), and accretion (Limbe, and South Manoka Island) and also by weak internal variations. The fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data in the discrimination of land use classes, has shown that the construction zones are the most vulnerable to coastal erosion. On the other hand, the presence of vegetation (mangrove, forest) stabilizes and protects the coast from possible risks of this nature. © 2021 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

Many experimental studies in previous literature proved that increasing the number of temporal SAR images (time dimension) or polarimetric feature parameters (feature dimension) can improve the accuracy of SAR crop identification. However, the comparative analysis of the impact of these two factors on the accuracy of temporal SAR crop classification is still a problem. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper collected a total of 11 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data and 5 RADARSAT-2 full polarization SAR data for testing purposes. The widely used random forest classification method was adopted for crop classification research, and the importance of the number of SAR images and the number of polarimetric features were explored. Compared with dual-polarization SAR data, the overall classification accuracy in a single month with fully polarimetric SAR data can be improved by 17.94% at most. Moreover, the overall classification accuracy using only 5 RADARSAT-2 images can reach at 95.13%, which is 3.05% and 0.84 % higher than that of 5 and 11 Sentinel-1 data, respectively.  © 2021 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Image enhancement; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Crop classification; Dual-polarization SAR; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric features; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; SAR data; SAR Images; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar","crop classification; Multi-temporal; polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); RADARSAT-2; Sentinel-1","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119057778"

In order to reduce the damage, preventive maintenance is desirable. In contrast, surveying localized ground surface changes by hand is difficult. Therefore, effective and efficient implementation of national land monitoring is required. Nowadays, the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is expected to provide a comprehensive view of the earth's surface, independent of weather conditions and time of day. Differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique has been widely known as wide range of land subsidence measurement method. In particular, Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) can accurately measure wide range of land subsidence by using multi-temporal SAR images. Based on the accurately estimated ground displacement velocity, we can detect small ground displacement behavior before a disaster occurs, which may be useful for disaster management. In this paper, PSInSAR analysis was conducted around the Takeo Junction (JCT) in western Japan, where a large landslide occurred in the past due to a heavy rainfall disaster and the road surface was uplifted significantly. After that, we conducted a basic study on the development of a method for detecting signs of disaster based on ground displacement velocity. As a result, we can detect the behavior of the ground pushing up the road surface before a landslide occurs. This result suggests the possibility of using satellite SAR imagery to detect signs of a disaster. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Global warming; Interferometry; Landslides; Preventive maintenance; Radar imaging; Rain; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Satellite imagery; Space applications; Space optics; Space-based radar; Subsidence; Detection of disaster area; Disaster areas; Ground displacement; Heavy rainfall; Heavy rainfall disaster; Multi-temporal; Persistent scatterer interferometry; Persistent scatterers; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar images; Synthetic aperture radar","detection of disaster areas; heavy rainfall disaster; PSI; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127413165"

We investigate the backscattering characteristics of washed-away or collapsed bridges from the multi-temporal high-resolution SAR intensity imagery introduced in our previous studies. In this study, we address the challenge of building a model to identify collapsed bridges using five change features obtained from multi-temporal SAR intensity images.

Twelve models were trained, using different numbers of features as input in random forest and logistic regression methods. Comparing the accuracies of the validation sets, the random forest model trained with the two mixed events using all the features showed the highest capability to extract collapsed bridges.

After smoothing the images to suppress noise, a sample selection method is defined to train the HELM for each image, in which the feature extraction is respectively implemented for heterogeneous images and the parameters need not be fine-tuned. Then, the multi-temporal feature maps extracted from the trained HELM are segmented to obtain classification maps and then compared to generate a change map with changed types. The proposed method is validated experimentally by using one set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images obtained from Sentinel-1, one set of optical images acquired from Google Earth, and two sets of heterogeneous SAR and optical images. The results show that compared to state-of-the-art change detection methods, the proposed method can improve the accuracy of change detection by more than 8% in terms of the kappa coefficient and greatly reduce run time regardless of the type of images used.

Several studies have demonstrated the excellent capability of radar and optical imagery for crop mapping and biophysical parameter estimation. This paper aims at modeling the crop biophysical parameters, e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) and biomass, using a combination of radar and optical Earth observations. We extracted several radar features from polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and Vegetation Indices (VIs) from optical images to model crops’ LAI and dry biomass. Then, the mutual correlations between these features and Random Forest feature importance were calculated. We considered two scenarios to estimate crop parameters. First, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were utilized to estimate two crop biophysical parameters. To this end, crops’ dry biomass and LAI were estimated using three input data; (1) SAR polarimetric features; (2) spectral VIs; (3) integrating both SAR and optical features. Second, a deep artificial neural network was created. These input data were fed to the mentioned algorithms and evaluated using the in-situ measurements. These observations of three cash crops, including soybean, corn, and canola, have been collected over Manitoba, Canada, during the Soil Moisture Active Validation Experimental 2012 (SMAPVEX-12) campaign. The results showed that GB and XGB have great potential in parameter estimation and remarkably improved accuracy. Our results also demonstrated a significant improvement in the dry biomass and LAI estimation compared to the previous studies. For LAI, the validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was reported as 0.557 m2 /m2 for canola using GB, and 0.298 m2 /m2 for corn using GB, 0.233 m2 /m2 for soybean using XGB. RMSE was reported for dry biomass as 26.29 g/m2 for canola utilizing SVR, 57.97 g/m2 for corn using RF, and 5.00 g/m2 for soybean using GB. The results revealed that the deep artificial neural network had a better potential to estimate crop parameters than the ML algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, we focus our analysis on three periods: a) the time interval following the 2014 flank eruption, b) the July–August 2019 eruption and c) the following post-eruptive phase. To do this, we take advantage from an unprecedented set of space-borne and ground-based SAR data collected from April 2015 up to November 2019 along two (one ascending and one descending) Sentinel-1 (S-1) tracks, as well as, in the same period, by two ground-based systems installed along the Sciara del Fuoco northern rim. Such data availability permitted us to first characterize the volcano long-term 3D deformation behavior of the pre-eruptive period (April 2015–June 2019), by jointly inverting the space-borne and ground-based InSAR measurements. Then, the GB-SAR measurements allowed us to investigate the sin-eruptive time span (3rd July 2019 – 30th August 2019) which revealed rapid deformation episodes (e.g. more than 30 mm/h just 2 min before the 3rd July 2019 explosion) associated with the eruptive activity, that cannot be detected with the weekly S-1 temporal sampling. Finally, the S-1 measurements permitted to better constrain the post 2019 eruption deformations (31st August 2019 – 5th November 2019), which are mainly located outside the GB-SAR sensed area. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the joint exploitation of the InSAR measurements obtained through satellite and terrestrial SAR systems, highlighting their strong complementarity to map and interpret the deformation phenomena affecting volcanic areas. © 2021 The Authors","Italy; Lipari Islands; Messina [Sicily]; Sicily; Stromboli; Sciara; Stromboli; Deformation; Synthetic aperture radar; Volcanoes; GB-InSAR; Ground based; InSAR; Multi-temporal; P-SBAS; Sentinel-1; Space-borne; Stromboli volcano; Strombolus; Volcano monitoring; ground-based measurement; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; three-dimensional modeling; volcanic eruption; Data fusion","Data-fusion; GB-InSAR; InSAR; P-SBAS; Sentinel-1; Stromboli","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105360805"

After that, S-1 signals were statistically compared with all crop parameters considering the impact of pass orbit, irrigation and two vegetative periods in order to identify the best S-1 configuration for estimating crop parameters. Interesting S-1 backscattering behaviors were observed with the various wheat parameters after separating irrigation impacts and vegetative periods. For the orbit 30 (mean incidence angle of 33.6◦ ); results show that the best S-1 configurations (with coefficient of determination (R2 ) > 0.7) were obtained using the VV and VH + VV as a function of the He, TDM and WC, over irrigated fields and during the second vegetative period. For the orbit 132 (mean incidence angle of 43.4◦ ), the highest dynamic sensitivities (R2 > 0.8) were observed for the VV and VH + VV configurations with He, TDM and TFM over irrigated fields during the first vegetative period. Overall, the sensitivity of S-1 data to wheat variables depended on the radar configuration (orbits and polarizations), the vegetative periods and was often better over irrigated fields in comparison with rainfed ones. Significant improvements of the determination coefficients were obtained when the cumulative (VH + VV) index was considered for He (R2 > 0.9), TDM (R2 > 0.9) and TFM (R2 > 0.75) for irrigated fields, all along the crop cycle. The estimate of WC was more limited (R2 > 0.6) and remained limited to the second period of the vegetation cycle (from flowering onwards). Whatever parameters were considered, the relative errors never exceeded 23%. This study has shown the importance of considering the agricultural practices (irrigation) and vegetative periods to effectively monitor some wheat parameters with S-1 data. © 2021 by the authors.

The availability of dense time series enables the analysis of the SAR temporal signatures and exploitation of these signatures for classification purposes. Frequent backscatter observations allow derivation of temporally filtered time series that reinforce the effect of changes in vegetation phenology by limiting the influence of short-term changes related to environmental conditions. Recent studies have already shown the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data for forest mapping, forest type classification (coniferous or broadleaved forest) as well as for derivation of phenological variables at local to national scales. In the present study, we tested the viability of a recently pub-lished multi-temporal SAR classification method for continental scale forest mapping by applying it over Europe and evaluating the derived forest type and tree cover density maps against the Eu-ropean-wide Copernicus High Resolution Layers (HRL) forest datasets and national-scale forest maps from twelve countries. The comparison with the Copernicus HRL datasets revealed high correspondence over the majority of the European continent with overall accuracies of 86.1% and 73.2% for the forest/non-forest and forest type maps, respectively, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83 for tree cover density map. Moreover, the evaluation of both datasets against the national forest maps showed that the obtained accuracies of Sentinel-1 forest maps are almost within range of the HRL datasets. The Sentinel-1 forest/non-forest and forest type maps obtained average overall accuracies of 88.2% and 82.7%, respectively, as compared to 90.0% and 87.2% obtained by the Copernicus HRL datasets. This result is especially promising due to the facts that these maps can be produced with a high degree of automation and that only a single year of Sentinel-1 data is required as op-posed to the Copernicus HRL forest datasets that are updated every three years. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering unfavorable factors, such as inherent topography-induced effects and speckle noise in SAR images, it is challenging to accurately map and track the dynamic evolution of the glacial lakes by using multi-temporal SAR images. This paper presents an improved neighborhood-based ratio method utilizing a time series of SAR images to identify the boundaries of the glacial lakes and detect their spatiotemporal changes. The proposed method was applied to monitor the dynamic evolution of the two glacial lakes with periodic water discharge at the terminus of the Gongba Glacier in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau by utilizing 144 Sentinel-1A SAR images collected between October of 2014 and November of 2020. We first generated the reference intensity image (RII) by averaging all the SAR images collected when the water in the glacial lakes was wholly discharged, then calculated the neighborhood-based ratio between RII and each SAR intensity image, and finally identified the boundaries of the glacial lakes by a ratio threshold determined statistically. The time series of areas of the glacial lakes were estimated in this way, and the dates for water recharging and discharging were accordingly determined. The testing results showed that the water of the two glacial lakes began to be recharged in April and reached their peak in August and then remained stable dynamically until they began to shrink in October and were discharged entirely in February of the following year. We observed the expansion process with annual growth rates of 3.19% and 12.63% for these two glacial lakes, respectively, and monitored a glacial lake outburst flood event in July 2018. The validation by comparing with the results derived from Sentinel-2A/B optical images indicates that the accuracy for identifying the boundaries of the glacial lakes with Sentinel-1A SAR images can reach up to 96.49%. Generally, this contribution demonstrates the reliability and precision of SAR images to provide regular updates for the dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes. © 2021 by the authors.

Most presented change detection methods are conducted using couples of SAR amplitude images. However, a prior date of surface change is required to select a feasible image pair. We propose an automatic spatio-temporal change detection method by identifying the temporary coherent scatterers. Based on amplitude time series, x2-test and iterative single pixel change detection are proposed to identify all step-times: the moments of the surface change. Then the parameters, e.g., deformation velocity and relative height, are estimated and corresponding coherent periods are identified by using interferometric phase time series. With identified temporary coherent scatterers, different types of temporal surface changes can be classified using the location of the coherent periods and spatial significant changes are identified combining point density and F values. The main advantage of our method is automatically detecting spatio-temporal surface changes without prior information. Experimental results by the proposed method show that both appearing and disappearing buildings with their step-times are successfully identified and results by ascending and descending SAR images show a good agreement. © 1990-2011 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.","Interferometry; Iterative methods; Light scattering; Radar imaging; Time series; Amplitude analysis; Change detection; Coherent scatterers; Detection methods; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Spatio-temporal; Surface changes; Temporary coherent scatterer; Synthetic aperture radar","amplitude analysis; change detection; multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); temporary coherent scatterer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123184393"

However, most existing methods only focus on extracting road information from single temporal intensity images, which may cause a decrease in image resolution due to the use of spatial filter methods to avoid coherent speckle noises. Some newly developed methods take into account the multi-temporal information in the preprocessing stage to filter the coherent speckle noise in the SAR imagery. They ignore the temporal characteristic of road objects such as the temporal consistency for the road objects in the multitemporal SAR images that cover the same area and are taken at adjacent times, causing the limitation in detection performance. In this paper, we propose a multiscale and multitemporal network (MSMTHRNet) for road detection from SAR imagery, which contains the temporal consistency enhancement module (TCEM) and mul-tiscale fusion module (MSFM) that are based on attention mechanism. In particular, we propose the TCEM to make full use of multitemporal information, which contains temporal attention submodule that applies attention mechanism to capture temporal contextual information. We enforce temporal consistency constraint by the TCEM to obtain the enhanced feature representations of SAR imagery that help to distinguish the real roads. Since the width of roads are various, incorporating multiscale features is a promising way to improve the results of road detection. We propose the MSFM that applies learned weights to combine predictions of different scale features. Since there is no public dataset, we build a multitemporal road detection dataset to evaluate our methods. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation network HRNetV2 is used as a baseline method to compare with MSHRNet that only has MSFM and the MSMTHRNet. The MSHRNet(TAF) whose input is the SAR image after the temporal filter is adopted to compare with our proposed MSMTHRNet. On our test dataset, MSHRNet and MSMTHRNet improve over the HRNetV2 by 2.1% and 14.19%, respectively, in the IoU metric and by 3.25% and 17.08%, respectively, in the APLS metric. MSMTHRNet improves over the MSMTHRNet(TAF) by 8.23% and 8.81% in the IoU metric and APLS metric, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposes a modified polarimetric decomposition framework to retrieve SM from multi-incidence and multitemporal PolSAR observations. The framework is constructed by combining the X-Bragg model, the extended double Fresnel scattering model and the generalised volume scattering model (GVSM). Compared with traditional decomposition models, the proposed framework considers the depolarisation of dihedral scattering and the diverse vegetation contribution. Under the assumption that SM is invariant for the PolSAR observations at two different incidence angles and that vegetation scattering does not change between two consecutive measurements, analytical parameter solutions, including the dielectric constant of soil and crop stem, can be obtained by solving multivariable nonlinear equations. The proposed framework is applied to the time series of L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012. In this study, we assess retrieval performance by comparing the inversion results with in-situ measurements over bean, canola, corn, soybean, wheat and winter wheat areas and comparing the different performance of SM retrieval between the GVSM and Yamaguchi volume scattering models. Given that SM estimation is inherently influenced by crop phenology and empirical parameters which are introduced in the scattering models, we also investigate the influence of surface depolarisation angle and co-pol phase difference on SM estimation. Results show that the proposed retrieval framework provides an inversion accuracy of RMSE<6.0% and a correlation of R≥0.6 with an inversion rate larger than 90%. Over wheat and winter wheat fields, a correlation of 0.8 between SM estimates and measurements is observed when the surface scattering is dominant. Specifically, stem permittivity, which is retrieved synchronously with SM also shows a linear relationship with crop biomass and plant water content over bean, corn, soybean and wheat fields. We also find that a priori knowledge of surface depolarisation angle, co-pol phase difference and adaptive volume scattering could help to improve the performance of the proposed SM retrieval framework. However, the GVSM model is still not fully adaptive because the co-pol power ratio of volume scattering is potentially influenced by ground scattering. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Yamaguchi; Brassica napus var. napus; Glycine max; Antennas; Crops; Nonlinear equations; Parameter estimation; Polarimeters; Soil surveys; Surface scattering; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; %moisture; Multi-incidence; Multi-temporal; Performance; Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Radar observations; Scattering model; Soil moisture retrievals; Volume scattering; agricultural land; biomass; crop plant; decomposition analysis; in situ measurement; measurement method; observational method; phenology; soil moisture; soil-vegetation interaction; synthetic aperture radar; Soil moisture","Multi-incidence; Multitemporal; Polarimetric decomposition; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105496519"

Field techniques adopted for soil moisture measurements are laborious and time-consuming. In a watershed, the soil moisture varies both spatially and temporally. Making continuous on-field observations simultaneously at several locations is practically impossible for large watersheds. Soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques is considered a viable alternative. In this study, it is proposed to apply a modified water cloud model for surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval over partially vegetated regions. This method combines the microwave data obtained from Sentinel-I and optical data obtained from Landsat Operational Land Image (OLI) for SSM estimation. It is necessary to remove the effect of vegetation moisture content for better SSM estimation. Therefore, the index derived from the Landsat OLI spectral bands is applied to build a model for the vegetation water content estimation. A modified water cloud model (MWCM) is developed by integrating the vegetation index with the original water cloud model. In this study, the backscatter coefficients measured using the C-band (5.405 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor onboard the Sentinel-IA satellite has been used. The developed MWCM has been used to prepare multi-temporal SSM maps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Backscattering; Cloud computing; Moisture determination; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Vegetation; Watersheds; Backscatter coefficients; Hydrological models; LANDSAT; Modified water cloud model; Remote sensing data; Soil moisture measurement; Surface soil moisture; Surface soil moisture retrieval; Surface-soil-moisture estimation; Water cloud models; Synthetic aperture radar","Backscatter coefficients; Modified water cloud model; Surface soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131138254"

The farmlands are divided into small pieces that consider the different behaviors of farmers for their planting contents in Taiwan. Hence, the conventional image classification process cannot produce good outcomes. The crop phenological information will be a core factor to multi-period image data. Accordingly, the study intends to resolve the previous problem by using three different SPOT6 satellite images and nine Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar images, which were used to calculate features such as texture and indicator information, in 2019. Considering that a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) index (i) can integrate different image data sources, (ii) can integrate data of different lengths, and (iii) can generate information with time characteristics, this type of index can resolve certain classification problems with long-term crop classification and monitoring. More specifically, this study used the time series data analysis of DTW to produce “multi-scale time series feature similarity indicators”. We used three approaches (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Decision Tree) to classify paddy patches into two groups: (a) the first group did not apply a DTW index, and (b) the second group extracted conflict predicted data from (a) to apply a DTW index. The outcomes from the second group performed better than the first group in regard to overall accuracy (OA) and kappa. Among those classifiers, the Neural Network approach had the largest improvement of OA and kappa from 89.51, 0.66 to 92.63, 0.74, respectively. The rest of the two classifiers also showed progress. The best performance of classification results was obtained from the Decision Tree of 94.71, 0.81. Observing the outcomes, the interference effects of the image were resolved successfully by various image problems using the spectral image and radar image for paddy rice classification.

Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model trained with limited datasets has strong potential for near-real-time urban flood mapping.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Backscattering; Complex networks; Deep neural networks; Floods; Interferometry; Mapping; Deep learning; Flood mapping; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar; Sentinel-1; U-net; Urban areas; Urban flood mapping; Urban floods; Urban-aware; backscatter; flooding; interferometry; machine learning; mapping method; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; Synthetic aperture radar","Deep learning (DL); multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR); U-Net; urban flood mapping; urban-aware","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136847070"

Furthermore, we investigate ingestion of the correction techniques by different InSAR applications, accuracy performance metrics and uncertainties of InSAR derived measurements attributed to tropospheric delay. Spatiotemporal modelling of atmospheric delay has evolved and can now be regarded as a spatially correlated turbulent delay with varying degree of anisotropy random in time and topographically correlated seasonal stratified delay. Tropospheric corrections methods performance is restricted to a case by case basis and ingestion of these methods by different applications remains limited due to lack of their integration into existing algorithms. Accuracy and uncertainty assessments remain challenging with most studies adopting simple statistical metrics.

This study assesses the potential of multitemporal L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data to improve forest AGB estimation using the three-parameter water cloud model (WCM) trained with field data from relatively small (0.1 ha) plots. The major objective is to assess the impact of the high uncertainties in field inventory data due to relatively smaller plot size and temporal gap between acquisitions and ground truth on the AGB estimation. This study analyzes a time series of twenty-three ALOS-2 dual-polarized images spanning 5 years acquired under different weather and soil moisture conditions over a subtropical forest test site in India. The WCM model is trained and validated on individual acquisitions to retrieve forest AGB. The accuracy of the generated AGB products is quantified using the root mean square error (RMSE). Further, we use a multitemporal AGB retrieval approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated AGB. Changes in precipitation and soil moisture affect the AGB retrieval accuracy from individual acquisitions; however, using multitemporal data, these effects are mitigated. Using a multitemporal AGB retrieval strategy, the accuracy improves by 15% (55 Mg/ha RMSE) for all field plots and by 21% (39 Mg/ha RMSE) for forests with AGB less than 100 Mg/ha. The analysis shows that any ten multitemporal acquisitions spanning 5 years are sufficient for improving AGB retrieval accuracy over the considered test site. Furthermore, we use allometry from colocated field plots and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L2A height metrics to produce GEDI-derived AGB estimates. Despite the limited co-location of GEDI and field data over our study area, within the period of interest, the preliminary analysis shows the potential of jointly using the GEDI-derived AGB and multi-temporal ALOS-2 data for large-scale AGB retrieval.

In this context, multi-sensor image fusion allows a comprehensive representation of biophysical and structural information. Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods are used for several applications due to their spatial-spectral interpretability. Hence, this study explores the potential of fused multi-temporal Sentinel 1 (S1) and Sentinel 2 (S2) images for Land Use/Land Cover classification over an agricultural area in India. For classification, Bayesian optimised 2D CNN-based DL and pixel-based SVM classifiers were used. For fusion, a CNN-based siamese network with Ratio-of-Laplacian pyramid method was used for the images acquired over the entire winter cropping period. This fusion strategy leads to better interpretability of results and also found that 2D CNN-based DL classifier performed well in terms of classification accuracy for both single-month (95.14% and 96.11%) as well as multi-temporal (99.87% and 99.91%) fusion in comparison to the SVM with classification accuracy for single-month (80.02% and 81.36%) and multi-temporal fusion (95.69% and 95.84%). Results indicate better performance by Vertical-Vertical polarised fused images than Vertical-Horizontal polarised fused images.

In this perspective, image registration is a mandatory data processing step for any kind of time series data analytics. Feature-based image registration is one of the prominent categories for superimposing multi-temporal and multi-modal images over each other. The paper provides a comprehensive and comparative survey of feature detection/description techniques for remote sensing images. In addition, outlier removal algorithms are explored in detail to generate putative keypoint correspondences for accurate transformation parameter estimation. The experiments are conducted on multiple remote sensing image pairs comprising visible, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and infrared images that provide diverse characteristics of the feature target. The co-registration accuracy is quantified for all possible combinations of feature detection/description with outlier removal, and best amalgamation is visually verified to check sub-pixel spatial alignment by swiping multi-temporal or multi-modal images over each other. It has been found that SIFT performs better in optical image registration, whereas A-KAZE feature detection has an upper edge at SAR image registration task. Marginalizing Sample Consensus (MAGSAC) and Mode Guided (MG) based outlier removal techniques achieves better pruning performance for multi-temporal optical and SAR images respectively. The comparative evaluation indicates that Motion Smoothness Constraint (MSC) optimization shows optimal performance for multi-modal remote sensing images. The best possible Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) achieved for multi-temporal optical images is 0.44 pixel whereas for multi-temporal SAR images, it is 0.46 pixels.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for change detection and monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Sentinel-1 6-day interferometric SAR (InSAR) temporal coherence could allow peat extraction monitoring from satellite. We demonstrate that temporal median coherence enables to detect harvest related surface altering works and therefore also spatially explicitly determine active and inactive extraction areas. A polygon-based multi-orbit time series approach is sufficient for the task. Hereby, vertical–vertical polarisation (VV) is more sensitive to the changes compared to vertical-horizontal (VH). During the main harvest season the peat extraction area has median VV coherence lower than 0.2 while the abandoned area and open bog which serve as reference for undisturbed extraction area have close to 0.6. Also, the potential for coherence based milled peat extraction intensity estimation is demonstrated and an indication is given how partially extracted areas could be distinguished from fully harvested and not harvest areas, by the use of coherence standard deviation. Regarding the influence of rainfall, only heavy rain on one of the acquisitions of the image pair whereas the other is from dry conditions seems to cause decorrelation comparable to surface altering works. Moreover, deploying images from multiple consecutive orbits or introducing backscatter intensity σ0 or reference polygons of undisturbed area helps to reduce risk for rain induced false positives. Developing an operational algorithm for peat extraction identification could be undertaken in future studies. © 2021 The Author(s)","algorithm; detection method; extraction method; identification method; image analysis; interferometry; monitoring system; peat; peatland; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial analysis; synthetic aperture radar; time series","Bog; Change detection; Coherence; Monitoring; Peatland; SAR interferometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113369958"

Landslide susceptibility (LS) mapping is one effective and foremost step in reducing landslide disaster as it provides vital information to the local authority for land use planning and management in the future. A set of controlling factors and landslide inventory (LI) are typically used to generate LS. Thus, the LS accuracy can be affected by the LI availability and its source and timespan. Here, the impact of LI from two sources and timespans on the accuracy of LS is analyzed. The LIs are the archived inventory (archived-LI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometry inventory (SBAS-LI). The former LI consisted of landslide events from 1945 to 2014. The latter was acquired by analyzing the ground deformation with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR datasets and covered between 2015 and 2017. Eleven landslide controlling factors after multicollinearity diagnostics were selected. With the controlling factors in a GIS-based environment, the frequency ratio (FR) model is applied to both LIs and the factors, generating two LS maps. Each map accuracy was validated using recent landslides from 2017 to 2020. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.739 and 0.898 for the LS from the archived-LI and SBAS-LI, respectively. The degree-of-fit index of 61.7% for the LS from the archived-LI and 80.8% from the SBAS-LI was obtained.

In the surface water mapping domain, Earth Observation plays a central role, enabling action at the level of disaster response as well as in preventive risk analysis. Most methodologies, however, rely on optical image analysis techniques that are not operational in cloudy conditions, that typically occur during the rainy season. In this article, we present a methodology that exploits SAR data exclusively. Being acquired in the microwave spectrum, SAR can operate irrespective of the weather and time of day. As a use case, we demonstrate the possible intersection of surface water layers with population and VGI data, which can provide enhanced information concerning displaced people and accessibility. The study area is the administrative unit level 3 of Pibor, South Sudan, which is reported to be particularly challenging in terms of logistics as well as for its environmental conditions. The results cover a multi-temporal dataset from 2017 to 2021, and a cross-validation is provided for a selected date showing an overall accuracy of 88.74% for the relevant surface water layer. © GI_Forum.All right reserved.","","accessibility; displaced people; humanitarian sector; surface water mapping; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135468338"

Interferometric decorrelation due to season replacement limits the conventional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique and its application in such areas. To extend the monitoring capability in the salt desert area, we select a vast basin of saline soil around Howz-e-Soltan Salt Lake of Iran as the study area and present an improved MT-InSAR for experimental research. Based on 131 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between October 2014 to July 2020,1896 refined interferograms in total are selected from all interfero-gram candidates. Interferometric coherence analysis shows that the coherence in the saline soil area has an apparent seasonal variation, and the soil moisture affected by the precipitation may be the main factor that leads to the seasonal variation. Subsequently, the deformation characteristics of saline soil under different environmental conditions and human activity factors are compared and analyzed in detail. Related deformation mechanisms of different saline soil types are initially revealed by combining interferometric coherence, meteorological data, and engineering geological characteristics of saline soil.

This study first obtained images from the Sentinel-2 satellites for the period 2015–2020 with the objective of applying multi-temporal spectral indices to assess areas burned in wildfires and prescribed fires in the Margalla Hills of Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using those images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which are often used to assess the severity of fires, were calculated for wildfires and prescribed fires. For each satellite image, spectral indices values were extracted for the 5th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th and 95th percentiles of pixels of each burned area. Then, boxplots representing the distribution of these values were plotted for each satellite image to identify whether the regeneration time subsequent to a fire, also known as the burn scar, and the severity of the fire differed between the autumn and summer wildfires, and with prescribed fires. A statistical test revealed no differences for the regeneration time amongst the three categories of fires, but that the severity of summer wildfires was significantly different from that of prescribed fire, and this, for both indices. Second, SAR images were obtained from the Sentinel-1 mission for the same period as that of the optical imagery. A comparison of the response of 34 SAR variables with official data on wildfires and prescribed fires from the Capital Development Authority revealed that the 95th percentile of the Normalized Signal Ratio (NSR p_95) was found to be the best variable to detect fire events, although only 50% of the fires were correctly detected. Nonetheless, when the occurrence of fire events according to the SAR variable NSR p_95 was compared to that from the two spectral indices, the SAR variable was found to correctly identify 95% of fire events. The SAR variable NSR p_95 is thus a suitable alternative to spectral indices to monitor the progress of wildfires and assess their severity when there are limitations to the use of optical images due to cloud coverage or smoke, for instance. © 2021 by the authors.

However, few optical images could be collected due to cloud contamination during the crop growth period. Therefore, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images could be used to extract crop distribution since it is capable of acquiring data without regard to bad weather conditions. Although numerous studies have been successfully carried out to highlight the potential of SAR images in crop monitoring, there are still some problems to be solved. The high dimensionality of multi-temporal SAR images remains a major issue, classification using all features is limited to efficiency. In this study, a method of autumn crop recognition based on PolSAR data and feature selection was proposed. Using Radarsat-2 PolSAR images acquired during the autumn crop growing season, the optimal subset of features was obtained by 3 feature selection methods and 15 polarimetric target decomposition methods. With optimal feature subset and train samples, crops and other ground objects were classified by SVM.

Archives provide access to long time-series of SAR images, from which multi-temporal averages can be computed with virtually no remaining speckle fluctuations. The proposed method combines this multi-temporal average and the image at a given date in the form of a ratio image and uses a state-of-the-art neural network to remove the speckle in this ratio image.

The assessment of ground displacements along the surface of the rupture in the 2019–2021 snowless periods was carried out using MT-InSAR methods. These displacements were 40 mm/year along the line of sight. The SBAS-InSAR results have allowed us to reveal displacements of great area in 2020 and 2021 snowless periods that were 30–40 mm/year along the line-of-sight.

The overexploitation of groundwater brings about severe land subsidence, which affects the safety and development of BTH. In this pa-per, we utilized multi-frame synthetic aperture radar datasets obtained by the Rardarsat-2 satellite to monitor land subsidence’s temporal and spatial distribution in the BTH from 2012 to 2016 based on multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). In addition, we also em-ployed the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mascon datasets acquired by the Center for Space Research (CSR) and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to obtain the GWS anomalies (GWSA) of BTH from 2003 to 2016. Then we evaluate the accuracy of the results obtained. Further-more, we explored the relationship between the regional GWSA and the average cumulative subsidence in the BTH. The total volume change of subsidence is 59.46% of the total volume change of groundwater storage. Moreover, the long-term decreasing trend of the GWSA (14.221 mm/year) and average cumulative subsidence (17.382 mm/year) show a relatively high consistency. Finally, we analyze the heterogeneity of GWS change (GWSC) and LS change (LSC) in the four typical areas by the Lorenz curve model. The implementation of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MSWDP) affects the heterogeneity of GWSC and LSC. It can be seen that the largest heterogeneity of LSC lags behind the GWSC in the Tianjin-Langfang-Hengshui-Baoding area. The largest uneven subsidence in Beijing and Tianjin occurred in 2015, and the largest uneven subsidence in Hengshui-Baoding occurred in 2014. After that, the heterogeneity of subsidence gradually tends to stable. © 2021 by the authors.

We also investigated the temporal stability through the use of backscatter from multiple seasons and years of acquisition. SAR acquisitions were pre-processed, histogram-matched, smoothed, and temperature-corrected. The normalized average backscatter was extracted for interpreted plots and used to train Random Forest models. The classification results were then validated with field plots. A principal component analysis was tested to reduce the dimensionality of the explanatory variables, which generally improved the results. Overall, the FTY classifications were promising, with higher accuracies (OA of 0.94 and K = 0.86) than the SPP classification (OA of 0.66 and K = 0.54). The use of merely winter images (OA = 0.89) reached, on average, results that were almost as good as those using of images from the entire year. The use of images from a single winter season reached a similar result (OA = 0.87). We conclude that multiple Sentinel-1 images acquired in winter conditions are feasible to classify forest types in a hemi-boreal Swedish forest. © 2021 by the authors.

It is well‐known that polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data provides ample information for crop classification. More-over, multi‐temporal PolSAR data can further increase classification accuracies since the crops show different external forms as they grow up. In this paper, we distinguish the crop types with multi‐temporal PolSAR data. First, due to the “dimension disaster” of multi‐temporal PolSAR data caused by excessive scattering parameters, a neural network of sparse auto‐encoder with non‐negativity constraint (NC‐SAE) was employed to compress the data, yielding efficient features for accurate classification. Second, a novel crop discrimination network with multi‐scale features (MSCDN) was constructed to improve the classification performance, which is proved to be supe-rior to the popular classifiers of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM). The performances of the proposed method were evaluated and compared with the tradi-tional methods by using simulated Sentinel‐1 data provided by European Space Agency (ESA). For the final classification results of the proposed method, its overall accuracy and kappa coefficient reaches 99.33% and 99.19%, respectively, which were almost 5% and 6% higher than the CNN method. The classification results indicate that the proposed methodology is promising for practical use in agricultural applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Existing literature mainly detects and mitigates RFI in the raw data domain, which is generally not accessible to the end-user. In this article, a novel RFI extraction and mitigation scheme in the image domain is proposed using multitemporal analysis of SAR images. By exploiting the coupling correlation and complementary information among the time-series images, the background landscape could be modeled as relatively stationary with the low-rank property. Meanwhile, the radiometric artifacts corresponding to RFI could be well extracted and characterized by the sparse components. Extraction and mitigation of RFI signatures could be achieved simultaneously via a joint iterative optimization process.

Fine classification of rice paddy plays an important role in growth monitoring, pest prevention and yield estimation of rice. In this study, the multi-temporal CP SAR data were firstly simulated by fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 data, and 22 CP parameters from each of the six temporal CP SAR data were extracted. Then we built a rice height-sensitive index (RHSI). Furthermore, a decision tree (DT) method was established by using the optimal CP parameters based on RHSI.

However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001–2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 ± 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 ± 0.05 m and 1.52 ± 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km2 that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years. © 2021 by the authors.

The advantage of multi-temporal spatial data and high data accuracy is useful in mapping urban vertical aspects like the compactness of urban areas, population expansion, and urban surface geometry. This study makes use of the ‘Ice, cloud, and land elevation satellite-2′ (ICESat-2) ATL 03 photon data for building height estimation using a sample of 30 buildings in three experimental sites. A comparison of computed heights with the heights of the respective buildings from google image and google earth pro was done to assess the accuracy and the result of 2.04 m RMSE was obtained. Another popularly used method by planners and policymakers to map the vertical dimension of urban terrain is the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). An assessment of the openly available DEM products—TanDEM-X and Cartosat-1 has been done over Urban and Rural areas. TanDEM-X is a German earth observation satellite that uses InSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry) technique to acquire DEM while Cartosat-1 is an optical stereo acquisition satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) that uses photogrammetric techniques for DEM acquisition. Both the DEMs have been compared with ICESat-2 (ATL-08) Elevation data as the reference and the accuracy has been evaluated using Mean error (ME), Mean absolute error (MAE) and Root mean square error (RMSE). In the case of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), RMSE values 5.29 m and 7.48 m were noted for TanDEM-X 90 and CartoDEM V3 R1 respectively. While the second site of Bellampalli Mandal rural area observed 5.15 and 5.48 RMSE values for the same respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that TanDEM-X has better accuracy as compared to the CartoDEM V3 R1. © 2021 by the authors.","","Cartosat-1; ICESat-2; InSAR; laser altimetry; TanDEM-X; urban monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143636615"

In this study, the Honghe National Nature Reserve was used as the research area. The VV and VH polarized backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1B, the polarimetric decomposition parameters of Sentinel-1B, and Sentinel-2A multi-spectral images from June and September were selected to construct 18 multi-dimensional data sets. A highly correlated variable elimination algorithm, a recursive feature elimination variable selection algorithm (RFE-RF), and an optimized random forest algorithm (RF) were used to construct a marsh vegetation identification model. In this study, we searched for an RF model to achieve the accurate classification of marsh vegetation and find the best feature for identifying various types of vegetation. Additionally, the applicability of different optimized RF models to the task of the identification of wetland vegetation and the stability of the identification of marsh vegetation using different classification models were quantitatively analyzed. The results show the following: (1) RFE-RF variable selection and RF parameter optimization can reduce the data dimensionality, improve the accuracy and stability of the wetland vegetation classification model, and achieve a training accuracy of up to 85.39%. (2) The RF model integrating multi-spectral data, backscattering coefficients, and polarimetric decomposition parameters for June and September can obtain the highest overall accuracy (91.16%), and the model has the strongest applicability. (3) The importance of multi-spectral variables in wetland vegetation classification is higher than that of backscattering coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters. The visible bands and vegetation index are the most important variables, while the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient (Mean_VH), polarimetric decomposition eigenvalue (Mean_l1, Mean_l2), and calculated eigenvalues of the matrix (Mean_lambda) are the backscattering coefficient features and polarimetric decomposition parameters with the highest contributions. (4) The modified normalized difference water index in June (MNDWI_ Jun), blue band in September (Mean_B_Sep), location feature pixel coordinates (Y_Max_Pxl), and ratio vegetation index in September (RVI_Sep) have the highest contribution to the identification and classification of deep-water marsh vegetation, shallow-water marsh vegetation, forest, and shrubs, respectively.

However, information loss caused by clouds largely decreases the availability of usable optical images so reconstructing the missing information is important. Existing reconstruction methods can hardly reflect the real-time information because they mainly make use of multitemporal optical images as reference. To capture the real-time information in the cloud removal process, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can serve as the reference images due to the cloud penetrability of SAR imaging. Nevertheless, large datasets are necessary because existing SAR-based cloud removal methods depend on network training. In this paper, we integrate the merits of multitemporal optical images and SAR images to the cloud removal process, the results of which can reflect the ground information change, in a simple convolution neural network. Although the proposed method is based on deep neural network, it can directly operate on the target image without training datasets. We conduct several simulation and real data experiments of cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images with multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR images and Sentinel-2 optical images. Experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms those state-of-the-art multitemporal-based methods and overcomes the constraint of datasets of those SAR-based methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques supply the structural community with time series of line-of-sight displacements of terrain or structures, such as bridges or buildings, resulting from causes such as thermal expansion, contraction, and terrain deformation. The analysis of the different deformation signals observed is crucial in order to identify the different phenomena that cause the deformation. In this article, we explore the possibility of applying blind source separation algorithms to MT-InSAR, with the aim of developing methods towards automatic identification of different deformation patterns both in buildings and structures. We validate the proposed methodology using both synthetically generated datasets and real MT-InSAR data. We also provide a comparison with other similar methods. Our results demonstrate that InSAR time-series analysis can benefit from the use of the proposed blind source separation approach.

However, its large extent and diverse characteristics are challenges for deformation monitoring. In this study, the Shanhaiguan section of the Great Wall was investigated in a case study to ascertain the damage and potential hazards of the architectural site. Two standard multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MTInSAR) technologies, including persistent scatterer SAR interferometry (PSInSAR) and small baseline subset (SBAS) SAR interferometry, were used for deformation monitoring using high-resolution TerraSAR-X data acquired in 2015–2017. The results of the two MTInSAR approaches reveal the health condition of the Great Wall. The Shanhaiguan section was stable, but local instabilities caused by rock falls were detected in some mountainous areas. In addition, the applicability of PSInSAR and SBAS was evaluated. The performance analysis of the two approaches indicated that a more reliable and adaptable MTInSAR technique needs to be developed for monitoring the Great Wall. This study demonstrates the potential of MTInSAR technology with high-resolution data for the health diagnosis of heritage sites with a linear structure, such as the Great Wall. © 2021, The Author(s).","","Architectural heritage; MTInSAR; Shanhaiguan; Sustainability; The Great Wall","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107657777"

A binary image indicating changed regions is generated by a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm from a Contourlet fused difference image. Contourlet fusion uses complementary information from different types of difference images. For unchanged regions, the details should be restrained while highlighted for changed regions. Different fusion rules are designed for low frequency band and high frequency directional bands of Contourlet coefficients. Then a fast non-local clustering algorithm (FNLC) is proposed to classify the fused image to generate changed and unchanged regions. In order to reduce the impact of noise while preserve details of changed regions, not only local but also non-local information are incorporated into the FNLC in a fuzzy way.

Rock glacier activity represents a critical indicator of water reserves state, permafrost distribution, and landslide disaster susceptibility. The dynamics of rock glacier activity in alpine periglacial environments are poorly quantified, especially in the central Himalayas. Multitemporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) has been shown to be a useful technique for rock glacier deformation detection. In this study, we developed a multi-baseline persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) combined MT-InSAR method to monitor the activity of rock glaciers in the central Himalayas. In periglacial landforms, the application of the PS interferometry (PSI) method is restricted by insufficient PS due to large temporal baseline intervals and temporal decorrelation, which hinder comprehensive measurements of rock glaciers. Thus, we first evaluated the rock glacier interferometric coherence of all possible interferometric combinations and determined a multi-baseline network based on rock glacier coherence; then, we constructed a Delaunay triangulation network (DTN) by exploiting both PS and DS points. To improve the robustness of deformation parameters estimation in the DTN, we combined the Nelder– Mead algorithm with the M-estimator method to estimate the deformation rate variation at the arcs of the DTN and introduced a ridge-estimator-based weighted least square (WLR) method for the inversion of the deformation rate from the deformation rate variation. We applied our method to Sentinel-1A ascending and descending geometry data (May 2018 to January 2019) and obtained measurements of rock glacier deformation for 4327 rock glaciers over the central Himalayas, at least more than 15% detecting with single geometry data. The line-of-sight (LOS) deformation of rock glaciers in the central Himalayas ranged from −150 mm to 150 mm. We classified the active deformation area (ADA) of all individual rock glaciers with the threshold determined by the standard deviation of the deformation map. The results show that 49% of the detected rock glaciers (monitoring rate greater than 30%) are highly active, with an ADA ratio greater than 10%. After projecting the LOS deformation to the steep slope direction and classifying the rock glacier activity following the IPA Action Group guideline, 12% of the identified rock glaciers were classified as active and 86% were classified as transitional. This research is the first multi-baseline, PS, and DS network-based MT-InSAR method applied to detecting large-scale rock glaciers activity. © 2021 by the authors.

It provides the French ForM@ter scientific community with automatically processed products using a state of the art processing chain based on a small baseline subset approach, namely the New Small Baseline (NSBAS). The service results from a collaboration between the scientific team that develops and maintains the NSBAS processing chain and the French Spatial Agency (CNES) that mirrors the Sentinel-1 data. The proximity to Sentinel-1 data, the NSBAS workflow, and the specific optimizations to make NSBAS processing massively parallel for the CNES high performance computing infrastructure ensures the efficiency of the chain, especially in terms of input and output, which is the key for the success of such a service. The FLATSIM service is made of a production module, a delivery module and a user access module. Products include interferograms, surface line of sight velocity, phase delay time series and auxiliary data. Numerous quality indicators are provided for an in-depth analysis of the quality and limits of the results. The first national call in 2020 for region of interest ended up with 8 regions spread over the world with scientific interests, including seismology, tectonics, volcano-tectonics, and hydrological cycle.

Mill.). Remote sensing satellite imagery represents a valuable data source for seamless regional-scale mapping of forest composition. This study developed and evaluated new models to map the distribution and abundance of SBW host species at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery in combination with several site variables for a total of 191 variables in northern New Brunswick, Canada using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found Sentinel-2 multi-temporal single spectral bands and numerous spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) yielded the classification of SBW host species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 72.6% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.65. Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 variables coupled with elevation, only marginally improved the performance of the model (OA: 73.0% and K: 0.66). The use of Sentinel-1 SAR data with elevation resulted in a reasonable OA of 57.5% and K of 0.47.

Moreover, the relative phase difference between the vertical displacement and surface soil moisture show local variations that are interpreted in terms of depth and thickness of the clay layer, as visualized by an electrical resistivity tomography.

By extracting and analyzing the change characteristics of the time-series curve of the polarization characteristic parameters of rice, the polarization characteristic parameters that are sensitive to the changes of rice phenology were screened out, and a radar phenology index (RPI) that can reflect the key phenological changes of rice growth was constructed, and then was reconstructed by Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter. The key phenological stages of rice were retrieved by the RPI.

Published inter-comparisons are mostly limited to ground displacement estimates obtained from different algorithms belonging to the same family of InSAR approaches, either Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) or Small BAseline Subset (SBAS); and accuracy assessments are mainly focused on vertical displacements or based on few Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or geodetic leveling points. To fill this demonstration gap, two years of Sentinel-1 SAR ascending and descending mode data are processed with both PSI and SBAS consolidated algorithms to extract vertical and horizontal displacement velocity datasets, whose accuracy is then assessed against a wealth of contextual geodetic data. These include permanent GNSS records, static GNSS benchmark repositioning, and geodetic leveling monitoring data that the National Institute of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (INEGI) of Mexico collected in 2014−2016 in the Aguascalientes Valley, where structurally-controlled land subsidence exhibits fast vertical rates (up to −150 mm/year) and a non-negligible east-west component (up to ±30 mm/year). Despite the temporal constraint of the data selected, the PSI-SBAS inter-comparison reveals standard deviation of 6 mm/year and 4 mm/year for the vertical and east-west rate differences, respectively, thus reassuring about the similarity between the two types of InSAR outputs. Accuracy assessment shows that the standard deviations in vertical velocity differences are 9−10 mm/year against GNSS benchmarks, and 8 mm/year against leveling data. Relative errors are below 20% for any locations subsiding faster than −15 mm/year. Differences in east-west velocity estimates against GNSS are on average −0.1 mm/year for PSI and +0.2 mm/year for SBAS, with standard deviations of 8 mm/year. When discrepancies are found between InSAR and geodetic data, these mostly occur at benchmarks located in proximity to the main normal faults, thus falling within the same SBAS ground pixel or closer to the same PSI target, regardless of whether they are in the footwall or hanging wall of the fault. Establishing new benchmarks at higher distances from the fault traces or exploiting higher resolution SAR scenes and/or InSAR datasets may improve the detection of the benchmarks and thus consolidate the statistics of the InSAR accuracy assessments. © 2021 by the authors.

The mean of geodetic mass balance is found to be -1.47 ± 0.01 m w. e. a-1 with constant density and -1.40 ± 0.06 m w. e. a-1 with the consideration of adaptive density for ice and firn area and then compared with field data (-1.38 m w. e. a-1). The mean mass balance of the proposed method is near to the field based calculated mass balance.  © 2021 IEEE.","Geodesy; Geology; Glaciers; Synthetic aperture radar; Different densities; Firn densities; Glacier facies; Glacier mass balance; Inversion algorithm; Mass balance; Multi-temporal SAR; Performance; Spatial variations; Svalbard; Ice","Firn density; glacier facies; Mass Balance; SAR; Svalbard","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133176838"

This simplification allows for the use of source separation methods, such as robust principal component analysis (RPCA) via principal component pursuit (PCP), for detecting changes in those images. In this manuscript, a change detection method for wavelength-resolution SAR images based on image stack through RPCA is proposed. The method aims to explore both the temporal and flight heading diversity of a set of wavelength-resolution multitemporal SAR images in order to detect concealed targets in forestry areas. A heuristic based on three rules for better exploring the RPCA results is introduced, and a new configurable parameter for false alarm reduction based on the analysis of image windows is proposed. The method is evaluated using real data obtained from measurements of the ultrawideband (UWB) very high-frequency (VHF) SAR system CARABAS-II. Experiments for stacks of four and seven reference images are conducted, and the use of reference images acquired with different flight headings is explored. The results indicate that a gain in performance can be achieved by using large image stacks containing, at least, one image of each possible flight heading of the data set, which can result in a probability of detection (PD) above 99% for a false alarm rate (FAR) as low as one false alarm per three square kilometers. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that high PD and low FAR can be achieved, also considering images from similar flight headings as reference images. © 2021 by the authors.

To further prepare, the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) platform was used to observe cropland sites across the southern United States to support the development of L-band (24 cm) prototype science products. Time series flights flew over four independent areas during the growing season of 2019 while crop ground measurements were collected. Major crops include corn, cotton, pasture, peanut, rice, and soybean. A suite of cropland classification experiments applied a set of machine learning (ML) algorithms (random forest, feedforward fully connected neural network, support vector machine), the recently developed Multi-temporal Binary Tree Classification (MBTC), and a phenology (Coefficient of Variation; CoV) approach to synergistically assess performance, scattering mechanisms, and limitations. Specific objectives of this research application included 1.) evaluation of L-band mapping performance across multiple independent agricultural production areas with field scale training data, and 2.) assessment of the CoV approach for the generation of prototype NISAR Level 2 science products. Collectively, SAR terms with sensitivity to volume scattering performed well and consistently across CoV mapping experiments achieving accuracy greater than 80% for cropland vs not cropland. Dynamic phenology classes, such as herbaceous wetlands, had some confusion with CoV agriculture requiring further regionalized training optimization. Volume scattering and cross-pol terms were most useful across the different ML techniques with overall accuracy and Kappa consistently over 90% and 0.85, respectively, for crop type by late growth stages for L-band observations. As expected, time series information was more valuable compared to any single ML technique, site, or crop schema. Ultimately, as more SAR platforms launch, the user community should leverage physical contributions of different wavelengths and polarizations along with growing open access time series for efficient and meaningful agricultural products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","United States; Arachis hypogaea; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Antennas; Binary alloys; Binary trees; Biology; Cobalt alloys; Crops; Data streams; Decision trees; Mapping; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Agricultural productions; Coefficient of variation; Fully connected neural network; Research applications; Scattering mechanisms; Time series informations; Training optimizations; Uninhabited aerial vehicle; accuracy assessment; agricultural land; agricultural production; cotton; growing season; legume; machine learning; maize; mapping method; pasture; radar; rice; satellite altimetry; scattering; soybean; synthetic aperture radar; unmanned vehicle; Space-based radar","Crop type and area mapping; Machine learning; NISAR; UAVSAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097056723"

The probability the occurrence of future events is established using a deterministic approach based on a classical one-dimension infinite slope stability model. The most important geotechnical parameters for slope failure in the proposed study area are cohesion, unit weight and friction angle, and the triggering factor is a rapid rise in groundwater table under wetting conditions. Employing a susceptibility analysis using the physically based model under completely saturated conditions proved to be the most suitable scenario for identifying unstable areas. The kinematic characteristics are assessed by the Small BAseline Subsets (SBAS) interferometry technique applied to C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 imagery. The analysis was carried out mainly for inhabited areas which present a better backscatter return. The validation revealed that more than 22% of the active landslides identified by InSAR were predicted as unstable areas by the infinite slope model.

In detail, the services benefit from regularly updated deformation maps (every 12 days) to promptly detect anomalies of deformation, i.e., trend variations in the time series of displacement. In this work, anomalies detected between September 2019 and September 2020 are thus correlated with several types of factors, either related to the environment, intrinsic of the data or derived from ancillary data.

Ground deformations can be well captured by satellite data using a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR) approach. The accuracy of the achievable ground deformation products (e.g., mean displacement time series and related ground displacement time series) critically depends on the number and quality of the selected interferograms. This paper presents a straightforward interferogram selection algorithm that can be applied to identify an optimal network of small baseline (SB) interferograms. The selected SB interferograms are then used to produce ground deformation products using the well-known small baseline subset (SBAS) Mt-InSAR algorithm. The developed interferogram selection algorithm (ISA) permits the selection of the group of SB data pairs that minimize the relative error of the mean ground deformation velocity. Experiments were carried out using a group of 102 Sen-tinel-1B SAR data collected from 12 April 2017 to 29 October 2020.

They face the problem of finding out if a flood hit a specific facility located in the open countryside. Physical inspection after every heavy rain is time and personnel consuming, and equipping all facilities with flood detection is expensive. Therefore, methods are being sought to ensure that these facilities are monitored at a minimum cost. One of the possibilities is using remote sensing, especially radar data regularly scanned by satellites. A significant challenge in this area was the launch of Sentinel-1 providing free-of-charge data with adequate spatial resolution and relatively high revisit time. This paper presents a developed automatic processing chain for flood detection in the open landscape from Sentinel-1 data. Flood detection can be started on-demand; however, it mainly focuses on autonomous near real-time monitoring. It is based on a combination of algorithms for multi-temporal change detection and histogram thresholding open-water detection. The solution was validated on five flood events in four European countries by comparing its results with flood delineation derived from reference datasets. Long-term tests were also performed to evaluate the potential for a false positive occurrence. In the statistical classification assessments, the mean value of user accuracy (producer accuracy) for open-water class reached 83% (65%). The developed solution typically provided flooded polygons in the same areas as the reference dataset, but of a smaller size. This fact is mainly attributed to the use of universal sensitivity parameters, independent of the specific location, which ensure almost complete successful suppression of false alarms. © 2021 by the authors.

Wetlands in Zhenlai county, with the Momoge National Nature Reserve, which was included on the Ramsar list, have degraded by nearly 30%. Wetland degradation is a long-term continuous process with annual or interannual changes in water area, water level, or vegetation presence and growth. Therefore, it requires sufficiently frequent and high-spatial-resolution data to represent its dynamics. This study mapped yearly land-use maps with 30-m resolution from 1985 to 2018 using Landsat data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore the wetland degradation process and mapped 12-day interval land-use maps with 15-m resolution using the Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 data in GEE and other assistant platforms to study the characteristics of wetland dynamics in 2018. Four sets of maps were generated using Sentinel-1B (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), the combination of Sentinel-1B and Sentinel-2 (S12), and S12 with multitemporal remote sensing (S12’). All of the classifications were performed in the Random Forest Classification (RFC) method using remote sensing indicators. The results indicate that S12’ was the most accurate. Then, the impact of the historic land-use degradation process on current wetland change dynamics was discussed. Stable, degradation, and restoration periods were identified according to the annual changes in wetlands. The degraded, stable, restored, and vulnerable zones were assessed based on the transformation characteristics among wetlands and other land-use types. The impact of historical land-use trajectories on wetland change characteristics nowadays is diverse in land-use types and distributions, and the ecological environment quality is the comprehensive result of the effect of historical land-use trajectories and the amount of rainfall and receding water from paddy fields. This study offers a new method to map high-spatiotemporal-resolution land-use (S12’) and addresses the relationship between historic wetland change characteristics and its status quo. The findings are also applicable to wetland research in other regions. This study could provide more detailed scientific guidance for wetland managers by quickly detecting wetland changes at a finer spatiotemporal resolution. © 2021 by the authors.

When performed on synthetic aperture radar images, the most critical issues are as follows: 1) the labeling of the identified changing patterns and 2) the scarce robustness of classic pixel-based approaches based on threshold segmentation of an appropriate change index, which tend to fail when multiple changes are present in the study area. In this work, a new methodology for unsupervised change detection in vegetation canopy is presented. It overcomes these limitations by exploiting multitemporal geographical object-based image analysis with the aim to make the intrinsic semantic of data emerge and direct the processing toward the identification of precise classes of changes through dictionary-based preclassification and fuzzy combination of class-specific information layers. The proposed methodology has been tested in ten different experiments covering agriculture and clear-cut deforestation applications. The results, validated against literature methods, highlighted the superiority of the proposed approach, which was quantitatively assessed in terms of standard classification quality parameters. On agriculture experiments, it allowed for an average increase in the detection accuracy of about 11% with respect to the best performing literature method, with an increment of the false alarm rate in the order of 0.5%. In case of deforestation, the registered detection accuracy was comparable to that achieved by the literature, while the most significant benefit was the reduction, of more than one-third, of the number of detected false deforestation patterns. Overall, the main characteristics of the proposed architecture are the robustness and the lack of any supervision, which makes it very well-suited for operational scenarios. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deforestation; Image classification; Image segmentation; Object detection; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Semantics; Change detection; Detection accuracy; Image-analysis; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar; Object based; Object-based image analyse; Objects-based; Synthetic aperture radar images; Unsupervised change detection; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; Classification; Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Object-based image analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102579986"

The recent success of deep learning envisions a new generation of despeckling techniques that could outperform classical model-based methods. However, current deep learning approaches to despeckling require supervision for training, whereas clean SAR images are impossible to obtain. In the literature, this issue is tackled by resorting to either synthetically speckled optical images, which exhibit different properties with respect to true SAR images, or multitemporal SAR images, which are difficult to acquire or fuse accurately. In this article, inspired by recent works on blind-spot denoising networks, we propose a self-supervised Bayesian despeckling method. The proposed method is trained by employing only noisy SAR images and can, therefore, learn features of real SAR images rather than synthetic data. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed approach is very close to the supervised training approach on synthetic data and superior on real data in both quantitative and visual assessments. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Bayesian networks; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Geometrical optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Classical model; Learning approach; Multi-temporal SAR images; Scene analysis; Supervised trainings; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Synthetic data; Visual assessments; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); despeckling; self-supervised; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103286404"

This is the case of Ischia Island (Naples, Italy) dominated by the Mt. Epomeo (787 m a.s.l.), a volcano-tectonic horst located in the central portion of the island. This study aims to follow a long temporal evolution of ground deformations on the island through the interferometric analysis of satellite SAR data. Different datasets, acquired during Envisat, COSMO-SkyMed and Sentinel-1 satellite missions, are for the first time processed in order to obtain the island ground deformations during a time interval spanning 17 years, from November 2002 to December 2019. In detail, the multitemporal differential interferometry technique, named small baseline subset, is applied to produce the ground displacement maps and the associated displacement time series. The results, validated through the analysis and the comparison with a set of GPS measurements, show that the northwestern side of Mt. Epomeo is the sector of the island characterized by the highest subsidence movements (maximum vertical displacement of 218 mm) with velocities ranging from 10 to 20 mm/yr. Finally, the displacement time series allow us to correlate the measured ground deformations with the seismic swarm started with the Mw 3.9 earthquake that occurred on 21 August 2017. Such correlations highlight an acceleration of the ground, following the mainshock, characterized by a subsidence displacement rate of 0.12 mm/day that returned to pre-earthquake levels (0.03 mm/day) after 6 months from the event. © 2021 by the authors.

The traditional multi-tem-poral interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can only obtain the surface deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, even if some methods can obtain the 3-D displacements of mining area based on InSAR. However, it has high data requirements for data types, which are not conducive to the inversion of 3-D displacements. In this paper, the symmetry of the surface basin caused by mining subsidence under different mining degrees is analyzed. According to the basic symmetrical features of mining subsidence—that the surface vertical displacement and horizontal displacement in near horizontal coal seam is symmetrical with respect to the main section of the basin, combined with time series InSAR technology (TS-InSAR)—a novel method for retrieving the 3-D displacement results from a single-geometry InSAR dataset based on symmetrical features (hereafter referred to as the SGI-SF method) is proposed. The SGI-SF method first generates multi-temporal observations of LOS displacement from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, and then trans-forms them into multi-temporal observations of 3-D displacement datasets according to symmetrical features. There is no necessity to obtain the surface movement parameters from the measured data to calculate 3-D displacement fields. Finally, the time series of 3-D displacements are estimated from multi-temporal 3-D displacements using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Nine descending Sentinel-1 images from the Yulin mining area of China are used to test the proposed SGI-SF method. The results show that the average root mean square errors (RMSE) in the vertical and horizontal direction of the three-dimensional deformations are approximately 9.28 mm and 13.10 mm, respectively, which are much smaller than mining-induced displacements and can provide support for deformation monitoring in mining areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering that these disasters may occur anywhere—both in remote and/or in highly populated areas—and anytime, continuously monitoring areas known to be more prone to geohazards can help to determine preventive or alert actions to safeguard human life, property and businesses. Remote sensing technology—especially satellite-based—can be of help due to its high spatial and temporal coverage. Indeed, data acquired from the most recent satellite missions is considered suitable for a detailed reconstruction of past events but also to continuously monitor sensitive areas on the lookout for potential geohazards. This work aims to apply different techniques and methods for extensive exploitation and analysis of remote sensing data, with special emphasis given to landslide hazard, risk management and disaster prevention. Multi-temporal SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry, SAR tomography, high-resolution image matching and data modelling are used to map out landslides and other geohazards and to also monitor possible hazardous geological activity, addressing different study areas: (i) surface deformation of mountain slopes and glaciers; (ii) land surface displacement; and (iii) subsidence, landslides and ground fissure. Results from both the processing and analysis of a dataset of earth observation (EO) multi-source data support the conclusion that geohazards can be identified, studied and monitored in an effective way using new techniques applied to multi-source EO data. As future work, the aim is threefold: extend this study to sensitive areas located in different countries; monitor structures that have strategic, cultural and/or economical relevance; and resort to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to be able to analyse the huge amount of data generated by satellite missions and extract useful information in due course. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore a river channel extraction algorithm on multi-spectral image based on sparse reconstruction is proposed and adopted in our method. The extracted river channel is used as prior information to effectively eliminate most interference regions on the shore. Then an adaptive threshold segmentation method is adopted to accurately detect river ice regions in SAR image. Fuzzy C-means clustering is used to segment river ice using the infrared bands of multi-spectral image, considering temperature can provide significant information to discriminate ice, water and shore. Finally, change analysis is done based on the ice extractions results of two kinds of images.

The ground deformation, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, can be quantified via geodetic observations, especially using multi-temporal InSAR techniques. The previous InSAR studies, however, either rely on data-driven models or Stefan-equation-based models, which are both lacking of consideration of the spatial-temporal variations of freeze-thaw processes. Furthermore, the magnitudes and patterns of the permafrost-related ground deformation over large scales (e.g., 1 × 105 km2 or larger) is still insufficiently quantified or poorly understood. In this study, to account for the spatial heterogeneity of freeze-thaw processes, we develop a permafrost-tailored InSAR approach by incorporating a MODIS-land-surface-temperature-integrated ground deformation model to reconstruct the seasonal and long-term deformation. Utilizing the approach to Sentinel-1 SAR images on the vast regions of about 140,000 km2 of the central QTP during 2014–2019, we observe widespread seasonal deformation up to about 80 mm with a mean value of about 10 mm and linear subsidence up to 20 mm/year. We apply the geographical detector to determine the controlling factors on the permafrost-related deformation. We find that the slope angle is the primary controller on the seasonal deformation: strong magnitudes and variations of seasonal deformation are most pronounced in flat or gentle-slope regions. The aspect angle, vegetation and soil bulk density exhibit a certain correlation with seasonal deformation as well. Meanwhile, we find that a linear subsidence is higher in the regions with high ground ice content and warm permafrost. It indicates that warm and ice-rich permafrost regions are more vulnerable to extensive long-term subsidence. We also observe that the cold permafrost regions experience lower linear subsidence even with high ground ice content, which indicate ice loss is limited. Thus, we infer that under continuously warming, the transition from cold permafrost to warm permafrost may lead to more extensive ground ice melting.

Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.  © 2021 IEEE.","Data handling; Emergency services; Engines; Geometrical optics; Landslides; Mapping; Orbits; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Tracking radar; Case-studies; Google earth engine; Google earths; Landslide identification; Landslide mapping; Mapping accuracy; Optical image; Radar data; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic aperture radar","Google Earth Engine; Landslide Mapping; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126097463"

However, effectively retaining the edge information of the changed area is still a challenging task. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a change detection method based on progressive nonlocal theory. First, the progressive nonlocal theory is used to extract the spatial-temporal nonlocal information from multitemporal SAR images. Compared with the traditional nonlocal theory, the progressive nonlocal theory proposed in this study has three distinctive characteristics: 1) the progressive nonlocal neighborhood from the matching window to the search window; 2) the progressive optimization of matching window weight from the isotropic Gaussian distribution to the irregular distribution; and 3) the progressive increase of noise level from the 2 sigma principle to the 4/3 sigma principle (the noise level corresponding to the 4/3 sigma principle is 1.5 times the noise level corresponding to the 2 sigma principle). The difference image is then obtained by using the spatial-temporal nonlocal information and the ratio operator. Finally, the change map is obtained by applying a threshold segmentation method to the difference image. Two data sets were used for the testing, and it was shown that compared with other advanced methods, the method proposed in this study can better retain the edge information of the changed area and improve the Kappa coefficient and F1 score of the change map.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Change detection; Data mining; Edge detection; Image segmentation; Radar imaging; Speckle; Tracking radar; Change detection; Edge information; Image edge detection; Kernel; Multi-temporal; Noise levels; Nonlocal; Progressive non-local; Radar polarimetry; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; detection method; image analysis; information; neighborhood; optimization; segmentation; synthetic aperture radar; threshold; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; edge information; multitemporal; progressive nonlocal; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132787754"

However, the detection of sites with spatial heterogeneity in pasture cover as a manifestation of selective grazing has not yet been investigated using satellite remote sensing. Thus, this study was conducted to address the question; can Sentinel-1 detect spatial heterogeneity induced by livestock grazing in grassy fields? Since Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging is noted to be sensitive to vegetation architectural arrangement, this study used Sentinel-1 C-band SAR to detect spatial heterogeneity created by selective livestock grazing. The study examined a range of semivariogram, grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and eigenvector-eigenvalue polarimetric decomposition features. The coefficient of variation estimates of the GLCM contrast feature consistently produced the strongest correlation (R 2 = 0.71) with Lloyd’s Patchiness Index and semivariogram sill while the polarimetric scattering entropy (range estimates) produced a significant linear correlation with semivariogram sill (R 2 = 0.55, p < 0.05). Inferably, the GLCM contrast and polarimetric scattering entropy can predict spatial heterogeneity in a grazing environment. This is the first time polarimetric scattering entropy estimated from Sentinel-1 has been used for the detection of spatial heterogeneity in a grazing landscape, which makes this study different from past similar studies. Nonetheless, we recommend the testing of this parameter (polarimetric scattering entropy) with a multitemporal SAR data and encourage future studies to investigate the potential of Sentinel-1 for the detection of spatial distances between grass clumps. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Entropy; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Coefficient of variation; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Linear correlation; Multi-temporal SAR; Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric scattering; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial heterogeneity; grassland; heterogeneity; parameter estimation; pasture; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; species diversity; synthetic aperture radar; Agriculture","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095848740"

Most importantly, two significant accelerations were detected at the upper area of the Aningzhai slope before the occurrence of failure.

These limitations are overcome in this study by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and deep learning technique. Two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) architecture is applied on multi-temporal SAR data of Sentinel-1 to classify soybean, jowar, cotton and sugarcane crops in a large geographic area located in a Central Indian state. Classification experiments are conducted with full season data from nine overpasses in three modes namely VH alone, VH and VH/VV ratio, and VH and VV, and these experimental results reveal that VH and VV combination performed better with an overall accuracy of 91.75% as compared to 84.96% and 88.75% respectively by others. Classification performances with three sets of temporal data, covering part of the season, reveal that crop map can be generated as early as 27th August (i.e. roughly 45 days prior harvesting) with an accuracy of 89.15% slightly less than the mapping accuracy achieved with full season data (i.e. till 14th October). 2D-CNN algorithm has performed better than SVM and RF techniques. This methodology can be extended to similar agro-ecological regions of the country.

According to the measurement results of GPS RTK, this method can obtain a high accuracy of shoreline extraction, with an observation error of 71.4% within one pixel of the image. Then, the influence of annual water discharge and sediment load on the changes of the coastline is investigated. The results show that there are two significant accretion areas in the Qing 8 and Qingshuigou course. The relative high correlation illustrates that the sediment discharge has a great contribution to the change of estuary area.

With the advancement in deep neural networks, existing work in the literature mainly concentrates on developing self-supervised methods to generate pseudo-labeled samples to guide the subsequent deep learning based detection. However, this way of selecting sample inevitably introduces erroneous labels and imbalance between unchanged and changed classes, thus causing deterioration in change detection performance. To mitigate these issues, we have proposed a SAR change detection network based on visual saliency and multi-hierarchical fuzzy clustering. Specifically, with multi-dimensional difference feature representations, a visual saliency based difference map is constructed for accurate difference feature extraction. By integrating neighborhood information and hierarchical clustering, the multi-hierarchical fuzzy local information C-means clustering algorithm has been developed to identify potential changed regions for sample selection. A class-balanced adaptive focal loss has further been incorporated into the network training to obtain accurate predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on five datasets have been performed.

Conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions with a single beam only detect deformation along the line of sight (LOS) and relative elevation due to the undetermined model of phase wrapping. In a multisatellite SAR mission, measurements from different SAR geometry improve the sensitivity of the detectable deformation, especially to the deformation along the north-south (N-S) direction. However, it is difficult to combine the measurements from varying viewing angles since the absolute phase cannot be reconstructed without a ground control point. In this article, a tri-beam SAR system is introduced to detect 3-D deformation and derive multiview 3-D surface model from a single spaceborne platform. The accuracy of the 3-D deformation from the tri-beam SAR is exploited with varying squint and incident angles to obtain the optimal parameters of the three beams. Then a multidimensional coherent scattering model is used to simulate the multitemporal SAR data with different viewing angles. Regarding the tri-beam SAR, potential applications in earth observation including 3-D deformation monitoring, geodetic stereo SAR, and multiview 3-D forest reconstruction are investigated subsequently. The results of this study indicate that the tri-beam SAR is able to measure 3-D deformation and reconstruct 3-D surface model without ground control point.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Coherent scattering; Deformation; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Image reconstruction; Interferometry; Observatories; Radar measurement; Rock mechanics; Space applications; Space-based radar; Surface measurement; Surface reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; Extraterrestrial measurements; Geodetic stereo synthetic aperture radar; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR); Radar polarimetry; Solid modelling; Squint synthetic aperture radar; Squint synthetic aperture radar.; Surfaces reconstruction; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; data set; detection method; satellite mission; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Geodetic stereo synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Multitemporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR); Squint SAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118266733"

In this study, multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 fine beam quad-polarized SAR data was obtained, and a crop classification method based on similarity analysis of phenological features and image segmentation technology was proposed. The main idea of this method is to construct a standard phenological feature sequence (SPFS) based on backscatter coefficient and Cloude decomposition parameters for each crop by using the training data, and then the similarity coefficient between the segmented test data and the phenological sequence of each crop is calculated to judge the type of ground objects. The results show that the overall classification accuracy based on block scale reached to 76.06%, which indicates that the phenological features and image segmentation is beneficial for accuracy improving in crop classification. And the multi-temporal SAR data own great potential in agricultural monitoring. © 2021 IEEE","Backscattering; Classification (of information); Crops; Image classification; Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscatter coefficients; Crop classification; Feature sequence; Images segmentations; Multi-temporal SAR; Multi-temporal SAR data; Phenological feature sequence; Polarimetric decomposition; SAR data; SAR imagery; Image segmentation","Backscatter coefficient; Image segmentation; Multi-temporal SAR data; Phenological feature sequences; Polarimetric decomposition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129885957"

Recent advances in the field of cloud removal consider multi-temporal data to reconstruct pixels covered by clouds at a time point of interest. Yet, the limitation of preceding work is that information gets integrated over time, removing any temporal resolution from the de-clouded end products. In this work we consider a sequence-to-sequence approach, translating cloudy time series to a series of cloud-free multi-spectral images without the need of any external cloud-free data set. Our network is guided by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) information providing a strong prior for the reconstruction of cloud-covered information. We analyze the proposed method by visual inspection of predictions and in terms of error metrics to highlight its benefits. Finally, an ablation study is conducted in which the our network is compared against a baseline model and the effectiveness of the proposed SAR prior is demonstrated. © 2021 IEEE","Deep learning; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Cloud coverage; Cloud removal; Continuous demand; Deep learning; Internal learning; On demands; Optical imagery; Optical satellites; Prior information; Times series; Data fusion","cloud removal; data fusion; deep learning; optical imagery; synthetic aperture radar; time series","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126275713"

Differences in phenological development of crops lead to dissimilar temporal signatures of backscatter intensities, which may influence the separability of the crop classes. This principle leads to multi-date classification approach. In this work, kernel principal component (KPCA) is adopted for feature selection from multi-date datasets, and the selected features are used for classification using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classification is investigated for both the KPCA-based SVM and only SVM approaches using quad-pol C-band RADARSAT-2 data acquired over the test site in Vijayawada, India.

The absorption of solar radiation in the water leads to a higher ice ablation, and water draining through the glacier to its bed leads to a higher velocity. Rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns provoke an increase in the supraglacial lakes in number and total area. However, the seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes and thus their potential for influencing mass balance and ice dynamics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We present a summertime series of supraglacial lake evolution on Baltoro Glacier in the Karakoram from 2016 to 2020. The dense time series is enabled by a multi-sensor and multi-temporal approach based on optical (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR; Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X) remote sensing data. The mapping of the seasonal lake evolution uses a semi-automatic approach, which includes a random forest classifier applied separately to each sensor. A combination of linear regression and the Hausdorff distance is used to harmonize between SAR- and optical-derived lake areas, producing consistent and internally robust time series dynamics. Seasonal variations in the lake area are linked with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI) based on air temperature and precipitation data derived from the climate reanalysis dataset ERA5-Land. The largest aggregated lake area was found in 2018 with 5.783 km2, followed by 2019 with 4.703 km2, and 2020 with 4.606 km2. The years 2016 and 2017 showed the smallest areas with 3.606 and 3.653 km2, respectively. Our data suggest that warmer spring seasons (April–May) with higher precipitation rates lead to increased formation of supraglacial lakes. The time series decomposition shows a linear increase in the lake area of 11.12 ± 9.57% per year. Although the five-year observation period is too short to derive a significant trend, the tendency for a possible increase in the supraglacial lake area is in line with the pronounced positive anomalies of the SPI and STI during the observation period.

In this study, multiple satellites with different frequencies (C-band, L-band) and periodic GNSS observations were employed. For the entire peninsula, we processed 149 images from the ascending orbit, 144 images from the descending orbit of Sentinel-1 (C-Band) and 24 ALOS-2 (L-band) images from the ascending orbit. The evaluations were carried out in the period between 2015 and 2020 for Sentinel-1 imagery and 2015–2020 for ALOS-2 imagery respectively. Since the study area is covered by dense settlements, the Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI) technique was utilized to determine the landslide behaviors. According to the results, for both orbits of the Sentinel-1, the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement were observed in the range of − 10 to 6 mm. Compared to the magnitude of displacement signal measured by Sentinel-1, ALOS-2 data has higher values due to the high surface penetration of the L-band. The results showed that most of the old landslide regions are reactivated. Horizontal movement derived through Sentinel-1 showed that the highest movement overlaps with old landslides. L-band ALOS-2 provided better spatial coverage of landslide movement than C-band Sentinel-1 data, especially at the rural part along the coast of the lake. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Istanbul [Istanbul (PRV)]; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; Satellites; ALOS; displacement; GNSS; imagery; landslide; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series","GNSS; InSAR; Landslides; Multi-temporal SAR; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108280257"

Furthermore, SAR images can be acquired regardless of the weather conditions. The monitoring and study of wetlands have become increasingly important due to the social and ecological benefits they provide and the constant pressures they are subject to. The Sentinel-1 mission from the European Space Agency enables the possibility of having free access to multitemporal SAR data. This study aims to investigate the use of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data for wetlands land-cover classification. To perform this assessment, we acquired 76 Sentinel-1 images from a portion of the Lower Delta of the Paraná River, and considering different seasons, texture measurements, and polarization, 30 datasets were created. For each dataset, a Random Forest classifier was trained. Our experiments show that datasets that included the winter dates achieved kappa index values (κ) higher than 0.8. Including textures measurements showed improvements in the classifications: for the summer datasets, the κ increased more than 14%, whereas, for Winter datasets in the VH and Dual polarization, the improvements were lower than 4%. Our results suggest that for the analyzed land-cover classes, winter is the most informative season. Moreover, for Summer datasets, the textures measurements provide complementary information.

This paper proposes a method for estimating river water levels under bridges using multi-temporal high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. Due to the side-looking characteristics of SAR data acquisitions, bridges crossing over rivers usually exhibit multiple bounce echoes in SAR images caused by the multipath scattering. The range difference of the multiple returns is proportional to the clearance between the water surface and the bridge. In this study, the water level oscillation of Yangtze River under Badong Yangzte River Bridge (China) was calculated by estimating the range pixel distances of the multiple bounces in ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images using cross correlation algorithm. Besides, a linear correlation between the range pixel distance of the multiple bounces and in situ water level measurements was found, with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.9985. This relationship allowed estimating the river water level in each SAR acquisition, with an average error equal to −0.39 m and root mean square error of 0.51 m, and the elevation of the bridge, with an error of about 0.5 m, which is smaller than the theoretical uncertainty of the method (1.24 m). The obtained results show the efficiency of the method in estimating river water levels. © 2021 COSPAR","Errors; Mean square error; Pixels; Radar imaging; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Uncertainty analysis; High resolution synthetic aperture radar; High resolution synthetic aperture radar images; Hydraulic process; Hydrological process; Multi-temporal; Multiple bounce; River water; River water level; Synthetic aperture radar images; Yangzte river, china; Water levels","Bridge; High-resolution SAR image; Multiple bounces; River water level; Yangzte River, China","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116896727"

The present study aimed to propose a systematic SAR simulation involving the imaginary part of dielectric constant measurements of two consecutive seasons (dry and wet) to quantify and discriminate the irrigation-induced and upheaval-associated salinity from total salinity levels and investigate its impact on crop growth. The Sentinel-1 data of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) acquired for both the dry and wet spells from 2015 to 2019 was instrumental in the present study. The total soil EC (Electrical Conductivity) was quantified from the imaginary part of dielectric constant (ε″) using semi-empirical microwave simulation “DSDM-SS”. Irrigation-induced salinity (εIrrigation″) and upheaval-associated salinity (εUpheaval″) were extracted from ε″ by proposing a site-, and climatic-specific novel model. The εUpheaval″ and εIrrigation″ have shown promising statistical significance with the in-situ soil EC (R2 = 0.89, p = <0.001, rMSE = 1.08, Bias = 0.584) and groundwater EC measurements (R2 = 0.85, p = <0.001, rMSE = 1.28, Bias = 1.16). The study found that the rate of salinity increase over time due to irrigation (77%) was considerably higher than the upheaval (42%) process. This demonstrated that the intensive use of groundwater for irrigation has a higher impact on vegetation vigor (θ = −0.87) than the upheaval process. The study revealed that crop failure in the dry season was provoked by osmotic stress and waterlogging conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural Irrigation; Desert Climate; Groundwater; Salinity; Soil; Crops; Drought; Groundwater; Irrigation; Soils; ground water; ground water; Groundwater associated salinity; Imaginary part of dielectric constant; Imaginary parts; Irrigation-induced salinity; Microwave remote sensing; Multi-temporal; Salinisation; Salinity effects; SAR data; Soil electrical conductivity; dielectric property; groundwater; irrigation; microwave imagery; remote sensing; salinity; synthetic aperture radar; Article; crop management; data analysis; dielectric constant; dry season; electric conductivity; environmental impact; environmental temperature; frequency modulation; imagery; irrigation (agriculture); measurement; microwave radiation; osmotic stress; plant growth; plant water use; rainy season; remote sensing; salinity; simulation; statistical significance; trend study; vegetation; waterlogging; desert climate; irrigation (agriculture); soil; Remote sensing","Groundwater associated salinity; Imaginary part of dielectric constant; Irrigation-induced salinity; Microwave remote sensing; Salinity effects","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107266544"

As an active fault, it leads to natural disasters, one of them being the Yogyakarta earthquake in 2006. Since then, Opak Fault surface deformation has not reoccured; hence measurement to detect this movement is essential. A widely used method in surface deformation measurement is Persistent Scatter Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar. A refined version of the PSI technique, the QPSI method, allows identifying and estimating targets undergoing movement through the reflectivity and amplitude stability of SAR waves. This study analyzed multi temporal Sentinel-1 Ascending and Descending data to analyze the Quasi-PSI performance in detecting surface deformation surrounding the Opak Fault. Results showed subsidence of the Opak Fault with a displacement accumulation up to -50mm throughout a period of 6 years. A majority of the surface deformation occurring in the area of interest lies at the border between Bantul Graben and the highlands of Gunung Kidul. Some of the surface displacements implied the presence of ongoing slope activity. In the area with a velocity displacement of -7 to -10 mm/year, a cumulative displacement greater than -50 mm was found. Furthermore, areas with a -2.5 to -5.5 mm/year velocity displayed a cumulative displacement ranging from -30 mm to - 40 mm. Surface deformation in the study area expressed an adequate result with a few sparse zones. Nonetheless, results from the ascending and descending modes present dissimilarity between results from several locations.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Deformation; Disasters; Fault detection; Faulting; Interferometry; Radar measurement; Amplitude stability; Area of interest; Fault surfaces; Interferometry synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Natural disasters; Surface deformation; Surface displacement; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105355298"

Seasonal changes in permafrost are usually reflected as ground surface deformation, which can be monitored by multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technology. Owing to the extreme environment in the QTP, there are few ground-based deformational observation data available, and records of permafrost monitoring by MT-InSAR with ground validation are limited. Here we present a study of surface deformation monitoring for permafrost with MT-InSAR technology validated by a large number of in-situ observations compared with the previous published results. In this study, a small baseline subset (SBAS) method was used with ENVISAT ASAR data in WuDaoLiang, QTP, to acquire the surface deformation and to analyze the corresponding characteristics. The results were first validated with 24 GNSS leveling observation points along the Qinghai–Tibet Railway, including numeric validation (e.g., statistics and KS test) between the InSAR derived deformation and the time-interpolated GNSS leveling values, and the variation trend of the two deformation sequences during a permafrost deformation period, at each observation point. Considering both the differences in magnitudes and trends, the deformation at 22 out of 24 points detected by InSAR corresponded well to the GNSS observation series over one year, which indicates the reliability of MT-InSAR for permafrost monitoring. After validation, the amplitudes and linear velocity of the InSAR deformation in this region were calculated and analyzed, together with selected points in different types of terrain. Generally, in the deformation map, most pixels show a trend of periodic and seasonal displacement, uplift in winter and subsidence in summer, with amplitudes of 3–10 mm in most regions. The deformation in mountain areas is less than that of flat lands in amplitude, and shows more randomness in periodic characteristics. Meanwhile, some points with obvious settlement have been detected, probably corresponding with permafrost degradation. © 2021 The Author(s)","China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; deformation; environmental monitoring; Envisat; global warming; GNSS; permafrost; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar","Envisat ASAR; GNSS leveling; InSAR; Permafrost; Tibet","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120091629"

While the wide-scale variability of the atmosphere can be adequately modeled with global or regional weather models, it is especially the turbulent and convective part of the atmosphere at smaller spatial and temporal scales that is typically poorly captured. Due to the high resolution and precision of InSAR, there is a need for a realistic modeling of the 3-D distribution of turbulent refractivity in the boundary layer. This would enable assessment of the impact of a temporal or spatial model misalignment on the interferometric products, and contribute to studying the impact for future SAR missions. Here we test the feasibility of an advanced large Eddy simulation (LES) model to simulate a time-series refractivity distribution with a high spatio-temporal resolution to show the spatio-temporal variability of the troposphere on short time scales. We found for a fair-weather situation that the LES model produces realistic atmospheric simulations that match stochastically with results found in interferometric studies and that tropospheric delay variation leads to significant phase gradients within several minutes. This implies that even when using an (unrealistic) perfect weather model with resolutions similar to the SAR image, realizations that are several minutes apart from the time of the SAR acquisition will lead to significant phase errors. We propose the use of LES models as a realistic instrument to perform InSAR quality-assessments and for the development and simulation for future missions. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Interferometry; Large eddy simulation; Refraction; Synthetic aperture radar; Troposphere; Atmospheric modeling; Delay; Interferometric products; Large eddy simulation models; Large-eddy simulations; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal InSAR; Spatio-temporal; Tropospheric delays; Weather modeling; large eddy simulation; radar interferometry; spatial variation; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; troposphere; Refractive index","Large-eddy simulation (LES); multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); tropospheric delay","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137580852"

Datasets that document the spatial and temporal variability of the landscape are needed to monitor the rapid changes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is specifically suitable for monitoring the Arctic, as SAR, unlike optical remote sensing, can provide time series regardless of weather and illumination conditions. This study examines the potential of seasonal backscatter mechanisms in Arctic tundra environments for improving land cover classification purposes by using a time series of HH/HV TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery. A Random Forest (RF) classification was applied on multi-temporal Sigma Nought intensity and multi-temporal Kennaugh matrix element data. The backscatter analysis revealed clear differences in the polarimetric response of water, soil, and vegetation, while backscatter signal variations within different vegetation classes were more nuanced. The RF models showed that land cover classes could be distinguished with 92.4% accuracy for the Kennaugh element data, compared to 57.7% accuracy for the Sigma Nought intensity data. Texture predictors, while improving the classification accuracy on the one hand, degraded the spatial resolution of the land cover product. The Kennaugh elements derived from TSX winter acquisitions were most important for the RF model, followed by the Kennaugh elements derived from summer and autumn acquisitions. The results of this study demonstrate that multi-temporal Kennaugh elements derived from dual-polarized X-band imagery are a powerful tool for Arctic tundra land cover mapping. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the Sentinel-1A/B satellite and optical images captured by the PlanetScope satellites were jointly used to analyze and explore the deformation characteristics and the Spatial-Temporal evolution of the ANZ landslide before and after the multi-hazard chain. Several areas of pre-failure movements were found from the multi-temporal optical images analysis before the reactivation of the ANZ landslide. The large post-failure surface deformation over the ANZ slope was also retrieved by the optical pixel offset tracking (POT) technique. A major northwest movement with the maximum horizontal deformation of up to 14.4 m was found. A time-series InSAR technique was applied to analyze the descending and ascending Sentinel-1A/B datasets spanning from March 2018 to July 2020, showing that the maximum magnitudes of the Line of Sight (LoS) displacement velocities were −70 mm/year and 45 mm/year, respectively. The Spatial-Temporal evolution over the ANZ landslide was analyzed based on the time-series results. No obvious change in acceleration (precursory deformation) was detected before the multi-hazard chain, while clear accelerated deformation can be observed over the slope after the event. This suggested that heavy rainfall was the most significant triggering factor for the generation and reactivation of the ANZ landslide. Other preparatory factors, including the deformation behavior, the undercutting and erosion of the river and the outburst flood, the local terrain conditions, and earthquakes, might also have played an important role in the generation and reactivation of the landslide. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the development and validation of these models are more challenging where the monitoring stations are limited, unevenly distributed, and particularly scarce in many developing countries. Alternatively, satellite images allow detecting the multi-temporal flood extent over large horizontal areas with a cost advantage for hydrological calibration and validation. Many approaches have been explored to distinguish floodwater from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. However, most of the SAR-based flood studies use only intensity bands to detect the water surface. Studies using polarimetric and coherence for flood detection are few because of their complexity. The general objective of this study is to investigate and explore the potential of intensity, polarimetric, and coherence information of SAR Sentinel-1 satellite data to detect flooded areas and enhance the reliability of flood mapping in rural landscapes. This study tested 15 approaches as the combination of intensity bands with textures, polarimetry, and coherence images derived from dual-polarization Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 C-band data. Random Forest (RF) model was used to classify these SAR-based image compositions to detect the flood areas. The model Overall accuracies (OA), precision (Producer accuracies - PA), and sensitivity (User accuracies - UA) were used to evaluate the RF classification and contribution of intake SAR-based image components. Results showed that the modest model accuracies were achieved (UA = 75%, PA = 86.9%, OA = 94.3%) when flood image intensity bands were combined with Alpha, Anisotropy, and the co-event coherence images. It was concluded that the use of polarimetric and coherence information can significantly improve the accuracy of flood maps derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Traditional multitemporal interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) is able to monitor long-term and periodic deformation with high precision by time-series analysis. However, as time series lengthen, it is time-consuming to update the current results by reprocessing the whole dataset. Additionally, the number of coherent scatterers varies over time due to disappearing and emerging scatterers due to inevitable changes in surface scattering, and potential deformation anomalies require changes in the prevailing deformation model. Here, we propose a novel method to analyze InSAR time series recursively and detect both significant changes in scattering as well as deformation anomalies based on the new acquisitions. Sequential change detection is developed to identify temporary coherent scatterers (TCSs) using amplitude time series. Based on the predicted phase residuals, scatterers with abnormal deformation displacements are identified by a generalized ratio test, while the parameters of stable scatterers are updated using Kalman filtering. The quality of the anomaly detection is assessed based on the detectability power and the minimum detectable deformation. This facilitates (near) real-time data processing and decreases the false alarm likelihood. Experimental results show that the technique can be used for the real-time evaluation of deformation risks. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Anomaly detection; Coherent scattering; Data handling; Surface scattering; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Anomaly detection; Change detection; Coherent scatterers; Combined detections; Multi-temporal; Multitemporal InSAR; Recursive process; Surface changes; Surface-deformations; Times series; amplitude; data processing; detection method; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; Deformation","Anomaly detection; change detection; multitemporal InSAR; recursive process","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123628012"

This paper explores the possibility of addressing fast and accurate SAR image geometric coregistra-tion, with sub-pixel accuracy and in the presence of a complex 3-D object scene, by exploiting the parallelism offered by shared-memory architectures. An efficient and scalable processor is proposed by designing a parallel algorithm incorporating thread-level parallelism for solving the inherent computationally intensive problem. The adopted functional scheme is first mathematically framed and then investigated in detail in terms of its computational structures. Subsequently, a parallel version of the algorithm is designed, according to a fork-join model, by suitably taking into account the granularity of the decomposition, load-balancing, and different scheduling strategies. The developed parallel algorithm implements parallelism at the thread-level by using OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) and it is specifically targeted at shared-memory multiprocessors. The parallel performance of the implemented multithreading-based SAR image coregistration prototype processor is experimentally investigated and quantitatively assessed by processing high-resolution X-band COSMO-SkyMed SAR data and using two different multicore architectures. The effectiveness of the developed multithreaded prototype solution in fully benefitting from the computing power offered by multicore processors has successfully been demonstrated via a suitable experimental performance analysis conducted in terms of parallel speedup and efficiency.

Observations and classification of forest phenology provide valuable inputs for ecosystem models regarding its responses to climate change to assist forest management. Remotely sensed observations are often used to derive the parameters corre-sponding to seasonal vegetation dynamics. Data acquired from the Sentinel-1A satellite holds a great potential to improve forest type classification at a medium-large scale. This article presents an integrated object-based classification method by using Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 OLI data acquired during different phenological periods (rainy and dry seasons). The deciduous forest and nondecid-uous forest areas are classified by using NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from Landsat 8 cloud-free composite images taken during dry (from February to April) and rainy (from June to October) seasons. Shorea siamensis (S. siamensis), Shorea obtusa (S. obtusa), and Dipterocarpus tuber-culatus (D. tuberculatus) in the deciduous forest area are classified based on the correlation between phenology of BDFs in Yok Don National Park and backscatter values of time-series Sentinel-1A imagery in deciduous forest areas. One hundred and five plots were selected during the field survey in the study area, consisting of dominant deciduous species, tree height, and canopy diameter. Thirty-nine plots were used for training to decide the broadleaf deciduous forest areas of the classified BDFs by the proposed method, and the other sixty-six plots were used for validation. Our proposed approach used the changes of backscatter in multitemporal SAR images to implement BDF classification mapping with acceptable accuracy. The overall accuracy of classification is about 79%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.7. Accurate classification and mapping of the BDFs using the proposed method can help authorities implement forest management in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Development of novel approach to Monitor wildfire progressions in near real-time is therefore of critical importance for emergency responses. The objective of this research is to investigate continuous learning with U-Net by exploiting both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI time series for increasing the frequency and accuracy of wildfire progression mapping. In this study, optical-based burned areas prior to each SAR acquisition (when available) were accumulated into SAR-based pseudo progression masks to train a deep residual U-Net model. Unlike multi-temporal fusion of SAR and optical data, the temporal fusion of progression masks allows us to track as many wildfire progressions as possible. Specifically, two approaches were investigated to train the deep residual U-Net model for continuous learning: 1) Continuous joint training (CJT) with all historical data (including both SAR and optical data); 2) Learning without forgetting (LwF) based on newly incoming data alone (SAR or optical). For LwF, a mean squared loss was integrated to keep the capabilities learned before and prevent it from overfitting to newly incoming data only. By fusing optical-based burned areas, SAR-based progression pseudo masks improve significantly, which benefits both data sampling and model training, considering the challenges in SAR-based change extraction attributed to the variability in SAR backscatter of the surrounding environments. Pre-trained ResNet was frozen as the encoder of the U-Net model, and the decoder part was trained to further refine the derived burned area maps in a progression-wise manner. The experimental results demonstrated that LwF has the potential to match CJT in terms of the agreement between SAR-based results and optical-based ground truth, achieving a F1 score of 0.8423 on the Sydney Fire (2019–2020) and 0.7807 on the Chuckegg Creek Fire (2019). We also observed that the SAR cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) shows good capability in suppressing multiplicative noise and detecting burned areas when VH and VV have diverse temporal behaviors. © 2021 The Author(s)","Varanidae; Climate change; Deep learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Burned areas; Change detection; Deep learning; Near-real time; Net model; Optical-; SAR; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2.; U-net; algorithm; climate change; detection method; real time; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series; time series analysis; wild population; wildfire; Fires","Burned area; Change detection; Deep learning; SAR; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2.; U-Net; Wildfire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105352138"

However, cloudy/rainy climate conditions can easily lead to a lack of valid optical data, leading to crop classification difficulties. A general solution is taking advantage of all-weather synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. In practice, SAR and optical datasets are often applied in the agricultural field by the method of image fusion, but it is difficult to apply when the number of optical images is too small. To solve this problem, this research proposes a data-transfer and feature-optimize-based method, which deploy an RNN-based encoding-decoding network to add additional data to the ‘optical’ temporal features at the farmland parcel scale and improve the utilization of optical fragments. On the basis of this method, we mitigate inconsistencies in spatial scale among different datasets and optimize the time-series parameters without expert knowledge in the crop classification procedure. The experimental results illustrate the crop classification accuracy of this method, which achieves a 4.1% improvement over the traditional approach and is especially effective for dryland crops (e.g. corn and rapeseed). Thus, this research demonstrates the effectiveness of the combined use of optical and SAR data for similar applications in cloudy/rainy mountainous areas. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Classification (of information); Crops; Data transfer; Deep learning; Farms; Geometrical optics; Image fusion; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Cloudy/rainy mountainoi area; Combined utilization; Crop classification; Feature transfers; Mountainous area; Multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Optical-; Optimisations; Sentinel-1; agricultural land; crop plant; data set; machine learning; mountain region; optimization; remote sensing; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","cloudy/rainy mountainous area; combined utilization; crop classification; feature transfer; multitemporal data; optimization","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125641177"

Yet, its use is limited to high coherences. This article proposes the analysis of low-coherence scenarios by introducing a reinterpretation of coherence. It is demonstrated that coherence results from the product of two terms accounting for coherent and radiometric changes, respectively. For low coherences, the first term presents low values, preventing its exploitation for information retrieval. The information provided by the second term can be used in these circumstances to exploit common information. This second term is proposed, as an alternative to coherence, for information retrieval for low coherences. Besides, it is shown that polarimetry allows the temporal optimization of its values.

For this reason, it is essential to analyze landslide dynamics and environmental conditioning factors. Various techniques and instruments exist for landslide investigation and monitoring. Out of these, Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) techniques have been widely used in the last decades. Their capabilities are enhanced by the availability of the active Sentinel-1 mission, whose 6-day revisiting time enables near real-time monitoring of landslides. Interferometric results, coupled with ground measurements or other approaches such as numerical modeling, significantly improve the knowledge of the investigated surface processes. In this work, we processed the C-band SAR images of the available European Space Agency (ESA) satellite missions, using MT-InSAR methods to identify the surface deformations related to landslides affecting the Iași Municipality (Eastern Romania). The results (i.e., velocity maps) point out the most active landslides with velocities of up to 20 mm/year measured along the satellite Line of Sight (LOS). Following, we focused on the most problematic landslide that affects the Țicău neighborhood and is well-known for its significant implications that it had. To better understand its behavior and the sensitivity of the displacements to the environmental factors (i.e., rainfall), we carried out 2D numerical modeling using a finite difference code. The simulated displacement field is consistent with the InSAR displacements and reveals the most active sectors of the landslide and insights about its mechanism. © 2021 by the authors.

Then, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Jianshanying landslide is analyzed in terms of line-of-sight (LOS) deformation with stacking InSAR method and two-dimensional (2D) deformation with improved SAR offset-tracking method. And the different deformation features between sliding body and surrounding areas are uncovered. Accordingly, we point out the “three-section” surface deformation model. We further analyze the deformation time series by considering the joint effects of rainfall and underground mining.

Due to limited radiometric sensitivity to forest biomass variation at C-band, basic multitemporal change detection approach was supplemented by spatial texture analysis to separate disturbed forest from intact. The developed technique primarily uses multi-temporal aggregation of orthorectified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery that are acquired before and after the logging operations. The actual change analysis is based on textural features of the log-ratio image calculated using two SAR temporal composites compiled of SAR scenes acquired before and after the logging operations. Multitemporal aggregation and filtering of SAR scenes decreased speckle and made the extracted textural features more prominent. The overall detection accuracy was around 80%, with some underestimation of the area of forest disturbance compared to reference based on optical data. The user’s accuracy for disturbed forest varied from 76.7% to 94.9% depending on the accuracy assessment approach.

In the last decades, technologies such as LiDAR, terrestrial and satellite SAR interferometry (InSAR) and photogrammetry demonstrated a great potential for rock slope assessment while limited studies and applications are still available for ArcSAR Interferometry, Gigapixel imaging and Acoustic sensing. Taking advantage of the facilities located at the Poggio Baldi Landslide Natural Laboratory, an intensive monitoring campaign was carried out on May 2019 using simultaneously the HYDRA‐G ArcSAR for radar monitoring, the Gigapan robotic system equipped with a DSLR camera for photo‐monitoring purposes and the DUO Smart Noise Monitor for acoustic measurements.

This allowed us to understand the short‐term evolution of the rock cliff that is characterized by several impulsive rockfall events and continuous debris production. Radar displacement maps revealed a constant movement of the debris talus at the toe of the main rock scarp, while acoustic records proved the capability of this technique to identify rockfall events as well as their spectral content in a narrow range of frequencies between 200 Hz to 1000 Hz.

Unfortunately, current phase reconstruction methods generally exhibit a low computational efficiency due to their high non-linearity, in particular in the case that the dimension of a SAR stack is high. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to efficiently resolve phase reconstruction problems. This approach is inspired by the theory of probabilistic principle component analysis. A complex valued probability generative model is constructed to portray a phase reconstruction process. Moreover, in order to resolve such a model, a targeted algorithm based on the idea of expectation maximization is designed and implemented. For validation purposes, the proposed approach is compared to the traditional eigenvalue decomposition-based method by using simulated data and 101 real Sentinel-1A SAR images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accelerate the phase reconstruction process drastically, in particular when a high-dimensional SAR stack is required to be processed. © 2021 by the authors.

Four parameters derived from Sentinel-1 (backscatters in dual-polarization: σVHo, σVVo, cross-ratio ([Formula presented]), and radar vegetation index (RVI)) were considered to develop temporal patterns and correlate with un-classified time-series satellite imagery using time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm. Pixel and parcel based classifications were considered to identify four crop varieties (paddy, sugarcane, cotton and vegetables) subjected to two water limiting conditions (low stress-LS, high stress-HS). In-situ data were split-sampled (30:70 ratio) between training (to develop temporal patterns) and testing (to validate classification output). Overall accuracy of pixel and parcel based classifications were 63% and 76% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.58 and 0.73 respectively. In conclusion, parcel based TWDTW algorithm conditioned by temporal signatures of RVI has effectively delineated croplands with varying irrigation treatments for yield and damage assessment modeling studies. © 2021","","Fragmented lands; Pixel and parcel classification; Sentinel-1; Temporal patterns; TWDTW","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123123069"

Flood damages were assessed by considering both the LULC and flood maps. We defined three strategies to compare the MS + SAR and MS + Pan images to demonstrate the ability of the MultiSenCNN algorithm for LULC classification. The three strategies yielded an average overall accuracy of ∼98% and an average Kappa of ∼0.98 for LULC classification. The overall accuracy of the fused MS + SAR images is slightly higher than the MS + Pan images when using the same model training samples. The flood mapping shows an overall accuracy of 97.22% and a Kappa of 0.94, with a flood inundation area of 101 km2 that mainly inundated cropland and urban areas. Compared to other LULC types, the flooded cropland has caused more loss of ecosystem service values during typhoon Lekima, accounting for 81.19% of the total. Using SAR mages can well monitor the start/end states of flood events and the inundated areas, providing the flood status information to rescuers and governments for making timely decisions. © 2022 The Author(s).

The study was conducted in the Małopolskie municipality, a rural setting with sparse urbanization in the Polish Flysch Carpathians. PSInSAR has been applied using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel 1A/B with different acquisition geometries (ascending and descending orbit) to increase PS coverage and mitigate the geometric effects due to layover and shadowing. The Line-Of-Sight PSInSAR measurements were projected to the steepest slope, which allowed to homogenize the results from diverse acquisition modes and to compare the displacement velocities with different slope orientations. Additionally, landslide intensity (motion rate) and expected damage maps were generated and verified during field investigations. A high correlation between PSInSAR results and in-situ damage observations was confirmed. The activity state and landslide-related expected damage maps have been confirmed for 43 out of a total of 50 landslides investigated in the field. The short temporal baseline provided by both Sentinel satellites (1A/B data) increases the PS density significantly. The study substantiates the usefulness of SAR based landslide activity monitoring for land use and land development, even in rural areas. © 2021 The Authors","","Interferometry; Landslide activity; Landslide intensity; Persistent scatterers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122618018"

However, reliable monitoring data are difficult to acquire after 2018 due to the lack of continuous maintenance of the field measurement equipment. In this study, the multitemporal interferometry (MTI) technique is applied with Sentinel-1 SAR images to monitor the slow-moving landslide from 2014–2019. The slow-moving areas detected by persistent scatterer (PS) pixels are consistent with the range of previous studies, which are based on in situ monitoring data and field surveys. According to the time series of the PS pixels, a long period gravity-induced deformation of the slow-moving landslide can be clearly observed. Moreover, a short period seasonal surface fluctuation of the slow-moving landslide, which has seldom been discussed before, can also be detected in this study. The seasonal surface fluctuation is in-phase with precipitation, which is inferred to be related to the geological and hydrological conditions of the study area. The MTI technique can compensate for the lack of surface displacement data, in this case, the Huafan University campus, and provide information for evaluating and monitoring slow-moving landslides for possible landslide early warning in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent applications of deep generative models and sequence-to-sequence-based models have proved their capability to advance the field significantly. Nevertheless, there are still some gaps: the amount of cloud coverage, the landscape temporal changes, and the density and thickness of clouds need further investigation. We fill some of these gaps in this work by introducing an innovative deep model. The proposed model is multimodal, relying on both spatial and temporal sources of information to restore the whole optical scene of interest. We use the outcomes of both temporal-sequence blending and direct translation from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to optical images to obtain a pixel-wise restoration of the whole scene. The reconstructed images preserve scene details without resorting to a considerable portion of a clean image. Our approach's advantage is demonstrated across various atmospheric conditions tested on different datasets.

Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were trained and assessed for three major crops (wheat, soybeans and canola). ANN provided the best accuracy for all wheat parameters and soybean LAI and canola wet biomass and LAI. RFR led to higher accuracy for soybean dry and wet biomass. However, SVR could accurately estimate only canola dry biomass. All data were then pooled to investigate if a single algorithm could estimate biophysical parameters for all crops. The RFR model accurately estimated wet and dry biomass and LAI across all crop types in this scenario.

With increasing deployments of highly capable commercial satellites offering high spectral and spatial resolution, global coverage and site revisit rates, predictive structural instability/integrity assessment is becoming accessible at a fraction of cost of aerial and ground based solutions. This paper presents an overview of the opportunities and challenges in affordably monitoring new and longstanding large buildings, monuments and ground infrastructure. This is necessitated by increasingly intense exploitation of environmental resources, hydrogeological instabilities and risk of natural disasters in environments perturbed by human activities that has created new risks.

New results are presented on dataset acquired using ESA's Sentinel-l C-band InSAR instrument (with revisit time of 6 days) with high swath-width over a site in Southern Italy. QRI-enhanced displacement maps, compared in terms of the density of measured coherent targets and the precision of the estimated velocity, will be provided.

Amongst others, the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) technique has proven to be viable for the long-term evaluation of ground scatterers. However, its effectiveness as a routine tool for certain critical application areas, such as the assessment of millimetre-scale differential displacements in airport runways, is still debated. This research aims to demonstrate the viability of using medium-resolution Copernicus ESA Sentinel-1A (C-Band) SAR products and their contribution to improve current maintenance strategies in case of localised foundation settlements in airport runways. To this purpose, “Runway n.3” of the “Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport” in Fiumicino, Rome, Italy was investigated as an explanatory case study, in view of historical geotechnical settlements affecting the runway area. In this context, a geostatistical study is developed for the exploratory spatial data analysis and the interpolation of the Sentinel-1A SAR data. The geostatistical analysis provided ample information on the spatial continuity of the Sentinel 1 data in comparison with the high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed data and the ground-based topographic levelling data. Furthermore, a comparison between the PSI outcomes from the Sentinel-1A SAR data—interpolated through Ordinary Kriging—and the ground-truth topographic levelling data demonstrated the high accuracy of the Sentinel 1 data. This is proven by the high values of the correlation coefficient (r = 0.94), the multiple R-squared coefficient (R2 = 0.88) and the Slope value (0.96). The results of this study clearly support the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A SAR data as a continuous and long-term routine monitoring tool for millimetre-scale displacements in airport runways, paving the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable maintenance strategies for inclusion in next generation Airport Pavement Management Systems (APMSs). © 2021 by the authors.

Every year, after a long harsh winter, the accumulated snow on the Lena watershed melts, leading to the major annual spring flood event causing heavy transport of sediments, organic carbon, and trace metals, both into as well as within the delta. This study aims to analyze the hydrodynamic processes of the spring flood taking place every year in the Lena Delta. Thus, a combination of remote sensing techniques and hydrodynamic modeling methodologies is used to overcome limitations caused by missing ground-truth data. As a test site for this feasibility study, the outlet of the Lena River to its delta was selected. Lena Delta is an extensive wetland spanning from northeast Siberia into the Arctic Ocean. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellite mission served as input for the hydrodynamic modeling software HEC-RAS. The model resulted in inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities. The model accuracy assessed by comparing the multi-temporal modeled inundation areas with the satellite-derived inundation areas ranged between 65 and 95%, with kappa coefficients ranging between 0.78 and 0.97, showing moderate to almost perfect levels of agreement between the two inundation boundaries.

In this study, we map the flood event process using the multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by Sentinel-1. First, we develop a spatiotemporal filter based on low-rank tensor approximation (STF-LRTA) for removing the speckle noise in SAR images. Next, we employ the classic log-ratio change indicator and the minimum error threshold algorithm to characterize the flood using the filtered images. Finally, we relate the flood inundation to the land subsidence in the Taiyuan basin by jointly analyzing the multitemporal SAR change detection results and interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series measurements (preflood). The validation experiments compare the proposed filter with the Refined-Lee filter, Gamma filter, and a statistically homogeneous pixels selection based multitemporal SAR filter. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed STF-LRTA method in SAR despeckling and detail preservation, and the applicability to change scenes. The joint analyses reveal that land subsidence might be an important contributor to the flood event, and the flood recession process linearly correlates with time and subsidence magnitude.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","China; Shanxi; Taiyuan Basin; Flood control; Floods; Interferometry; Mapping; Radar imaging; Rain; Speckle; Subsidence; Tensors; Tracking radar; Change detection; Filtering algorithm; Flood mapping; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal change detection; Radar polarimetry; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Temporal change; flooding; mapping; satellite data; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; Synthetic aperture radar","Flood mapping; interferometric SAR (InSAR); land subsidence; multitemporal change detection; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137857247"

In this work, a multi-temporal approach based on Sentinel-1 data (S1) is proposed based on CR polarimetric index to monitor forest canopy along the considered period (2016–2019) preceding and following an important fire event occurred in the Piemonte Region (NW Italy) in November 2017. The Pettitt test, applied to the polarimetric index time series, was used for testing fire occurrence date and map burned areas (795 ha) resulting in user’s accuracy of burned area equal to 88%. A trend analysis was also conducted, on ‘burned’ pixels only, to describe tree canopy damage and strength of the consequent recovery process at pixel level using linear trend slope values of cross ratio polarimetric index time series. Finally, a k-means cluster analysis was applied to define classes having the same ecological behaviour with respect to two different criteria: one aimed at mapping type and intensity of damage and a second one aimed at describing the ecological behaviour in terms of resistance and resilience of burned patches. In the study area, the cluster layer called forest damage map classifies about the 22% of burned area as characterized by an early high severity whiled the residual by moderate-low severity levels. The second cluster layer called ecological response map defined the 61% of the burned area as resistant forests, the 20% as resilient forests and the 19% as increasing forest zones. All maps were generated with the aim of supporting post-fire assessment and management with free satellite SAR data. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","fire severity mapping; forest fire; Google Earth Engine; polarimetric index time series; recovery process mapping; SAR; Sentinel-1","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133659847"

Monitoring the spatial and temporal evolution of this type of natural hazard represents a major concern for the public authorities in charge of risk management. Pariana, a village with 400 residents located in the Apuan Alps (Massa, Tuscany, Italy), is an example of urban settlement where the population has long been forced to live with considerable slope instability. In the last 30 years, due to the slope movements associated with a slow-moving landslide that has affected a significant portion of the built-up area, several buildings have been damaged, including a school and the provincial road crossing the unstable area, leading to the need for an installation of a slope monitoring system with early warning capabilities, in parallel with the implementation of mitigation works. In this paper, we show how satellite multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) data can be effectively used when coupled with a wireless sensor network made of several bar extensometers and a borehole inclinometer. In fact, thanks to their wide area coverage and opportunistic nature, satellite InSAR data allow one to clearly identify the spatial distribution of surface movements and their long-term temporal evolution. On the other hand, geotechnical sensors installed on specific elements at risk (e.g., private buildings, retaining walls, etc.), and collected through Wi-Fi dataloggers, provide near real-time data that can be used to identify sudden accelerations in slope movements, subsequently triggering alarms. The integration of those two-monitoring systems has been tested and assessed in Pariana. Results show how a hybrid slope monitoring program based on the two different technologies can be used to effectively monitor slow-moving landslides and to identify sudden accelerations and activate a response plan. © 2021 by the authors.

In the past research, multi-temporal analysis and artificial neural network (ANN) inversion of physically based forward models were regarded as promising methods to decouple that combined influence. However, the former does not consider soil roughness change over a relatively longer period and the latter makes it hard to thoroughly eliminate the effect of soil roughness. This study proposes to use generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to derive bare surface soil moisture (BSSM) from radar backscatter observations regardless of the effect of soil roughness (GRNN inversion of backscatter observations). This method not only can derive BSSM from radar backscatters, provided soil roughness is unknown in any long period, but also can train models based on small-size sample data so as to reduce the manual error of training data created by simulation of physically based models. The comparison of validations between BSSM-backscatter models and BSSM-roughness-backscatter models both analyzed by GRNN shows that the incorporation of soil roughness cannot raise the prediction accuracy of models and, instead, even reduce it, indicating that the combined influence is thoroughly decoupled when being analyzed by GRNN. Moreover, BSSM-backscatter models by GRNN are recommended due to their good prediction, even compared to those related models in past publications. © Copyright © 2021 Zeng, Liu, Jing, Lan and Feng.","Backscattering; Predictive analytics; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Generalized Regression Neural Network(GRNN); Generalized regression neural networks; Multi-temporal analysis; Physically based models; Prediction accuracy; Small size samples; Soil moisture retrievals; Surface soil moisture; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; backscatter; RADARSAT; regression analysis; soil moisture; surface roughness; Neural networks","generalized regression neural network; high-dimensional analyses; SAR backscatter; soil moisture; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105489565"

It consists of a 5-bit species encoding scheme and a five-parameter relationship derived from the BAAD data records. Combined with an open-source fractal tree generation engine, it can produce realistic tree samples of a large variety of species. A coherent electromagnetic scattering calculation method is developed for the vegetation model where the generalized Rayleigh-Gans (GRG) approximation and the infinite cylinder approximation are used to calculate the scattering matrix of leaves and branches/trunk. Four-path multiple scattering mechanisms between vegetation and the ground are considered, and attenuations through vegetation canopy are also considered. The scattering model is validated against numerical methods. In addition, an end-to-end simulation tool is developed. An optical image is used to extract individual trees with center positions and crown diameters. The rest parameters are generated using the derived allometry model. A virtual 3-D scene with vegetation on a digital elevation map (DEM) can be generated, and SAR images can be simulated. Several case studies are carried out for both polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) and multitemporal interferometric SAR (InSAR). One case of the Mount Fuji area is simulated and validated against ALOS-2 data and demonstrates an average scattering coefficient error of less than 3 dB.

However, it is facing the effect of climate change, sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, drought, and flood which threatens food production, especially in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. For this reason, building a tool that allows estimating rice yield is necessary. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 satellites is provided by European Space Agency (ESA) with no cost, large coverage, and high spatio-temporal resolution, which has the advantage of observation in cloudy, foggy, rainy weather and independent of solar radiation. Therefore, this data is suitable for rice monitoring in countries with tropical monsoon climate like Vietnam. This paper presents the results of estimating the Winter-Spring rice yield in 2018 by using multitemporal Sentinel-1 data with C-band. The estimated rice yield was compared with the in-situ yield, which shows that the average values of the samples of estimated and surveyed yield were equivalent with 6.5 ton/ha and 6.6 ton/ha respectively, and the standard deviation between the estimated and surveyed yield was 0.80 ton/ha.

Additional tests have to be performed to recognize other 'interesting' but nonmodeled trends, and several automated approaches to this task have been proposed to date. We introduce here the fuzzy entropy ( $F_{E}$ ), a measure introduced in medical data analysis, as a viable parameter to characterize MTI time series. Being a measure of disorder in a time series, $F_{E}$ exhibits homogeneously low values for a large class of displacement models, such as seasonal, parabolic, or piecewise linear signals, while increasing for more chaotic trends, dominated by noise. It appears therefore suited as a discriminative parameter to isolate meaningful MTI time series within large data sets, without specifying a predefined model. The calculation of $F_{E}$ has low computational cost and can thus be easily performed as a prescreening filter.

Their highly dynamic behavior requires frequent monitoring. Tidal flat topography for a large spatial coverage has been generated mainly by the waterline extraction method from multitemporal remote sensing observations. Despite the efficiency and robustness of the waterline extraction method, the waterline-based digital elevation model (DEM) is limited to representing small scale topographic features, such as localized tidal tributaries. Tidal flats show a rapid increase in SAR backscattering coefficients when the tide height is lower than the tidal flat topography compared to when the tidal flat is covered by water. This leads to a tidal flat with a distinct statistical behavior on the temporal variability of our multitemporal SAR backscattering coefficients. Therefore, this study aims to suggest a new method that can overcome the constraints of the waterline-based method by using a pixel-based DEM generation algorithm. Jenks Natural Break (JNB) optimization was applied to distinguish the tidal flat from land and ocean using multitemporal Senitnel-1 SAR data for the years 2014–2020. We also implemented a logistic model to characterize the temporal evolution of the SAR backscattering coefficients along with the tide heights and estimated intertidal topography. The Sentinel-1 DEM from the JNB classification and logistic function was evaluated by an airborne Lidar DEM. Our pixel-based DEM outperformed the waterline-based Landsat DEM. This study demonstrates that our statistical approach to intertidal classification and topography serves to monitor the near real-time spatiotemporal distribution changes of tidal flats through continuous and stable SAR data collection on local and regional scales. © 2021 by the authors.

Then, these products along with large amount of wetland reference samples were employed to assess the separability of different wetland types and their trends over time. Overall, our analyses showed that coherence can be considered as an added value feature for wetland classification and monitoring. The Treed Bog and Shallow Open Water classes showed the highest and lowest coherence values, respectively. The Treed Wetland and Open Wetland classes were easily distinguishable. When analyzing the wetland subclasses, it was observed that the Treed Bog and Shallow Open Water classes can be easily discriminated from other subclasses. However, there were overlaps between the signatures of the other wetland subclasses, although there were still some dates where these classes were also distinguishable. The analysis of multi-temporal coherence products also showed that the coherence products generated in spring/fall (e.g., May and October) and summer (e.g., July) seasons had the highest and lowest coherence values, respectively. It was also observed that wetland classes preserved coherence during the leaf-off season (15 August–15 October) while they had relatively lower coherence during the leaf-on season (i.e., 15 May–15 August). Finally, several suggestions for future studies were provided. © 2021 by the authors.","Forestry; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Alberta , Canada; Change analysis; Coherence analysis; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Large amounts; Multi-temporal; Trends over time; Wetland classification; Wetlands","Big data; Change detection; Coherence; InSAR; Sentinel; Wetlands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113571217"

Nonlocal adaptive multilooking approach has potential benefits for the filtering and coherence estimation in the data preprocessing steps of MT-InSAR technique. The kernel of nonlocal adaptive multilooking approach lies in the selection of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs). Various amplitude-based strategies, such as DespecKS and its variations, have been proposed for selecting SHPs. However, the detection rates of these methods are usually unsatisfactory in the case of small data sets. To overcome this limitation, SHPs are selected based on the adaptive joint data vector, which encompasses both time dimensional samples and spatial information. In this letter, the outliers of the time dimensional samples are removed first based on a revised boxplot method. Additionally, image segmentation and L1 norm are both introduced to adaptively construct joint data vector in the preset window.

This study presents the use of a Spanish radar mission, PAZ, to classify agricultural areas with a very high spatial resolution. PAZ was recently launched, and it operates at X band, joining the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) constellation along with TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites. Owing to its novelty and its ability to classify crop areas (both taking individually its time series and blending with the Sentinel-1 series), it has been tested in an agricultural area of the central-western part of Spain during 2020. The random forest algorithm was selected to classify the time series under five alternatives of standalone/fused data. The map accuracy resulting from the PAZ series standalone was acceptable, but it highlighted the need for a denser time-series of data. The overall accuracy provided by eight PAZ images or by eight Sentinel-1 images was below 60%. The fusion of both sets of eight images improved the overall accuracy by more than 10%. In addition, the exploitation of the whole Sentinel-1 series, with many more observations (up to 40 in the same temporal window) improved the results, reaching an overall accuracy around 76%. This overall performance was similar to that obtained by the joint use of all the available images of the two frequency bands (C and X). © 2021 by the authors.

Monitoring the locations and distributions of Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is vital. In Colombia, Corine land cover maps are the primary source of information for researchers and governmental institutes responsible for managing and conserving natural areas. However, these maps are made mainly by a visual classification of multi-temporal satellite imagery. This paper presents an adapted methodology for the land cover classification in a highly intervened area in Colombia using state-of-the-art convolutional networks with a semantic segmentation approach with transfer learning techniques. We tested two decoders (Unet and PSPNet) with five different architectures (Resnet 18, 50, 101, 152, and inceptionresnetv2). The tests showed that the Unet encoder with Resnet 18 had the highest Jaccard index (mIoU = 0.806) and a pixel accuracy of 0.933 on the validation dataset. These results improve the previous attempts to make a deep learning-based model for the land cover classification in the Colombian context. This ongoing work is set to evaluate Deep learning-based algorithms to analyze multi-temporal LULCC in Colombia using high-resolution imagery. Developing a semi-supervised algorithm infused with SAR imagery for LULCC classification is expected to contribute to this work. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Land use; Learning algorithms; Satellite imagery; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Statistical tests; Synthetic aperture radar; Colombia; Deep learning; Ecosystem services; Human pressures; Land cover classification; Land use and land cover change; Multi-temporal; PSPNET; Semantic segmentation; Unet; Deep learning","Deep learning; Land cover classification; PSPNET; Semantic segmentation; Unet","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128460170"

The statistical goodness-of-fit testing of the temporal samples has been widely used for HPS. However, the detection rates of the existing methods are unsatisfactory under small datasets. In this article, a stacked autoencoder (SAE) network-based method is proposed for the selection of homogeneous pixels under the idea of deep learning image classification, as termed by SAEHPS. The SAE network is used to learn the spatial distribution behavior of the average intensity image. The deep network is trained and tested on different high-resolution SAR datasets of the Hong Kong Airport and the Fuzhou City, and three pixelwise labels (i.e., high, medium, and low reflections) are regarded as outputs of model learning. The unsupervised training and supervised fine-tuning realize the class prediction. The results show that the SAE can achieve robust accuracies above 90% based on empirically labeled samples, especially in nonarchitectural areas where the distributed scatterers exist. The SAE results are devoted to the multitemporal permanent scatterer (PS)/distributed scatterer (DS) InSAR approach to identify homogeneous pixels.

In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the inherent speckle noise leads to false changed points, and this affects the performance of change detection. To improve the accuracy of change detection, a novel automatic SAR image change detection algorithm based on saliency detection and convolutional-wavelet neural networks is proposed. The log-ratio operator is adopted to generate the difference image, and the speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion is used to enhance the original multitemporal SAR images and the difference image. To reduce the influence of speckle noise, the salient area that probably belongs to the changed object is obtained from the difference image. The saliency analysis step can remove small noise regions by thresholding the saliency map, and interest regions can be preserved. Then an enhanced difference image is generated by combing the binarized saliency map and two input images. A hierarchical fuzzy c-means model is applied to the enhanced difference image to classify pixels into the changed, unchanged, and intermediate regions. The convolutional-wavelet neural networks are used to generate the final change map. Experimental results on five SAR data sets indicated the proposed approach provided good performance in change detection compared to state-of-the-art relative techniques, and the values of the metrics computed by the proposed method caused significant improvement. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical “coffee belt,” hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural information and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences. © 2021","Viet Nam; Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Cultivation; Data fusion; Data integration; Decision trees; Deforestation; Engines; Feedstocks; Mapping; Remote sensing; Supply chains; Textures; Topography; Agroforestry; Crop mask; Google earth engine; Google earths; Production system; Random forests; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Smallholder agriculture; Viet Nam; coffee; crop production; livelihood; mapping method; radar altimetry; satellite data; Sentinel; smallholder; synthetic aperture radar; Crops","Agroforestry; Crop mask; Data fusion; Google Earth Engine; Random forest; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Smallholder agriculture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115794946"

Crop mapping is used to identify the croplands and their spatial distribution. For a reliable analysis and forecast for projection, multi-temporal data play a key role. Even current open and frequent optical satellite data such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat support monitoring, they are not always operational due to atmospheric conditions (rain, cloud cover, haze, etc.). On the other hand, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites provide alternative data sets compared to optical satellites since they can acquire images under all weather conditions. In this study, an annual cropland monitoring study is conducted using Sentinel-1 SAR. For the investigation, Tokat Province an agricultural region of Turkey, where the main source of income is agriculture, was selected. There are 4 different vegetation species (wheat, sunflower, sugar beet, corn) in the study area. Sentinel-1 data was used to generate time-series of each class and phenological structures of the crops. In this context, backscatter images of both vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarized data, and coherence of both VV and VH were produced from Sentinel-1 data.

Particularly, the monitoring of landscape surface subsidence and monument instability is of great importance to the protection and development planning of the Bagan heritage site. In this study, we applied high resolution TerraSAR-X imagery acquired from 2019 to 2020 for deformation monitoring based on the small baseline subset (SBAS) and persistent scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PSInSAR) approaches. We identified several hotspots and pagodas with displacement anomalies linked to land cover change and previous earthquakes. The cross comparison between SBAS and PSInSAR and the precision of height estimates derived by PSInSAR indicated a millimetric precision of the derived deformation products. The combination of the two multi-temporal SAR interferometry approaches satisfies the two-scale monitoring requirements from landscapes to monuments, particularly for large-scale World Heritage sites.

In this article, we built an upsampling moving window network for regional crop growth monitoring (UMRCGM) model to estimate the two key biophysical parameters (BPs), leaf area index (LAI), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) during the main growth period of winter wheat by using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-3 optical images. Sentinel-1 imagery is unaffected by cloudy weather and Sentinel-3 imagery has a wide width and short revisit period, the organic combination of the two will greatly improve the ability to monitor crop growth at a regional scale. The impact of two different types of SAR information (intensity and polarization) on the estimation of the two BPs was further analyzed. The UMRCGM model optimized the correspondence between inputs and outputs, it had more accurate LAI and CCC estimates compared with the three classical machine learning models, and had the highest accuracy at the green-up stage of winter wheat, followed by the jointing stage and the heading-filling stage, and the lowest accuracy was found at the milk maturity stage. The estimation accuracies of CCC were slightly higher than that of LAI for the first three growth stages of winter wheat, while lower than that of LAI for the milk maturity stage. This article proposes a new method for regional BPs (especially for CCC) estimation by combining SAR and optical imagery with large differences in spatial resolution under a deep learning framework. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Chlorophyll; Crops; Deep learning; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Light polarization; Optical remote sensing; Radar imaging; Canopy chlorophyll; Canopy chlorophyll content; Chlorophyll contents; Deep learning; Leaf Area Index; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal monitoring; Optical imaging; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1 and -3; biophysics; chlorophyll; growth; leaf area index; machine learning; monitoring; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; wheat; Synthetic aperture radar","Canopy chlorophyll content; deep learning; leaf area index; multitemporal monitoring; sentinel-1 and -3","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137596280"

Remote sensing techniques are widely applied to large-scale monitoring tasks. Among them, DInSAR using multi-temporal spaceborne SAR images is able to derive surface movement up to mm level over an area. One of the factors inducing the movement is variation of soil moisture. Based on this, a semi-empirical approach can be tailored to retrieve the underground water content. However, the derived movement is often contaminated with other irrelevant noise. Besides, a time-series analysis could not be simply implemented without additional fusion and calibration. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling based on advanced DInSAR to solve these problems. The irrelevant noise will be removed as parts of the modelled elements in the DInSAR processing. A forward model on a scene is built by regressing the measured soil moisture on the DInSAR-derived movement series. We tested our approach using Sentinel-1 images in the grasslands of organic soil within State of Brandenburg, Germany. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the measured soil moistures and the DInSAR-derived movements are up to 0.91. The mean square errors of the predicted soil moistures compared with the measurements reach 3.03 % (volumetric water content) at best.

Indeed, the exploitation of remotely sensed data collected by constellations of new-generation satellite platforms, complemented with in-situ measurements and ground-based observation systems, represents a well-established practice to get valuable information on Earth's crust and subsurface dynamics. The effects of extreme natural or man-induced events (e.g., earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding phenomena, sea-level rise, big fires, etc.) have severe societal and economic impacts. In particular, the technologies based on the use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images reached significant improvements in the last decade due to the growing availability of vast amounts of data collected by multiple-satellite sensors operating at different frequency bands and with complementary viewing angles, polarization and acquisition modes. Accordingly, to process a large amount of SAR data in a timely fashion, up-to-date high-performance computing (HPC) methods and tools are required. This paper addresses the state-of-the-art of SAR technologies for the analysis of long sequences of multiple sets of SAR images and provides a perspective on the forthcoming improvements of these technologies. In particular, the emphasis is placed on novel interferometric SAR and change detection methods, giving an overview of how those processing techniques have been used for investigating sites located in South and Central America. Moreover, an overview of the new generation of SAR sensors' observational capability, especially in the field of ground deformation analysis for mitigating the risk associated with natural and human-induced hazards, is provided. COSMO-SkyMed, ALOS, Sentinel-1, and SAOCOM data are exploited to show how natural and human-induced terrain displacement phenomena can be detected and investigated in different portions (X-, L- and C-band) of the microwave spectrum using SAR technologies. © 2021","South America; advanced technology; image processing; interferometry; remote sensing; satellite constellation; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar","Ground deformation; InSAR; Multi-pass interferometry; SAR instruments; Satellite constellations; Sentinels","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109356540"

This research aims to investigate the viability of a novel non-destructive health-monitoring approach based on satellite remote sensing techniques for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of damage by structural subsidence. To this purpose, commercial high-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) products of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) provided by the European Space Agency (ESA), were acquired and processed by MT-InSAR technique. Analyses were developed to identify and monitor the structural displacements of the historical “Ponte Sisto” masonry bridge located in Rome, Italy, crossing the Tiber River. To this extent, the historical time-series of deformations were processed by Persistent Scatterers (PSs) relevant to critical structural elements of the bridge (i.e., bridge piers and arcs). A novel data interpretation approach is proposed based on the selection of several PS data-points with coherent deformation trends and location on the bridge. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that multi-temporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be applied to complement non-destructive ground-based analyses (e.g., ground-penetrating radars, laser scanners, accelerometers), paving the way for future integrated approaches in the smart monitoring of infrastructure assets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Damage detection; Data handling; Deformation; Geological surveys; Masonry materials; Space-based radar; Structural health monitoring; Synthetic aperture radar; Bridge monitoring; Cultural heritage monitoring; Cultural heritages; Health monitoring; High resolution; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Nondestructive assessment; PSI; Remote-sensing; Remote sensing","Bridge monitoring; Cultural heritage monitoring; Masonry bridges; Non-destructive assessment; PSI; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121923426"

The development of the methods is the first step towards an operational system for near-real-time windstorm damage monitoring, with a latency of only a few days after the storm event in the best case. Windstorm detection using SAR data is not trivial, particularly at C-band. It can be expected that a large-area and severe windstorm damage may affect backscatter similar to clear cutting operation, that is, decrease the backscatter intensity, while a small area damage may increase the backscatter of the neighboring area, due to various scattering mechanisms. The remaining debris and temporal variation in the weather conditions and possible freeze–thaw transitions also affect observed backscatter changes. Three candidate windstorm detection methods were suggested, based on the improved k-nn method, multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine classification. The approaches use multitemporal ESA Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data and were evaluated in Southern Finland using wind damage data from the summer 2017, together with 27 Sentinel-1 scenes acquired in 2017 and other geo-referenced data. The stands correctly predicted severity category corresponded to 79% of the number of the stands in the validation data, and already 75 % when only one Sentinel-1 scene after the damage was used. Thus, the damaged forests can potentially be localized with proposed tools within less than one week after the storm damage. In this study, the achieved latency was only two days. Our preliminary results also indicate that the damages can be localized even without separate training data. © 2021 by the authors.

Filtering-based methods are very successful in extracting contextual information from an image by removing redundant spatial details and preserving the geometric characteristics of the objects in the region of interest.

With the aim to avoid the lack of optical data in winter wheat extraction, the validity of time series Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar(SAR)backscattering coefficients on winter wheat identification was explored based on random forest(RF)and Google Earth Engine(GEE)cloud platform. And Sentinel-1 and 2 active and passive remote sensing data was integrated to explore the improvement of winter wheat identification accuracy on combining various features groups of backscattering coefficients, spectral features, vegetation index features and texture features. The result indicated that the overall classification accuracy of the monthly average multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR polarization data was 85.93%, the Kappa coefficient was 0.75 and the winter wheat identification accuracy was above 95%. By integrating the monthly average time serious multi-temporal SAR data and the single-temporal optical data, the overall classification accuracy was 95.78% and the Kappa coefficient were 0.92. Integrating data fully used the polarization and spectral information and the overall classification accuracy and the Kappa coefficient were improved by 9.85 percentage points and 22.67%. The identification accuracy of winter wheat was improved by about 2 percentage points. The identification accuracy of winter wheat was affected by less than 0.9% by analyzing the influence of texture features under different features combinations. Therefore, the method and platform used accurately and efficiently obtained winter wheat planting area and it had a good promotion value. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

However, automatically locating and assessing the state of the ground motion from the massive Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements is not easy. Utilizing the spatial-temporal characteristics of surface deformation on the basis of the Small Baseline Subsets InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) measurements, this study develops an improved method to locate potential unstable or dangerous regions, using the spatial velocity gradation and the temporal evolution trend of surface displacements in large-scale areas. This method is applied to identify the potential geohazard areas in a mountainous region in northwest China (Lajia Town in Qinghai province) using 73 and 71 Sentinel-1 images from the ascending and descending orbits, respectively, and an urban area (Dongguan City in Guangdong province) in south China using 32 Sentinel-1 images from the ascending orbit. In the mountainous area, 23 regions with potential landslide hazards have been identified, most of which have high to very high instability levels. In addition, the instability is the highest at the center and decreases gradually outward. In the urban area, 221 potential hazards have been identified. The moderate to high instability level areas account for the largest proportion, and they are concentrated in the farmland irrigation areas, and construction areas. The experiment results show that the improved method can quickly identify and evaluate geohazards on a large scale. It can be used for disaster prevention and mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Non-invasive structural monitoring techniques can provide useful information for supporting the management process and the safety evaluation, reducing at once the impact of disturbances on the structure’s functionality. This paper focuses on the exploitation of advanced multi-temporal differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) products for the structural monitoring of buildings and infrastructures, subjected to different external actions. In this framework, a methodological approach is proposed, based on the integration of DInSAR measurements with historical sources, accurate 3D modelling and consistent positioning of the reflecting targets in the GIS environment. Documentary sources can prove particularly helpful in collecting technical information, to reconstruct an accurate 3D geometry of the building under monitoring, limiting in-situ surveys. The analysis of DInSAR-based displacements time series and mean deformation velocity values allows the identification of possible critical situations for buildings to be monitored. The paper presents different approaches, with increasing accuracy levels, to study the active deformative processes of the examined buildings and the related damage assessment. An insight into these interpretative approaches is given through the application of the proposed procedure to two case studies in the city of Rome (Italy), the residential building named Torri Stellari in Valco San Paolo (1951–1953) and the housing complex referred to as Corviale (1967–1983), by exploiting the whole COSMO-SkyMed data archive (both ascending and descending acquisitions), collected during the 2011–2019 time interval.

Predomi-nated by low intensity events, this activity is occasionally interspersed with more powerful episodes, known as major explosions and paroxysms, which represent the main hazards for the inhabitants of the island. Here, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between paroxysms and major explosions by using satellite-derived measurements. We investigated the high energy explosive events occurring in the period January 2018–April 2021. Three distinguishing features are taken into account, namely (i) the temporal variations of surface temperature over the summit area, (ii) the magnitude of the explosive volcanic deposits emplaced during each explosion, and (iii) the height of the volcanic ash plume produced by the explosive events. We use optical satellite imagery to compute the land surface temperature (LST) and the ash plume height (PH). The magnitude of the explosive volcanic deposits (EVD) is estimated by using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) intensity images. Once the input feature vectors were identified, we designed a k-means unsupervised classifier to group the explosive events at Stromboli volcano based on their similarities in two clusters: (1) paroxysms and (2) major explosions. The major explosions are identified by low/medium thermal content, i.e., LSTI around 1.4◦C, low plume height, i.e., PH around 420 m, and low production of explosive deposits, i.e., EVD around 2.5. The paroxysms are extreme events mainly characterized by medium/high thermal content, i.e., LSTI around 2.3◦C, medium/high plume height, i.e., PH around 3330 m, and high production of explosive deposits, i.e., EVD around 10.17. The centroids with coordinates (PH, EVD, LSTI) are: Cp (3330, 10.7, 2.3) for the paroxysms, and Cme (420, 2.5, 1.4) for the major explosions. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the MassMov2D model, the effect of the dynamic process and deposit thickness of the potentially unstable rock mass (deformation rate < −70 mm/year) on this landslide body were numerically simulated. Combined with terrain data and images generated by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the driving factors of this old landslide were analyzed. The InSAR results show that the motion rate in the middle part of the landslide body is the largest, with a range of −55 to −80 mm/year on average, whereas those of the upper part and toe area were small, with a range of −5 to −20 mm/year. Our research suggests that there is a correlation between the LOS (line of sight) deformation rate and rainfall. In rainy seasons, particularly from May to July, the deformation rate is relatively high. In addition, the analysis suggests that SBAS can provide smoother displacement time series, even in areas with vegetation and the steepest sectors of the landslide. The simulation results show that the unstable rock mass may collapse and form a barrier dam with a maximum thickness of about 16 m at the Zagunao river in the future. This study demonstrates that combining temporal UAV measurements and InSAR techniques from Sentinel- 1A SAR data allows early recognition and deformation monitoring of old landslide reactivation in complex mountainous areas. In addition, the information provided by InSAR can increase understanding of the deformation process of old landslides in this area, which would enhance urban safety and assist in disaster mitigation. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users. © 2022 by the authors.

Satellite multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques enable measurement of building displacements over time with millimetre-scale accuracy. Compared to traditional ground-based monitoring, MT-InSAR can yield denser and cheaper building observations, representing a cost-effective monitoring tool. However, without integrating MT-InSAR techniques and structural assessment, the potential of InSAR monitoring cannot be fully exploited. This integration is particularly demanding for large construction projects, where big datasets need to be processed. In this paper, we present a new automated methodology that integrates MT-InSAR-based building deformations and damage assessment procedures to evaluate settlement-induced damage to buildings adjacent to tunnel excavations. The developed methodology was applied to the buildings along an 8-km segment of the Crossrail tunnel route in London, using COSMO-SkyMed MT-InSAR data from 2011 to 2015. The methodology enabled the identification of damage levels for 858 buildings along the Crossrail twin tunnels, providing an unprecedented number of high quality field observations for building response to settlements.

Recently there is a considerable increase in production, area and yield of rice crop in India. Temporal monitoring of crop area under cultivation is essential for the sustainable management of agricultural activities on both national and global levels. The present study is envisaged to estimate area under kharif rice using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with dual polarization (VH and VV) in Bhandara district of Maharashtra. The geographical area of Bhandara district is 4087 square kilometres and lies in between 20°64′03′' to 21°60′18′' N latitude and 79°44′93′' to 80°08′70′' E longitude. The rice area is extracted using Random Forest (RF) classification techniques available in SNAP tool and validated using the ground observation collected from the field. An area of 1760 square kilometres was found under kharif rice out of 4087 square kilometres area of entire Bhandara district. The rice is predominant crop and covered around 43% of the total geographical area of Bhandara district during kharif season. The user accuracy (omission error), producer accuracy (commission error) for rice crop, overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients were 82.7, 90.0, 91% and 0.80, respectively. The study found that SAR data can be successfully used for acreage estimation with RF classifier. © 2020, Korean Spatial Information Society.","","RF classifier and Bhandara district; Rice; Sentinel-1 SAR data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096451595"

The multiple Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) technique shows great potential in crop phenology retrieval for its characterizations, such as short revisit time, all-weather monitoring and sensitivity to vegetation structure. This study aims to explore the potential of averaged Stokes-related parameters derived from multiple PolSAR data in oilseed rape phenology identification. In this study, the averaged Stokes-related parameters were first computed by two different wave polarimetric states. Then, the two groups of averaged Stokes-related parameters were generated and applied for analyzing averaged Stokes-related parameter sensitivity to oilseed rape phenology changes. At last, decision tree (DT) algorithms trained using 60% of the data were used for oilseed rape phenological stage classification. Four Stokes parameters (g0, g1, g2 and g3 ) and eight sub parameters (degree of polarization m, entropy H, ellipticity angle χ, orientation angle ϕ, degree of linear polarization Dolp, degree of circular polarization Docp, linear polarization ratio Lpr and circular polarization ratio Cpr) were extracted from a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset acquired during the whole oilseed rape growth cycle in 2013. Their sensitivities to oilseed rape phenology were analyzed versus five main rape phenology stages. In two groups (two different wave polarimetric states) of this study, g0, g1, g2, g3, m, H, Dolp and Lpr showed high sensitivity to oilseed rape growth stages while χ, ϕ, Docp and Cpr showed good performance for phenology classification in previous studies, which were quite noisy during the whole oilseed rape growth circle and showed unobvious sensitivity to the crop’s phenology change. The DT algorithms performed well in oilseed rape phenological stage identification. The results were verified at the parcel level with left 40% of the point dataset. Five phenology intervals of oilseed rape were identified with no more than three parameters by simple but robust decision tree algorithm groups. The identified phenology stages agree well with the ground measurements; the overall identification accuracies were 71.18% and 79.71%, respectively. For each growth stage, the best performance occurred at stage S1 with the accuracy of 95.65% for Group 1 and 94.23% for Group 2, and the worst performance occurred at stage S3 and S5 with the values around 60%. Most of the classification errors may resulted from the indistinguishability of S3 and S5 using Stokes-related parameters. © 2021 by the authors.

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of crop monitoring and classification over an agricultural area in southwestern Ontario, Canada. The time-series RADARSAT-2 C-Band PolSAR images throughout the entire growing season were exploited. A set of 27 representative polarimetric observables categorized into ten groups was selected and analyzed in this research. First, responses and temporal evolutions of each of the polarimetric observables over different crop types were quantitatively analyzed. The results reveal that the backscattering coefficients in cross-pol and Pauli second channel, the backscattering ratio between HV and VV channels (HV/VV), the polarimetric decomposition outputs, the correlation coefficient between HH and VV channel ρHHVV, and the radar vegetation index (RVI) show the highest sensitivity to crop growth. Then, the capability of PolSAR time-series data of the same beam mode was also explored for crop classification using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results using single groups of polarimetric observables show that polarimetric decompositions, backscattering coefficients in Pauli and linear polarimetric channels, and correlation coefficients produced the best classification accuracies, with overall accuracies (OAs) higher than 87%. A forward selection procedure to pursue optimal classification accuracy was expanded to different perspectives, enabling an optimal combination of polarimetric observables and/or multitemporal SAR images. The results of optimal classifications show that a few polarimetric observables or a few images on certain critical dates may produce better accuracies than the whole dataset. The best result was achieved using an optimal combination of eight groups of polarimetric observables and six SAR images, with an OA of 94.04%. This suggests that an optimal combination considering both perspectives may be valuable for crop classification, which could serve as a guideline and is transferable for future research. © 2021 by the authors.

As an active remote sensing system, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides high-resolution polarimetric information of land covers. Nowadays, it is possible to carry out continuous multi-temporal analysis of crops in large-scales since an increased number of spaceborne SAR systems has been launched. This paper formulates rice mapping as a semantic segmentation problem and proposes to use deep learning techniques to exploit the phenological similarity of rice production to identify the rice distribution in large-scales. The study area (i.e., about 58504 km2) located in Arkansas River Basin is selected to develop an adapted U-Net for large-scale rice mapping. The Sentinel-1 data in previous years (i.e., data collected in 2017 and 2018) are used to train and fine-tune the network, and current season data (i.e., data collected in 2019) is selected to test the robustness of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance as it benefits from the spatial characteristics and phenological similarity of rice. The experiments of rice extraction in different planting pattern regions and extracted features visual projection are conducted to explain the features mined by the adapted U-Net. Furthermore, the advantages of temporal generalization in large-scale are validated by the comparison between space migration and time migration, which indicates that the difference of rice in different years is smaller than that of rice in different spaces. Finally, the issues for operational implementation are discussed. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

This paper conducts a tentative test for applying C-band SAR data to the deformation monitoring of HSR subgrade, phase stability analysis and improved StaMPS technology were jointly used to increase the point density and stability of deformation parameter solution.

However, the future prediction of the mining-induced surface displacement after the underground mining extraction cannot be achieved with single Multi-Temporal Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) technique, which can only reveal the deformation history during the period of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisition dates. In this paper, a novel dynamic model, namely Dynamic Probability Integral Method (DPIM), based on the integration of Probability Integral Method (PIM) and Weibull temporal function, is proposed in order to predict the future dynamic subsidence for the period which can not covered by the SAR acquisitions. Firstly, the time series deformation over the test salt mine are generated by Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique with use of 43 Sentinel-1 images, and then the functional relationship between the derived deformation and DPIM is established; Subsequently, the unknown parameters, including the PIM parameters and the Weibull temporal parameters are estimated following the genetic algorithm; Finally, the dynamic surface deformation occurring during the entire period of the underground extraction of the test rock salt mine is predicted. Both simulation and real deformation data over Xinhua (a typical rock salt mine in Hunan province, China) have been investigated. The scenario using the simulated data shows that the overall root-mean-square error of DPIM-predicted subsidence is ±3 mm. The real data experimental results show that the maximum predicted vertical subsidence over the rock salt mine was up to 246 mm. The root-mean-square error with comparison to the levelling measurements is estimated as ±7 mm. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Hunan; Deformation; Extraction; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Integral equations; Interferometry; Mean square error; Rock drilling; Rocks; Salt deposits; Salt mines; Subsidence; Weibull distribution; Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Functional relationship; Hunan province , China; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Probability integral methods; Root mean square errors; Small baseline subsets; Surface displacement; deformation; mine; mining; probability; rock salt; subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096339844"

This paper conducts a systematic investigation of the incident by integrating data from multiple sensors, including high-resolution optical imagery, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, unmanned aerial system (UAS) footage, SRTM and ALOS digital elevation models (DEMs), soil moisture product from multi-spectral Landsat-8 satellite and precipitation records from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Optical imagery, UAS footage and DEMs allow us to build a comprehensive mapping of tailing areas and quarry scarps from 2010 and reconstruct the 2D pit geometry prior to failure. Deformation signals from multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), soil moisture variations and precipitation trends further allow us to identify possible failure causes. To evaluate the quality of deformation obtained from different distributed-scatterer phase estimators, we develop an empirical mapping function based on areal fraction values to facilitate the comparison of temporal coherence values that are differently formulated in each phase estimator. The comparison shows that phase linking algorithm outperforms the small baseline subset method in terms of signal recovery and phase reliability. Our investigation points out that the mining site is under aggressive mining cycles that are exacerbated by frequent, uncontrolled landslides. Seepage failure, which involves the expulsion of water from rapidly compacting tailings, may be a critical factor in the 2020 incident. Instead of extreme weather, the failure had occurred under normal to drier conditions. This means that the sliding planes were already in a critical state, which is evident from the accelerated deformation around the collapse area since the beginning of 2020. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve mining site regulations and management practices for safer open-pit mining in Myanmar and probably in similar contexts outside Myanmar. © 2021 The Author(s)","Myanmar; Antennas; Climate models; Deformation; Earth (planet); Erosion; Failure (mechanical); Landslides; Mapping; Remote sensing; Signal reconstruction; Silicate minerals; Slope protection; Soil moisture; Time series; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Weathering; Digital elevation model; InSAR time-series; Jade mine in myanmar; Myanmars; Open-pit mine; Phase estimators; Phase linking; Seepage failure; Slope failure; Unmanned aerial systems; algorithm; ALOS; digital elevation model; disaster; landslide; mapping method; mortality; open pit mine; satellite imagery; sensor; Sentinel; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; slope failure; synthetic aperture radar; unmanned vehicle; Seepage","InSAR time-series; Jade mine in Myanmar; Open-pit mine; Phase linking; Seepage failure; Slope failure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108718103"

First, we propose applying a temporal averaging filter that allows the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g., due to tides or vegetation, to be encapsulated, and, at the same time, the speckle to be reduced, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land pixels, we will employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes using bimodal distribution. The distribution is then segmented by a thresholding and region-growing procedure to separate the sea and land classes. A large-scale quantitative comparison between the SAR-derived and open street map (OSM) coastlines allows for a numerical evaluation of the results, i.e., an overall agreement ranging from 80% to 90%. In addition, Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the estimated SAR coastline qualitatively. Furthermore, the benefits of having an accurate SAR coastline are shown in the case of two well-known Earth observation-monitoring applications, ship detection, and floodwater mapping.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Coastal zones; Floods; Iterative methods; Landforms; Radar imaging; Ships; Time series; Bimodal distribution; Coastal area; Coastline detections; Monitoring applications; Multi-temporal; Region growing; Sentinel-1; Ship monitoring; Synthetic aperture radar; Times series; coast; detection method; flood; monitoring; study application; time series; Synthetic aperture radar","Bimodal distribution; coastline; multitemporal; region growing; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116253973"

This allows high‐rate and non‐linear trends to be observed, which typically characterize pre‐failure warning signals. In order to fully exploit the content of MTInSAR products, methods are needed for the automatic identification of relevant changes along displacement time series and the classification of the targets on the ground according to their kinematic regime. This work reviews some of the classical procedures for model ranking, based on statistical indices, which are applied to the characterization of MTInSAR displacement time series, and introduces a new quality index based on the Fisher distribution. Then, we propose a procedure to recognize automatically the minimum number of parameters needed to model a given time series reliably within a predefined confidence level. The method, though general, is explored here for polynomial models, which can be used in particular to approximate satisfactorily and with computational efficiency the piecewise linear trends that are generally used to model warning signals preceding the failure of natural and artificial structures. The algorithm performance is evaluated under simulated scenarios. Finally, the proposed procedure is also demonstrated on displacement time series derived by the processing of Sentinel‐1 data. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we want to focus on the capability of high-resolution CSK images, combined with medium-resolution Sentinel-1 data, to jointly provide a more comprehensive view of the changes occurring in highly urbanized coastal regions, such as the one represented by the megacity of Shanghai. Specifically, we have applied a split-spectrum method to identify a set of highly coherent SAR pixels. The location and spatial density of such permanent (and the semi-permanent scatters) have revealed helpful to generate a flood risk map for the coastal area of Shanghai in a worst-case scenario.

The filling of GERD not only has an impact on the Blue Nile Basin hydrology, water storage and flow but also poses massive risks in case of collapse. Rosaries Dam located in Sudan at only 116 km downstream of GERD, along with the 20 million Sudanese benefiting from that dam, would be seriously threatened in case of the collapse of GERD. In this study, through the analysis of Sentinal-1 satellite imagery, we show concerning deformation patterns associated with different sections of the GERD’s Main Dam (structure RCC Dam type) and the Saddle Dam (Embankment Dam type). We processed 109 descending mode scenes from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, from December 2016 to July 2021, using the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry technique to demonstrate the deformation trends of both—the GERD’s Main and Saddle Dams. The time series generated from the analysis clearly indicates different displacement trends at various sections of the GERD as well as the Saddle Dam. Results of the multi-temporal data analysis on and around the project area show inconsistent subsidence at the extremities of the GERD Main Dam, especially the west side of the dam where we recorded varying displacements in the range of 10 mm to 90 mm at the crest of the dam. We conducted the current analysis after masking the images with a coherence value of 0.9 and hence, the subsequent results are extremely reliable and accurate. Further decomposition of the subsiding rate has revealed higher vertical displacement over the west side of the GERD’s Main Dam as compared to the east side. The local geological structures consisting of weak zones under the GERD’s accompanying Saddle Dam adds further instability to its structure. We identified seven critical nodes on the Saddle Dam that match the tectonic faults lying underneath it, and which display a varying degree of vertical displacements. In fact, the nodes located next to each other displayed varying displacement trends: one or more nodes displayed subsidence since 2017 while the other node in the same section displayed uplift. The geological weak zones underneath and the weight of the Saddle Dam itself may somewhat explain this inconsistency and the non-uniform vertical displacements. For the most affected cells, we observed a total displacement value of ~90 mm during the whole study period (~20 mm/year) for the Main Dam while the value of the total displacement for the Saddle dam is ~380 mm during the same period (~85 mm/year). Analysis through CoastSat tool also suggested a non-uniformity in trends of surface water-edge at the two extremities of the Main Dam. © 2021 by the authors.

L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR HH, HV, and HH/HV ratio were used to detect various deforestation stages based on their different radar scattering characteristics. The three main stages considered in this approach were as follows: (1) forest was cut, and felled trees were left on the ground, (2) felled trees were burned, and (3) felled (and burned) trees were removed. Two types of forest fires occurred in tropical rain forests and dry and open forests were considered. Multi-temporal data and image normalization techniques are used to suppress commission errors induced by the effects of seasonality and rainfall. Detection accuracies were evaluated at 11 validation sites distributed over various forest types in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The user's and producer's accuracies of the proposed forest monitoring algorithm were estimated to be 85.0% and 63.8%, respectively. An additional broader performance assessment using data from 191 sites showed an estimated total user's accuracy of 71.1%. The results indicate that detection accuracies depend on temporal sequences, with slower, gradual transitions from forest to other land cover hampering detection performance.

The motivation behind this research was to study the crustal deformations that pose treat to the archaeological site ""Solnitsa-Provadia""located in the area Mirovo salt deposit near the town Provadia, NE Bulgaria. It needs to be mentioned that the said monument is dated back to VI-V millennium BC and includes the remnants of an ancient city near Provadia. The registered deformations in the region are due to natural and anthropogenic factors. The mentioned factors have undisputable negative impact on the preservation of this historical site and justify the necessity of regular monitoring of the ongoing geodynamic processes.

The information concerning the detected surface deformations was obtained by the DInSAR method. The multitemporal processing included creation of set of interferometric images from several periods with time span of four months. This interval was selected since it was needed to decrease the decorrelation of the phase signal caused by the vegetation and noise introduced by the atmosphere. In order to increase the reliability of the output information SAR data from ascending and descending orbits were processed which provided two different stereoscopic-like views to the investigated area.

In particular, the hanging-wall block is characterized by pre-seismic uplift – which we document as being independent of any hydrological control – and eastward horizontal motion for about six years, followed by subsidence and westward motion (starting six to eight months prior to the earthquake).

These have become the main source of data for geopositioning. However, due to the limitation of the direct geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery and the effect of the small intersection angle of HR optical imagery in stereo pair orientation, the geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery cannot meet the requirements for geopositioning without ground control points (GCPs), especially in uninhabited areas, such as forests, plateaus, or deserts. Without satellite attitude error, SAR usually provides higher geometric accuracy than optical satellites. Space-borne laser altimetry technology can collect global laser footprints with high altitude accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a geometric accuracy improvement method for HR optical satellite remote sensing imagery combining multi-temporal SAR Imagery and GLAS data without GCPs. Based on the imaging mechanism, the differences in the weight matrix determination of the HR optical imagery and SAR imagery were analyzed. The laser altimetry data with high altitude accuracy were selected and applied as height control point in combined geopositioning. To validate the combined geopositioning approach, GaoFen2 (GF2) optical imagery, GaoFen6 (GF6) optical imagery, GaoFen3 (GF3) SAR imagery, and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) footprint were tested. The experimental results show that the proposed model can be effectively applied to combined geopositioning to improve the geometric accuracy of HR optical imagery. Moreover, we found that the distribution and weight matrix determination of SAR images and the distribution of GLAS footprints are the crucial factors influencing geometric accuracy. Combined geopositioning using multi-source remote sensing data can achieve a plane accuracy of 1.587 m and an altitude accuracy of 1.985 m, which is similar to the geometric accuracy of geopositioning of GF2 with GCPs. © 2020 by the authors.","Altitude control; Aneroid altimeters; Arid regions; Geology; Geometry; Image coding; Image enhancement; Matrix algebra; Meteorological instruments; Radio altimeters; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Space-based radar; Stereo image processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Geometric accuracy; Geoscience Laser Altimeter System; Geoscience laser altimeter systems; Ground control points; Multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Optical satellite imagery; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging","Geometric accuracy improvement; Geoscience laser altimeter system altimetry (GLAS); High-resolution (HR) optical satellite imagery; Multi-temporal data; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080969918"

Although the proposed method has principally been developed to work with differential SAR interferograms that form a triangle-shaped network in the temporal/perpendicular baseline plane, as originally exploited by Extended Minimum Cost Flow (EMF) phase unwrapping (PhU) technique, it may simply be adapted to work with any network of time-redundant interferograms. The fundamental idea is to exploit the phase inconsistencies of triples of (already) unwrapped sequence of interferograms, prior to the application of any inversion for the generation of surface displacement time-series, to independently identify, for every SAR pixels, the 2π-multiple integers corrections to be applied to the unwrapped phases for adjusting the time-inconsistent phase unwrapping errors. This goal is achieved by solving a simple and computationally efficient network-based minimum-cost-flow optimization problem.

The contribution of public construction is undoubtedly vital to a modern society. However, many civil engineering infrastructures, such as bridges, electric power transmission towers and dams, constructed decades ago have been gradually affected by natural hazards and environmental factors such as earthquakes, typhoons, heavy rainfalls, land subsidence, soil liquefaction and materials deterioration. Those infrastructures are going into the recession of their life cycle. The government has put a great effort to the maintenance and monitoring of infrastructures in recent years, with goals to extend the life of the structures and also to ensure public safety. In recent years, radar imaging for commercial and scientific applications have been adopted in many disciplines and various applications were launched and carried out successfully. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a microwave-based active imaging system that can be mounted onboard an aircraft or a satellite. Because SAR is less affected by weather, it has been widely used in environmental and disaster monitoring and investigations. This paper describes a systematic approach to analyze the deformation of several engineering structures using Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technology with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data. The results indicate that the correlation coefficient between PSInSAR and GPS observations among the examples presented in this paper is up to 0.7 and the root-mean square error (RMSE) is 23.9 cm. Furthermore, with the help of GIS, this study also develops a Web application with Geospatial database that allows users to make a convenient searching and analysis for rapid screening of potential severe subsidence or deformation areas and targets to help decision making. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

However, developing effective monitoring approaches must rely on the collection of a variety of information, such as the time series of structural deformations. In this context, various ground-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods have been used in monitoring the structural integrity of transport infrastructures. However, these require routine and systematic application at the network level over long periods of time to build up a solid database of information, involving many efforts from stakeholders and asset owners in the sector. To this effect, satellite-based remote sensing techniques, such as the Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR), have gained momentum due to the provision of accurate cumulative structural displacements in bridges. Although the application of the InSAR monitoring technique is established, this is limited to the high required time for the interpretation of the data with high spatial and temporal density. This research aims to demonstrate the viability of the MT-InSAR techniques for the structural assessment of bridges and the monitoring of damage by structural subsidence, using high-resolution SAR datasets, integrated with complementary Ground-Based (GB) information. To this purpose, high-resolution SAR dataset of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) mission provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), were acquired and processed in the framework of the ASI-Open Call approved Project ""MoTiB""(ID 742). In particular, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) analysis is applied to identify and monitoring the structural displacements at the Rochester Bridge, in Rochester, Kent, UK. In order to explore the viability of Machine Learning algorithms in detecting critical situations in the monitoring phases, an Unsupervised ML Clustering approach, which generates homogeneous and well-separated clusters, is implemented. Each PS data-point is located to specific cluster groups, based on the deformation-Trend and the values of displacements of the historical time-series. This research paves the way for the development of a novel interpretation approach relying on the integration between remote-sensing technologies and on-site surveys to improve upon current maintenance strategies for bridges and transport assets.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The main advantage of this technique compared to other non-destructive surveying methodologies is in the possibility to perform fast network-level surveys as well as the provision of time-series of the displacements by multi-temporal data acquisitions. Given the medium ground resolution, C-band imagery are usually not employed for transport infrastructure monitoring as it is considered unlikely to obtain sufficiently accurate information. However, the use of medium resolution SAR data has not been thoroughly investigated until now and is still an open challenge. This study presents a novel approach for transport assets monitoring, based on the synergistic use of medium resolution (C-Band) and high resolution (X-Band) SAR imagery. To this effect, a multi-temporal SAR Interferometry analysis of high and medium-resolution datasets is performed on a runway of the Leonardo Da Vinci Airport in Rome, Italy.

For automatic extraction of flooded area in multi-temporal satellite imagery acquired by Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), this paper presents two neural network algorithms: Feed-Forward Neural Network, Cascade-forward back-propagation neural network. This work currently focuses on Uttar Pradesh in India, which was affected due to floods during August 2017. The two models are trained, validated and tested using MATLAB R2018b. The models are first trained using a variety of input data until the percentage of error with respect to water body detection is within an acceptable error limit. These models are then used to extract the water features effectively and to detect the flooded regions. Finally, flood area is calculated in sq. km in during flood and post-flood imagery using these algorithms. The results thus obtained are compared with that from the binary thresholding method from previous studies. The results show that the Feed-Forward Neural Network gives better accuracy than the Cascade-forward back propagation neural network.

Therefore, a complete history of settlement since the operation of the Airport has never been available to aid the understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of the land settlement.

The results reveal both the spatial and temporal variations of the land settlement. They also show for the first time that the accumulative settlement reaches up to 40 cm over the past two decades. The settlement is largely associated with the material types used in the landfill works and the underlying alluvial sediments as some earlier research has indicated, and the stages of the reclamation works.

While volcanic hazard in Methana is considered low, the neotectonic basin constituting the Saronic Gulf area is seismically active and there is evidence of local geothermal activity. Monitoring is therefore crucial to characterize any activity at the volcano that could impact the local population. This study aims to detect surface deformation in the whole Methana peninsula based on a long stack of 99 Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images in interferometric wide swath mode acquired in March 2015-August 2019. A Multi-Temporal Interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) processing approach is exploited using the Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) method, involving the extraction of a network of targets including both Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Distributed Scatterers (DS) to augment the monitoring capability across the varied land cover of the peninsula. Satellite geodetic data from 2006-2019 Global Positioning System (GPS) benchmark surveying are used to calibrate and validate the MT-InSAR results. Deformation monitoring records from permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, two of which were installed within the peninsula in 2004 (METH) and 2019 (MTNA), are also exploited for interpretation of the regional deformation scenario. Geological, topographic, and 2006-2019 seismological data enable better understanding of the ground deformation observed. Line-of-sight displacement velocities of the over 4700 PS and 6200 DS within the peninsula are from -18.1 to +7.5 mm/year. The MT-InSAR data suggest a complex displacement pattern across the volcano edifice, including local-scale land surface processes. In Methana town, ground stability is found on volcanoclasts and limestone for the majority of the urban area footprint while some deformation is observed in the suburban zones. At the Mavri Petra andesitic dome, time series of the exceptionally dense PS/DS network across blocks of agglomerate and cinder reveal seasonal fluctuation (5 mm amplitude) overlapping the long-term stable trend. Given the steepness of the slopes along the eastern flank of the volcano, displacement patterns may indicate mass movements. The GNSS, seismological and MT-InSAR analyses lead to a first account of deformation processes and their temporal evolution over the last years for Methana, thus providing initial information to feed into the volcano baseline hazard assessment and monitoring system. © 2020 by the authors.","","GNSS; Ground deformation; Ground deformation; InSAR; MT-InSAR; SAR; Seismicity; Sentinel-1; Slope instability; Volcano monitoring","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092018257"

Low-lying coastal urban centers, populated deltas, and coastal protected areas are key societal hotspots of coastal vulnerability in terms of relative sea level change. Land deformation on a local scale can significantly affect estimations, so it is necessary to understand the rhythm and spatial distribution of potential land subsidence/uplift in coastal areas. The present study deals with the determination of the relative vertical rates of the land deformation and the sea-surface height by using multi-source Earth observation-synthetic aperture radar (SAR), global navigation satellite system (GNSS), tide gauge, and altimetry data. To this end, the multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MT-InSAR) technique was used in order to exploit the most recent Copernicus Sentinel-1 data. The products were set to a reference frame by using GNSS measurements and were combined with a re-analysis model assimilating satellite altimetry data, obtained by the Copernicus Marine Service. Additional GNSS and tide gauge observations have been used for validation purposes. The proposed methodological approach has been implemented in three pilot cases: the city of Alexandroupolis in the Evros Delta region, the coastal zone of Thermaic Gulf, and the coastal area of Killini, Araxos (Patras Gulf) in the northwestern Peloponnese, which are Greek coastal areas with special characteristics. The present research provides localized relative sea-level estimations for the three case studies. Their variation is high, ranging from values close to zero, i.e., from 5-10 cm and 30 cm in 50 years for urban areas to values of 50-60 cm in 50 years for rural areas, close to the coast. The results of this research work can contribute to the effective management of coastal areas in the framework of adaptation and mitigation strategies attributed to climate change. Scaling up the proposed methodology to a continental level is required in order to overcome the existing lack of proper assessment of the relevant hazard in Europe. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Coastal zones; Conservation; Deformation; Environmental protection; Global positioning system; Hazards; Observatories; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Tide gages; Earth observation data; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Land subsidence/uplift; Methodological approach; Natural protected areas; Relative sea level rise; Relative sea-level changes; Satellite altimetry data; Sea level","Climate change impact; Coastal urban centers; GNSS; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal SAR interferometry; Natural protected areas; Relative sea level change; Satellite altimetry data; Sea-surface height","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088658684"

Usually, within the DInSAR framework, the Weighted Least-squares (WLS) techniques have principally been applied for improving the performance of the phase unwrapping operations as well as for better conveying the inversion of sequences of unwrapped interferograms to generate ground displacement maps. In both cases, the identification of low-coherent areas, where the standard deviation of the phase is high, is requested. In this paper, a WLS method that extends the usability of the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm in regions with medium-to-low coherence is presented. In particular, the proposed method relies on the adaptive selection and exploitation, pixel-by-pixel, of the medium-to-high coherent interferograms, only, so as to discard the noisy phase measurements. The selected interferometric phase values are then inverted by solving a WLS optimization problem. Noteworthy, the adopted, pixel-dependent selection of the “good” interferograms to be inverted may lead the available SAR data to be grouped into several disjointed subsets, which are then connected, exploiting the Weighted Singular Value Decomposition (WSVD) method. However, in some critical noisy regions, it may also happen that discarding of the incoherent interferograms may lead to rejecting some SAR acquisitions from the generated ground displacement time-series, at the cost of the reduced temporal sampling of the data measurements. Thus, variable-length ground displacement time-series are generated. The mathematical framework of the developed technique, which is named Weighted Adaptive Variable-lEngth (WAVE), is detailed in the manuscript. The presented experiments have been carried out by applying the WAVE technique to a SAR dataset acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) sensors over the Basilicata region, Southern Italy. A cross-comparison analysis between the conventional and the WAVE method has also been provided. © 2020 by the authors.

We analysed a set of ten airborne SAR L-band 2 (Pi-SAR-L2) images obtained during the paddy rice growing season (in June, August, and September) from 2012 to 2014 using polarimetric decomposition. Vector data for agricultural land use areas were overlaid on the analysed images and the mean value for each agricultural parcel computed. By quantitatively comparing our data with a reference dataset generated from optical sensor images, effective polarimetric parameters and the ideal observation season were revealed. Double bounce scattering and surface scattering component ratios, derived using a four-component decomposition algorithm, were key to extracting paddy rice fields when the plant stems are vertical with respect to the ground. The alpha angle was also an effective factor for extracting rice fields from an agricultural area.

Single and multi-temporal filters were used to reduce speckle noise from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (i.e., ALOS PALSAR and Sentinel-1B) before fusing them with optical images through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We detected only one change in the two PV series using a non-seasonal detection approach, as well as in the fused images through five machine learning algorithms that were calibrated with Cross-Validation (CV) and Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV). In total, four categories were obtained: forest, cropland, bare soil, and water. We then compared the change map obtained with time series and that obtained with the classification algorithms with the best calibration performance, revealing an overall accuracy of 92.91% and 91.82%, respectively. For statistical comparisons, we used deforestation reference data.

The proposed solution aims at improving methods based on Sentinel 2 data, that are unusable in case of cloud cover. This goal is achieved by using S1 data to generate S2-like segmentation maps to be used to integrate S2 acquisitions forbidden by cloud cover. In particular, we propose for the first time in remote sensing a multi-temporal W-Net approach for the segmentation of Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW) Sentinel-1 data collected along ascending/descending orbit to discriminate rice, water, and bare soil. The quantitative assessment of segmentation accuracy shows an improvement of 0.18 and 0.25 in terms of accuracy and F1-score by applying the proposed multi-temporal procedure with respect to the previous single-date approach. Advantages and disadvantages of the proposed W-Net based solution have been tested in the National Park of Albufera, Valencia, and we show a performance gain in terms of the classical metrics used in segmentation tasks and the computational time. © 2020 by the authors.

But optical sensors often miss key stages for crop growth because of clouds, which poses challenges to many studies. The synergistic of SAR and optical data is expected to lift this problem, especially in areas with persistent cloud cover. However, due to the different characteristics of optical and SAR sensors, it is difficult to build a relationship between the two with most existing methods, let alone construct the long-time correlations to fill optic observation gaps using SAR data. Inspired by deep learning, this study presents a novel strategy to learn the relationship between optical and SAR time series based on the sequence of contextual information. To be specific, we extended the conventional CNN-RNN to build Multi-CNN-Sequence to Sequence (MCNN-Seq) model, and formulate the correlation between the optic and SAR time series sequences. We verified the MCNN-Seq model and found that the accuracy of the predicted optical image was determined by crop types and phenological stages, both in the spatial and temporal domain, respectively. For several crops, such as onion, winter wheat, corn, and sugar beet, our predictions are fitting well with R2 0.9409, 0.9824,0.9157, and 0.9749, respectively. Compared to CNN and RNN, the simulation accuracy achieved by the MCNN-Seq model is much better in terms of R2 and RMSE. In general, results demonstrate that deep learning models have the potential to synergize SAR and optical data and provide replaceable information when the optical data has a long data gap due to the persistent clouds. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Allium cepa; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Crops; Geometrical optics; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sugar beets; Time series; Contextual information; Dynamic monitoring; Long-time correlations; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Novel strategies; Phenological stage; Simulation accuracy; Temporal domain; biomonitoring; cloud cover; optical method; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Deep learning","CNN-RNN; Crops dynamic; Deep learning; Long-time series; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Optical data; SAR data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086524787"

Available Sentinel-1 TOPS C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images over about one year after the earthquakes are used to analyze the postseismic activities. An adaptive method incorporating Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and multi-Temporal Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques is proposed and implemented to recover the rapid deformation. This method is applied to the series of interferograms generated in a fully constructed SBAS network to retrieve the postseismic deformation signal. ICA algorithm uses a linear transformation to decompose the input mixed signal to its source components, which are non-Gaussian and mutually independent. This analysis allows extracting the low rate postseismic deformation signal from a mixture of interferometric phase components. The independent sources recovered from the multi-Temporal InSAR dataset are then analyzed using a group clustering test aiming to identify and enhance the undescribed deformation signal. Analysis of the processed interferograms indicates a promising performance of the proposed method in determining tectonic deformation. The proposed method works well, mainly when the tectonic signal is dominated by the undesired signals, including atmosphere or orbital/unwrapping noise that counts as temporally uncorrelated components.</p><p>In contrast to the standard SBAS time series method, the ICA-based time series analysis estimates the cumulative deformation with no prior assumption about elevation dependence of the interferometric phase or temporal nature of the tectonic signal. Application of the method to 433 Sentinel-1 pairs within the dataset reports two distinct deformation patches corresponding to the postseismic deformation. Besides the performance of the ICA-based analysis, the proposed method automatically detects rapid or low rate tectonic processes in unfavorable conditions. © Authors 2020.

The rock mass and debris of the slope failure formed a landslide dam. The discharge of the dammed lake plus the failure events caused significant socio-economic losses. Many slow-moving areas appeared after the two failure events and potential landslide risk still exists. Retrieving the long-term spatial-temporal pattern of landslide activity can help us to understand and mitigate landslide disasters. However, it is difficult to monitor all movement episodes of some landslides using single satellite dataset and method, due to the different deformation characteristics. Employing multiple radar and optical images may solve this problem. In this study, the Landsat 8, the ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images are used to obtain the surface displacements before the first failure event by using the cross-correlation technique (for Landsat 8 images) and the pixel offset tracking technique. The displacement velocity map after the second failure is derived by the Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) method from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and the Sentinel-1 images. The maximum radar line of sight (LOS) average velocity is 3 m/yr between Jan. 2007 and Feb. 2011, and 12 m/yr between Jul. 2015 and Jul. 2018. From Oct. 2013 to Feb. 2018, the maximum horizontal average velocity is 5.8 m/yr. The movement accelerated from Jul. 2017. A large deformation area appeared on the south of the failed slope after the second failure. The unstable area observed by the MT-InSAR is much larger than that obtained through the field measurements. In the first month after the second failure, the maximum LOS displacements are more than 20 cm. The depletion area and the neighboring zones of the landslide are unstable even one year after the second failure.

The method of log-cumulants (MoLC) is a reliable alternative for parameter estimation of SAR data models and image processing. However, numerical methods are usually applied to estimate parameters using MoLC, and it may lead to a high computational cost. Thus, MoLC may be unsuitable for real-time SAR imagery applications such as change detection and marine search and rescue, for example. Our paper introduces a fast approach to overcome this limitation of MoLC, focusing on parameter estimation of single-channel SAR data modeled by the <i>G</i>0<i>I</i> distribution. Experiments with simulated and real SAR data demonstrate that our approach performs faster than MoLC, while the precision of the estimation is comparable with that of the original MoLC. We tested the fast approach with multitemporal data and applied the arithmetic-geometric distance to real SAR images for change detection on the ocean. The experiments showed that the fast MoLC outperformed the original estimation method with regard to the computational time. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The core of the image fusion was an orthogonal transform of the reflectance channels from optical sensors on hypercomplex bases delivered in Kennaugh-like elements, which are well-known from polarimetric radar. In this way, SAR and Optics could be fused to one image data set sharing the characteristics of both: the sharpness of Optics and the texture of SAR. The special properties of Kennaugh elements regarding their scaling-linear, logarithmic, normalized-applied likewise to the newelements and guaranteed their robustness towards noise, radiometric sub-sampling, and therewith data compression. This study combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on an Octonion basis as well as Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2 on a Sedenion basis. The validation using signatures of typical land cover classes showed that the efficient archiving in 4 bit images still guaranteed an accuracy over 90% in the class assignment. Due to the stability of the resulting class signatures, the fuzziness to be caught by Machine Learning Algorithms was minimized at the same time.

This paper proposes an exclusive multi-scale with multiple orientation approach for multi-temporal SAR images. This approach integrates pre-processing and change detection. Pre-processing is performed on the SAR imagery through speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion and discrete wavelet transform. The processed speckle-free images are designed by Log-Gabor filter bank in terms of multi-scale with multiple orientations. The maximum magnitude of multiple orientations is concatenated to obtain feature-based scale representation. Each scale is dealt with multiple orientations and is compared by band-wise subtraction to retrieve difference image (DI) coefficient. The series of the difference coefficients from each scale are add-on together to estimate a DI. Thus, the resultant image of multi-scale orientation gives perception of detailed information with specific contour. Constrained k-means clustering algorithm is preferred to achieve change and un-change map. Performance of the proposed approach is validated on three real SAR image datasets. The effective change detection is examined by using confusion matrix parameters. Experimental results are described to show the efficacy of the proposed approach. © 2021 The Author(s).

The increasing number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite systems have steadily provided a large amount of SAR data. Among these systems, the Sentinel-1 mission can be considered a milestone in the development of InSAR techniques, offering new opportunities to monitor global surface deformation with high precision, due to its wide coverage, short revisit time, and free access. However, conventional InSAR techniques have encountered great challenges in large-scale InSAR processing over wide areas because of the large computational burden and complexity. In this work, we present a novel parallel computing-based coherent scatterer InSAR (P-CSInSAR) method for automatic and efficient generation of deformation results from Sentinel-1 raw data. To achieve high parallelization performance for the overall InSAR processing chain, parallelization strategies at different levels have been adopted in the P-CSInSAR method, which has been fully addressed in this work. To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, P-CSInSAR has been tested on the North China Plain regions with three adjacent frames of Sentinel-1 images, and the deformation results have been validated by GPS measurements. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed parallel computing-based P-CSInSAR method.

However, this idea is impracticable for the task of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image despeckling, since no real-world speckle-free SAR data exist. To address this issue, this article presents a noisy reference-based SAR deep learning filter, by using complementary images of the same area at different times as the training references. In the proposed method, to better exploit the information of the images, parameter-sharing convolutional neural networks are employed. Furthermore, to mitigate the training errors caused by the land-cover changes between different times, the similarity of each pixel pair between the different images is utilized to optimize the training process. The outstanding despeckling performance of the proposed method was confirmed by the experiments conducted on several multitemporal data sets, when compared with some of the state-of-the-art SAR despeckling techniques. In addition, the proposed method shows a pleasing generalization ability on single-temporal data sets, even though the networks are trained using finite input-reference image pairs at a different imaging area. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image denoising; Learning systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Generalization ability; Land-cover change; Learning methods; Learning techniques; Multi-temporal data; Parameter sharing; SAR image despeckling; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; artificial neural network; data set; learning; satellite imagery; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; speckle filtering; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097406889"

A continuous geodetic observation in the landslide prone area is essential to support the precautionary measures. Because of its hilly topography, torrential rainfall and landslide history, the Ciloto district in Indonesia has been affected by ground deformation for an extended period of time. The purpose of our study is to detect significant movement and quantify the kinematics of its motion using the Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis and multi-band SAR images. We utilized the small baseline SDFP technique for processing multi-temporal SAR data, comprising ERS1/2 (1998–1999), ALOS PALSAR (2007–2009), and Sentinel-1 (2014–2018). Based on the detected deformation signal in the Ciloto area, the displacement rates are categorized as very slow movements. Two active main landslide zones; the Puncak Pass and the Puncak Highway area, which show the trend of slow movement progressively increasing or descreasing, were detected. The integration of the velocity rate between InSAR results and ground observations (e.g., terrestrial and GPS) was conducted at the Puncak Highway area from the temporal perspective. Using the polynomial model, we estimated that the area had cumulatively displaced up to −42 cm for 25 years and the type of movements varied from single compound to multiple rotational and compound. © 2020 by the authors.

Satellite remote sensing data are nowadays essential to perform such task, thanks to their capability to survey disastrous events also in remote and under-monitored regions, with frequent revisit time and accurate spatial resolution. Even though satellite imageries are presently used to analyze several phenomena related to eruptions, automatic methods and synergic exploitation of different sensors are rarely considered. In this work, we have analyzed satellite images coming from both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors, to study the effusive eruption of Fogo volcano, Cape Verde, which took place between November 2014 and January 2015. In particular, we have exploited multi-sensor images from Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, Landsat-8, and Earth-Observing-1 missions, to retrieve lava flow patterns and volcanic source parameters related to the eruption. The main outcome of our work is the application of a new automatic change detection technique for estimating the lava field and its temporal evolution, combining the SAR intensity and the interferometric SAR coherence. The innovative algorithm is able to take full advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission’s 6-day repeat cycle. Such data are here used for the first time for lava mapping, thereby providing an unprecedented example of using the multi-temporal interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence to automatically monitor lava flow evolution in emergency phase. This new technique, jointly used with optical satellite images, is capable of resolving with spatial and temporal detail the evolution of lava flows. We have also performed differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) to map the ground deformation and retrieve the feeding dyke by inverting syn-eruptive signals. Results from source modeling show a SW-NE oriented dyke, located inside Chã das Caldeiras, SW of the Pico do Fogo. Our work highlights how multidisciplinary and satellite open data, along with innovative and automatic processing techniques, may be adopted for real-time hazard estimates in an operational environment. © Copyright © 2020 Bignami, Chini, Amici and Trasatti.","Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; Fogo; Geometrical optics; Hazards; Image analysis; Interferometry; Open Data; Remote sensing; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Volcanoes; Change detection; D-inSAR; hierarchical-split-based approach; lava; Optical image; Source modeling; hazard assessment; lava flow; pyroclastic flow; remote sensing; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; volcanic eruption; Space-based radar","change detection; DInSAR coherence; Fogo volcano; hierarchical-split-based approach; lava; optical images; synthetic aperture radar; volcanic source modeling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083031038"

Rice occupies about two-third of the total cropped area in the state, and is grown in 2.47 million ha area during kharif (rainy) and rabi (summer) seasons. The 2.04 t/ha rice (paddy) productivity in Assam is below the national average of 3.29 t/ha of rice productivity of India, despite having good alluvial soils. Rice productivity in Assam is mainly constrained by the frequent spells of floods during kharif season. An estimated of 0.475 million ha (ca 19% of the net sown area) in the state is chronically flood-prone. Swarna Sub1, a flood-tolerant rice variety has been developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) by introduction of Sub1 gene in the parent variety Swarna, providing it submergence tolerance up to 15 days. The Government of Assam wanted to introduce this variety in the state in 2011. To facilitate effective dissemination of Swarna-Sub1 rice seeds, this study used remote sensing and GIS to identify villages experiencing flash food with maximum duration of 15 days. Such endeavor involved analysis of 21 flood-prone districts of Assam using flood inundation layer, based on Radarsat-2 multi-temporal data (C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR wide range at 100 m resolution with HH polarization; SAR narrow range at 50 m resolution; standard range at 25 m resolution). All available SAR data from 2007 to 2010 were used. The year-wise layers of different flood dates were digitized in ArcGIS and areas where flood water stagnated for 15 days or less in different flood cycles in a year were clipped. This process was repeated for all the four flood years and a merged data layer was created. The merged data layer was intersected with village administrative boundary and villages were selected. These selected villages represent the submergence areas of 15 days or less, recommended locations for dissemination of Sub1 rice variety seeds. A total of 6997 villages in 21 districts were identified for seed dissemination through an IRRI-implemented project- Stress Tolerant Rice for Farmers in Africa and South Asia (STRASA). Dissemination of Swarna-Sub1 seeds was carried out under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) of the Government of India during 2011. In 2012, more seed multiplication was carried out and in 2013, about 30,000 ha was covered by Swarna-Sub1 in Assam. Following its success, Sub1 gene was introgressed into two most popular rice varieties of Assam-Ranjit and Bahadur. These varieties, Ranjit-Sub1 and Bahadur-Sub1, were released for cultivation in 2018. Sub1 rice varieties have now covered a significant area in Assam. This study demonstrated the use case of remote sensing and GIS technologies to target dissemination of flood-tolerant rice varieties with the ultimate goal of reducing vulnerability of rice farmers to flood-induced crop production loss and thereby increasing farmers' rice productivity and also helped farmers grow flood tolerant rice in those flooded areas where no crop could be taken otherwise. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

SAR constellations, with more rapid revisit capability, allow one to generate stacks of SAR data and to use multi-temporal filters for speckle reduction. GAMMA software offers multi-temporal filters for SAR processing, two of which we compared to the traditional Enhanced Lee and the Lee filters. We evaluated the filters using three criteria: (1) visual inspection, (2) signal level ratio, and (3) the equivalent number of looks (ENL). The results of this study show that multi-temporal filters were able to reduce speckle from areas of surface water and land, as well as to improve the detection of Phragmites patches due to preserving the resolution and texture which helped in the detection of the patch boundaries. The signal level ratio was approximately 1.0 with the GAMMA Multi-temporal filter and approximately 0.9 with the other filters. The enhanced Lee and the two multi-temporal filters produced an equal ENL of about 6. However, due to small patch sizes and backscatter similarity with cattails and other cover types Phragmites patches were difficult to separate from other types of flooded vegetation with C-HH intensity only. © 2020 Copyright of the Crown in Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada.

For the past ten years, Canada has integrated C-band SAR with optical satellite data to map what crops are grown in every field, for the entire country. While the advantages of SAR are well understood, the barriers to its operational use include the lack of familiarity with SAR data by agricultural end-user agencies and the lack of a ‘blueprint’ on how to implement an operational SAR-based mapping system. This research reviewed order of operations for SAR data processing and how order choice affects processing time and classification outcomes. Additionally this research assessed the impact of speckle filtering by testing three filter types (adaptive, multi-temporal and multi-resolution) at varying window sizes for three study sites with different average field sizes. The Touzi multi-resolution filter achieved the highest overall classification accuracies for all three sites with varying window sizes, and with only a small (< 2%) difference in accuracy relative to the Gamma Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) adaptive filter which had similar window sizes across sites. As such, the assessment of order of operations for noise reduction and terrain correction was completed using the Gamma MAP adaptive filter. This research found there was no difference in classification accuracies regardless of whether noise reduction was applied before or after terrain correction. However, implementing the terrain correction as the first operation resulted in a 10 to 50% increase in processing time. This is an important consideration when designing and delivering operational systems, especially for large geographies like Canada where hundreds of SAR images are required. These findings will encourage country-wide, regional and global food monitoring initiatives to consider SAR sensors as an important source of data to operationally map agricultural production. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Canada; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Data handling; Image processing; Landforms; Mapping; Noise abatement; Optical data processing; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural landscapes; Agricultural productions; Classification accuracy; Maximum a posteriori; Operational systems; Optical satellites; SAR data processing; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; agricultural production; image processing; mapping method; satellite data; sensor; synthetic aperture radar; terrain; Space-based radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087588271"

GLRT is applied to the neighborhood areas corresponding to the same geographical area in multitemporal SAR images. Generally, the difference image is acquired by applying the GLRT on a moving window empirically determined by the user, which is clearly unreasonable because the different pixels in an image may have different optimal windows. To overcome this drawback, we propose an adaptive GLRT (AGLRT) method for change detection in SAR images. AGLRT adaptively selects the homogeneity window for each pixel and can decrease the uncertainty of change detection due to manual selection of the moving window. Experiments are conducted on two data sets to confirm the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that AGLRT can both suppress the influence of noise and preserve edge details and improve the accuracy of change detection. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Adaptive; Change detection; Difference images; Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test; Generalized likelihood-ratio tests; Geographical area; Multi-temporal SAR images; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; accuracy assessment; detection method; neighborhood; pixel; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; testing method; Radar imaging","Adaptive; change detection; generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT); synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080931206"

Primeval forests that remained there untouched have exceptional value. Unsustainable logging and climate change intensify forest disturbances and may cause substantial forest loss. The engagement of remote sensing allows timely monitoring and prediction of negative consequences. The leaf area index is selected from the other forest’s condition indicators to assess the forests’ quantity and disturbance. The conceptual approach for risk assessment of forest disturbance is proposed. This approach uses multiscale multi-temporal Earth observation data, such as synthetic aperture radar imagery and high-level satellite data products. The output response of the forest’s condition was restored by multivariate regression with radar backscattering coefficients, relative difference polarization index, and local incidence angle. The low-resolution leaf area index pre-developed Copernicus data products make it possible to characterize the forest’s condition without ground truth measurements. According to the elaborated methodology, a time series of the leaf area index was mapped, and risks analysis was performed according to hazard functions. A resulting risk’s gradations map is a good tool for future research and decision-making support in nature management. The high spatial resolution of the output maps allows getting a more detailed assessment of forest disturbance behavior. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This research aims to investigate the viability of a novel Non-Destructive Health-Monitoring Approach (ND-HMA) based on the synergistic use of satellite remote sensing and GPR techniques for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of damages induced by structural subsidence. The analyses were developed to identify and detect structural displacements of the Olivieri Bridge, located in Salerno, Italy. To this purpose, commercial VHR COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) products, provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI), were acquired and processed by persistent scatterers (PS) InSAR technique. The historical time-series of deformations of the scatterers, found in correspondence of critical structural elements of the structure (i.e., bridge piers and arcs), were analyzed. Furthermore, in-situ GPR inspection analysis were carried out by using multi-frequency GPR systems equipped with both air-launched and ground-coupled antennas with central frequency ranging between 200 MHz and 1000 MHz. The implementation of the integrated approach provides a technologically enhanced and reliable mechanism for the provision of ""early warning""information to be more rapidly processed and conclusively actioned by asset owners and management agencies. In particular, a novel data interpretation approach is proposed based on the selection of several PS data-points with coherent deformation trends on the bridge and the analysis of GPR outputs. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that multi-Temporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be applied to complement non-destructive ground-based analyses (e.g., ground-penetrating radars), thereby paving the way for integrated approaches in the smart monitoring of infrastructure assets.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Remote sensing techniques have long been important means of forest monitoring with their ability to quickly and efficiently collect the spatial-temporal variability of vegetation. Vegetation classification is a key issue for forest monitoring and is critical to many remote sensing applications in the domain of precision forestry such as vegetation area estimation. Remote sensing applications in vegetation classification have traditionally focused on the use of optical data such as MODIS. However, due to cloud and haze interference, optical images are not always available at phenological stages that are essential to vegetation identification, making it difficult to construct complete time-series vegetation growth and limiting the vegetation classification accuracy. Unlike passive visible and infrared wavelengths which are sensitive to cloud and light, active SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is particularly attractive for vegetation classification due to its all-weather, all-day imaging capabilities. In addition, SAR provides information on the stem and leaf structures of vegetation and is sensitive to soil roughness and moisture content, making it effective in forest applications. In this study, a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method employing multi-temporal SAR data is presented for forest vegetation classification in the Taibai Mountain (the main peak of Qinling Mountains). Firstly, Sentinel-2 optical images and digital elevation data in the study area were used for multi-scale segmentation to produce a precise farmland map. Then pre-processed SAR intensity images were overlaid with the farmland map to construct time-series vegetation growth for each parcel. Finally, a deep-learning-based classifier using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was employed to learn time-series features of vegetation and to classify parcels to produce a final classification map. The experimental results show that: (1) Compared with traditional machine learning methods (such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine), the classification accuracy of the deep-learning-based method proposed in this paper was improved by more than 10%; (2) Among different combinations of Sentinel-1A polarizations, VV+VH performed best, having a similar accuracy with the VV+VH+VV/VH; (3) Time-series classification using all images in the whole year achieved the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 82% using VV+ VH. The study shows that the combination LSTM network and time-series Sentinel-1A data can effectively improve the accuracy of vegetation classification and provide new ideas for forest vegetation classification from the perspectives of data source and classification method. © 2020, Science Press.

Ground deformation often occurs with improper construction activities. Such deformation can be measured with techniques such as multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). However, the deformation anomalies, such as the building horizontal tilt can cause the MT-InSAR line-of-sight deformation to tend to zero, the deformed area is likely to be ignored when the individual SAR dataset is applied. In this article, we explore deformation induced by the underground construction of To Kwa Wan (TKW) station in Hong Kong with an improved MT-InSAR method. Multiplatform SAR datasets from TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A are adopted to retrieve comprehensive deformation of ground buildings for stability investigation. The results are validated through cross-validation between SAR datasets. Both spatial and temporal variations of ground deformation are revealed. Ground buildings suffered significant deformation in vertical and horizontal directions, the maximum deformation is around 30 and 40 mm, respectively. Due to the anomalous deformation, the ground buildings around the station are dumped towards the street center. In view of temporal evolution, the deformation is strongly related to the construction stages. The deformation turned to be stable after the completion of the main framework of the TKW station in December 2016. This article suggests that the deformation obtained from individual SAR datasets may sometimes is not noticeable or reliable in the area with complex underground construction. Such complex phenomena can be revealed by using the multiplatform SAR datasets with MT-InSAR.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","China; Hong Kong; Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Deformation; Radar measurement; Three dimensional displays; Deformable models; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-platform; Multi-temporal; Multiplatform SAR data; Multitemporal InSAR; SAR data; Three-dimensional display; To kwa wan station; Underground construction; anomaly; data set; deformation; detection method; synthetic aperture radar; underground construction; Synthetic aperture radar","Deformation; multiplatform synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data; multitemporal INSAR; To Kwa Wan (TKW) station; underground construction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115680550"

Rapid delineation of the spatial extent of flooding is of great importance for the dynamic monitoring of flood evolution and corresponding emergency strategies. Some of the current flood mapping methods mainly process single date images characterized by simple flood situations and homogenous backgrounds. Although other methods show good performance for images with harsh conditions for floods, they must be trained—many times based on pre-classified samples—or undergo complicated parameter tuning processes, which require computation efforts. The widely used change detection methods utilize multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for the detection of flood area, but the results are largely influenced by the quality of defined reference images. Furthermore, these methods were mostly applied for some river basin floods, which are not effective for the large scale, semi-arid regions with complex flood conditions, and various land cover types. All of these extremely limited the use of these methods for the timely and accurate extraction of the spatial distribution pattern of floods in other typical and broad areas. Based on the above considerations, this paper presents a new method for rapidly determining the extent of flooding in large, semi-arid areas with challenging environmental conditions, based on multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. First, a preprocessing scheme is applied to perform geometric correction and to estimate the intensity of the imagery. Second, an automatic thresholding procedure is used to generate an initial land and water classification through the integration of the probability density distribution. A fuzzy logic-based approach, combining SAR backscattering information and other auxiliary data, is then used to refine the initial classified image. The fuzzy logic-based refinement removes areas that look similar to water in the SAR images, significantly enhancing the flood mapping accuracy. Finally, a post-processing step consisting of morphological operations and extraction improves the homogeneity of the extracted flood segments, discards isolated pixels, and gives the final flood map. This method can automatically detect the extent of floods at little computational cost. As Sentinel-1 data are publicly available and have a fast repeat cycle, the procedure can provide near real time results for rapid emergency response following flash floods. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed at three test sites in Pakistan, which covered diverse landscapes and suffered large scale serious flooding after a long and severe drought in 2015. In comparison with the more recent studies from Ohki et al., 2020, and Shahabi et al., 2020, our results indicate the best spatial agreement with GF-2 panchromatic multi-spectral (PMS) water classification, with an encouraging overall accuracy ranging from 91.1% to 96.6%, and Kappa coefficients ranging from 0.893 to 0.954. Especially for the areas with fragmented floods, heterogeneous backgrounds, and the areas where samples are highly unbalanced in the SAR images, our method combines the global statistics and local relationships of backscattering properties, terrain, and other auxiliary information, enabling to effectively preserve the detailed structures and also remove the noise. © 2020 by the authors.

It is therefore important to be able to predict SOC accurately to promote sustainable soil management. Although the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has many advantages and has been widely used in soil science research, it has rarely been used in previous SOC mapping studies based on remote sensing images. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in SOC prediction, by comparing the predictive performance of random forest (RF) and boosted regression tree (BRT) models in the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. A set of 162 topsoil (0–20 cm) samples were taken and 15 environmental variables were obtained including land use, topography, climate, and remote sensing images (optical and SAR data). Using a cross-validation procedure to evaluate the performance of the models, three statistical indices were calculated. Overall, both RF and BRT models effectively predicted SOC content, exhibiting similar performance and producing similar spatial distribution patterns of SOC. The results showed that the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images improved prediction accuracy, with the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) improving by 9.0%, 8.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all environmental variables had the best prediction performance explaining 75% of SOC variation. The most important environmental variables explaining SOC variation were precipitation, elevation, and temperature. The multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data in RF and BRT models explained 9% and 7%, respectively. The results from our case study highlight the usefulness of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data in SOC mapping. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hei River; Agronomy; Climate change; Decision trees; Forecasting; Forestry; Image enhancement; Land use; Mapping; Mean square error; Organic carbon; Random forests; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Watersheds; Boosted regression trees; Coefficient of determination; Digital soil mappings; Root mean squared errors; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic carbon content; Spatial distribution patterns; Sustainable soil management; algorithm; global climate; mapping method; organic carbon; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil carbon; soil management; soil quality; soil science; spatial distribution; synthetic aperture radar; topsoil; Soil quality","Boosted regression tree; Digital soil mapping; Random forests; Remote sensing; Soil organic carbon","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081160593"

Correlation analysis was performed between SAR data and NDVI values derived from Landsat-8 optical data. A linear mixed-effects regression analysis was performed for detecting the impact of drought on communal and commercial grasslands during a drought and non-drought growing seasons. Our results indicate that vegetation dynamics in grasslands in the study area are highly responsive to the climatic fluctuations. A significant correlation between backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1 SAR data (VH and VV) and NDVI was observed for both communal and commercial grasslands (R2 = 0.89). Results also demonstrated that communal grasslands are more affected by drought impact than commercial grasslands. In commercial grasslands, management activities can improve the growing conditions of grasslands, reduce the impact of drought, and subsequently increase the resilience and productivity of this ecosystem. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, we use multi-temporal X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations to analysis dramatic changes of ice velocity in glacier over Greenland. Differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) can measure glacier movement with high accuracy of from cm to mm scale, but it is often limited by degraded loss of coherence due to significant temporal and volume decorrelation. Thus, we adopted intensity offset tracking to estimate the displacement of the different part of glacier. Since offset tracking is determined by the cross-correlation of the amplitude between two SAR images, it can be applied to large displacements regardless of temporal decorrelation. In this study, a time series of ice velocity of Narssap sermia and Qamanaarsuup Sermia was estimated by using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X X-band SAR images. We processed 95 SAR images, which were collected with mostly the 11-day temporal baseline in the stripmap mode at ascending direction, VV polarization, and incidence angle of 21.4 degree, acquired from July 22, 2013 to February 09, 2017.

First, the statistically homogeneous pixels (SHP) with similar scatter behaviour are identified using the Anderson-Darling (AD) test method. Then, the Distributed Scatterers (DSs) are selected according to the SHPs threshold, and the backscattering coefficients of DSs are filtered using the SHPs distribution and coherences. In order to eliminate the negative influence of vegetation and roughness, the filtered backscattering coefficients are further processed by coupling the Water Cloud Model (WCM) and the images acquired in the winter season. The response of soil moisture to backscattering coefficients is greatly improved. Finally, the backscatter coefficients (σ0) are transformed into soil-moisture units by using the Least Square Regression (LSR) model and multi-temporal Change Detection (CD) method, respectively. The 15 scenes of TerraSAR-X images and 18 scenes of Sentinel-1 images in Northern Piedmont river, Northern Tibet, were used for experimental study. The results reveal that the response of the filtered backscattering coefficients to in-situ soil moisture is greatly improved. The soil-moisture content estimated by LSR and CD model using TerraSAR-X data is consistent with in-situ measurements, with coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0.52 and 0.56, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.08 and 0.06, respectively. The results show that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of soil-moisture estimation, especially over the complex surface features of the QTP permafrost region. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Backscattering; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Permafrost; Satellites; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Testing; Vegetation; Backscatter coefficients; Backscattering coefficients; Coefficient of determination; Influence of vegetations; Least square regression; Radar backscattering coefficient; Soil moisture estimation; Soil moisture retrievals; backscatter; estimation method; permafrost; satellite data; Sentinel; signal processing; soil moisture; TerraSAR-X; Soil surveys","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097075882"

In this work we propose a wavelet framework that exploits the information from polarimetric features and analyze them to both mitigate the speckle effect on the multi-temporal information and improve the targets homogeneity using the multi-temporal information.

The Autochange method outputs the pre-change land cover class, the change magnitude, and the change type. Pre-change land cover information is transferred to post-change imagery based on classes derived by unsupervised clustering, enabling using data from different instruments for pre-and post-change. The change magnitude and change types are computed by unsupervised clustering of the post-change image within each cluster, and by comparing the mean intensity values of the lower level clusters with their parent cluster means. A computational approach to determine the change magnitude threshold for the abrupt change was developed. The method was demonstrated with three summer image pairs Sentinel-2/Sentinel-2, Landsat 8/Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-2/ALOS 2 PALSAR in a study area of 12,372 km2 in southern Finland for the detection of forest clear cuts and tested with independent data. The Sentinel-2 classification produced an omission error of 5.6% for the cut class and 0.4% for the uncut class. Commission errors were 4.9% for the cut class and 0.4% for the uncut class. For the Landsat 8/Sentinel-2 classifications the equivalent figures were 20.8%, 0.2%, 3.4%, and 1.6% and for the Sentinel-2/ALOS PALSAR classification 16.7%, 1.4%, 17.8%, and 1.3%, respectively. The Autochange algorithm and its software implementation was considered applicable for the mapping of abrupt land cover changes using multi-temporal satellite data. It allowed mixing of images even from the optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors in the same change analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change analysis; Computational approach; Hierarchical clustering methods; Land cover informations; Land-cover change; Software implementation; Southern Finland; Unsupervised clustering; Hierarchical clustering","Algorithm; Change detection; Forestry; Land cover; Multi-temporal; Optical; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086463638"

Mechanism of land subsidence of plateau lakeside Kunming city cluster (China) by MT-InSAR and leveling survey. In: Bai, X. and Zhou, H. (eds.), Advances in Water Resources, Environmental Protection, and Sustainable Development. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 115, pp. 666-675. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The Kunming city cluster (KCC) is located around the lakeside of Dianchi Lake, a plateau lake in Kunming Basin southwest of China, which is of complex geological structures and evolutionary history, and belongs to an earthquake fault depression area, where faults are developed and crustal stability is poor. Influenced by regional uplift and continuous subsidence of lakeside areas, the land subsidence characteristics of KCC are quite complex. The subsidence mechanism shows multi-inducement and multi-source property. In this paper, the land subsidence ranges, subsidence rate and subsidence spatio-temporal variation pattern of KCC were analyzed, mainly based on multi-temporal interferometry synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR), supplemented by leveling survey data, from 1986 to 2018. The effects of various controlling factors on land subsidence were studied respectively, such as geological structure, stratigraphic distribution, groundwater exploitation, and loads on the ground due to infrastructure construction and human activities, and the internal mechanism and response relation between the subsidence and the factors were studied too. The controlling factors and variation pattern of land subsidence in KCC were identified. The results have shown that the land subsidence of KCC is mainly affected by the tectonic activity in this area, fault basin landform sediments provide conditions for the development and speed up of land subsidence, and the previous land subsidence areas were closely related to the excessive exploitation of groundwater. However, in recent years, the subsidence areas expand continuously due to increases of loads from human activities. By analyzing the controlling factors and spatio-temporal variation pattern of land subsidence in the study areas, this paper has preliminarily revealed the land subsidence mechanism, which will provide reasonable theoretical reference and practical guidance for identifying and eliminating the potential land subsidence hazards and urban development planning in the plateau lakeside city cluster.  © 2020 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

This methodology was enhanced to include advances and updates in data pre-processing such as use of multi-temporal speckle filtering, newer and better classification techniques like the decision tree classifier and latest practices on accuracy assessment like unbiased area estimation. Pre-processing steps were automated through Python scripts to speed up data processing and make the methodology easily replicable at the provincial, regional and/or national scale. To further allow the approach to be reproducible, the freely available 25-meter slope-corrected mosaic radar data from Daichi-1/2, also known as Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-1/2), acquired using the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-1/2) was utilized. Forest cover maps of the three field sites for 2007, 2010 and 2015, as well as the forest cover change maps from 2010 to 2015 were produced using decision tree classifiers (DTC). The thresholds used for the decision tree to map forest extent in the field sites worked best for the radar images of the site in Mindanao (Davao Oriental), which achieved unbiased measures of accuracy using Olofsson's accuracy assessment techniques of at least 89% for all classes mapped. The forest cover maps for the sites in Luzon (Albay) and Visayas (Eastern Samar) over-estimated the actual forest cover, although the unbiased area estimation allows uncertainties to fall below 10%. The change map for Mindanao (Davao Oriental) achieved unbiased accuracy measures of at least 91% for stable forests and non-forest classes, while the deforestation class only had an accuracy of 50%. Better thresholds have to be re-identified to improve forest cover change mapping. The improved methodology has produced accurate results for forest cover mapping and thus can be applied to other sites in the Philippines, but unbiased areas estimation would have to be used to achieve error-adjusted estimates. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

While a detailed mangrove map of China derived from remote sensing imagery is crucial for protecting mangroves, fragmented mangrove patches are hardly captured by Landsat-derived 30-m-resolution maps. To overcome this limitation, we proposed 10-m-resolution mangrove maps for 2017 using Sentinel SAR and optical time-series imagery, together with terrain data. We first classified coastal land covers based on quantile synthesis; following this, the mangrove category was refined by applying the tidal flat constraint and manual editing. The proposed approach considered factors that limit the accuracy of mangrove maps, including tidal inundation, intertidal terrain, cloudiness, and phenological variations of vegetation. A pixel-based mangrove map (PXL_Map) and an object-based mangrove map (OBJ_Map) were produced using the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. PXL_Map achieved an overall accuracy of 95.3 ± 0.2% based on validation samples, and a 91.6% accuracy based on field sample plots. OBJ_Map had a slightly lower performance than PXL_Map. The maps produced in this study improved the delineation of small mangrove patches along tidal creeks relative to recent Landsat-based maps. The total mangrove area was estimated to be between 21,148 ha (by PXL_Map) and 24,801 ha (by OBJ_Map). Furthermore, the spatial differences among the mangrove maps produced in this study were quantitatively compared with three other existing mangrove maps. The discrepancies among maps could have been due to the size and the location of the mangrove patches. The 10-m-resolution mangrove maps from this study can help manage and protect mangroves in China, especially the small fragmented mangrove patches scattered along the coast. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, the decomposed scattering features with high dimensionality can cause serious problems of ""curse of dimensionality."" This paper proposes a multitemporal PolSAR scattering feature dimension reduction method based on Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder (S-SAE) to effectively reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional scattering features. The proposed method firstly decomposes the PolarSAR data to obtain high-dimensional scattering features and adopts S-SAE to reduce the dimensionality of the acquired multidimensional features. For the S-SAE construction, unsupervised layer-by-layer greedy training is performed to optimize the main parameters. Combined with a sigmoid classifier, the parameters of S-SAE are finely tuned through supervised training to achieve effective dimension reduction of high-dimensional features. The reduced low-dimensional features are taken as the input of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers to evaluate the performance of feature dimension reduction. The performance of the proposed method is validated on two datasets of multitemporal simulated and real Sentinel-1 data. Experimental results show that the S-SAE method with two hidden layers achieves the best performance of feature dimension reduction. Compared with traditional Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction methods, the overall classification accuracy of S-SAE for the SVM classifier is raised by at least 9% and 14%. The overall classification accuracy of S-SAE for the CNN classifier is at least 7% and 9% higher than that of LLE and PCA, respectively. © 2020, Science Press.

One is how to maximize the observation and application effectiveness based on the geometric distortion in an area of interest for determining appropriate ascending- and descending-orbit SAR observations. The other is how to optimize the selection of ground control points (GCPs) to correct orbital phase errors and reference in deriving valid ground surface displacements in the SBAS InSAR analysis. Four criteria were proposed to identify valid GCPs efficiently and effectively. The 2017 Xinmo landslide event, China, was showcased. The tear-away zone was 100% and ∼50% distorted when imaged by ascending- and descending-orbit Sentinel-1A/B SAR sensors. The descending SAR datasets were preferred. Then, we identified four spatially dispersed GCP clusters with the selection criteria using the SBAS InSAR technique and 45 descending-orbit MT SAR datasets. One GCP per cluster was chosen. With the four GCPs and SBAS analysis, we successfully detected the stable status in the landslide-free area and the prelandslide acceleration movement within the tear-away zone.

Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR), which has an all-weather response capability with increased polarimetric information, is a key tool for change detection. However, for PolSAR data, inadequate evaluation of the difference image (DI) map makes the threshold-based algorithms incompatible with the true distribution model, which causes the change detection results to be ineffective and inaccurate. In this paper, to solve these problems, we focus on the generation of the DI map and the selection of the optimal threshold. An omnibus test statistic is used to generate the DI map from multi-temporal PolSAR images, and an improved Kittler and Illingworth algorithm based on either Weibull or gamma distribution is used to obtain the optimal threshold for generating the change detection map. Multi-temporal PolSAR data obtained by the Radarsat-2 sensor over Wuhan in China are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results using our approach obtained the best performance in East Lake and Yanxi Lake regions with false alarm rates of 1.59% and 1.80%, total errors of 2.73% and 4.33%, overall accuracy of 97.27% and 95.67%, and Kappa coefficients of 0.6486 and 0.6275, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method is more suitable than the other compared methods for multi-temporal PolSAR data, and it can obtain both effective and accurate results. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper quantifies and compares the performance of forest biomass estimation from L-band SAR backscatter measured selectively under dry and wet conditions during the 2019 AM-PM NASA airborne campaign. Seven Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images acquired between June and October 2019 over a temperate deciduous forest in Southeastern United States with varying moisture and precipitation conditions are examined in conjunction with LIDAR and field measurements. Biomass is estimated by fitting a 3-parameter modified Water Cloud Model (WCM) to radiometric terrain corrected SAR backscatter. Our experiment is designed to quantify the biomass estimation errors when biomass models are calibrated and validated on varying acquisition conditions (dry or wet). Multi-temporal estimation strategies are also evaluated and compared with single-acquisition estimation approaches. As an outcome, the experiment shows that the WCM model calibrated and validated on single acquisitions adapts to different soil moisture conditions with RMSD up to 18.7 Mg/ha. The AGB estimation performance, however, decreases with RMSD upwards of 30 Mg/ha when the model is cross-validated on moisture and precipitation conditions different than the calibration conditions. Results confirm that calibrating the model over the multi-temporal data using averaged backscatter or weighted combinations of individual AGB estimates, improves the biomass estimation accuracy up to about 20% at L-band. This study helps design biomass cal/val procedures and biomass estimation algorithms for dense time-series to be collected by low-frequency radar missions such as NASA-ISRO SAR (NISAR) and BIOMASS. © 2020 by the authors.

Because of this, there is a large demand for monitoring tools to support landslide management strategies. Among the variety of remote sensing techniques, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become one of the most widely applied for landslide studies. This work reviews a variety of InSAR-related applications for landslide studies in Italy. More than 250 papers were analyzed in this review. The first application dates back to 1999. The average production of InSAR-related papers for landslide studies is around 12 per year, with a peak of 37 papers in 2015. Almost 70% of the papers are written by authors in academia. InSAR is used (i) for landslide back analysis (3% of the papers); (ii) for landslide characterization (40% of the papers); (iii) as input for landslide models (7% of the papers); (iv) to update landslide inventories (15% of the papers); (v) for landslide mapping (32% of the papers), and (vi) for monitoring (3% of the papers). Sixty-eight percent of the authors validated the satellite results with ground information or other remote sensing data. Although well-known limitations exist, this bibliographic overview confirms that InSAR is a consolidated tool for many landslide-related applications. © 2020 by the authors.","Interferometry; Losses; Paper; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Landslide detection; Landslide inventories; Landslide management; Landslide mapping; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing techniques; Satellite interferometry; Landslides","InSAR; InSAR applications; Italy; Landslide mapping; Landslide monitoring; Multi-temporal SAR; Risk management","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085251281"

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Amazon Basin; Cambodia; Congo Basin; Mekong Basin; Tonle Sap Lake; Aneroid altimeters; Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric pressure; Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Climate change; Electromagnetic waves; Flood control; Food supply; Forecasting; Lakes; Orthogonal functions; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Water; Water management; Watersheds; Eof analysis; Flood forecast; Mekong river basins; Satellite altimetry; Tonle saps; biodiversity; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; empirical orthogonal function analysis; flood; flood forecasting; floodplain; forecasting method; hindcasting; hydrological cycle; satellite altimetry; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; Floods","Daily inundation extents estimation; EOF analysis; Flood forecast; Mekong River Basin; SAR; Satellite altimetry; Tonle Sap Lake","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082653654"

This method identifies the differences between the images and accomplishes the classification result into changed and unchanged areas. However, the existing algorithms are degraded due to noises present in the RS images. The main aim of the proposed method is the automatic semantic segmentation based change detection that produces a final change between the two input images. This paper proposes a feature learning method named deep lab dilated convolutional neural network (DL-DCNN) for the detection of changes from the images. The proposed approach consists of three stages: (i) pre-processing, (ii) semantic segmentation based change detection and (iii) accuracy assessment. Initially, preprocessing is performed to correct the errors and to obtain detailed information from the scene. Then, map the changes between the two images with the help of a trained network. The DCNN network performs fine-tuning and determines the relationship between two images as changed and unchanged pixel areas. The experimental analysis conducted on various datasets and compared with several existing algorithms.

Focus on this, this paper propose the intensity segregation representation model for the multi-temporal SAR image restoration. This new variational regularization model based on the intensity separation of the multi-temporal SAR image is composed of two sub-models. The first one is a variational regularization model for the intensity component of the image, where the noise is assumed to be multiplicative, and the regularization term is the total variation. A fixed point iterative algorithm is used to solve the Euler-Lagrangian equation of the first sub-model. The second sub-model is the vectorial variational regularization model for the vector component of the image, which is obtained by the assumption that the noise is multiplicative. And the vectorial total variation norm of the vector defined on the unit sphere is obtained. A partial differential equation method is used to get the differential iterative algorithm to solve the Euler-Lagrangian equation of the second sub-model. In this paper, the intensity separation model is applied to the multi-temporal SAR image despeckling. The strong scattering target is well preserved while the good efficient of despeckling is obtained.

We employed interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) as a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique on ascending and descending Sentinel-1A the terrain observation with progressive scans SAR (TOPSAR) images acquired between January 2015 and December 2018 to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution and cause of subsidence in Abbottabad City of Pakistan. The line of sight (LOS) average deformation velocities along ascending and descending orbits were decomposed into vertical velocity fields and compared with geological data, ground water pumping schemes, and precipitation data. The decomposed and averaged vertical velocity results showed significant subsidence in most of the urban areas in the city. The most severe subsidence was observed close to old Karakorum highway, where the subsidence rate varied up to −6.5 cm/year. The subsidence bowl profiles along W–E and S–N transects showed a relationship with the locations of some water pumping stations. The monitored LOS time series histories along an ascending orbit showed a close correlation with the rainfall during the investigation period. Comparative analysis of this uneven prominent subsidence with geological and precipitation data reflected that the subsidence in the Abbottabad city was mainly related to anthropogenic activities, overexploitation of water, and consolidation of soil layer. The study represents the first ever evidence of land subsidence and its causes in the region that will support the local government as well as decision and policy makers for better planning to overcome problems of overflowing drains, sewage system, littered roads/streets, and sinking land in the city. © 2020 by the authors.

Conventionally, PS pixels are selected based on the estimated noise present in the spatially uncorrelated phase component along with look-angle error in a temporal interferometric stack. In this study, two deep learning architectures, namely convolutional neural network for interferometric semantic segmentation (CNN-ISS) and convolutional long short term memory network for interferometric semantic segmentation (CLSTM-ISS), based on learning spatial and spatio-temporal behaviour, respectively, were proposed for selection of PS pixels. These networks were trained to relate the interferometric phase history to its classification into phase stable (PS pixels) and phase unstable (non-PS pixels) measurement pixels using ~10,000 real world interferometric patch images of different study sites containing man-made objects, forests, vegetation, uncropped land, water bodies, and areas affected by lengthening, foreshortening, layover and shadowing. The networks were trained using training labels obtained from the Stanford method for Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (StaMPS) algorithm. However, pixel selection results, evaluated using a combination of R-index, Similar Time Series Interferometric Pixel (STIP) maps and a classified image of the test dataset, reveal that CLSTM-ISS estimates improved the classification of PS and non-PS pixels as compared to those of StaMPS and CNN-ISS. The predicted results show that CLSTM-ISS reached an accuracy of 93.50%, higher than that of CNN-ISS (89.21%). CLSTM-ISS also improved the density of reliable PS pixels compared to StaMPS and CNN-ISS.

However, a drawback to this approach is that it is limited to displacement along the radar line-of-sight direction. An accurate understanding of land subsidence requires estimation of 3D displacement. One solution is to combine observations from multiple sources and directions, such as multi-Temporal SAR images acquired on ascending and descending orbits, with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data. While this approach estimates 3D displacement, other methods do not account for differences in data accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for estimating 3D land subsidence from multi-Temporal SAR images and GNSS data by using the weighted least squares method. The weights for data sources are calculated from the PSI results and GNSS data. We apply the method to Kansai International Airport, using 13 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ascending images from 2014 to 2018 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 descending images from 2015 to 2018. Root mean squared errors in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions are 6, 13, and 10 mm/year, respectively.

However, it is clearly demonstrated that combining images from different sources improves results in remote-sensing applications, it still remains a challenge to make full use of their benefits. These challenges become complicate, extending to multitemporal analysis and very high resolution (VHR) images, which includes different acquisition conditions, and consequently radiometric and geometric differences between images. To design methods that are robust to data set shifts, recent remote-sensing literature has considered solutions based on domain adaptation (DA) approaches. In this research, we aim to propose a method based on autoencoder which is a DA method to achieve fused features of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical to benefit from their complementary information, and simultaneously aligning multitemporal features by reduction in spectral and radiometric differences and make multitemporal features more similar for better accuracy in change detection (CD). In continuation, to cope with the problem of detecting changes using VHR images, we introduce a framework to obtain the change map, in which, the differences caused by the registration error as well as the geometric differences of VHR images will be minimized, by maximum use of spatial information of images. For these purposes, a multitemporal pair of co-registered images, each composed of optical multispectral channels and a SAR amplitude channel acquired over the same urban area before and after changes, is assumed. Finally, the strategy of detecting changes resulted in improvement compared to common and simpler methods and also individual sensor CD method, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image registration; Imaging techniques; Radar imaging; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Geometric difference; Multi-temporal analysis; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Remote sensing applications; Spatial informations; Temporal resolution; Unsupervised change detection; Very high resolution (VHR) image; accuracy assessment; data acquisition; detection method; error analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078051428"

Recently, deep learning based algorithms and cloud computing infrastructure have become available with a great potential to revolutionize the processing of EO data. This paper aims to present a novel EO-based soil monitoring approach leveraging open-access Copernicus Sentinel data and Google Earth Engine platform. Building on key results from existing data mining approaches to extract bare soil reflectance values the current study delivers valuable insights on the synergistic use of open access optical and radar images. The proposed framework is driven by the need to eliminate the influence of ambient factors and evaluate the efficiency of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively combine the complimentary information contained in the pool of both optical and radar spectral information and those form auxiliary geographical coordinates mainly for soil. We developed and calibrated our multi-input CNN model based on soil samples (calibration = 80% and validation 20%) of the LUCAS database and then applied this approach to predict soil clay content. A promising prediction performance (R2 = 0.60, ratio of performance to the interquartile range (RPIQ) = 2.02, n = 6136) was achieved by the inclusion of both types (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and laboratory visible near infrared-short wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) multispectral) of observations using the CNN model, demonstrating an improvement of more than 5.5% in RMSE using the multi-year median optical composite and current state-of-the-art non linear machine learning methods such as random forest (RF; R2 = 0.55, RPIQ = 1.91, n = 6136) and artificial neural network (ANN; R2 = 0.44, RPIQ = 1.71, n = 6136). Moreover, we examined post-hoc techniques to interpret the CNN model and thus acquire an understanding of the relationships between spectral information and the soil target identified by the model. Looking to the future, the proposed approach can be adopted on the forthcoming hyperspectral orbital sensors to expand the current capabilities of the EO component by estimating more soil attributes with higher predictive performance. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Data mining; Decision trees; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Learning systems; Orbits; Reflection; Soils; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Cloud computing infrastructures; Geographical coordinates; Inter quartile ranges; Learning-based algorithms; Prediction performance; Predictive performance; Spatial characteristics; Visible near-infrared; Radar imaging","Copernicus data; Deep learning; Earth observation; Hyper and multi spectral remote sensing; SAR data; Soil texture mapping; Spectral signatures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085257255"

Stokes parameters, which is proposed on the dichotomy principle of electromagnetic wave, describe the changes of the incident electromagnetic wave affected by objects which are radiated by electromagnetic wave, and then obtain the information from the objects. However, to our best knowledge, few reports focus on crop phenology monitoring using Stokes parameters. This study aims to explore the feasibility of Stokes related parameters for crop growth monitoring. In this paper, Stokes parameters and their subparameters are calculated based on assumption of wave transmitted in horizontal and received in both horizontal and vertical polarization. Then these Stokes parameters are derived from 5 multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images and averaged relying on each oilseed rape field area. The correlation between all of the Stokes parameters and oilseed rape growth parameters including above ground biomass (AGB), height and leaf area index (LAI) are computed by Pearson product moment correlation coefficient. The significance of these Stokes parameters for oilseed rape AGB, height and LAI inversion are derived from random forest (RF) model. The results indicate the potential of Stokes parameter for crop growth monitoring and growth parameters inversion. It demonstrates that scattering power related Stokes parameters reveal better performance for crop AGB inversion, but scattering mechanism related Stokes parameters such as degree of polarization (m), the degree of linear polarization (m_l) and the ratio of linear polarization (μ_l) are more sensitive to crop height and LAI. Moreover, the results suggest that it is necessary to analyze the influence of crop structure on scattering power when crop growth parameters inversion is performed with Stokes parameters. © 2020, Research and Development Office of Wuhan University.

Parameterised classification with multi-temporal features derived from regularly acquired, C-band, VV and VH polarized Sentinel-1A SAR imagery was used for mapping rice area. A fully automated processing chain in MAPscape-Rice software was used to convert the multi-temporal SAR data into terrain-geocoded s° values, which included strip mosaicking, co-registration of images acquired with the same observation geometry and mode, time-series speckle filtering, terrain geocoding, radiometric calibration and normalization. Further Anisotropic non-linear diffusion (ANLD) filtering was done to smoothen homogeneous targets, while enhancing the difference between neighbouring areas. Multi-Temporal Features viz., max, min, mean, max date, min date and span ratio were extracted from VV and VH polarizations to classify rice pixels. Rice detection was based on the analysis of temporal signature from SAR backscatter in relation to crop stages. About sixty images across four footprints covering 16 samba (Rabi) rice growing districts of Tamil Nadu, India were obtained between August 2017 and January2018. In-season site visits were conducted across 280 monitoring locations in the footprints for classification purposes and more than 1665 field observations were made for accuracy assessment. A total rice area of 1.07 million ha was mapped with classification accuracy from 90.3 to 94.2 per cent with Kappa values ranging from 0.81 to 0.88. Using ORYZA2000, a weather driven process based crop growth simulation model developed by IRRI, yield estimates were made by integrating remote sensing products viz., seasonal rice area, start of season and backscatter time series. By generating average backscatter for each time series and dB stack for each SoS, LAI values were estimated. The model has generated rice yield estimate for each hectare which were aggregated at administrative boundary level and compared against CCE yield. Yield Simulation accuracy of more than 86-91% at district level and 82-97% at block level from the study indicates the suitability of these products for policy decisions. SAR products and yield information were used to meet the requirements of PMFBY crop insurance scheme in Tamil Nadu and helped in identifying or invoking prevented/failed sowing in 529 villages and total crop failure in 821 villages. In total 303703 farmers were benefitted by this technology in getting payouts of INR 9.94 billion through crop insurance. The satellite technology as an operational service has helped in getting quicker payouts. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

However, its application to very slow rock slope deformations in alpine environments (displacement rates < 5 cm/year) remains challenging, mainly due to low signal to noise ratio, atmospheric disturbances, snow cover effects, and complexities resulting from heterogeneous displacement in space and time. Here we combine SqueeSARTM data, targeted multi-temporal baseline DInSAR, GPS data, and detailed field morpho-structural mapping, to unravel the kinematics, internal segmentation, and style of activity of the Mt. Mater deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) in Valle Spluga (Italy). We retrieve slope kinematics by performing 2D decomposition (2D InSAR) of SqueeSARTM products derived from Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits. To achieve a spatially-distributed characterization of DSGSD displacement patterns and activity, we process Sentinel-1 A/B images (2016-2019) with increasing temporal baselines (ranging from 24-days to 1-year) and generate several multi-temporal interferograms. Unwrapped displacement maps are validated using ground-based GPS data. Interferograms derived with different temporal baselines reveal a strong kinematic and morpho-structural heterogeneity and outline nested rockslides and active sectors, that arise from the background displacement signal of the main DSGSD. Seasonal interferograms, supported by GPS displacement measurements, reveal non-linear displacement trends suggesting a complex response of different slope sectors to rainfall and snowmelt. Our analyses clearly outline a composite slope instability with different nested sectors possibly undergoing different evolutionary trends towards failure. The results herein outline the potential of a targeted use of DInSAR for the detailed investigation of very slow rock slope deformations in different geological and geomorphological settings. © 2020 by the author.","Deformation; Interferometry; Kinematics; Landslides; Signal to noise ratio; Snow; Space applications; Synthetic aperture radar; Atmospheric disturbance; Displacement patterns; Displacement signals; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Radar interferometry; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; Structural heterogeneity; Structural mapping; Global positioning system","Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation; DInSAR processing; GPS; Heterogeneity; Kinematics; Landslide activity; Slow rock-slope deformation; SqueeSAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084589593"

Nowadays, the interferometric approach is more and more used for wide-areas analysis, providing useful information for risk management actors but at the same time requiring a lot of efforts to correctly interpret what satellite data are telling us. In this context, hot-spot-like analyses that select and highlight the fastest moving areas in a region of interest, are a good operative solution for reducing the time needed to inspect a whole interferometric dataset composed by thousands or millions of points. In this work, we go beyond the concept of MTInSAR data as simple mapping tools by proposing an approach whose final goal is the quantification of the potential loss experienced by an element at risk hit by a potential landslide. To do so, it is mandatory to evaluate landslide intensity. Here, we estimate intensity using Active Deformation Areas (ADA) extracted from Sentinel-1 MTInSAR data. Depending on the localization of each ADA with respect to the urban areas, intensity is derived in two different ways. Once exposure and vulnerability of the elements at risk are estimated, the potential loss due to a landslide of a given intensity is calculated. We tested our methodology in the Eastern Valle d'Aosta (north-western Italy), along four lateral valleys of the Dora Baltea Valley. This territory is characterized by steep slopes and by numerous active and dormant landslides. The goal of this work is to develop a regional scale methodology based on satellite radar interferometry to assess the potential impact of landslides on the urban fabric. © 2019 The Authors","Italy; Valle d'Aosta; landslide; mapping method; mountain environment; mountain region; radar interferometry; satellite data; Sentinel; slope; synthetic aperture radar; urban area","Landslide intensity; Mountainous region; Potential loss; Satellite interferometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081888693"

The method of log-cumulants (MoLC) is a reliable alternative for parameter estimation of SAR data models and image processing. However, numerical methods are usually applied to estimate parameters using MoLC, and it may lead to a high computational cost. Thus, MoLC may be unsuitable for real-time SAR imagery applications such as change detection and marine search and rescue, for example. Our paper introduces a fast approach to overcome this limitation of MoLC, focusing on parameter estimation of single-channel SAR data modeled by the GI0 distribution. Experiments with simulated and real SAR data demonstrate that our approach performs faster than MoLC, while the precision of the estimation is comparable with that of the original MoLC. We tested the fast approach with multitemporal data and applied the arithmetic-geometric distance to real SAR images for change detection on the ocean. The experiments showed that the fast MoLC outperformed the original estimation method with regard to the computational time.  © 2020 IEEE.","Image processing; Marine applications; Numerical methods; Parameter estimation; Probability density function; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Computational costs; Estimation methods; Geometric distances; Method of log cumulants (MoLC); Multi-temporal data; SAR image processing; Statistical modeling; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","change detection; log-cumulants; parameter estimator; SAR image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091661909"

The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1 SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available. Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this development presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans. Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time. Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 ± 2.8% (95% c.i.) over Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6% and 9.8% over flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly, Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of 98.5% in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Greece; Houston County [Texas]; Madagascar; Texas; Thessaly; United States; Cloud computing; Emergency services; Engines; Floods; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Open Data; Radar imaging; Risk management; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Class probabilities; Cloud computing platforms; Emergency management; European Space Agency; Flood disaster; Sentinel-1; Very high resolution; Very high spatial resolutions; flood frequency; hazard assessment; hazard management; Landsat; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; synthetic aperture radar; Space-based radar","Cloud computing; Flood disasters; SAR; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078660849"

Crop biophysical parameters were measured in the field for both healthy and lodged plots from March to June 2018 in a study site in Ferrara, Italy, and the corresponding Sentinel images were downloaded and processed. The lodged plots were further categorised into different lodging severity classes (moderate, severe and very severe). Temporal profiles of backscatter, coherence, reflectance and continuum removed spectra were studied for healthy and lodging severity classes throughout the stem elongation to ripening growth stages. The Kruskal Wallis and posthoc Tukey tests were used to test for significant differences between different classes. Our results for Sentinel-2 showed that red edge (740 nm) and NIR (865 nm) bands could best distinguish healthy from lodged wheat (particularly healthy and very severe). For Sentinel-1, the analysis revealed the potential of VH backscatter and the complementarity of VV and VH/VV backscatter in distinguishing a maximum number of classes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Sentinel data for near real-time detection of the incidence and severity of lodging in wheat. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has contributed to this application. © 2020 The Authors","Italy; Triticum aestivum; Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Crops; Damage detection; Reflection; Remote sensing; Lodging severity; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Sustainable agriculture; Wheat; alternative energy; backscatter; biomechanics; remote sensing; ripening; Sentinel; spectral reflectance; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; wheat; Time series analysis","Lodging severity; Remote sensing; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Sustainable agriculture; Wheat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082999547"

Preservation of the cultural heritage and mitigating potential risks on invaluable artifacts or objectives is key to conserving the identity of present and future generations. Our complex project is dedicated to monitoring, conservation, protection and promotion of the Romanian cultural heritage. It addresses the challenge of better safeguarding the cultural heritage by developing a multidisciplinary approach. The combined use of Synthetic Aperture Radar and multispectral satellite imagery represent a non-invasive investigation instrument that enable multitemporal analysis, contributing with valuable insights regarding cultural heritage sites. Remote sensing techniques were used to generate geospatial products such as displacement maps, urban sprawl evolution maps, urban heat island maps and many more. For protecting important artifacts, innovative recipes based on nanotechnologies were developed. In order to promote these artifacts, 3D photorealistic models were created using 3D reconstruction technology. For selected cultural heritage objectives, an integrated LiDAR aerial mapping system has enabled the creation of a high accuracy 3D model.

This study demonstrated an effective flood mapping framework using freely available multi-temporal Earth Observation (EO) images, including C-band Sentinel-1A & 1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and optical WorldView-3 images, for analyzing the 2018 flood event of Kerala, India. Two Change Detection (CD) techniques, i.e. Ratio Index (RI) and Normalized Change Index (NCI) combined with semi-automatic thresholding are implemented on temporal descending pass SAR images for flood identification. For ascending pass SAR images, the statistical-based thresholding method is implemented. The results indicate that combined use of ascending and descending pass SAR images contributed to a better understanding of flood conditions. It is also inferred that the use of a pre-flood image can enhance flood area estimation and helps in minimizing the overestimation errors. The results also found that NCI outperforms RI for Kerala flood event.

The project utilizes freely available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from Sentinel-1A (C-band, vv and vh polarization SAR with 20 m spatial resolution and 12 days temporal resolution) and Sentinel-2 (multispectral optical data with 10 m spatial resolution and 5 days temporal resolution) from the Copernicus Programme of European Space Agency (ESA), and LANDSAT-8 (multispectral optical data with 30 m spatial resolution and 16 days temporal resolution) from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for rice area and start of season estimation and ORYZA crop growth model for yield estimation. MAPscape-RICE, a fully automated software for generation of rice area, start of season, and leaf area index (LAI) estimates from multi-temporal SAR and optical data was used in conjunction with Rice-YES, a software linking remote sensing derived information with ORYZA crop growth model. The project started in two districts (Nellore and West Godavari) in 2016/17 Rabi (dry) season, followed by expansion of monitoring activities to four districts (East Godavari, West Godavari, Guntur, and Krishna) in 2017 Kharif (rainy) season, and to seven districts (East Godavari, West Godavari, Nellore, Chitoor, Kadapa, Prakasam, and Kurnool) in 2017/18 Rabi season, and to the entire 13 districts of Andhra Pradesh by 2018 Kharif season. The project involved a rigorous rice classification validation exercise through physical field verification visits to ensure rice area products at district, block, and village granularity were at acceptable accuracy of 85% or more. Rice area and yield estimates were also compared against values obtained from government source. Mitigating rice farmers' production loss thru implementation of crop insurance is a key area of use case of this Satellite based rice monitoring system with the goal of timely rice production provision to be used by crop insurance companies to validate farmer's claims for insurance payouts in case of loss triggered by drought, floods, or cyclones. This study demonstrates the utility of remote sensing and crop modeling technologies to support the government of Andhra Pradesh, India in near-real time rice production monitoring and conducting damage assessment in case of unfavorable climate events such as drought, floods, or cyclones affecting small-holder rice farmers. Likewise, it demonstrates the importance of regular and timely rice area monitoring and pre-harvest yield forecast as critical requirements to prepare for extreme climate events with a case study involving damage assessment from cyclone Titli that affected rice production in Srikakulam district during 2018 Kharif season. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

In fact, it requires to simultaneously consider several time series of polarimetric features to understand the physical changes of a target and its temporal evolution. In an effort to characterize the changes over time, multitemporal polarimetric SAR (MTPolSAR) change detection was introduced in the literature. However, existing methods either only exploit intensity of changes or the resulting changed scattering mechanisms are not guaranteed to represent physical changes of the target. This article presents a variation in a previously published change detector based on the difference of covariance matrices that characterize the polarimetric information, allowing for an intuitive representation and characterization of physical changes of a target and its dynamics. We show the results of this method for monitoring growth stages of rice crops and present a novel application of the method for crop type mapping from MT-PolSAR data. We compare its performance with a neural network based classifier that uses time series of PolSAR features derived from a target covariance matrix decomposition as input. Experimental results show that the classification performance of the proposed method and the baseline method are comparable with differences between the two methods in the overall balanced accuracy and the F1-macro metrics of around 2% and 3%, respectively. The method presented here achieves similar classification performances of a traditional PolSAR data classifier while providing additional advantages in terms of interpretability and insights about the physical changes of a target over time. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Covariance matrix; Polarimeters; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Change detection; Classification performance; Covariance matrices; Crop monitoring; Crop type classification; Multi-temporal; Physical changes; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Time-series analysis; Times series; agricultural production; detection method; image classification; performance assessment; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Crops","Agricultural fields; change detection; change matrix (CM); image classification; SAR polarimetry; target dynamics and evolution; time series encoding","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120045885"

Despite its significance, the complete mapping of the aeolian surface erosion in southern Mongolia remains unresolved because of extensive region of interest cannot be interpreted easily by conventional approaches. Therefore, in this study, we built a mapping scheme to define on going aeolian erosion and applied it over the southern Gobi Desert. The remote sensing approach applied here was based on an interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) time series technique. A number of Sentinel-1 InSAR pairs that generate phase coherences for a certain period were synthesized via the means of principle component analysis to extract the topographic persistence indicative of surface erosion rates. Validation analyses performed through inter-comparisons of phase coherence signals over landmark areas and residuals between global digital elevation models confirmed the reliability of outputs. The results revealed geological lineaments in southern Mongolia confining sandy deposits and the sediment transportation pathways. Apparently, such bounded eolian deposits and transportation mechanisms within geological structures have significantly contributed to dust generation in the Gobi Desert over southern Mongolia.

According to the characteristics of different SAR image modes, the input SAR images were pre-processed firstly, and then the matrix decomposition of the SAR images and the iterative solution of the optimal matrix were implemented based on RNMU. To verify the effect of application of integrated SAR image on land cover classification, taking Da'an City in Jilin Province as an example, RNMU was used for the fusion of multi-temporal VV/VH dual-polarization Sentinle-1 SAR image and HH/HV dual-polarization GF-3 data.

Soil behind the collapsed piling wall slipped inside the excavation site dragging seven cars parked on one side of the road running parallel to the piling wall and affecting some residential buildings located on the opposite side of the road. Fortunately, no injuries were counted but the 22 families living in the buildings next to the damaged wall were evacuated. Following the piling wall collapse, the Civil Protection of Rome, thanks to the technical support of the Research Centre on Geological Risks (CERI) of the Sapienza University of Rome, started a continuous monitoring of the affected area through remote sensing techniques. In the first hours following the collapse, a Terrestrial Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometer (TInSAR) and a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) were installed with the aim to control the evolution of the process, to support the local authority to manage the associated residual risk, and to ensure the safety of workers during emergency operations. In this paper we discuss some of the results obtained by the monitoring of the involved area. Thanks to the comparisons between different surveys and the reconstruction of the pre-event geometries, the total volume involved in the failure was estimated around 850 m3. In addition, through the analysis of data acquired by the 18 multi-temporal TLS scans and the three and a half months of continuous TInSAR monitoring, the movement involving a portion of the filling material used for stabilization works was observed and described.

However, both conventional D-InSAR (differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry) and MT-InSAR (multi-temporal InSAR) can only measure the displacement component along the radar LOS (line of sight) direction, which greatly limits the application of InSAR technique. Over the past decades, great endeavors have been made to overcome its limitation of the one-dimensional LOS measurements, and several methods have been proposed to retrieve complete three-dimensional displacement components from InSAR measurements. On the whole, the commonality of the existing methods is characterized by using both ascending and descending SAR data. In this paper, we put forward an approach for retrieving complete three-dimensional ground displacement components from two parallel-track InSAR measurements and present the analytical expressions for the vertical, the North–South, the East–West displacement components. It reveals that the vertical displacement component is just a function of the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements, i.e., the vertical displacement component can be retrieved from the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements, while the North–South or the East–West displacement component is a function of both the two parallel-track InSAR LOS displacements and the azimuthal displacement. What is more, the proposed approach can effectively improve the accuracy of the azimuthal measurement by using a redundant measurement. As a result, the accuracies of the derived North–South and East–West displacement components are improved as well, which can provide more reliable results for characterizing ground movement associated with geological hazards. In terms of their geographic coverage, there is a strong complementary relationship between the proposed approach and the existing methods. Thus, they can be integratedly utilized in the practical applications. Finally, the approach is illustrated through the retrieval of the complete three-dimensional co-seismic displacement components in an area to the west of Bam, Iran, where a strong earthquake occurred in 2003. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bam; Iran; Kerman [Iran]; coseismic process; displacement; earthquake event; geological hazard; radar; synthetic aperture radar","InSAR; Line of sight; Multi-aperture InSAR; Offset-tracking; Three-dimensional ground displacement components","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096229661"

Wetland maps are essential for the conservation and management of terrestrial ecosystems. This study is to obtain an accurate wetland map using an object-based stacked generalization (Stacking) method on the basis of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. Firstly, the Robust Adaptive Spatial Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) is used to get time series Sentinel-2 NDVI, from which the vegetation phenology variables are derived by the threshold method. Subsequently, both vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizontal receive (VH) polarization backscatters (σ0 VV, σ0 VH) are obtained using the time series Sentinel-1 images. Speckle noise inherent in SAR data, resulting in over-segmentation or under-segmentation, can affect image segmentation and degrade the accuracies of wetland classification. Therefore, we segment Sentinel-2 multispectral images to delineate meaningful objects in this study. Then, in order to reduce data redundancy and computation time, we analyze the optimal feature combination using the Sentinel-2 multispectral images, Sentinel-2 NDVI time series, phenological variables and other vegetation index derived from Sentinel-2 multispectral images, as well as time series Sentinel-1 backscatters at the object level. Finally, the stacked generalization algorithm is utilized to extract the wetland information based on the optimal feature combination in the Dongting Lake wetland. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the object-based stacked generalization method are 92.46% and 0.92, which are 3.88% and 0.04 higher than that using the pixel-based method. Moreover, the object-based stacked generalization algorithm is superior to single classifiers in classifying vegetation of high heterogeneity areas. © 2020 The Authors","algorithm; image classification; mapping; optical method; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; wetland","Classification; Multi-Temporal; Object-Based; Sentinel-1/2; Stacked generalization; Wetland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120703255"

To this end an automatic and unsupervised coastline detection method is proposed. First, we apply a temporal averaging filter that allows encapsulating the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g. due to tides or vegetation, and at the same time it allows reducing the speckle, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land classes we employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes by a bimodal distribution. The latter is then segmented by a thresholding and region-growing procedure to separate the sea and land classes. The proposed method is applied to two different SAR time-series, each one acquired throughout one year. The extracted yearly coastlines are then analyzed in order to identify spatio-temporal changes.

In the study, the potential of repeat-pass high resolution PAZ images were investigated. To this aim, both linear backscatter and interferometric results were presented. We used multi-temporal X-band (3.1 cm wavelength) new generation single look complex (SLC) data from Spanish PAZ in single polarization data. PAZ is based on TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X platform to establish a constellation with them to shorten the revisit time and increase data acquisition capacity. We applied two analysis on PAZ data to assess the performance of the satellite images. For the analysis a semi-arid and almost flat region of Central Anatolia was selected. The images are acquired in both ascending and descending orbits. Each pair has 33 days of temporal baselines. Firstly, backscatter analysis was conducted over the region for different land cover classes. Secondly interferometric analysis was applied to determine phase difference and coherence features. As the region has sand dunes, bareland and uncultivated agricultural fields the coherence analysis showed high values, while cultivated fields showed variations of coherence due to different growth of vegetation. Since the region is prone to sinkhole formation the high-resolution PAZ indicated its advantage as determining a sinkhole that has a circle shape. The displacement of ground surface is determined in line of sight direction. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Data acquisition; Interferometry; Orbits; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Agricultural fields; Coherence analysis; Phase difference; Satellite images; Single polarization; Single-look complex datum; Sinkhole formation; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","Coherence; PAZ; Repeat-pass InSAR; SAR; Subsidence","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091181800"

However, most change detection approaches can only detect the intensity or type of change. The aim of this study is to dig for more change information from time-series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, such as the change frequency and the change moments. This paper proposes a novel multitemporal building change detection framework that can generate change frequency map (CFM) and change moment maps (CMMs) from multitemporal SAR images. We first give definitions of CFM and CMMs. Then we generate change feature using four proposed generators. After that, a new cosegmentation method combining raw images and change feature is proposed to divide time-series images into changed and unchanged areas separately. Secondly, the proposed cosegmentation and the morphological building index (MBI) are combined to extract changed building objects. Then, the logical conjunction between the cosegmentation results and the binarized MBI is performed to recognize every moment of change. In the post-processing step, we use fragment removal to increase accuracy. Finally, we propose a novel accuracy assessment index for CFM. We call this index average change difference (ACD). Compared to the traditional multitemporal change detection methods, our method outperforms other approaches in terms of both qualitative results and quantitative indices of ACD using two TerraSAR-X datasets. The experiments show that the proposed method is effective in generating CFM and CMMs. © 2021 by the authors.

The potential of CD has been shown in different fields, including disaster monitoring and military applications. Access to multi-temporal SAR images of the same scene is now possible, and therefore we can improve the performance and the interpretation of CD. Apart from specific SAR campaign measurements, the ground truth of the scene is usually unknown or only partially known when dealing with open data. This is a critical issue when the purpose is to detect targets, such as vehicles or ships. Indeed, typical change detection methods can only provide relative changes; the actual number of targets on each day cannot be determined. Ideally, this change detection should occur between a target-free image and one with the objects of interest. To do so, we propose to benefit from pixels' intrinsic temporal behavior to compute a frozen background reference (FBR) image and perform change detection from this reference image. We will then consider that the scene consists only of immobile objects (e.g., buildings and trees) and removable objects that can appear and disappear from acquisition to another (e.g., cars and ships). Our FBR images will, therefore, aim to estimate the immobile background of the scene to obtain, after change detection, the exact amount of targets present on each day. This study was conducted first with simulated SAR data for different number of acquisition dates and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). We presented an application in the region of Singapore to estimate the number of ships in the study area for each acquisition. © 2020 by the authors.","Image enhancement; Military applications; Object detection; Open Data; Ships; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Background references; Change detection; Critical issues; Disaster monitoring; Ground truth; Multi-temporal SAR images; Reference image; Temporal behavior; Radar imaging","Change detection; SAR; Target detection; Time-series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086461134"

The ecosystem services provided by a wetland are largely dependent on its hydrological dynamics. Constant monitoring of the spatial extent of water surfaces and the duration of flooding of a wetland is necessary to understand the impact of drought on the ecosystem services a wetland provides. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the potential to reveal wetland dynamics. Multitemporal SAR image analysis for wetland monitoring has been extensively studied based on the advances of modern SAR missions. Unfortunately, most previous studies utilized monopath SAR images, which result in limited success. Tracking changes in individual wetlands remains a challenging task because several environmental factors, such as wind-roughened water, degrade image quality. In general, the data acquisition frequency is an important factor in time series analysis. We propose a Gaussian process-based temporal interpolation (GPTI) method that enables the synergistic use of SAR images taken from multiple paths. The proposed model is applied to a series of Sentinel-1 images capturing wetlands in Okanogan County, Washington State. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the multiple path analysis based on the proposed method can extract seasonal changes more accurately than a single path analysis. © 2020 by the authors.","Data acquisition; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Flood control; Floods; Food storage; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Image processing; Interpolation; Regression analysis; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Wetlands; Ecosystem services; Environmental factors; Experimental analysis; Gaussian Processes; Multi-temporal SAR images; Seasonal changes; Temporal interpolation; Washington State; Radar imaging","Drought; Gaussian process; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Wetlands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086469542"

In recent years, successive large-scale landslide hazards such as Maoxian landslide, Baige landslide, and Shuicheng landslide have shown that the occurrence of catastrophic landslide events is not only related to the conditions that are prone to breeding geological hazards in the area, but also connecting with the failure in accurately identifying and monitoring the development of landslide disasters. Based on active microwave remote sensing imaging, the InSAR technology was utilized to identify of active geological disasters in Meili Snow Mountain sections of the Lantsang River, where traditional ground-based geological disaster survey methods and optical remote sensing technology were limited. Multi-source remote sensing data was used, including SAR images and multi-temporal traditional optical remote sensing images. By using PALSAR-1/2 and Sentinel-1 data of ascending and descending orbits, the earth observations of multiple periods, multiple angles, multiple wavelengths and spatial resolutions were carried out. Combined with the calculation results of D-InSAR, IPTA-InSAR and Stacking, Human-computer interaction, visual interpretation, the testing data was verified comparing with the multi-temporal optical remote sensing data and three-dimensional topography collected from Google Earth. Ground verification for typical landslide disasters was conducted and its stability was analyzed by using InSAR calculation results. The results of this work are as follows: 1) A total of 92 landslide geological hazards were identified, of which 76 landslide geological hazards in the Lantsang valley section accounted for 82.6% of the total interpretation; 5 Lantsang tributaries were interpreted, and Deqin County surrounding areas interpreted 11 landslides. There were 26 landslides with a floor area greater than 200000 square meters, accounting for 28.3% of the total interpretated ones. The Permian and Triassic weak strata in the Lantsang valley area are distributed along the valley. Coupled with the influence of multiple factors such as topography, rainfall, and reservoir storage, there were many large and fast-moving landslide disasters along the valley. 2) The Meilishui landslide was a typical high-level deformation landslide in the river valley. The rapid deformation area was located at a high altitude and had a large potential energy. Many similar high-level deformation activities have been found in the river valley. 3) The Yagong landslide has always been deformed during the data observation period (2007—2019), and the scale was huge. The developed secondary landslide had a faster deformation rate, and the front edge of the landslide had serious deformation and damage, with a deformation rate of 7~11 cm/a, threatening the safety of residents and cultivated land on the platform in the middle of the landslide. 4) A total of 11 landslide deformation bodies were identified in the observation range of Deqin County, including two creep-type landslides, i.e., Dingyangding landslide and Guibading landslide, with obvious local deformation phenomena and still in the development stage. 5) Multiple disaster types can be monitored by InSAR technology. Four large debris flow ditches were developed around the county, and the source area and circulation area had different degrees of deformation; the high-altitude area had frequent activities and large deformations of moraines. In addition to the moraine landslide formed by the interaction of ice and snow, many high mountain slopes were severely weathered and broken, and there were also strong deformations. The combination of multi-orbit and multi-type SAR data in high mountain areas can effectively compensate for SAR satellite imaging defects and increase the observable area. Combining with multiple InSAR algorithms can take advantages of different SAR data and improve the identification accuracy of active landslides; in the cold, steep, and vegetation-rich mountainous area of the Lantsang, short-wavelength Sentinel-1 data can be used for stacking calculations, which significantly improved the calculation effect. The long-band PALSAR-1/2 data had better adaptability under harsh conditions, and had better performance in the IPTA-InSAR results. Copyright ©2020 Advanced Engineering Sciences.

A fundamental land cover type that needs to be constantly monitored by the climate change community is water, but currently there is a lack of high-resolution water body maps at the global scale. In this article, we present a fully automated procedure for the extraction of fine spatial resolution (10 m) inland water land cover maps for any region of the Earth by means of a relatively simple k-means clustering model applied to multitemporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 SAR sequences. Indeed, due to heavy cloud coverage conditions in many locations, multispectral sensors are not suitable for global water body mapping. For this reason, in this work, we deal only with SAR data, and specifically with multitemporal Sentinel-1 data sequences. The experimental results, obtained for three geographical areas selected because of their wide diversity in terms of geomorphology and climate, show an almost complete consistency with existing datasets, and improve them thanks to their finer spatial details. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Climate change; Climate models; Data mining; Earth (planet); Image resolution; Land use; Mapping; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Inland waters; K-means; Land surface; Multi-temporal; SAR; Sentinel-1; Spatial resolution; Time-series analysis; Water mapping; Waterbodies; Synthetic aperture radar","Climate change; k-means; Sentinel-1; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); time series analysis; water mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119412533"

In this article, three kinds of deep learning applications - data augmentation, semisupervised classification, and domain-adapted architecture - were tested in an effort to overcome the limitation of insufficient labeled data. Among the diverse tasks that can be used for classification, rice paddy detection in South Korea was performed for its ability to fully utilize the advantages of deep learning and high spatiotemporal image resolution. In the process of designing each application, the domain knowledge of remote sensing and rice phenology was integrated. Then, all possible combinations of the three applications were examined and evaluated with pixel-based comparisons in various environments and city-level comparisons using national statistics. The results of this article indicated that all combinations of the applications can contribute to increase classification performance, even though the uncertainty involved in imitating or utilizing unlabeled data remains. As the effectiveness of the proposed applications was experimentally confirmed, enhancement in the applicability of deep learning was expected in various remote sensing areas.

The synergistic use of multi-temporal polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and available multispectral remote sensing data can reduce the temporal gaps and provide the spectral and polarimetric information of the crops, which is effective for crop classification in areas with frequent cloud interference. The main objectives of this study are to develop a deep learning model to map agricultural areas using multi-temporal full polarimetric SAR and multi-spectral remote sensing data, and to evaluate the influence of different input features on the performance of deep learning methods in crop classification.

The Pauli decomposition and coherency matrix gave similar overall accuracy (OA) for Conv1D when fused with the VENμS data by the MNF transformation (OA = 96.65 ± 1.03% and 96.72 ± 0.77%). The MNF transformation improved the OA and F-score for most classes when Conv1D was used.

Recently, Deep learning (DL) paved the road to implement various reliable change detection approaches that overcome traditional CD methods limitation. However, high performance DL based approaches have explosion number of parameters that demanded extensive computation and memory usage in addition to large volumes of training data. To address this issue, we proposed a teacher-student setting for remote sensing imagery change detection. To distill the knowledge from the over-parameterized Siamese teacher network, we proposed tiny student network that was trained using the obtained categorical distribution of probability from the teacher paired Softmax output at high temperature. Practical Swarm Optimization (PSO) was applied in order to optimally configure student architecture. Finally, ample experiments were conducted on LEVIR-CD dataset. Also, we introduced EGSAR-CD dataset, which contains of a large set of bi-temporal SAR images with 460 image pairs ( 256 times 256 ). Experiment results indicate that we can reach up to 5.4times reduction rate in number of parameters with loss of accuracy between 5% and 6% on the LEVIR-CD and EGSAR-CD datasets utilizing self-knowledge distillation. © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; Distillation; Large dataset; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Probability distributions; Students; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; High temperature; Loss of accuracy; Multi-temporal image; Reduction rate; Remote sensing imagery; Student network; Swarm optimization; Remote sensing","Change detection (CD); deep learning (DL); knowledge distillation (KD); practical swarm optimization (PSO); Siamese network; teacher-student setting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112239771"

As a result, deforestation has catastrophic consequences for the environment, including the loss of biodiversity, disruption of clean water supplies, and the acceleration of climate change. According to statistics, the deforestation trend in developing countries is at an alarming rate including Malaysia where plantation activities are the primary cause of forest loss. Recent anecdotal studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based (DL) approach in producing deforestation maps. However, there are limited studies concentrating on DL approach for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging due to complexity of the computational concepts of the method. The SAR imagery can be challenging to interpret but its all-weather and all-day capability can be critical in forest monitoring compared to optical imagery. Thus, in this study, we propose to map deforestation areas in Permanent Forest Reserve (HSK) using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data. Deep learning-based U-Net was employed to classify the SAR imagery as forest and non-forest due to its semantic segmentation capabilities. The experiment results showed that the proposed deep learning-based technique successfully achieved 0.993 of intersection over union (IoU) and 0.980 of overall accuracy (OA). Also, we explained the entire procedure from beginning to end as simple as possible for beginners to comprehend. In brief, the findings of this study have the potential to improve monitoring of damaged HSK areas, prioritize the restoration of the affected forest areas and protecting the forest lands from illegal deforestation activities. © 2021.

Studying the characteristics of the seismogenic fault is of great significance for understanding the regional tectonic. Due to the small magnitude of this earthquake, the interferometric deformation field acquired by a single interferometric pair was affected by large phase noise, especially atmospheric noise. In order to solve this problem, this study applied the multi-temporal interferograms generated by the time series Sentinel-1A SAR imagery. The co-seismic deformation field of this series earthquake was reconstructed by a temporal averaging method. We applied a geodetic inversion based on interferometric displacement map and elastic dislocation models. The slip distribution on seismogenic fault plane was estimated. The calculated the strike, dip and rake of the best solution were 188°, 43° and 78°, respectively. The result shows that accumulative displacement was created by normal faulting with some left-lateral strike slip contribution. The slip was mainly distributed between 0 km to 9 km in the depth, and the maximum amount of slip is about 25 cm at the depth of 3 km. The moment magnitude obtained by the inversion was MW5.58. The result of this study showed that the applied temporal averaging solution with spaceborne InSAR data can effectively extract the coseismic deformation field of moderate or small -sized shallow earthquakes. The result implied that this earthquake is closely related to the activity of the Southern Tibet Detachment and Shenzha-Dingjie fault in southern Tibet. © 2020, Science Press.

River characteristics, including water extent, water level/water depth, river discharge, water quality, and ice coverage, are vital to the dynamic monitoring of water resources and protection of eco-hydrological systems. Traditional methods of acquiring river characteristics are to use in situ data that were collected on hydrological gauges, which costs large amount of financial and mate-rial resources. It is urgent to develop a way of supplementing in situ data of rivers quickly and accurately for the increasing demand of river information. With the ability of omnidirectional and multi-temporal Earth observa-tion, remote sensing has greatly improved the efficiency of acquiring river characteristics. It has been applied broadly in multi-scale river monitoring and hydrological simulation in ungauged basins. Therefore, it is neces-sary to summarize recent progresses in the field of remote sensing based river characteristics inversion, in order to further promote the application of remote sensing data and methods in this field. This article, therefore, focusing on remote sensing of river characteristics, summarizes recent progresses systematically on the extraction of water extent, inversion of water level/water depth, estimation of river discharge, and monitoring of water quality and ice coverage. Advantages and disadvantages of applying optical and microwave remote sensors for obtaining water extent and water level/depth are discussed in detail. The advanced data, specific methods, and related emerging technologies in this field are discussed and the following conclusions are made: 1) Newly available remotely sensed data have been making creative breakthroughs in spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and spectral resolution, which dramatically enrich data sources for river studies. 2) Most optical images still face the challenge of mixed pixels, while the application of SAR images is suffering from difficulties in developing complex processing algorithms. Meanwhile, accurate extractions of narrow and non-open waters need further research in the future. 3) The development of big data and cloud computing technologies provide excellent means for monitoring river characteristics at large spatial scales and long temporal scales, with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. © 2020, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

More precisely, in this paper, a WLS method that extends the usability of the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm in regions with medium-to-low coherence is presented. The proposed method relies on the adaptive selection and exploitation, pixel-by-pixel, of the medium-to-high coherent interferograms, such as to discard the noisy phase measurements. In such a way, for each pixel, it is possible to obtain several disjoined sets of interferograms, which are then connected by exploiting the weighted singular value decomposition (WSVD) method. As a consequence, the interferogram networks reduction may lead to rejecting some SAR acquisitions from the used dataset, this results in the generation of so called variable-length displacement time-series.

On July 9, 1956, one of the strongest earthquakes of the 20th century in the area of the South Aegean, occurred in Amorgos, with a magnitude of Mw = 7.7. The objective of this research is to map ground deformation in Amorgos island, using InSAR techniques. We conducted a multi-temporal analysis of all available data from 2003 to 2019 by exploiting historical ENVISAT SAR imagery, as well as the dense archive of Sentinel-1 SLC imagery. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) methods were implemented. Results of both data-sets indicate a small-scale deformation on the island. A multi-track analysis was implemented on Sentinel-1 data to decompose the line of sight velocities to vertical and horizontal. The central south coast is experiencing horizontal movement, while uplift of a maximum value of 5 mm/y is observed in the southeastern coast. The combination of the good spatial coverage achievable via InSAR, with GPS measurements, is suggested an important tool for the seamless monitoring of Amorgos island towards tectonic hazard estimation. © 2020 by the authors.

Several developments in the processing methods and an increase in the availability of SAR data sets from different satellite missions have proven the viability of this technique in the near-real-time assessment of bridges and the health monitoring of transport infrastructure. This research aims to demonstrate the potential of satellite-based remote sensing techniques in developing an innovative health-monitoring method for structural assessment of bridges and the prevention of subsidence damage, using high-resolution SAR data sets and complementary ground-based (GB) non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques. To this purpose, high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) products provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) were acquired and processed. A multitemporal InSAR analysis was developed to identify and monitor the structural displacements of the Rochester Bridge, located in Rochester, Kent, U.K. This bridge is composed by four separate bridge decks carrying the A2 Road, a railway, and a service-bridge carrying service pipes and cable. The outcomes of this study demonstrate how multitemporal InSAR remote sensing techniques can be synergistically applied to complement the traditional GB analyses (e.g., ground penetrating radar, laser scanner, and accelerometers) and information on river bridges (e.g., river levels from monitoring stations). This can provide an extended spatial coverage and an effective identification and monitoring of defects and decays at reduced costs, compared to traditional monitoring techniques. © ASCE.All right reserved.","Bridge decks; Cable stayed bridges; Damage detection; Geological surveys; Ground penetrating radar systems; Interferometry; Monitoring; Pavements; Radar stations; Railroad transportation; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space-based radar; Structural health monitoring; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Ground Penetrating Radar; Health monitoring method; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Non destructive testing; Remote sensing techniques; Structural assessments; Structural displacement; Transport infrastructure; Nondestructive examination","Bridge monitoring, remote sensing; Non-destructive assessment; Transport infrastructures, multi temporal InSAR Interferometry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108075200"

Built structures located on potentially unstable slopes are susceptible to deformations due to the displacement of the ground that at worst can lead to total destruction. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites and processed by multi-temporal interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) techniques can measure centimeter to millimeter-level displacement with weekly to monthly updates, characterizing long-term large-scale behavior of the buildings and slopes. However, the spatial resolution and short wavelength weaken the performance of Sentinel-1 in recognizing features (i.e., single buildings) inside image pixels and maintaining the coherence in mountainous vegetated areas. We have proposed and applied a methodology that combines Sentinel-1 interferometry with ground-based geomatics techniques, i.e., global navigation satellite system (GNSS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and terrestrial structure from motion photogrammetry (SfM), for fully assessing building deformations on a slope located in the north-eastern Italian pre-Alps. GNSS allows verifying the ground deformation estimated by MT-InSAR and provides a reference system for the TLS and SfM measurements, while TLS and SfM allow the behavior of buildings located in the investigated slope to be monitored in great detail. The obtained results show that damaged buildings are located in the most unstable sectors of the slope, but there is no direct relationship between the rate of ground deformation of these sectors and the temporal evolution of damages to a single building, indicating that mass movements cause the displacement of blocks of buildings and each of them reacts differently according to its structural properties. This work shows the capability of MT-InSAR, GNSS, TLS and SfM in monitoring both buildings and geological processes that affect their stability, which plays a key role in geohazard analysis and assessment. © 2021 by the authors.

Such a method is widely used to monitor the time evolution of ground surface changes in areas with large deformations (e.g., due to glaciers movements or seismic episodes), permitting one to discriminate the three-dimensional (up-down, east-west, north-south) components of the Earth's surface displacements. The MAI technique relies on the spectral diversity (SD) method, which consists of splitting the azimuth (range) Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) signal spectrum into separate sub-bands to get an estimate of the surface displacement along the azimuth (sensor line-of-sight (LOS)) direction. Moreover, the SD techniques are also used to correct the atmospheric phase screen (APS) artefacts (e.g., the ionospheric and water vapor phase distortion effects) that corrupt surface displacement time-series obtained by currently available multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) tools. More recently, the SD methods have also been exploited for the fine co-registration of SAR data acquired with the Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) mode. This work is primarily devoted to illustrating the underlying rationale and effectiveness of the MAI and SD techniques as well as their applications. In addition, we present an innovative method to combine complementary information of the ground deformation collected from multi-orbit/multi-track satellite observations. In particular, the presented technique complements the recently developed Minimum Acceleration combination (MinA) method with MAI-driven azimuthal ground deformation measurements to obtain the time-series of the 3-D components of the deformation in areas affected by large deformation episodes. Experimental results encompass several case studies. The validity and relevance of the presented approaches are clearly demonstrated in the context of geospatial analyses. © 2020, by the authors.","Deformation; Interferometry; Orbits; Surface measurement; Time series; Geo-spatial analysis; Ground deformations; Ground displacement; Multiple apertures; SAR interferometry; Satellite observations; Spectral diversity; Surface displacement; Synthetic aperture radar","Along-track/across-track displacement; Atmospheric path delay; Ionosphere; Multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI); SAR interferometry (InSAR); Spectral diversity (SD); TOPS; Water vapour","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084260411"

For the Bhurkunda site (characterized by underground coal mining related subsidence), a network of 56 GNSS points, densified by Total Station (TS) ground points, was set up during three field visits. GNSS derived deformation estimates reveal that the southern part of the investigated area underwent subsidence (maximum displacement 1.813 m). Furthermore, DEM differences of the three epochs generated using TS points detect a subsidence of 1.358±0.057 m with similar pattern and magnitude of movement as detected by GNSS stations. For the Sirobagarh landslide (witnessing recurring slides due to local geological conditions and rainfall), a GNSS network of six control points in an area of 500×600 m2 was established. Deformation estimates from GNSS show subsidence in the area with a horizontal trend of movement towards the Alaknanda river situated below the landslide (maximum horizontal and vertical displacement values are 0.1306 m and 2.1315 m respectively). Further, for the Sirobagarh landslide, multi-temporal interferometry using Sentinel-1 SAR images detect displacement vectors showing downward movement of the landslide, with displacement rates ranging from 0.008 to −0.115 m yr−1. It is evident that the landslide scarp encountered high magnitude subsidence, whereas the area containing and surrounding the landslide (~30 km2) underwent a moderate rate of subsidence. A set of surveying guidelines for monitoring deformation events of similar kind are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Survey Review Ltd.","Alaknanda River; India; Jharkhand; Uttarakhand; coal mine; deformation mechanism; geodetic datum; GNSS; guideline; interferometry; landslide; satellite imagery; Sentinel; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar","3D deformation; Adjustment; Geodetic network; GNSS; Multi-temporal SAR interferometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055134681"

In order to make a step further with respect to previous studies, which investigate multitemporal SAR and optical data or multitemporal/multiscale optical combinations, here, we propose a deep learning framework that simultaneously integrates all these input sources, specifically multitemporal SAR/optical data and fine-scale optical information at their native temporal and spatial resolutions. Our proposal relies on a patch-based multibranch convolutional neural network (CNN) that exploits different per-source encoders to deal with the specificity of the input signals. In addition, we introduce a new self-distillation strategy to boost the per-source analyses and exploit the interplay among the different input sources. This new strategy leverages the final prediction of the multisource framework to guide the learning of the per-source CNN encoders supporting the network to learn from itself. Experiments are carried out on two real-world benchmarks, namely, the Reunion island (a French overseas department) and the Dordogne study site (a southwest department in France), where the annotated reference data were collected under operational constraints (sparsely annotated ground-truth data). Obtained results providing an overall classification accuracy of about 94% (respectively, 88%) on the Reunion island (respectively, the Dordogne) study site highlight the effectiveness of our framework based on CNNs and self-distillation to combine heterogeneous multisensor remote sensing data and confirm the benefit of multimodal analysis for downstream tasks such as land cover mapping. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Distillation; Land use; Landforms; Mapping; Optical data processing; Signal encoding; Synthetic aperture radar; Convolutional neural network; Land use and land cover mapping; Multi sensor; Multi-scales; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal and multi-scale remote sensing; Optical imaging; Remote-sensing; Self-distillation; Sparsely annotated data; Spatial resolution; Temporal scale; artificial neural network; data set; land cover; land use change; mapping method; optical property; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; Remote sensing","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); land use and land cover (LULC) mapping; multisensor; multitemporal and multiscale remote sensing; self-distillation; sparsely annotated data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117349775"

InSAR stack data is composed of multi-temporal homogeneous data, which is regarded as a third-order tensor. The InSAR tensor can be filtered by data fusion, i.e., tensor decomposition, and these filters keep balance in the noise elimination and the fringe details preservation, especially with abrupt fringe change, e.g., the edge of urban structures. However, tensor decomposition based on batch processing cannot deal with few newly acquired interferograms filtering directly. The filtering of dynamic InSAR tensor is the inevitable challenge when processing InSAR stack data, where dynamic InSAR tensor denotes the size of InSAR tensor increases continuously due to the acquisition of new interferograms. Therefore, based on the online CANDECAMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition, we propose an online filter to fuse data and process the dynamic InSAR tensor, named OLCP-InSAR, which performs well especially for the urban area. In this method, CP rank is utilized to measure the tensor sparsity, which can maintain the structural features of the InSAR tensor. Additionally, CP rank estimation is applied as an important step to improve the robustness of Online CP decomposition - InSAR(OLCP-InSAR). Importing CP rank and outlier's position as prior information, the filter fuses the noisy interferograms and decomposes the InSAR tensor to acquire the low rank information, i.e., filtered result. Moreover, this method can not only operate on tensor model, but also efficiently filter the new acquired interferogram as matrix model with the assistance of chosen low rank information. Compared with other tensor-based filters, e.g., high order robust principal component analysis (HoRPCA) and Kronecker-basis-representation multi-pass SAR interferometry (KBR-InSAR), and the widespread traditional filters operating on a single interferometric pair, e.g., Goldstein, non-local synthetic aperture radar (NL-SAR), non-local InSAR (NL-InSAR), and InSAR nonlocal block-matching 3-D (InSAR-BM3D), the effectiveness and robustness of OLCP-InSAR are proved in simulated and real InSAR stack data. Especially, OLCP-InSAR can maintain the fringe details at the regular building top with high noise intensity and high outlier ratio. © 2020 by the authors.","Batch data processing; Data fusion; Data handling; Information filtering; Interferometry; Radar signal processing; Statistics; Tensors; Interferometric SAR; Optimized filtering; Pre-processing step; Robust principal component analysis; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Tensor decomposition; Third-order tensors; Three-dimensional information; Synthetic aperture radar","Data fusion; Multi-pass sar interferometry (InSAR); Online tensor decomposition; Phase filtering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090100557"

The temporal flood depth maps are created with the Floodwater Depth Estimation Tool (FwDET) which requires only two input parameters, viz. flood extent, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Subsequently, flood hotspot zones are also identified. We tested the flood monitoring framework on Amphan cyclone-induced flood event at both regional and local levels. The spatio-temporal flood extent, depth, and hot spot maps are generated for the Amphan cyclone event and a 97% overall accuracy is achieved at the local level. The entire process took less than one hour for regional and local level analysis. © 2021 The Author(s).

Monitoring rice field distribution can effectively manage food security. This study proposed a feature-based decision approach to detect the mapping of rice cultivation using the time-series Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provided by Sentinel-1A. Instead of using the maximum and minimum backscatter of SAR data, as most studies in the literature, this study established a rice growth model based on complete time series data in the rice growth period. From the developed model, a feature related to rice growth time, that is, the time interval (TI) between vegetative growth and maturity stages was introduced. The proposed feature was first compared with the feature of backscatter difference (BD) between the maximum and minimum value of SAR data. The experimental results show that the proposed feature can achieve better rice detection accuracy. Then, a decision method based on the combination of TI and BD features was proposed for rice planting mapping. In the study, Yunlin and Changhua counties in central Taiwan were used as experimental areas. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve more than 90% overall accuracy in rice detection for VH polarization. Furthermore, comparing with the traditional method that uses growth height feature, BD, the proposed method can improve the overall accuracy of rice detection about 5%. © 2020 IEEE.","Backscattering; Food supply; Geology; Mapping; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Decision method; Detection accuracy; Developed model; Maturity stages; Overall accuracies; Rice cultivation; Time-series data; Vegetative growth; Feature extraction","multi-temporal data; rice field distribution; rice growth features; Sentinel-1A; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101961865"

The technique's capability of imaging the spatial extent of ground motion has especially helped to shed light on the location, shape, and dynamics of subsurface magmatic storage and transport as well as the overall state of activity of volcanoes worldwide. A variety of different deformation phenomena are observed at exceptionally active and frequently erupting volcanoes, like Piton de la Fournaise on La Reunion Island. Those offer a powerful means of investigating related geophysical source processes and offer new insights into an active volcano's edifice architecture, stability, and eruptive behavior. Since 1998, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has been playing an increasingly important role in developing our present understanding of the Piton de la Fournaise volcanic system. We here collect the most significant scientific results, identify limitations, and summarize the lessons learned from exploring the rich Piton de la Fournaise SAR data archive over the past ~20 years. For instance, the technique has delivered first evidence of the previously long suspected mobility of the volcano's unsupported eastern flank, and it is especially useful for detecting displacements related to eruptions that occur far away from the central cone, where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations are sparse. However, superimposed deformation processes, dense vegetation along the volcano's lower eastern flank, and turbulent atmospheric phase contributions make Piton de la Fournaise a challenging target for applying InSAR. Multitemporal InSAR approaches that have the potential to overcome some of these limitations suffer from frequent eruptions that cause the replacement of scatterers. With increasing data acquisition rates, multisensor complementarity, and advanced processing techniques that resourcefully handle large data repositories, InSAR is progressively evolving into a near-real-time, complementary, operational volcano monitoring tool. We therefore emphasize the importance of InSAR at highly active and well-monitored volcanoes such as Mount Etna, Italy, Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i, and Piton de la Fournaise, La Reunion. © 2020 by the authors.

At the end of the drought, GRACE-based estimates of total water storage show a rising trend. Also, the precipitation anomalies, considering monthly averages over 2002–2017, are positive. But, it is unclear if a pressure equilibrium is achieved within the aquifer systems, which is a requirement for residual compaction to halt. To this end, we perform a multidisciplinary multi-resolution analysis of space-borne and ground-based observations. We find that following the drought period and during wetter years, due to reduced pumping, owing to significant precipitation and the supply of surface water, groundwater levels begin to rise at all sites while compaction of aquifer-systems continues. A multi-temporal interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1A/B SAR datasets during Nov. 2014–Nov. 2017 shows subsidence rates of ~6 mm/yr, ~3 mm/yr, ~200–300 mm/yr, ~3–4 mm/yr, ~4–6 mm/yr, ~2 mm/yr affecting parts of Phoenix, Tucson, San Joaquin Valley, Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, respectively, which are attributed to delayed compaction of fine-grain aquitard layer.

This paper presents sustainability strategies for smart cities: the use of SAR Sentinel-1 for monitoring flood inundation and landslide hazards in Aceh Province, Indonesia. In this study, for flood detection, we attempt to uses Sentinel-1A (S-1A) in the same direction and acquisition through polarization of Vertical transmit and Vertical received (VV) - Vertical transmit and Horizontal received (VH) with a temporal baseline of 6 days. Those data were then analysed using the SNAP Toolbox. The results showed that the S-1A was successfully for detecting a flood inundation in which VH polarization is more sensitive than VV. For landslide monitoring, we apply multitemporal SAR images, where one of them is the Quasi-Persistent Scatterers (Q-PS) technique. Using ascending and descending orbit pass results in a better velocity map where both sides of the slope are detected due to the different sensor angle of both orbital passes. This technique has resulted in the undulating areas being monitored well and this will also fill the gap of layover and shadowing phenomena of the slant range SAR image. The Q-PS combinations were very effective to identify the deformation features associated with the land movement. For a smart city, natural hazards such as landslides and floods require continuous monitoring to ensure the potential as well as management and mitigation of natural hazards. Therefore, the InSAR technique is one of the effective ways for doing this strategy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Flood control; Floods; Hazards; Landslides; Polarization; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Smart city; Continuous monitoring; Deformation feature; Flood detections; Landslide hazard; Landslide monitoring; Multi-temporal SAR images; Persistent scatterers; Sustainability strategies; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089834728"

It is also computationally intensive when processed through traditional remote sensing techniques that limit its use during emergency situations. To hasten the production of flood maps from RADAR images during flooding incidents, a deep learning model using Fully connected Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) has been developed to delineate flooded areas with minimal human intervention. The model was formulated from the data gathered during a flooding event captured by both Sentinel-1A SAR satellite and Planet's Dove optical satellites. Two pre-flood and one post-flood SAR scenes were used to detect the occurrence of water by analysing drops in backscatter values. The potential flood extents were verified using optical images which were then used to train the AI model. The model is currently being used operationally to map flood extent across the Philippines with no human intervention from data download to detection of flooded areas. The technique can detect floods across five Sentinel 1 scenes in less than four hours upon download of new satellite data. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Floods; Geometrical optics; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Emergency situation; Flood detections; Human intervention; Learning models; Multiple radar; New satellites; Optical satellites; Remote sensing techniques; Radar imaging","Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; Flood; Radar; Remote Sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091189462"

While many studies have demonstrated the ability of optical and SAR remotely sensed data to estimate crop parameters, these data have not been compared or combined to predict crop phenological stages. Despite the high sensitivity of SAR polarimetric data to crop phenological stages, no study has used high temporal resolution data. The freely available SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series provide a unique opportunity to monitor crop phenology at a high spatial resolution on a weekly basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use to predict wheat and rapeseed phenological stages. We first analyzed temporal profiles of spectral bands, vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) derived from S-2 data, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 data. Then, an incremental procedure was used to estimate the contribution of S-1 and S-2 features to the classification of principal and secondary phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed. Results for both crops showed that the classification obtained with combined S-1 & 2 data (mean kappa = 0.53–0.82 and 0.74–0.92 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) was more accurate than those obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa = 0.54–0.75 and 0.67–0.86 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) or S-1 data alone (mean kappa = 0.48–0.61 and 0.61–0.64 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively). Combining S-1 & 2 data allowed better identification of the beginning and end of tillering for wheat and the beginning and end of ripening for rapeseed. Among S-2 features, the most important were LAI for wheat and the NDVI for rapeseed. For both crops, the S2REP index was one of the most important vegetation indices, while MCARI was less important. For S-1 features, results highlighted the large contribution of the backscatter ratio (σ◦VH:σ◦VV) and the value of using polarimetric indicators (Shannon entropy and span) to monitor rapeseed and wheat phenology. The main novelties of this work are the use of S-1 polarimetric indicators to identify phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed and the mapping of wheat and rapeseed secondary phenological stages using remotely sensed data. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The aim of this study is to analyse the ability of the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on board of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS/PALSAR-1) data to identify, delineate and monitor wetlands, and to evaluate the importance of scene selection in a highly unpredictable wetland. Three SAR scene sets (Year A, Year B and Inter-annual) were built for this purpose, considering the intra-annual and inter-annual hydrologic variability and the phenologic variability of the studied coastal wetland. Seven land cover types were defined, including three permanently flooded wetland classes, three temporarily flooded wetland classes and one non-wetland class. An object-based unsupervised classification approach was applied on each multi-temporal set. The obtained clusters were characterized by a temporal signature and assigned to the seven land cover types using a decision tree with user-defined thresholds.

Here, the performance of the least squares (LS) and singular value decomposition (SVD) methods for the robust solution of SBAS InSAR deformation models are compared via tests with simulation and real SAR data. The LS method is used to solve the SBAS InSAR deformation models of 62 and 48 multi-temporal differential interferogram series; the SVD method is used to solve the SBAS InSAR deformation models of 60, 41, 58 and 53 multi-temporal differential interferogram series; the solved deformation results of the six series by the LS and SVD methods are compared and verified with the simulated deformation values and global positioning system (GPS) measurements. The results indicate that there is a moderate ill-posed degree in solving the SBAS InSAR deformation model by the LS method. The LS method can correctly retrieve the deformation information without considering any errors; however, in the case of serious random error, the deformation information acquired through the LS method is different from that of the simulation and is affected by the error of the multi-temporal differential interferometric phase series. The LS-solved results of real SAR datasets of two series are consistent, but are not in good agreement with the results of five GPS measurements. When the number of subsets is two, all types of deformation information solved by the SVD method follow the same rules as the results solved by the LS method. However, when the number of subsets increases to three and four, the stability of the SVD method becomes very poor; the SVD method can then only correctly solve the distribution of deformation in the study area, and the other solved deformation information, such as deformation velocity, is no longer credible. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Deformation; Global positioning system; Interferometry; Least squares approximations; Random errors; Singular value decomposition; Deformation modeling; Deformation models; Deformation velocity; Interferometric phase; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Singular value decomposition method; Small baseline subsets; Surface deformation; computer simulation; deformation; least squares method; numerical model; performance assessment; singular value decomposition; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090358404"

Deformation velocity maps and vertical displacement time series were produced and compared with geology and groundwater level of the region. Deformation velocity maps show significant subsidence in the region. The most severe subsidence, up to 35 mm/year, was found in the southern part of Bolvadin which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Both in long and short term, there was a strong correlation between the subsidence and the groundwater level. As a result, the high correlation of the vertical deformation velocity with lithological units and groundwater level indicates that subsidence in the region is probably due to the excessive use of groundwater.  © 2020 IEEE.","Deformation; Groundwater; Lithology; Signal processing; Subsidence; Alluvial deposits; Deformation velocity; Ground deformations; Multi-temporal SAR; Strong correlation; Surface deformation; Vertical deformation; Vertical displacements; Synthetic aperture radar","Bolvadin; land subsidence; multi-temporal InSAR; remote sensing; sentinel-1; time series analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100320156"

Information from the globally available CORINE land cover dataset, derived over Africa from the Proba V satellite, and available publicly at the resolution of 100 m, is also exploited. Integrated multi-frequency, multi-temporal, and multi-polarizations analysis allows highlighting different drying dynamics for floodwater over various land cover classes, such as herbaceous vegetation, wetlands, and forests. They also enable detection of different scattering mechanisms, such as double bounce interaction of vegetation stems and trunks with underlying floodwater, giving precious information about the distribution of flooded areas among the different ground cover types present on the site. The approach is validated through visual analysis from Google Earth™ imagery.

Today, the scientific community and a wide variety of users and stakeholders consider MTInSAR a precise tool for ground motion-related applications. The standard product of a MTInSAR analysis is a deformation map containing a high number of point-like measurement points (MP) which carry information on ground motion. The density of MPs is uneven, and they cannot be extracted continuously at large scale due to geometrical distortions and unfavourable landcover. It is a good practice to assess the feasibility of the interferometric analysis ahead of data processing. This technical note proposes a ready-to-use set of tools aimed at updating existing methods for modelling the effects of local topography and land cover on MTInSAR approaches. The goal of the tools is to provide InSAR experts and non-experts with a fast and automatic way to derive visibility maps, useful for pre-processing screening of a target area, and to forecast the expected density of MP over a specified area. Moreover, the visibility maps are a valid support for users to better understand the available standard and advanced interferometric results. Two workflows are proposed: the first generates the so-called Rindex map (Ri_m) to estimate the influence of topography on MP detection, the second is used to derive a land cover-calibrated Ri_m seen as a probabilistic model for MP detection (MPD_m). The proposed set of tools was applied in the context of the Alpine arc, whose climatic, morphological, and land cover characteristics represent a challenging environment for any interferometric approach. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we have introduced a α-cut induced Fuzzy layer to the Deep Neural Network (αFDNN). Deep neural networks for change detection normally rely on the pre-classified labels of the clustering. But the pre-classified labels are more coarse and ambiguous, which is not able to highlight the changed information accurately. This challenge can be addressed by encapsulating the local information and fuzzy logic into the deep neural network. This takes the advantage of enhancing the changed information and of reducing the effect of speckle noise. As the first step in change detection, a fused difference image is generated from the mean and log ratio image with the advent of Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT). It not only eliminates the impact of speckle noise but also it has good ability to identify the trend of change thanks to the shift invariance property. Pseudo classification is performed as the next step using Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering. Then, we apply reformulated α-cut induced Fuzzy Deep Neural Network to generate the final change map which facilitates a final representation of data more suitable for the process of classification and clustering. It also results into a noteworthy improvement in the change detection result. The efficacy of the algorithm is analyzed through the parameter study.

However, accurate map of paddy rice is a long-term challenge because of its spatiotemporal discontinuity and short duration. To solve this problem, this study proposed a paddy rice area extraction approach by using the combination of optical vegetation indices and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This method is designed to overcome the data-missing problem due to cloud contamination and spatiotemporal discontinuities of the traditional optical remote sensing method. More specifically, the Sentinel-1A SAR and the Sentinel-2 multispectral imager (MSI) Level-2A imagery are used to identify paddy rice with a high temporal and spatial resolution. Three vegetation indices, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI), are estimated from optical bands. Two polarization bands (VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical)) are used to overcome the cloud contamination problem. This approach was applied with the random forest machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform for the Jianghan Plain in China as an experimental area. The results of 39 experiments uncovered the effect of different factors. The results indicated that the combination of VV and VH band showed a better performance compared with other polarization bands; the average producer's accuracy of paddy rice (PA) is 72.79%, 1.58% higher than the second one VH. Secondly, the combination of three indices also showed a better result than others, with average PA 73.82%, 1.42% higher than using NDVI alone. The classification result presented the best combination is EVI, VV, and VH polarization band. The producer's accuracy of paddy rice was 76.67%, with the overall accuracy (OA) of 66.07%, and Kappa statistics of 0.45. However, NDVI, EVI, and VH showed better performance in mapping the morphology. The results demonstrated the method developed in this study can be successfully applied to the cloud-prone area for mapping paddy rice to overcome the data missing caused by cloud and rain during the paddy growing season. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision trees; Engines; Machine learning; Mapping; Morphology; Polarization; Radar imaging; Random forests; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Vegetation; Water management; Classification results; Cloud contamination; Enhanced vegetation index; Land surface water index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical remote sensing; Temporal and spatial; Waterresource management; Synthetic aperture radar","EVI; Google Earth Engine; LSWI; NDVI; Paddy rice; Precision farming; SAR; SAR data; Sentinel images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092076309"

In the recent years, satellite polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) systems (e.g., the Sentinel-1 constellation) became a suitable tool for multitemporal monitoring due to the regular acquisitions with a short revisit time in different polarimetric channels. Methods for CD in PolSAR data mainly focus on binary CD (i.e., they provide information about the presence/absence of change only), whereas the polarimetric enhanced information provides multiple features that can be exploited for performing multiclass CD. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for the characterization of multitemporal changes in dual-polarimetric data. The framework is based on the definition of polarimetric change vectors (PCVs) and their representation in a polar coordinate system. PCVs allow characterizing and, thus, to separate multiclass changes in terms of target properties of the single-time scenes and the scattering theory. The proposed model is used to: 1) derive the statistical behaviors of change and no change classes in PolSAR multitemporal images; 2) design an automatic and unsupervised strategy to estimate the optimal number of changes; and 3) distinguish no change from change classes and the kinds of change from each other. An experimental analysis has been conducted on three multitemporal PolSAR data sets having different complexities in terms of number and kinds of change classes. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the better performance with respect to both specific techniques for CD in dual-pol SAR data and a general multiclass CD method, not designed for PolSAR data.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Experimental analysis; Multi-temporal image; Multiple features; Polar coordinate systems; Polarimetric data; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Remote sensing applications; Statistical behavior; data interpretation; image analysis; image classification; polarization; radar imagery; synthetic aperture radar; unsupervised classification; vector; Radar imaging","Change detection (CD); expectation maximization (EM); multiclass unsupervised CD; polarimetric change vector (PCV); polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086756426"

Thus, quick detection, prediction, and identification of early signals of landslide occurrence are critical for prompt emergency information, rescue efforts, and mitigation of further damage such as collapse of a landslide dam. Accordingly, in this paper, a prototype of early-stage-landslide detection is introduced. We construct a new automatic approach to extract landslides from remote sensing imagery, both optical and radar for quick prediction and detection before disasters, achieved by combining interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with differential detection method using multi-temporal high-resolution optical images. The idea behind the novel approach is to identify potential landslides by typical distribution features, deformation, and tendency of landslides, including the result of expert second opinion. To verify the feasibility of this landslide prediction system, a case study was performed in Jinsha River area. It is found that the use of automatic detection of the potential landslides over satellite imagery allows the identification and characterization of the affected areas based on landslide features. It is expected that the prototype of landslide prediction can provide early recognitions before severe landslides occur.

The more favorable weather conditions permit more flexible agricultural practices, which creates complex crop dynamics. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems provide high-resolution images independent of daylight, cloud coverage, and climate conditions, turning into a cost-effective tool for crop mapping in tropical regions. Conditional random fields (CRFs) models have been used with great success to exploit spatial and temporal contexts in crop type classification. Even if such approaches deliver high accuracy, they often rely on manually designed features requiring domain-specific knowledge. In this context, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proved to be an appealing alternative for feature learning in the context of remote sensing image classification. This work introduces an end-to-end model that combines CNNs and CRFs for crop recognition in areas characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics, typical of tropical regions. The proposed framework consists of two modules: the first implements a CNN that models spatial and temporal contexts from the input data, and the second implements a CRF module that models temporal dynamics considering label dependencies. Experiments are presented for an agricultural region in Brazil using multi-temporal SAR images sequences. The experiments showed significant improvements in the F1 score against a baseline model that does not include temporal dependencies in the learning process. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

They will trigger considerable false alarms in target detection applications tasked with ship detection, if they are not identified. An algorithm for stationary marine target detection, developed based on the assumption that the apparent positions of a stationary target in multitemporal imagery are also stationary or nearly so, is proposed in this article. This algorithm requires a strict time-series of SAR images in temporal sequence as input. For each input SAR image, all targets on sea surface are initially detected with an iterative cell-averaging constant false-alarm rate detection algorithm, and their longitude and latitude positions are then used to identify whether they are stationary targets. Under this algorithm, a stationariness index with five levels ('unknown target,' 'suspected new stationary target,' 'stationary target,' 'suspected removed stationary target,' and 'removed target') is defined for each target and must be iteratively updated with the latest level of identification.

Our study aims to employ temporal patterns from monthly-median Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band synthetic aperture radar data and cloud-filled monthly spectral indices, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), from Landsat 8 (L8) OLI for mapping rice cropland areas in the northern part of Central Java Province, Indonesia. The harmonic function was used to fill the cloud and cloud-masked values in the spectral indices from Landsat 8 data, and smile Random Forests (RF) and Classification And Regression Trees (CART) algorithms were used to map rice cropland areas using a combination of monthly S1 and monthly harmonic L8 spectral indices. An additional terrain variable, Terrain Roughness Index (TRI) from the SRTM dataset, was also included in the analysis. Our results demonstrated that RF models with 50 (RF50) and 80 (RF80) trees yielded better accuracy for mapping the extent of paddy fields, with user accuracies of 85.65% (RF50) and 85.75% (RF80), and producer accuracies of 91.63% (RF80) and 93.48% (RF50) (overall accuracies of 92.10% (RF80) and 92.47% (RF50)), respectively, while CART yielded a user accuracy of only 84.83% and a producer accuracy of 80.86%. The model variable importance in both RF50 and RF80 models showed that vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) polarization and harmonic-fitted NDVI were identified as the top five important variables, and the variables representing February, April, June, and December contributed more to the RF model. The detection of VH and NDVI as the top variables which contributed up to 51% of the Random Forest model indicated the importance of the multi-sensor combination for the identification of paddy fields. © 2020 by the authors.","","Classification and regression trees; Harmonics; Random forest; Variable importance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101298841"

The work of reclamation is even more serious. Taking Baodian Coal Mine, a high phreatic mining area, as the research object, combining and improving the water body and non-water body extraction methods, the surface subsidence information of the entire mining area was obtained. On the basis of Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), an Enhanced Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (E-MNDWI) was proposed for the characteristics that the edge of coal mining subsidence was easy to be confused with water body information. The Landsat 8 data was used to extract the subsidence water area through E-MNDWI. The Sentinel-1A data (Sentinel-1A) was used to extract the subsided non-watershed area by Small Baseline Subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR). Finally, Kriging interpolation was performed to obtain the 10 mm contour of the subsidence of the mining area. The results showed that the accuracy of extracting subsidence water by E-MNDWI was high, and the Kappa coefficient was 85.07%. The western part of the mining area has basically reached a stable state, and the surface subsidence in the east was more obvious, and the southern surface was slightly elevated. During the monitoring period, the maximum surface subsidence rate of the mining area was 41.69 mm/ a, and the maximum subsidence was 85.16 mm. As of 2017, the subsidence area caused by coal mining in the mining area was 10.1 km2, of which the subsidence water area was 4.6 km2and the non-water accumulation area was 5.5 km2. A number of reference points were selected to verify the extraction results of the subsided non-watershed area, and the coefficient of determination R2was 0.92. The use of multi-source and multi-temporal data, combined with a variety of methods to obtain mining subsidence information, could provided a theoretical basis for ecological restoration and land remediation in coal mining cities, and provide a new idea for the rapid and efficient monitoring of surface deformation in coal mining subsidence areas. © 2020 China Coal Society.

In this study, we proposed a superpixel-based prediction transformation-fusion (SPTF) time-series reconstruction method for cloud/shadow-covered optical images. Central to this approach is the incorporation between intrinsic tendency from multi-temporal optical images and sequential transformation information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, through autoencoder networks (AE). First, a modified superpixel algorithm was applied on multi-temporal optical images with their manually delineated cloud/shadow masks to generate superpixels. Second, multi-temporal optical images and SAR data were overlaid onto superpixels to produce superpixel-wise time-series curves with missing values. Third, these superpixel-wise time series were clustered by an AE-LSTM (long short-term memory) unsupervised method into multiple clusters (searching similar superpixels). Four, for each superpixel-wise cluster, a prediction-transformation-based reconstruction model was established to restore missing values in optical time series. Finally, reconstructed data were merged with cloud-free regions to produce cloud-free time-series images. The proposed method was verified on two datasets of multi-temporal cloud/shadow-covered Landsat OLI images and Sentinel-1A SAR data. The reconstruction results, showing an improvement of greater than 20% in normalized mean square error compared to three state-of-the-art methods (including a spatially and temporally weighted regression method, a spectral–temporal patch-based method, and a patch-based contextualized AE method), demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in time-series reconstruction for multi-temporal optical images. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","image analysis; Landsat; machine learning; pixel; radar imagery; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","cloud and shadow; deep learning; Landsat image; Sentinel-1 SAR; superpixel; Time-series reconstruction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095769926"

Particularly, the snowmelt runoff in the Khanabad watershed is one of the critical drivers for the Amu River, since it is a primary source of available water in several Middle Eastern countries in the off monsoon season. The purpose of this study is to devise strategies based on active microwave remote sensing for the monitoring of snow depth during the winter and the melt season. For the estimation of snow depth, we utilized a multi-temporal C-band (5.405 GHz) Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with a differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR)-based framework. In the proposed approach, the estimated snowpack displacements in the vertical transmit-vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit-horizonal receive (VH) channels were improved by incorporating modeled information of snow permittivity, and the scale was enhanced by utilizing snow depth information from the available ground stations. Two seasonal datasets were considered for the experiments corresponding to peak winter season (February 2019) and early melt season (March 2019). The results were validated with the available nearest field measurements. A good correlation determined by the coefficient of determination of 0.82 and 0.57, with root mean square errors of 2.33 and 1.44 m, for the peak winter and the early melt season, respectively, was observed between the snow depth estimates and the field measurements. Further, the snow depth estimates from the proposed approach were observed to be significantly better than the DInSAR displacements based on the correlation with respect to the field measurements. © 2020 by the authors.","Mean square error; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Active microwave; Coefficient of determination; Differential interferometric sar; Field measurement; Good correlations; Hindu-Kush-Himalayas; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Root mean square errors; Water resources","DInSAR; Dual polarimetric SAR; Sentinel-1; Snow depth; Snow permittivity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090596128"

Interferometric synthetic aperture (InSAR) provides a powerful tool to map terrain motion and characterize the failure mechanism of unstable slopes. However, it is challenging for the conventional InSAR technique to obtain reliable landslide information in mountainous regions because of insufficient coherent measurements and signal confusion caused by vegetation coverage and rugged terrain. In this study, we adopt an optimized multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to analyze the surface displacement of an artificial side slope along Freeway No. 3, where a catastrophic landslide failure occurred on 25 April 2010, in northern Taiwan. To increase the spatial extent of the deformation signal, we integrate information from both persistent scatterers (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs). Topographic residual and height-dependent atmospheric delays are corrected by a component-based method and joint model estimation, respectively. The results reveal the existence of slope movement with a rate of about -30 mm/year prior to the landslide failure. Further analysis shows that the temporal behaviors of downslope movement are correlated with local precipitation. The study demonstrates the need to continuously monitor and verify the stability of artificial slopes to prevent and minimize the probability of a similar landslide occurrence in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Landforms; Landslides; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic apertures; Catastrophic landslides; Coherent measurement; Component-based method; Distributed scatterers; Persistent scatterers; Seasonal precipitations; Surface displacement; Vegetation coverage; Failure (mechanical)","Artificial slope; Landslide hazards; Multitemporal InSAR (MTInSAR); Phase estimation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089706467"

Changes in the temperature, volume, pressure of the reservoir can culminate in surface deformation and in seismicity at the reservoir edges and/or near the production wells. Identifying the origin of the ground response enables controlled management of the reservoir and can help prevent damage to structures. Satellite remote sensing (InSAR) permits the study of the deformation at these sites with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, Central America has a dynamic atmosphere with considerable water vapour and constant growth of vegetation all year long, which leads to decorrelation between SAR images. Here we study the Dr. Alfredo Mainieri Protti geothermal field, located near Miravalles Volcano in the Northern Costa Rica volcanic arc. We measure the deformation associated with geothermal energy production using data from two satellites (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) between January 2015 and January 2017. The ALOS-2 data was used to obtain the extent of the affected area, and two StaMPS multi-temporal methods (Persistent Scatter (PS) InSAR, and Small Baselines(SB)) were applied to the Sentinel-1 data, to obtain the temporal pattern of the ground displacements. Results show a direct response of the ground to the extraction of fluids. The pattern of deformation obtained with ALOS-2 is spatially correlated with the geothermal field, and with the recorded seismicity. Between April 2015 to October 2016, periods of uplift and subsidence were observed with values between ~2.0 to 3.0 cm every 120 days, linked to changes in the amount of fluids extracted from the reservoir. The results also show the ability of the reservoir to recover rapidly following a decrease in extraction rate. This work has shown that even in this tropical region it is possible to monitor anthropogenic ground motion using InSAR. This is beneficial for the Central American region, as satellite images are becoming more frequently acquired and available, and can be used to boost the monitoring of seismic regions, volcanic activity and anthropogenic activities. © 2020","Costa Rica; Satellites; Trachinotus falcatus; Varanidae; Deformation; Extraction; Geothermal power plants; Indium compounds; Remote sensing; Reservoir management; Satellites; Seismology; Synthetic aperture radar; Volcanoes; Anthropogenic activity; Ground deformations; Ground displacement; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Surface deformation; Temporal pattern; Volcanic activities; ALOS; baseline conditions; caldera; deformation; geothermal energy; hydrocarbon reservoir; response analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Geothermal fields","Deformation time-series; Geothermal production; InSAR; Persistent scattering; Small baselines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096162443"

These wetlands are susceptible to climatic variability, resulting in temporally and spatially dynamic habitats that are difficult to map accurately. This study hypothesizes that seasonal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery will capture temporal variations of wetlands in the spring/summer and fall months of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. We propose that these data combined with topographic variability offered by LiDAR-derived topographic wetness index (TWI) shall result in the accurate delineation of the wetlands. Using a combination of open-access government databases, we generated ground and training data to develop the classification models and perform accuracy assessments. The wetland map products’ overall accuracy results ranged from 63.2% to 75.7%. The pixel-based random forest (RF) classified dataset (Dataset 5–multi-temporal (2017–2020) S1 SAR (VH) and S2 optical (B8 and B11) bands fused with TWI) had the highest overall accuracy (75.6%). The RF result significantly outperformed similar CART (Classification and Regression Trees) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifications, which had overall accuracies of 67.4% and 63.2%, respectively. In addition, the RF optimal wetland product had the best combination of F-score values for wetland and upland classes: 0.61 (marsh), 0.82 (open water), 0.75 (swamp), and 0.8 (uplands). Overall, the methodology adopted in this study is promising for mapping the spatial distribution of wetland habitats across the seasonally dynamic GNR of Alberta. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Alberta; Canada; Alberta; grassland; lidar; machine learning; mapping; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; topography; wetland","CART; LiDAR; random forest; Sentinel satellite; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111645439"

In this context, we propose to employ a convolutional neural network that integrates a set of SAR images of different dates and polarizations for delineating the building footprint.

However, as far as classification is concerned, it is dicult to directly generate the classification map for a new temporal image, by the use of conventional TSA or change detection methods. Once some labeled samples exist in historical temporal images, semi-supervised domain adaptation (DA) is able to use historical label information to infer the categories of pixels in the new image, which is a potential solution to the above problem. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised DA algorithm is proposed, which inherits the merits of maximum margin criterion and principal component analysis in the DA learning scenario. Using a kernel mapping function established on the statistical distribution of PolSAR data, the proposed algorithm aims to find an optimal subspace for eliminating domain influence and keeping the key information of bi-temporal images. Experiments on both UAVSAR and Radarsat-2 multi-temporal datasets show that, superior classification results with the average accuracy of about 80% can be obtained by a simple classifier trained with historical labeled samples in the learned lowdimensional subspaces. © 2020 by the author.","Classification (of information); Learning algorithms; Polarimeters; Principal component analysis; Radar imaging; Semi-supervised learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Transfer learning; Dissimilarity measures; Domain adaptation; Graph embeddings; Polarimetric SAR; Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces; Scatter matrix; Temporal images; Image enhancement","Bi-temporal images; Dissimilarity measure; Domain adaptation; Graph embedding; Polarimetric SAR; Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces; Scatter matrices; Transfer learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080943289"

In recent years, multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques have been rigorously explored, for land deformation detection and monitoring, by extracting highly stable measurement pixels using tens of SAR acquisitions simultaneously. In this research work, a GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis to prepare LSMs is proposed, with MT-InSAR derived displacement estimates used as a critical input parameter. An LSM is generated by processing 20 ERS-1/2 and Envisat ASAR images, acquired over ∼120 sq. km wide river basin, located in Uttarakhand, India. The generated LSM is found to be congruent with the susceptible maps made available by the Geological Survey of India (GSI) under the National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) program. Preliminary results indicate that the majority of the unstable zones along the Alaknanda River are correctly identified. The approach is further implemented to generate an updated susceptibility map using 60 scenes of freely available Sentinel-1A dataset, followed by validation through actual field survey. This resulted in the generation of an updated susceptibility map, which helped in the identification of 44.5% new landslide susceptible zones (LSZs). Furthermore, the status of previously identified zones is also quantified. The performance of the proposed approach suggests its usability in generating and updating near-real-time LSMs. © 2021 The Author(s).

Considering the dual-polarimetry with limited observables, the surface roughness parameters such as the RMS height and auto-correlation length are first estimated by optimizing the semi-empirical Oh2004 model applied to the ALOS2 data acquired under bare soil condition. The vegetation water content corresponding to each ALOS2 acquisition time is derived from an empirical model applied to the temporally interpolated MODIS NDVI data. Then, the obtained roughness and vegetation optical depth are substituted into the Water Cloud Model which we modified by adding a double-bounce component according to the L-band scattering processes to retrieve the effective scattering albedo and soil moisture. The results show that the optimized surface RMS height and the associated slope are negatively related to a dual-angular radar index ΔHH, indicating the feasibility to optimize the relatively stable surface roughness parameters before retrieving the soil moisture dynamics. The obtained vegetation optical depth which is cross-validated against a normalized cross-polarized radar descriptor indicates a significant increase from May to August, in response to the vegetation phenological growth. Furthermore, the time-variable scattering albedo is less than 0.08, and slightly increases with the vegetation development. By accounting for the double-bounce component, the retrieved soil moisture better agrees with the ground measurements with R = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.058 m3/m3, but exhibits an overestimation issue for the soil moisture higher than 0.35 m3/m3 due to the saturation of SAR signal and the relatively strong vegetation cover. A positive correspondence (R = 0.81) between the retrieved soil moisture and the interpolated NDVI was found, verifying their close coupling in the soil-vegetation system.

The intensive extraction of brine from the underground salt deposit caused accumulative subsidence of up to -12 m from 1956 to 2003. It induced serious damage to residences, buildings, and infrastructures. Although the activity of brine extraction was officially stopped in 2007, reports of subsidence are still on-going for some areas of Tuzla City according to a previous study. In the present study, a satellite-based method, i.e., Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), is applied for the subsidence monitoring of the induced underground brine extraction. Since October 2014, SAR data obtained by the Sentinel-1A and -1B satellites (European Space Agency: ESA) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) multi-temporal analyses have been employed to obtain the spatial distribution and the temporal transition of the land subsidence. The accuracy and effectiveness of the SBAS-DInSAR method are assessed and evaluated by using the real-time kinematic GNSS monitoring system. DInSAR detected that the subsidence is still on-going at a velocity of -36.4 mm/year in some areas, especially in an area northeast of the center of the city.

The relation of selected monoand multi-temporal SAR features and roughness is investigated by using an empirical multi-model approach and selected 1D and 2D surface roughness indices. These indices were obtained from 48 high-resolution ground-based photogrammetric digital elevation models, which were acquired during a single field campaign. The analysis is backed by a time series analysis, comparing Sentinel-1 features to temporal-corresponding observations and reanalysis datasets on soil moisture conditions, land surface temperature, occurrence of precipitation events, and presence and development of vegetation. Results show that Sentinel-1 features are hardly sensitive to the changing surface conditions over none to sparsely vegetated land, indicating very dry conditions throughout the year. Consequently, surface roughness is the dominating factor altering SAR intensity. The best correlation is found for the combined surface roughness index Z-Value (ratio between the root mean square height and the correlation length) and the mean summer VH intensity with an r2 coefficient of 0.83 and an Root-Mean-Square Error of 0.032. © 2020 by the authors.

Over the last few decades, Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) has been used to efficiently monitor this phenomenon with great spatial and temporal coverage. More advanced multi-temporal DInSAR (MTInSAR) algorithms have been proposed to overcome some of the limitations of conventional DInSAR. However, advanced MTInSAR approaches are also not perfect in terms of measuring mining subsidence (e.g., temporal decorrelation, ambiguity, nonlinearity). For this reason, we propose a fusion of the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSInSAR) and DInSAR results. By combining these complementary techniques, the atmospheric errors in PSInSAR data are reduced and larger deformation rates could have been detected more accurately (thanks to DInSAR) than by an approach solely based on PS-InSAR. This allows to measure areas with fast-moving subsidence (1 m/year) due to ongoing underground coal exploitation. Data from ascending and descending orbits of Sentinel-1A\B were used to obtain the vertical deformation component. The resulting integrated vertical deformation map was compared with the results from levelling benchmarks. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculated based on this comparison was 22 mm. Moreover, the maximal vertical cumulative subsidence detected in the study area was 1.05 m/year. © 2020 The Author(s).

The multisensor MTI time-series fusion (MMTI-TSF) techniques has been proposed to solve this problem, but rarely mentioned. In this paper, an improved MMTI-TSF is systematically explained and its limitations are discussed. Taking the Beijing Subway Network (BSN) as a case study, through crossvalidation and timing verification, we find that the improved MMTI-TSF results have higher accuracy (R2 of 98% and, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4mm), and compared with 38 leveling points, the fitting effect of the time series is good. We analyzed the characteristics of deformation along the BSN over a 15-year periods. The results suggest that there is a higher risk of instability in the eastern section of Beijing Subway Line 6 (L6). The land subsidence characteristics along the subway lines are related to its position from the subsidence center, and the edge of the subsidence center presents a segmented feature. © 2020 by the authors.","Deformation; Life cycle; Light rail transit; Mean square error; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Cross validation; Deformation monitoring; Entire life cycles; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Root mean squared errors; Stable operation; Timing verification; Urban rail transit; Subways","Beijing subway network; Crossvalidation; Land subsidence; MTI; Multi-sensor; Time-series fusion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087549298"

However, there is no retrieval algorithm that can make complementary use of the multi-frequency data from those missions, due to the large uncertainties in observations collected by the different sensors, different validity regions of the forward models, and the fact that inversion algorithms have been designed for specific data sources. In this study, the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues. Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution, multiple soil moisture retrievals (termed sub-retrievals) with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and/or time instances randomly selected from the available data, with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output. The ensemble retrievals, taking one existing snapshot method and two multi-temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms, were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources. An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non-ensemble retrieval in most cases, with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014 m3/m3 in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and an increase of 0.01 to 0.16 in correlation coefficient (R). Weakly biased and correlated sub-retrievals were confirmed to be the basic requirement of an effective ensemble retrieval, being consistent with use of ensemble learning in other applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Mean square error; Soil surveys; Stochastic systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Correlation coefficient; Inversion algorithm; Retrieval algorithms; Root mean square errors; Soil moisture mapping; Soil moisture retrievals; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Uncertainty sources; algorithm; radar; satellite data; satellite mission; satellite sensor; soil moisture; stochasticity; uncertainty analysis; Soil moisture","Ensemble learning; Multi-frequency; Multi-temporal; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091076745"

This represents an excellent opportunity to investigate and improve our understanding of the behavior of extremely slow landslides, as well as of the long- to short-term controls of their activity. In urban settings, such landslides deserve special attention, as their cumulative movements can cause significant socio-economic damage. Here, we re-examine the case of a long-lived, deep-seated landslide in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) which was urbanized between the late 1970s and early 2000s. The case provides a rare opportunity to highlight the benefits of the integrated analysis of long-term (several years) borehole inclinometer measurements with 15 years of multi-temporal InSAR displacement data. We present evidence of the landslide composite nature and asymmetry, and draw attention to the recent period of accelerated movement that coincided with the foot failure event. This helps constraining the interpretation of the borehole and InSAR data and demonstrating the predominantly rotational landslide mechanism. We show how a detailed analysis of sparse inclinometer and more spatially continuous InSAR measurements, when combined with local rainfall records, can reveal long- to short-term patterns of temporal variability in landslide motions and allow anticipating the consequences of future landslide activity. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Apennines; Italy; Boreholes; Displacement measurement; Failure (mechanical); Interferometry; Landslides; Radar measurement; Rain; Deep seated landslide; Failure mechanism; InSAR; Landslide mechanism; Movement pattern; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Temporal variability; borehole; composite; failure mechanism; landslide; long-term change; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; Synthetic aperture radar","Borehole inclinometer; Failure mechanism; InSAR; Movement patterns; Sentinel-1; Urban landslide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073944400"

However, support for this agricultural sector is hampered by lack of reliable information on the distributions and acreage of smallholder fields. This information is essential in not only monitoring food security and informing markets but also in guiding the determination of levels of support required from government by individual farmers. There is urgent need for robust techniques that can be used to cost-effectively and time-efficiently map smallholder crop fields especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. This study attempts to do this by using an approach in which optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are systematically combined and classified using Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost). We also investigated model stacking as another technique to improve classification accuracy. We combined Xgboost with Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). The combined use of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 bands, spectral indices, and Sentinel-1 produced better results than exclusive use of optical data (α = 0.95, p = 0.0005). Furthermore, stacking of classification algorithms based on model comparisons achieved higher accuracy than stacking the algorithms indiscriminately (α = 0.95, p = 0.0100). Through systematic fusion of SAR and optical data and hyper-parameter tuning of Xgboost, we achieved a maximum classification accuracy of 97.71%, while achieving a maximum accuracy of 96.06% through model stacking.

The capability of conventional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to monitor tectonic movements, volcanic eruptions and city subsidence has been fully demonstrated, but its application to mining subsidence is limited because of the failure caused by localized surface displacements with strong spatial gradients. In this paper, a new method is presented to utilize SAR pixel Offset Tracking (OT) with a single pair of SAR images to resolve three-dimensional (3D) large surface displacements caused by underground coal mining. Coal mining subsidence theory is utilised to analytically separate the vertical and horizontal components. This method is applied to the Daliuta coal mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, where a dense GPS network is available. Results show the RMS differences of OT derived displacements against GPS in both horizontal and vertical directions are in the sub-centimeter level. In addition, a prediction of mining-induced ground movements is performed with the Support Vector Regression algorithm and RMS differences of 12.4, 13.1 and 14.4 cm are observed compared to GPS, in the vertical, easting and northing directions respectively. The framework demonstrated in this paper is not only able to derive the evolution of the 3D large surface displacements with multi-temporal SAR images in a single-geometry, but also has a potential for short-term predication, which can provide early warnings and promote strategic decision-making for engineering management in the process of coal mining. © 2020 The Authors","China; Shaanxi; Coal; Coal mines; Cutting machines (mining); Decision making; Global positioning system; Pixels; Radar imaging; Subsidence; Surface measurement; Time series analysis; Tracking radar; Volcanoes; Coal mining; Deformation monitoring; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal SAR images; Offset tracking; Support vector regression algorithms; Time varying; Underground mining activities; algorithm; coal mining; displacement; GPS; measurement method; model; pixel; spatial variation; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; three-dimensional modeling; Synthetic aperture radar","Coal mining; Deformation monitoring; Pixel offset tracking; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Time-varying displacement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078702595"

Detection of wetland water levels through interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has outstanding advantage, including high spatial resolution, high accuracy, low cost, and high efficiency. We introduced prerequisites for the monitoring of wetland water levels with InSAR, discussed the types of InSAR techniques, the influencing factors for monitoring wetland water levels and their advantages and disadvantages. There are three prerequisites for effectively detecting wetland water levels with InSAR techniques: 1) the presence of emergent aquatic plants; 2) the main backscattering mechanism is double bounce scattering; and 3) the interferometric coherence exceeds a certain threshold. Current water level monitoring techniques have been developed from traditional InSAR techniques to advanced InSAR techniques, such as STBAS, MM, and DSI. These techniques evolve from detecting relative water level changes to estimate absolute water level and water depth time series. The influencing factors of InSAR techniques for monitoring wetland water levels include operating para-meters of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and characteristics of the wetlands themselves. Finally, we proposed the key directions for future research in this field: i) investigating the potential use of specific water level monitoring techniques in other regions with different backscattering and interferometric coherence characteristics; ii) developing new algorithms to integrate multi-sensor, multi-track, multi-band, multi-polarization, and multi-temporal InSAR repeat-pass observation; iii) considering alternative sources of SAR data; and (iv) strengthening research on ""by-products"" of wetland water level monitoring with InSAR, such as wetland hydrological connectivity, flow direction, and flow regime.","Algorithms; Radar; Water; Wetlands; water; algorithm; telecommunication; wetland","backscattering; hydrological connectivity; InSAR; interferometric coherence; water level; wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116171849"

It is exposed to a complex interaction of natural phenomena, oil and gas activities, fishing and navigational activities and these are potential sources of oil slicks and seeps. This work is primarily aimed at characterizing oil on water events and their association to oil and gas activities utilizing space synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The primary dataset being multi temporal Sentinel – 1A data acquired between 2015 and 2018. The analysis involved derivation of backscatter coefficients of the SAR images used, in order to identify dark regions. A novel approach applying gamma augmentation to the SAR datasets for the purpose of optimized characterization of the detected dark regions. Enhanced discrimination of dark regions using gamma, aided inference on the nature of weathering, thickness and behaviour of the detected oil anomaly. Geometric, textural and radiometric parameters of areas of detected anomalies were extracted and computed for the purpose of anomaly characterization. An anomaly confidence estimation algorithm was utilized, incorporating four key parameters in confidence estimation. These parameters are Homogeneity - uniformity in dark pixels of anomaly, Association - relationship of anomaly with a possible source, Signature - geometry of anomaly and contrast with respect to the ocean and Detectability - Ocean and satellite parameters such as wind speed and satellite incident angle. The quantitative extraction of these confidence estimating parameters was instrumental in the numerical computation of confidence levels using the HADS (Homogeneity Association Detectability Signature algorithm) computational method. Detected high confidence oil anomaly were strongly related to Otuo offshore oil and gas infrastructure, and these validated using optical satellite images: Landsat - 8 and Sentinel - 2. The results derived from this study establishes that SAR is a practical and effective tool in detecting oil on water within offshore oil mining leases, in addition to confirmation that oil spills occur as a result of oil and gas activities within this mining lease. © 2021 International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering.

In this study, ALOS-2 (L-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-Band) images were used to map potential areas prone to the occurrence of large-scale landslide disasters. Differential InSAR (D-InSAR) and multi-temporal techniques were applied to detect landslides in a part of Maoxian(a typical mountainous county in Southwest China), allowing the identification of 8 active landslides. The integration of local historical geological hazard data and local field exploration data allowed to conclude that the detected landslides found in Baibu village and other places were in the development stage. Deformation rate reached 200mm/yr along the line of sight direction. The results obtained by exploiting the two datasets correspond to each other in terms of spatial distribution and are consistent with the local field exploration results.

SAR remote sensing-based techniques, such as interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) have already proven useful in the estimation of geophysical parameters of snow. InSAR-based techniques utilize interferometric phase information from repeat-pass datasets for snow parameters retrieval. During the monitoring of snow, the large temporal gap between the repeat passes results in the temporal decorrelation in the snowpack, which leads to the loss of interferometric coherence. Hence, there is a need for a technique for snow parameters estimation, which can work with zero temporal baseline datasets. This study works on the development of a Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) based modelling approach for snow-depth estimation using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X datasets acquired in the pursuit monostatic mode (temporal baseline = 10 seconds). The study area of this work is the Manali region of Himachal Pradesh situated in the Beas basin. Multi-temporal analysis of the snow-depth variation is executed utilizing the two pursuit-monostatic TanDEM-X interferometric quad-pol dataset pairs of the dates 21 January 2015 and 22 January 2015. In this study, the PolInSAR-based Coherence Amplitude Inversion modelling approach is used for the snow-depth retrieval. The magnitude of the complex interferometric coherence is used during the modelling implementation. The snow extinction coefficient is estimated and used as an input during PolInSAR modelling. Further, a comparison of the calculated volume coherence magnitude and the observed volume coherence magnitude is done during model implementation for the snow-depth estimation. The snow depth is estimated at a resolution of 15 m × 15 m in range and azimuth directions respectively. The estimated snow depth for both the dates shows a precise correlation with the ground datasets. The rise in model retrieved snow-depth value from 0.84 m to 1.24 m is observed during the period. The retrieved results were validated using the ground data of snow depth from the Automatic weather station (AWS) of Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE), Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS) installed in the Dhundi region of the study area for same dates. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Himalayas; Interferometry; Parameter estimation; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Weather information services; Automatic weather stations; Defence Research and Development Organization; Extinction coefficients; Geophysical parameters; Interferometric coherence; Multi-temporal analysis; Polarimetric SAR interferometry; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry; data inversion; data set; numerical model; radar interferometry; satellite data; snow cover; synthetic aperture radar; TanDEM-X; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099189514"

It describes the mean of Rayleigh-distributed discrete-time signals by a dynamic structure including autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) terms, a set of regressors, and a link function. After presenting the conditional likelihood inference for the model parameters and the detection theory, in this article, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to evaluate the finite signal length performance of the conditional likelihood inferences.

Often, only a few sets of cloud-free optical imagery are available in cloudy regions, where many agricultural towns are located. On the other hand, radar remote sensing can capture imagery under cloudy conditions. In this study, we examined the capability of Sentinel-1 multitemporal dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in a whole year from Google Earth Engine in crop mapping in two study sites in Chongqing, China, and Landivisiau, France. Results show that it is possible to produce better crop classification maps using multitemporal SAR imagery, but the performance is limited by local terrain. Flat agricultural regions, such as Western Europe, are expected to benefit from the multitemporal SAR information. Mountain agricultural regions, such as Southwestern China, will encounter difficulties due to the undulate terrain. We also tested two sampling strategies, i.e., random sampling and regional sampling, and observed high variation in overall accuracy: the former led to a higher accuracy. The gap is caused by the diversity of training sets examined using tSNE visualization. The importance of SAR channels in each month are correlated with their entropy. Data from the growing season are important in distinguishing crop types. The 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved similar results under a huge computation cost compared with 2-D CNNs.

However, speckle noise presented in SAR images has a negative effect on change detection, leading to frequent false alarms in the mapping products. In this research, a novel two-phase object-based deep learning approach is proposed for multi-temporal SAR image change detection. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach brings two main innovations. One is to classify all pixels into three categories rather than two categories: unchanged pixels, changed pixels caused by strong speckle (false changes), and changed pixels formed by real terrain variation (real changes). The other is to group neighbouring pixels into superpixel objects such as to exploit local spatial context. Two phases are designed in the methodology: (1) Generate objects based on the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm, and discriminate these objects into changed and unchanged classes using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and a deep PCANet. The prediction of this Phase is the set of changed and unchanged superpixels. (2) Deep learning on the pixel sets over the changed superpixels only, obtained in the first phase, to discriminate real changes from false changes. SLIC is employed again to achieve new superpixels in the second phase. Low rank and sparse decomposition are applied to these new superpixels to suppress speckle noise significantly. A further clustering step is applied to these new superpixels via FCM. A new PCANet is then trained to classify two kinds of changed superpixels to achieve the final change maps. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with benchmark methods, the proposed approach can distinguish real changes from false changes effectively with significantly reduced false alarm rates, and achieve up to 99.71% change detection accuracy using multi-temporal SAR imagery. © 2020 by the authors.","C (programming language); Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Errors; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Object detection; Speckle; Superpixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Fuzzy C means clustering; Iterative clustering; Low-rank and sparse decompositions; Multi-temporal SAR; Multi-temporal SAR images; Numerical experiments; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","Change detection; Deep learning; Superpixel; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080921746"

From this analysis, a novel method to deal with the problem of flood mapping in urban areas has been derived. The approach assumes the availability of a map of persistent scatterers (PSs) inside the urban settlement and is based on the analysis of the temporal trend of the InSAR coherence and the spatial average of the exponential of the InSAR phase in each PS. Both interferometric products are expected to have high and stable values in the PSs; therefore, anomalous decreases may indicate that floodwater is present in an urban area. The stack of Sentinel-1 data has been divided into two subsets. The first one has been used as a calibration set to identify the PSs and determine, for each PS, reference values of the coherence and the spatial average of the exponential of the interferometric phase under standard non-flooded conditions. The other subset has been used for validation purposes. Flood maps produced by UNOSAT, analyzing very-high-resolution optical images of the floods that occurred in Beletweyne in April–May 2018, October–November 2019, and April–May 2020, have been used as reference data. In particular, the map of the April–May 2018 flood has been used for training purposes together with the subset of Sentinel-1 calibration data, whilst the other two maps have been used to validate the products generated by applying the proposed method. The main product is a binary map of flooded PSs that complements the floodwater map of rural/suburban areas produced by applying a well-consolidated algorithm based on intensity data. In addition, a flood severity map that labels the different districts of Beletweyne, as not, partially, or totally flooded has been generated to consolidate the validation. The results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.

Recent geothermal and geochemical studies suggest that the TVG is dormant-active rather than extinct, implying the eruption potential to devastate the nearby area of 7 million inhabitants. Although some geodetic tools (e.g., global positioning system and precise leveling) have been utilized to analyze the activity associated with volcanism, it is still challenging for conventional interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to obtain clear ground surface movement at the TVG due to decorrelation and complex atmospheric delay. In this study, we present an improved multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to explore the temporal evolution and spatial extent of displacement at the TVG from 19 L-band ALOS/PALSAR images acquired between 2007 and 2011. Stratified atmospheric delays and orbit error are corrected with a patch-based joint model as different phase components can be separated according to their distinct spatiotemporal characteristics.

Oftentimes inspection and maintenance costs far exceed available resources, and numerous assets lack any rigorous structural evaluation. Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is a powerful remote-sensing technology, which can provide cheaper deformation measurements for bridges and other transport infrastructure with short revisit times, while scaling from the local to the global scale. As recent studies have shown the InSAR accuracy to be comparable with traditional monitoring instruments, InSAR could offer a cost-effective tool for long-term, near-continuous deformation monitoring, with the possibility to support inspection planning and maintenance prioritisation, while maximising functionality and increasing the resilience of infrastructure networks. However, despite the high potential of InSAR for structural monitoring, some important limitations need to be considered when applying it in reality. This paper identifies and discusses the challenges of using InSAR for the purpose of structural monitoring, with a specific focus on bridges and transport networks. Examples are presented to illustrate current practical limitations of InSAR; possible solutions and promising research directions are identified. The aim of this study is to motivate future action in this area and highlight the InSAR advances needed to overcome current challenges. © 2021 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Cost effectiveness; Deterioration; Hazards; Interferometry; Landslides; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; 'current; Bridge evaluation; Infrastructure monitoring; Inspection and maintenance; Multi-temporal; Recent trends; Safety and hazards; Settlement; Structural monitoring; Transport infrastructure; Deformation","bridge evaluation; deformation; monitoring; safety and hazards; settlement","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123101898"

These disruptions included restricting human movement through local 'lockdowns.' This article applies a multitemporal analysis of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar to evaluate the relationship between restrictions on movement and solid waste production in landfill sites. We selected three landfill sites from Africa, Euro-Asia, and America to assess the impact of restricted mobility on waste production. Our research shows that solid waste production and restrictions on human mobility are significantly correlated. This article indicates that a reduction in human mobility increases human waste production even after accounting for changes in economic activities. The research highlights the benefit of using remote sensing SAR data for monitoring the impact of human activities on the environment.

Two stacks of ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B C-band SAR images were applied to explore the pre-failure characteristics of this event. Advanced time-series InSAR analysis was processed to detect the pre-failure movements of this event, with identifying the spatial-temporal pattern and evolution of the source area of the Maoxian landslide.

In the present study, three monitoring techniques including (i) an automated tracking total station (ATTS), (ii) multi-temporal terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and (iii) space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) are applied to monitor the spatio-temporal displacement patterns of the Vögelsberg landslide (Tyrol, Austria) between 2016/05 and 2020/06. The landslide shows spatially and temporally varying displacement rates with up to 12 cm/a and a mean annual displacement of 4 cm/a. The results show that only the ATTS provides sufficient temporal resolution and spatial accuracy for assessing the temporal behaviour of the landslide's movement. However, ATTS measurements are only available at the installed 53 retro-reflecting prisms. Multi-temporal TLS can provide additional insight into the spatial displacement pattern at various man-made and natural objects such as walls, fences, poles and tree stems. But the respective accuracy and data acquisition intervals do not allow to draw conclusions about the temporal dynamics of the landslide's movement. Results of the InSAR technique based on Sentinel-1 imagery show good agreement with ATTS measurements, but cannot provide real-time information on the landslide's acceleration and deceleration phases.

As a result of extensive groundwater depletion, the NCP has experienced significant land subsidence, which threatens geological stability and infrastructure health and exacerbates the risks of other geohazards. In this study, we employed multi-track Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by the Sentinel-1A (S1A) satellite to detect spatial and temporal distributions of surface deformation in the NCP from 2016 to 2018 based on multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR). The results show that the overall ground displacement ranged from −165.4 mm/yr (subsidence) to 9.9 mm/yr (uplift) with a standard variance of 28.8 mm/yr. During the InSAR monitoring period, the temporal pattern of land subsidence was dominated by a decreasing tendency and the spatial pattern of land subsidence in the coastal plain exhibited an expansion trend. Validation results show that the S1A datasets agree well with levelling data, indicating the reliability of the InSAR results. With groundwater level data, we found that the distribution of subsidence in the NCP is spatially consistent with that of deep groundwater depression cones. A comparison with land use data shows that the agricultural usage of groundwater is the dominant mechanism responsible for land subsidence in the whole study area. Through an integrated analysis of land subsidence distribution characteristics, geological data, and previous research results, we found that other triggering factors, such as active faults, precipitation recharge, urbanization, and oil/gas extraction, have also impacted land subsidence in the NCP to different degrees. © 2020 by the authors.

This study aims to estimate the AGB of the largest single mangrove forest in the Philippines located in the municipality of Del Carmen, Siargao Islands using remotely sensed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) datasets and Sentinel-1 image. There were three predictor variables derived from the Sentinel -1 image used for modeling the AGB: the backscatter value from VV polarization, backscatter value from VH polarization, and the combination of the backscatter values from VV and VH polarizations. Also, the predictor variable from IfSAR dataset that was used is the canopy height. Linear regression between the field-measured AGB and the predictor variables was used to generate AGB model, and the coefficient of determination (r2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were determined. The results show that the model derived from IfSAR data obtained a coefficient of determination of 0.42 and RMSE of 19.39 Mg/ha. However, the combination of the two polarizations derived from Sentinel-1 image was more accurate in estimating AGB since it obtained the highest r2 of 0.43 and lowest RMSE of 12.65 Mg/ha. Based on the best model the estimated above ground biomass of whole mangrove forest ranged from 73.37 Mg/ha to 225.51 Mg/ha with an average of 140.2 Mg/ha.

Here, five sentinel-1 SAR scenes were acquired on different dates using the interferometric wide-swath (IW) mode and a mean incidence angle of 39.02° to build the backscatter temporal-ratio in VV polarization. This algorithm is generally based on the assumption of contributions of soil moisture and surface roughness to the backscattering coefficient under the given radar configurations. In this study, soil moisture is the target variable, and the surface roughness and backscatter temporal-ratio in VV polarization are the auxiliary variables. A cross-semivariogram relationship is formulated among those three spatial variables; then ordinary cokriging is used, based on that cross-semivariogram formula, to estimate the spatial distribution of bare soil moisture content.

MTInSAR data have been acquired in a very long period, between 1992 and 2018 and were analyzed in terms of subsidence rates and deformation time series at building scale. The obtained results show that the oldest buildings are still affected by a deformation rate close to −5 mm/yr, whereas recent buildings register rates around −40 mm/yr. Time series of deformation suggest that the deformation rates decrease over time following time-dependent trend that approximates the typical consolidation curve for compressible soils.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote sensing plays an important role in disaster assessment by means of its all-day and all-weather capability. Mining the characteristics of SAR data and extracting the seismic damage information of buildings are the key issues for successful application of SAR in post-earthquake emergency rescue. This paper uses multi-temporal and dual-polarization Sentinel-IA SAR data to detect the earthquake-induced damage buildings based on the intensity and coherence. Normalized intensity difference and normalized coherence difference are obtained by processing intensity and coherence of VV and VH. The mean of normalized intensity difference and normalized coherence difference are obtained by calculating the mean of normalized intensity difference and normalized coherence difference of dual-polarized data. Establishing discriminant function using the above two mean values from samples selected from intact buildings and collapse buildings randomly.

This paper evaluates the use of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (MT-InSAR) to calculate tunnelling-induced deformations of buildings. The paper introduces a step-by-step procedure to use InSAR displacements as an input to the structural damage assessment. After a comparison between traditional and InSAR monitoring data for the London area during the Crossrail excavation, the high resolution, high density InSAR-based displacements were used to evaluate the building deformations for a number of case studies. Results demonstrate the quality of information provided by InSAR data on soil-structure interaction mechanisms. Such information, essential to evaluate current damage assessment procedures, is typically only collected for relatively few buildings due to the cost of traditional monitoring. A comparison between damage indicators derived from greenfield assumptions and building displacements quantifies the practical benefit of the proposed step-by-step procedure. This work aims at filling the gap between the most recent advances in remote sensing and the civil engineering practice, defining the first step of an automated damage assessment procedure which can impact large scale underground projects in urban areas. © 2018 The Authors.

Monitoring and mapping changes in the distribution of agricultural land covers provide a reliable source of information that helps environmental sustainability and supports agricultural policies. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can contribute considerably to this monitoring effort. The first objective of this research is to extend the use of time series of polarimetric data for land-cover classification using a decision tree classification algorithm. With this aim, RADARSAT-2 (quad-pol) and Sentinel-1 (dual-pol) data were acquired over an area of 600 km2 in central Spain. Ten polarimetric observables were derived from both datasets and seven scenarios were created with different sets of observables to evaluate a multitemporal parcel-based approach for classifying eleven land-cover types, most of which were agricultural crops. The study demonstrates that good overall accuracies, greater than 83%, were achieved for all of the different proposed scenarios and the scenario with all RADARSAT-2 polarimetric observables was the best option (89.1%). Very high accuracies were also obtained when dual-pol data from RADARSAT-2 or Sentinel-1 were used to classify the data, with overall accuracies of 87.1% and 86%, respectively. In terms of individual crop accuracy, rapeseed achieved at least 95% of a producer's accuracy for all scenarios and that was followed by the spring cereals (wheat and barley), which achieved high producer's accuracies (79.9%-95.3%) and user's accuracies (85.5% and 93.7%). © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Crops; Decision trees; Mapping; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Trees (mathematics); Decision tree classification; Environmental sustainability; Land cover classification; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric SAR; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data; Radarsat-2; Sentinel-1; Classification (of information)","Agriculture; C5.0 algorithm;multitemporal; Classification; Polarimetric SAR; RADARSAT-2; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068498330"

In this study, a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method employing optical images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is presented for crop classification for cloudy and rainy regions. Central to this method is the spatial-temporal incorporation of high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal SAR data and deep-learning-based time-series analysis. First, a precise farmland parcel map is delineated from high-resolution optical images. Second, pre-processed SAR intensity images are overlaid onto the parcel map to construct time series of crop growth for each parcel. Third, a deep-learning-based (using the long short-term memory, LSTM, network) classifier is employed to learn time-series features of crops and to classify parcels to produce a final classification map. The method was applied to two datasets of high-resolution ZY-3 images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in Hunan and Guizhou of China. The classification results, with an 5.0% improvement in overall accuracy compared to those of traditional methods, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for parcel-based crop classification for southern China. A further analysis of the relationship between crop calendars and change patterns of time-series intensity indicates that the LSTM model could learn and extract useful features for time-series crop classification. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Guizhou; Hunan; image classification; image resolution; network analysis; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","crop classification; LSTM network; Sentienl-1 SAR; time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068553719"

Sentinel-1 (S1) images provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) can be used to monitor such situations due to its high temporal and spatial resolution and indifference to weather. Though a number of deep learning based methods have been proposed in the literature for change detection (CD) in multi-temporal SAR images, most of them require labeled training data. Collecting sufficient labeled multi-temporal data is not trivial, however S1 provides abundant unlabeled data. To this end, we propose a solution for CD in multi-temporal S1 images based on unsupervised training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Unlabeled single-time image patches are used to train a multilayer convolutional-autoencoder (CAE) in unsupervised fashion by minimizing the reconstruction error between the reconstructed output and the input. The trained multilayer CAE is used to extract multi-scale features from both the pre and post change images that are analyzed for CD. The multi-scale features are fused according to a detail-preserving scale-driven approach that allows us to generate change maps by preserving details. The experiments conducted on a S1 dataset from Brumadinho, Brazil confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 SPIE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Multilayers; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Unsupervised learning; Auto encoders; Change detection; Convolutional neural network; European Space Agency; Learning-based methods; Multi-temporal SAR images; Remote sensing applications; Unsupervised change detection; Image processing","Autoencoder; Change-detection; Convolutional-autoencoder; Convolutional-Neural-Network; Deep learning; Unsupervised change-detection; Unsupervised Learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078109258"

The key idea of the proposed approach is the use of the ratio image, provided by the ratio between an image and the temporal mean of the stack. This ratio image is easier to denoise than a single image thanks to its improved stationarity. Besides, temporally stable thin structures are well preserved thanks to the multitemporal mean. The proposed approach can be divided into three steps: 1) estimation of a 'superimage' by temporal averaging and possibly spatial denoising; 2) denoising of the ratio between the noisy image of interest and the 'superimage'; and 3) computation of the denoised image by remultiplying the denoised ratio by the 'superimage.' Because of the improved spatial stationarity of the ratio images, denoising these ratio images with a speckle-reduction method is more effective than denoising images from the original multitemporal stack. The amount of data that is jointly processed is also reduced compared to other methods through the use of the 'superimage' that sums up the temporal stack. The comparison with several state-of-the-art reference methods shows better results numerically (peak signal-noise-ratio and structure similarity index) as well as visually on simulated and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. The proposed ratio-based denoising framework successfully extends single-image SAR denoising methods to time series by exploiting the persistence of many geometrical structures. © 2019 IEEE.","Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Geometrical structure; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal SAR images; Peak signal noise ratio; Ratio images; Speckle reduction; Structure similarity; superimage; image analysis; numerical method; satellite imagery; signal-to-noise ratio; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; Image denoising","Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) series; ratio image; speckle reduction; superimage","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065731898"

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the utility of Sentinel-1A SAR imagery for characterising land use and land cover (LULC) in Bac Lieu, a rapidly developing province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, to support natural resource management for land use planning and monitoring. Twenty-one SAR images acquired in 2016 were classified in a four-step process. Firstly, the SAR images were pre-processed to produce Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture images. Then, to reduce the effects of rainfall variation confounding the classification, the images were divided into two categories: dry season (Jan–April) and wet season (May–December) and three input image sets were produced: 1) a single-date composite image (two VV-VH bands), 2) a multi-temporal composite image (eight bands for dry season and sixteen bands for wet season) and 3) a multi-temporal and textural composite image (sixteen bands for dry season and thirty two bands for wet season). We then applied Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to characterise urban, forest, aquaculture, and rice paddy field for the three input image sets. We tested a combination of input images and classification algorithms and found that no matter the classification algorithms used, multi-temporal images had a higher overall classification accuracy than single-date images and that differences between classification algorithms were minimal. The most accurate classification resulted from a combination of the SVM classifier and multi-temporal and textural input image sets from the dry and wet seasons; with an overall accuracy of 94.81% and Kappa coefficient of 0.92. Our land cover mapping showed that Bac Lieu province is dominated by shrimp farming and rice paddy fields, with natural coastal forested ecosystems only made up a small proportion of the province. The results demonstrated the potential use of SAR as an up-to-date complementary data source of land cover information for local authorities, to support their land use master plan and to monitor illegal land use changes. Long-term monitoring of land use in Bac Lieu province, as well as in the Mekong Delta, will be crucial for decision makers, to ensure sustainability and food security in this region. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Mekong delta land cover mapping; Multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR; Random forest; Support vector machines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074800167"

Regional snowcover area (SCA) is the basic parameters of hydrological model. In recent years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used in wet snow detection and SCA estimation during the spring melting period for its effectiveness. The absorption of electromagnetic waves by wet snow significantly reduces the SAR backscatter signal, which makes it possible to distinguish between wet snow and dry snow (or no snow). However, in forest areas, the sensitivity of traditional algorithms to detect snow changes is decreased due to the significant change of forest canopy transmittance with time and weather conditions. Based on the measured data of the forest area in northeastern China and the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data, the influence of forest canopy on the C-band backscattering coefficient of SCA is analyzed, and an adaptive SCA estimation algorithm based on the forest backscatter model is introduced in this paper. The backscattering coefficient attenuation caused by the forest canopy can be predicted by the algorithm and the SCA estimation for the corresponding region will be corrected. The results show that the snow cover characteristic is accurately estimated and the SCA of forests in northeastern China is significantly smaller than that of the open area, while the SCA of coniferous forest areas is generally smaller than broadleaf forests areas in the early stage of snowmelt period. © 2019 IEEE.","Backscattering; Electromagnetic waves; Melting; Photonics; Piers; Snow; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscatter model; Backscattering coefficients; Basic parameters; C-band backscattering; Coniferous forests; Estimation algorithm; Hydrological modeling; Snow covered area; Forestry","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082440239"

It is not rare to see that due to the discrepancies on threshold setting, even for the same MTInSAR technique with the same data sets, it will raise different (sometimes quite notable) results and affect the applicability of InSAR techniques. We propose here an integrated MTInSAR estimator that combines the coherent point selection and phase vector unwrapping into a single step. Essentially, the estimator aims to recover the unwrapped phase vector at coherent points. Therefore, it could serve as an alternative solution of spatial-temporal phase unwrapping problem. In the estimator, wrapped phase at all pixels in short baseline interferograms are taken as observations. Starting from the phase differences at arcs of a fully connected network of pixels, based on the residual analysis and spatial closure of phase triangularity, the estimator can detect and delete the arcs having unacceptable phase noise and phase ambiguities. By integrating the phase differences at the remained arcs, the unwrapped phase at coherent points in consecutive acquisition intervals can be obtained. Impressively, the estimator is immune to the bias raised by improper deformation model. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated via semisynthetic and real data tests. Considering that the phase enhancement algorithms (e.g., phase-linking and Extended Minimum Cost Flow-Small BAseline Subset) that can reconstruct high-quality wrapped phases are gaining popularity, the proposed estimator can also be implemented as a postprocessing module of these algorithms for retrieval of unwrapped phase vectors at coherent points. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Cost accounting; Phase noise; Recovery; Vectors; Alternative solutions; Deformation modeling; Distributed scatterers; Fully connected networks; Multi-temporal; Phase consistencies; Phase recovery; Small baseline subsets; algorithm; detection method; integrated approach; phase transition; pixel; synthetic aperture radar; Pixels","Ambiguity detection; coherent points detection multitemporal InSAR (MT-InSAR); phase consistency; unwrapping phase recovery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056601667"

In this study we investigated the potential of combined dual and fully polarized SAR data and performed polarimetric multi-frequency and multi-incidence angle analysis of C-band Sentinel-1, L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) and of C-band Radar Satellite-2 (RADARSAT-2) datasets for the detection of surface and subsurface archaeological structures over the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) site of Gebel Barkal (Sudan). While PALSAR offers a good historical reference, Sentinel-1 time series provide recent and systematic monitoring opportunities. RADARSAT-2 polarimetric data have been specifically acquired in 2012/2013, and have been scheduled to achieve a multi-temporal observation of the archaeological area under study. This work demonstrated how to exploit a complex but significant dataset composed of SAR full polarimetric and dual polarimetric acquisitions, with the purpose of identifying the most suitable earth observation technique for the preservation and identification of archaeological features. The scientific potential of the illustrated analysis fits perfectly with the current delicate needs of cultural heritage; such analysis demonstrates how multi-temporal and multi-data cultural heritage monitoring can be applied not only for documentation purposes, but can be addressed especially to those areas exposed to threats of different nature that require a constant and prompt intervention plans. © 2019 by the authors.","Feature extraction; History; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased-Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS-PALSAR); Archaeology; Cultural heritages; Earth observation techniques; High spatial resolution; SAR polarimetry; UNESCO; United Nations educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization; Space-based radar","Archaeology; Cultural heritage; Radar imaging; SAR polarimetry; UNESCO","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079618814"

Multi-temporal S-1A C-band dual polarization images at 20m resolution covering the wet cropping season over four provinces in the Philippines were acquired from March to November 2018. Field measurements, observations and interviews were conducted on 186 sample fields and mean backscatter values for each of the sampled fields were generated from S-1A data acquired during the season. The reported dates of land preparation and estimated dates of crop growth stages were matched with the corresponding SAR acquisition dates. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to identify growth stages for which there are significant differences in backscatter values between transplanted and direct seeded rice. The results are generally consistent with the findings of a previous study conducted in one province in the Philippines in the dry season of 2017. We found, however, some inconsistencies in terms of the polarization where the significant differences were observed. These findings demonstrate the possibility of discriminating transplanted from direct seeded rice using SAR temporal data but suggests further fine tuning in the methodology is needed for different locations and seasons. © 2020 Authors.","Backscattering; Crops; Polarization; Automated classification; Crop establishment; Crop management practices; Direct-seeding; Dual-polarizations; Mann-Whitney U test; Philippines; transplanting; Synthetic aperture radar","Crop establishment; direct seeding; Philippines; SAR; transplanting","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081593089"

Most researchers in this area have focused on exploring the ability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensors to identify crops. This paper uses multi-source (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8) and multi-temporal data to identify crop types. The change detection method was used to analyze spectral and indices information in time series. Significant differences in crop growth status during the growing season were found. Then, three obviously differentiated time features were extracted. Three advanced machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network, and Random Forest, RF) were used to identify the crop types. The results showed that the detection of (Vertical-vertical) VV, (Vertical-horizontal) VH, and Cross Ratio (CR) changes was effective for identifying land cover. Moreover, the red-edge changes were obviously different according to crop growth periods. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 showed different normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes also. By using single remote sensing data to classify crops, Sentinel-2 produced the highest overall accuracy (0.91) and Kappa coefficient (0.89). The combination of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 data provided the best overall accuracy (0.93) and Kappa coefficient (0.91). The RF method had the best performance in terms of identity classification. In addition, the indices feature dominated the classification results. The combination of phenological period information with multi-source remote sensing data can be used to explore a crop area and its status in the growing season. The results of crop classification can be used to analyze the density and distribution of crops. This study can also allow to determine crop growth status, improve crop yield estimation accuracy, and provide a basis for crop management. © 2019 by the authors.

The importance of identifying such deformations is not only related to the hazard they can pose, but also to the understanding of changes that permafrost or local hydrological conditions undergo. Here, we carry out a multi-temporal InSAR analysis over a mountainous area 8000 km2 large, straddling north-western Bhutan and southern Tibet. We propose a methodology to separate locally deforming areas from the effects of long-wavelength signals through the analysis of the spatio-temporal behaviour of 4-years long time series of surface displacements. We present the mapping of hundreds of small-scale features that appear to be actively deforming, as well as several examples of reversible deformation rarely detected at this scale in such a challenging and vast region. The analysis of the multi-annual trend of ground deformation shows a relatively small number of irreversible gravitational movements clearly related to rock slides which attests a low level of recent activity of large rock slope instabilities in the region. In the southernmost, lower elevation parts of the study area, we quantify reversible surface displacements with amplitudes ranging between 5 and 17 mm, and showing maximum displacements towards the satellite in summer months, thus compatible with hydro-mechanical effects related to groundwater table variations. In addition, the ground movement induced by the active layer's response to thawing and freezing over the gentler slopes and high-elevation permafrost regions of Bhutan and southern Tibet is on average around 10 mm, with maxima up to 28 mm. The localised displacements appear to be largely associated to braided stream plains, glacier outwash plains or low angle, fine sediment covered slopes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bhutan; Himalayas; Deformation; Freezing; Groundwater; Indium compounds; Permafrost; Signal analysis; Surface measurement; Thawing; Bhutan; Freeze-thaw cycles; Multi-temporal; Reversible deformation; Rock slides; Slope instability; crustal deformation; displacement; freeze-thaw cycle; freezing; ground movement; outwash; permafrost; satellite data; slope stability; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; thawing; time series; time series analysis; Time series analysis","Bhutan; Freeze-thaw cycles; Groundwater effects; Multitemporal InSAR analyses; Reversible deformation; Rock slides; Slope instability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071919212"

A remote sensing-based detection of different rice crop management practices, such as crop establishment method (transplanting or direct seeding), can provide timely and cost-effective information on which practices are used as well as their spread and change over time as different management practices are adopted. Establishment method cannot be easily observed since it is a rapid event, but it can be inferred from resulting observable differences in land surface characteristics (i.e. field condition) and crop development (i.e. delayed or prolonged stages) that take place over a longer time. To examine this, we used temporal information from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter to detect differences in field condition and rice growth, then related those to crop establishment practices in Nueva Ecija (Philippines). Specifically, multi-temporal, dual-polarised, C-band backscatter data at 20m spatial resolution was acquired from Sentinel-1A every 12 days over the study area during the dry season, from November 2016 to May 2017. Farmer surveys and field observations were conducted in four selected municipalities across the study area in 2017, providing information on field boundaries and crop management practices for 61 fields. Mean backscatter values were generated per rice field per SAR acquisition date. We matched the SAR acquisition dates with the reported dates for land management activities and with the estimated dates for when the crop growth stages occurred. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify significant differences in backscatter between the two practices during the land management activities and crop growth stages. Significant differences in cross-polarised, co-polarised and band ratio backscatter values were observed in the early growing season, specifically during land preparation, crop establishment, rice tillering and stem elongation. These findings indicate the possibility to discriminate crop establishment methods by SAR at those stages, suggesting that there is more opportunity for discrimination than has been presented in previous studies. Further testing in a wider range of environments, seasons, and management practices should be done to determine how reliably rice establishment methods can be detected. The increased use of dry and wet direct seeding has implications for many remote sensing-based rice detection methods that rely on a strong water signal (typical of transplanting) during the early season. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Central Luzon; Nueva Ecija; Philippines; agricultural development; backscatter; crop production; detection method; rice; satellite data; Sentinel; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar","Direct seeding; Philippines; Rice; SAR; Sentinel-1; Transplanting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062885731"

The proposed method uses a scattering covariance matrix of each image patch as the basic processing unit, which can exploit both the amplitude information of each pixel and the phase difference between any two pixels in a patch. The proposed filtering framework consists of four main steps: (1) a prefiltering result of each image is obtained by a nonlocal weighted average using only the information of the corresponding time phase; (2) an adaptively temporal linear filter is employed to further suppress the speckle; (3) the final output of each patch is obtained by a guided filter using both the original speckled data and the filtering result of step 3; and (4) an aggregation step is used to tackle the multiple estimations problem for each pixel. The despeckling experiments conducted on both simulated and real multitemporal SAR datasets reveal the pleasing performance of the proposed method in both suppressing speckle and retaining details, when compared with both advanced single-temporal and multitemporal SAR despeckling techniques. © 2019 by the authors.

In this work, we apply a multi-source feature data approach to investigate the urban area of Istanbul, Turkey which is a megacity with an approximate 15 million inhabitant, and under strong both anthropogenic and natural pressures. In order to analyse and compare the spatial pattern of the urban footprint, different techniques are applied. Speckle divergence, backscatter and repeat pass interferometric coherence values are considered for the analysis. To this aim, L-band HH and HV polarized ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired from Japan Space Exploration Agency's (JAXA). Pixel based Random Forest Classification method was used for the urban mapping. During the classification, different scenarios have been applied using speckle divergence, backscatter and coherence information. Overall, user and producer accuracies were calculated from the error matrix. While comparing HH and HV polarimetry, in each scenario HH provided much higher accuracies than HV results. Speckle divergence and backscatter values yielded similar accuracies which is around 88% for urban class. However, coherence gave approximately 69% while it is classified individually. The contribution of coherence was extracted while coherence was stacked with speckle divergence, and the result was improved to 91%. The urban areas was extracted with a maximum accuracy of maximum 93% while all information was combined.

In particular, persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) can be used to measure land subsidence accurately over a wide area from multi-temporal SAR images. However, the estimated displacement is obtained only in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction, making it necessary to develop a method for measuring three-dimensional displacements by combining multidirectional observations. Therefore, we propose herein a method for estimating three-dimensional displacement velocities by combining the results from PSI and geodetic deformation measurements, namely, Global Positioning System and leveling data.

In validation, the rootmean- square errors are 14, 16, and 14 mm/year for the east-west, north-south, and vertical components, respectively, showing that combining PSI results and geodetic deformation measurements is effective for monitoring land subsidence. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

The effect of the cyclone 'Titli' and heavy rains during first fortnight of October 2018 in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh State has been demonstrated using geo-spatial technology in terms of flood inundated rice area and corresponding yield and production loss. The pre- and post-cyclone (5 and 13 October 2018) flood inundation maps were generated using Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data respectively. The pre-cyclone rice area estimates were derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data, while yield forecast is based on the combination of satellite observations and yield simulation using ORYZA crop growth model. An intensive ground truth data collection had been carried out for the validation of satellite-derived rice area estimation of pre-cyclone event. An accuracy assessment has been carried out for district, mandal and village level. An overall accuracy of 96% with kappa coefficient 0.92 has been achieved. With the help map flood inundation and rice area maps, mandal-wise flood affected rice area and corresponding yield loss have been estimated. The post-cyclone ground truth data had been collected for quantitative assessment of crop damaged area. An overall accuracy of the flood affected rice map was 85% with kappa coefficient 0.70. It was estimated that rice crop damage assessment with SAR data indicated 53312 ha out of 205174 ha were affected and corresponding estimated yield as well as production are 0.8 t/ha and 189160 t respectively. © Authors 2019.

Specifically, in the framework of SFAE, unsupervised layer-wise feature learning and supervised fine-tuning are jointly performed when training the network. The trained network can be used to detect the changes in both of the single and multi-polarization SAR datasets in real-time. The proposed SFAE has two advantages. The first one is to expand the stacked autoencoder to suit the environment with the multiplicative noise in SAR change detection. The second is that the features extracted by SFAE are more discriminative than the original stacked autoencoder due to that Fisher discriminant criterion is incorporated into SFAE. The results on the simulated and real SAR datasets indicate that the proposed SFAE algorithm has a significant advantage on multitemporal single/multi-polarization SAR (SAR/PolSAR) change detection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Image denoising; Learning systems; Auto encoders; Change detection; Feature learning; Fisher criterion; Fisher discriminant criterion; Multi-polarization; Multi-temporal; Multiplicative noise; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; Fisher criterion; Stacked autoencoder (SAE); Stacked fisher autoencoder (SFAE); Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069724358"

It mainly aim at generating a difference image (DI) in the feature learning procedure by stacked auto-encoders (SAEs). Stacked auto-encoders, as one kind of deep neural network, can learn feature maps that retain the structural information but suppress the noise in the SAR images, which will be beneficial for DI generation. Compared with shallow network, the proposed framework can extract more available features, and be favorable for getting better change results. Different with other common deep neural networks, our proposed method does not need labeled data to train the network. In addition, we find a subset of the entire samples that appropriately represent the whole dataset to speed up the training of the deep neural network without under-fitting. Moreover, we design a fusion network structure that can combine ratio operator based method to ensure that the representations of higher layers are better than that of the lower ones. To summarize, the main contribution of our work lies in using of deep fusion network for generation of DI in a fast and unsupervised way.

We introduce a novel approach for the generation of large-scale thematic maps, based on the use of multi-temporal data, acquired over short observation intervals (short-time-series). A larger interferometric coherence loss is expected with the increasing time difference between two interferometric acquisitions. This phenomenon is normally indicated as temporal decorrelation whose amount differs depending on the type of imaged target on ground. The basic idea is therefore to accurately model the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation and use the estimated parameters, together with backscatter, as input features for the Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm.

Repeated attempts at classifying dense wetland vegetation has often failed to produce a high-quality product because of poor penetration of electromagnetic signals that cannot detect sub-surface water, and because of associated redundant information. In this study, a two-step classification procedure was developed for classifying typical coastal plain wetlands from multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR)-1 data. First, a new statistical strategy for feature selection was proposed by combining manual and automatic selection according to the backscattering mechanism differences between various land-cover types. Then the Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to evaluate the established feature combinations for wetland classification. The experimental results show that the method described has high classification accuracies over the test site, with overall accuracies and kappa coefficients (κ) of above 89.79% and 0.88, respectively.

As Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are now both operating in twin mode, they can provide an unprecedented data source to build dense spatial and temporal high-resolution time series across a variety of wavelengths. This study investigates (i) the ability of the individual sensors and (ii) their joint potential to delineate forest cover for study sites in two highly varied landscapes located in Germany (temperate dense mixed forests) and South Africa (open savanna woody vegetation and forest plantations). We used multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and single time steps of Sentinel-2 data in combination to derive accurate forest/non-forest (FNF) information via machine-learning classifiers. The forest classification accuracies were 90.9% and 93.2% for South Africa and Thuringia, respectively, estimated while using autocorrelation corrected spatial cross-validation (CV) for the fused data set. Sentinel-1 only classifications provided the lowest overall accuracy of 87.5%, while Sentinel-2 based classifications led to higher accuracies of 91.9%. Sentinel-2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels, biophysical parameters (Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR)) and the lower spectrum of the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series were found to be most distinctive in the detection of forest cover. In contrast to homogenous forests sites, Sentinel-1 time series information improved forest cover predictions in open savanna-like environments with heterogeneous regional features. The presented approach proved to be robust and it displayed the benefit of fusing optical and SAR data at high spatial resolution. © 2020 by the authors.","Data fusion; Forestry; Infrared radiation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Forest cover; Germany; Savanna; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Temperate forests; Classification (of information)","Data fusion; Forest cover; Germany; Machine-learning; Savanna; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; South Africa; Temperate forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081077628"

Most MT-InSAR methods select scatterers with high coherence throughout the entire time series. However, as time series lengthen, inevitable changes in surface scattering lead to decorrelation, which systematically decreases the number of coherent scatterers. Here, we propose a novel method to detect and process temporary coherent scatterers (TCS) by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Two hypothesis tests are developed for amplitude analysis in order to identify the moments of appearing and/or disappearing coherent scatterers. Based on the amplitude analysis, the parameters of interest are then estimated using the interferometric phase. An optimized adaptive temporal subset approach is proposed to improve the precision of the estimated parameters. If the scatterers are not evenly distributed over the area, a secondary (support) network is designed to improve the spatial point distribution. The main advantage of this method is the reliable extraction of a subset of time series without using any contextual information. Experimental results show that the TCSs significantly increase the number of observations for displacement monitoring and improve the change detection capability in urban construction areas. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Coherent scattering; Interferometry; Parameter estimation; Surface scattering; Time series; Change detection; Coherent scatterers; Contextual information; Displacement monitoring; Interferometric phase; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Rayleigh distributions; amplitude; precision; satellite altimetry; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; urban area; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; multi-temporal InSAR; Rayleigh distribution; temporary coherent scatterer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073469491"

In the absence of the data in Western Area, Sierra Leone (Africa), the SBAS-InSAR technique was applied for detecting the ground deformation using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR datasets from July 2015 to August 2017. The derived slope displacements coupled with the geomorphological evidence in the ancillary data are used to map the possible landslides in the area. The density ratio technique was used to generate landslide parameter class values. The values are aggregated to create the LS map and the result validated using the degree of fit and the error index.

This article present the different results obtained by the multi-temporal methods using the Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are suitable tools for flood mapping thanks to their daytime and nighttime and almost all-weather imaging capability, in addition to their sensitivity to surface roughness and to Flood monitoring.

However, the current operational services are mainly focused on flood in rural areas and flooded urban areas are less considered. In practice, urban flood mapping is challenging due to the complicated backscattering mechanisms in urban environments and in addition to SAR intensity other information is required. This paper introduces an unsupervised method for flood detection in urban areas by synergistically using SAR intensity and interferometric coherence under the Bayesian network fusion framework. It leverages multi-temporal intensity and coherence conjunctively to extract flood information of varying flooded landscapes. The proposed method is tested on the Houston (US) 2017 flood event with Sentinel-1 data and Joso (Japan) 2015 flood event with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data. The flood maps produced by the fusion of intensity and coherence and intensity alone are validated by comparison against high-resolution aerial photographs. The results show an overall accuracy of 94.5% (93.7%) and a kappa coefficient of 0.68 (0.60) for the Houston case, and an overall accuracy of 89.6% (86.0%) and a kappa coefficient of 0.72 (0.61) for the Joso case with the fusion of intensity and coherence (only intensity). The experiments demonstrate that coherence provides valuable information in addition to intensity in urban flood mapping and the proposed method could be a useful tool for urban flood mapping tasks. © 2019 by the authors.","Antennas; Bayesian networks; Floods; Interferometry; Mapping; Aerial Photographs; Emergency response; Interferometric coherence; Operational service; Overall accuracies; Unsupervised method; Urban environments; Urban floods; Synthetic aperture radar","Bayesian network; InSAR coherence; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Urban flood mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073441356"

Faulting-induced property damages have become more pronounced over the last few years, necessitating further investigation of these faults. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been proved to be an effective way for mapping deformations along and/or across fault traces. However, extracting short-wavelength small-amplitude creep signal (about 10-20 mm/yr) from long time span interferograms is extremely diffcult, especially in agricultural or vegetated areas. This study aims to position, map and monitor the rate, extent, and temporal evolution of faulting over GH at the highest spatial density using Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) technique. The MTI method, which maximizes usable signal and correlation, has the ability to identify and monitor faulting and provide accurate and detailed depiction of active faults. Two neighboring L-band Advanced Land Observing (ALOS) tracks (2007-2011) are utilized in this research. Numerous areas of sharp phase discontinuities have been discerned from MTI-derived velocity map. InSAR measurements allow us to position both previously known faults traces as well as nucleation of new fractures not previously revealed by other ground/space techniques. Faulting damages and surface scarps were evident at most InSAR-mapped fault locations through our site investigations. The newly discovered fault activation appears to be related to excessive groundwater exploitation from the Jasper aquifer in Montgomery County. The continuous mining of groundwater from the Jasper aquifer formed new water-level decline cones over Montgomery County, corroborating the intensity of new fractures. Finally, we elaborate the localized fault activities and evaluate the characteristics of faulting (locking depth and slip rate) through modeling MTI-derived deformation maps. The SW-NE-oriented faults pertain to normal faulting with an average slip rate of 7-13 mm/yr at a shallow locking depth of less than 4 km. Identifying and characterizing active faults through MTI and deformation modeling can provide insights into faulting, its causal mechanism and potential damages to infrastructure over the GH. © 2019 by the authors.","Aquifers; Creep; Faulting; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Interferometry; Locks (fasteners); Quartz; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Deformation modeling; Groundwater exploitation; Houston; InSAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Phase-discontinuities; Site investigations; Time-span interferograms; Fault slips","Faulting; Groundwater; Houston; InSAR; Subsidence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068120439"

This has resulted in many different investigations and improvements in crop growth monitoring, crop disaster prediction and providing accurate information to precise farming. In this study, a time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR images were acquired throughout the agricultural season synchronously with the field measurements to investigate the temporal backscatter changes for different crop types. From the backscattering analysis, it was observed that each similar crop type in different test fields due to the distinct methods of irrigation and fertilization has shown different intensity values. However, they all follow a roughly identical backscattering trend during growing stages of the crop and useful information can be extracted, such as estimating irrigation and harvesting time according to the changes made in backscatters. In comparing with ascending orbit in VH and VV polarizations it has indicated that the homogeneity between SAR backscatters is high for each field with the same crop type in descending pass direction with VH polarization. In contrary, high-intensity values are recorded in VV polarization for entire crop types. It is also observed that polarimetric composite images for a different date are useful to roughly identify crop types, and validated with the application of classification methods in the study area. As preliminary results, it is demonstrated that SAR data provide useful information about crops status. Hence, Sentinel-1 SAR data are ideal preference due to its free availability and constant long-term data archive. © 2019 R.

We used multi-source and multi-track satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques to reconstruct the coseismic displacement field from different line-of-sight geometries. To reduce the phase artifacts, we employed multi-temporal scenes acquired by Sentinel-1, and reconstructed the coseismic deformation through a temporal averaging strategy. Together with a single interferometric pair obtained using the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR2) sensor aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS2), we obtained five displacement maps with slightly different viewing geometries; all of which were used to constrain a geodetic inversion to retrieve the fault geometry parameters and slip distribution. Based on the focal mechanism and regional geology, we constructed multiple fault models that differ in dip direction (south and north dipping), and various striking angles. Both models fit the InSAR displacement maps, but have slip distributions of different depths. The slip depth of the south dipping model, with a dip of ~42°, is the most consistent with the relocated earthquake sequence and regional geological structure. Through the geodetic inversion, the maximum slip (0.25 m) occurred at 14.05 km and the associated rake was 89.56°. The result implies that the seismogenic fault is a blind thrust fault north of KPF (towards the foreland). Considering the relative locations of the suggested blind fault, the KPF, and the continuing north to south (N-S) shortening of the Tian Shan Mountains, this fault could be formed by the northward propagation of the regional fold-thrust belt. © 2019 by the authors.","Deformation; Earthquakes; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Geometry; Interferometry; Landforms; Radar imaging; Radar tracking; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced land observing satellites; Co-seismic displacement; Coseismic deformation; InSAR; Line-of-sight geometries; Northern Tian Shan; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Faulting","Coseismic deformation; InSAR; Jinghe earthquake; Northern Tian Shan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072632343"

The more favorable weather conditions, in comparison to the characteristic conditions of temperate regions, permit higher flexibility in land use, planning, and management, which implies complex crop dynamics. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover prevents the use of optical data during large periods of the year, making SAR data an attractive alternative for crop mapping in tropical regions. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) techniques for crop recognition from multi-date SAR images from tropical regions. Three DL strategies are investigated: autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and fully-convolutional networks. The paper further proposes a post-classification technique to enforce prior knowledge about crop dynamics in the target area.

Four multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based high-resolution images and digital elevation models (DEMs) before and after the landslides were obtained and merged. The initial deformation of the two landslides can be clearly captured by optical remote-sensing images and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis. The depth-integrated continuum method was adopted to analyze the dynamic process of both landslides, using the same basal friction angle and cohesion.

Multi-temporal Sentinel 1A GRD data at VV and VH polarizations and SLC products were acquired for the study area at 12 days interval and processed using MAPscape-RICE software. Multi-temporal Sentinel 1A data was used to identify the backscattering dB curve of maize crop. Analysis of temporal signatures of the crop showed minimum values at sowing period and maximum during the tasseling stage, which decreased during maturity stage of the crop. The maximum increase in the signature was observed during seedling to vegetative growth period. The signature derived from dB values for maize crop expressed a significant temporal behavior with the range of -21.26 to-13.18 in VH polarization and -14.05 to -6.54 in VV polarization. Considering the accuracy of SAR data to phenological variations of maize growing period, Multi-Temporal Features were extracted from multi-temporal dB images of VV and VH polarization and coherence images. Multi-Temporal Features viz., max, min, mean, max date, min date and span ratio were extracted from VV and VH polarizations of Sentinel 1A GRD and SLC data to classify maize pixels in the study area using parameterized classification approach.

The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multi-temporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82. In cases with pairs of classes that are difficult to separate, such as barley and wheat, MBTC is shown to be superior in this research application. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Canada; Carman; London [Ontario]; Manitoba; Ontario [Canada]; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Belt drives; Binary trees; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Image classification; Lagrange multipliers; Machine learning; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification framework; Comprehensive assessment; Machine learning methods; Polarimetric parameters; Polarimetric SAR; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; Scattering mechanisms; accuracy assessment; classification; decomposition analysis; machine learning; optimization; parameterization; RADARSAT; satellite imagery; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; Learning algorithms","Binary-tree classification; Optimum scattering mechanism; Polarimetric SAR; RADARSAT-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074092122"

In this study, ground deformation of the Bolvadin region is analyzed by means of multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits between October 2014 and October 2018 are processed with the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) open source software tools. Deformation velocity maps and line-of-sight (LOS) displacement time series are produced and compared with geology, groundwater level and the water surface area of Eber Lake nearby. Deformation velocity maps reveal significant subsidence in most of the town and surrounding regions, which is confirmed by field observations that show severe damage to the settlements and infrastructure of the town. The most severe subsidence is observed to be in the southern part of Bolvadin with rates up to 35 mm/year, which is characterized by the presence of soft alluvial deposits. Composed of slope debris/talus and conglomerate, the northeastern part of the deforming region experiences a relatively lower rate of subsidence. A strong correlation between LOS displacement time series and groundwater level exists both in the short and long term. Moreover, short term variations in LOS displacement time series also show high similarity with seasonal variations in the water surface area of Eber Lake located a few km southeast of the town. We conclude that the primary cause of subsidence is most probably the overexploitation of groundwater and hydrological changes because of (1) the strong correlation of subsidence with lithological units, (2) the similarity between deformation rate and groundwater level changes, (3) the correspondence of seasonal variations in water surface area and short-term deformation rate oscillations, and (4) the absence of InSAR velocity contrast across the active faults. © 2019 by the authors.","Application programs; Deformation; Faulting; Groundwater; Lakes; Lithology; Open source software; Open systems; Subsidence; Time series analysis; Application platforms; Bolvadin; Displacement time series; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-1; Short-term variations; Synthetic aperture radar","Bolvadin; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal InSAR; Sentinel-1; Time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065736599"

The objective of this study is to monitor crop phenology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric decompositions and a random forest algorithm applied to a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset, acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB). The model-based and eigen-based polarimetric parameters are used to separate the vegetation and soil scattering contributions in the total radar signal. As the crop morphological shape and structure vary with phenological growth, our study assumes that the polarimetric parameters related to the volume scattering mechanism have the potential to track the crop phenology. The sensitivity of the polarimetric parameters to the ground identified crop phenology is analyzed for different crop types. For canola, a single polarimetric parameter is sufficient to characterize the crop phenology, due to the high volume scattering power and large temporal dynamic. For corn, soybean and wheat, combinations of multiple polarimetric parameters are required. For each crop type, the Random Forest algorithm trained using 60% of the data is used to retrieve the crop phenology. Performances are compared to Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression and k-Nearest neighborhood algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm provides the best phenology retrieval with significant (p-value < 0.01) spearman correlation coefficients (between the retrieved and ground identified phenology) of 0.93, 0.90, 0.85 and 0.91 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. While a single polarimetric parameter demonstrates limited sensitivity to corn phenology, the retrieved phenology from the Random Forest algorithm using multiple polarimetric parameters agrees well with the ground measurements. Furthermore, the importance of different polarimetric parameters for phenology retrieval using the Random Forest algorithm is quantified for different crop types. These findings will be of interest in developing future analytical retrieval models. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Canada; Manitoba; Brassica napus var. napus; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Biology; Crops; Decision trees; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Polarimeters; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Crop phenology; Polarimetric decomposition; Radarsat-2; Random forest algorithm; SMAPVEX16-MB; algorithm; data acquisition; decomposition analysis; model validation; phenology; RADARSAT; satellite data; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation classification; Parameter estimation","Crop phenology; Polarimetric decompositions; RADARSAT-2; Random Forest algorithm; SMAPVEX16-MB","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066816725"

Accurate prediction of STN content is essential for the sustainable use of soil resources. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a promising source of data for soil monitoring because of its all-weather, all-day monitoring, but it has rarely been used for STN mapping. In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN by evaluating and comparing the performance of boosted regression trees (BRTs), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models in STN mapping in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. Fifteen predictor variables were used to construct models, including land use/land cover, multi-source remote sensing-derived variables, and topographic and climatic variables. We evaluated the prediction accuracy of the models based on a cross-validation procedure. Results showed that tree-based models (RF and BRT) outperformed SVM. Compared to the model that only used optical data, the addition of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data using the BRT method improved the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) by 17.2% and 17.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of all predictor variables using the BRT model had the best predictive performance, explaining 57% of the variation in STN, with the highest R2 (0.57) value and the lowest RMSE (0.24) and MAE (0.18) values. Remote sensing variables were the most important environmental variables for STN mapping, with 59% and 50% relative importance in the RF and BRT models, respectively. Our results show the potential of using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to predict STN, broadening the data source for future digital soil mapping.

The method takes advantage of back-projection tomography to ease translation of the 2-D location of the targets into their corresponding 3-D location and vice versa.

To remove signal decorrelation issues of DInSAR, Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) has come into practice over the last decade that can measure deformation at small scales and fine accuracy (mm-level). In this paper, we estimate ground deformation of Kolkata, India during 2007-2011 using a spatial correlation based PSInSAR method. Twenty L-band (ALOS PALSAR) SAR images along ascending orbit over Kolkata city were utilised to extract deformation time series, and a validation exercise was carried out using groundwater level data of two wells. PSInSAR extracted a large number of measurement points (363 per km2 for a total 568014 points), and we found a mean annual deformation rate of -16 to +16 mm/year in Kolkata area along Line-Of-Sight (LOS) of ALOS PALSAR.

Majority of agricultural professionals rarely capture the cropping patterns necessary to promote Good Agricultural Practises. Objective of this research is to explore the potential of mapping cropping patterns occurring on different field parcels on small-scale farmlands in Zimbabwe. The first study location under investigation are the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) research station and a few neighboring fields, the second is Middle Sabi Estate. Fourier time series modeling was implemented to determine the trends befalling on the two study sites. Results reveal that Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series allow detection of subtle changes that occur to the crops and fields respectively, hence can be utilized to detect cropping patterns on small-scale farmlands. Discrimination of the main crops (maize and soybean) grown at CIMMYT was possible, and crop rotation was synthesized where sowing starts in November. A single cropping of early and late crops was observed, there were no winter crops planted during the investigation period. At Middle Sabi Estate, single cropping on perennial sugarcane fields and triple cropping of fields growing leafy vegetables, tomatoes and onions were observed. Classification of stacked images was used to derive the crop rotation maps representing what is practised at the farming lands. Random forest classification of the multi-temporal image stacks achieved overall accuracies of 99% and 95% on the respective study sites. In conclusion, Sentinel-1 time series can be implemented effectively to map the cropping patterns and crop rotations occurring on small-scale farming land. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 SAR multi-temporal data to spatially explicitly map cropping patterns of single-, double- and triple-cropping systems on both small-scale and large-scale farming areas to ensure food security. © 2019, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Zimbabwe; Glycine max; Lycopersicon esculentum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; agricultural land; alternative agriculture; backscatter; mapping method; satellite data; Sentinel; smallholder; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","cropping patterns; polarized backscatter; Sentinel-1 SAR; time series; Zimbabwe","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068762118"

Parameterised classification with multi-temporal features derived from regularly acquired, C-band, VV and VH polarized Sentinel-1A SAR imagery was used for mapping rice area. A fully automated processing chain in MAPscape-Rice software was used to convert the multi-temporal SAR data into terrain-JHRFRGHG ı YDOXHV which included strip mosaicking, co-registration of images acquired with the same observation geometry and mode, time-series speckle filtering, terrain geocoding, radiometric calibration and normalization. Further Anisotropic non-linear diffusion (ANLD) filtering was done to smoothen homogeneous targets, while enhancing the difference between neighbouring areas. Multi-Temporal Features viz., max, min, mean, max date, min date and span ratio were extracted from VV and VH polarizations to classify rice pixels. Rice detection was based on the analysis of temporal signature from SAR backscatter in relation to crop stages. About sixty images across four footprints covering 16 samba (Rabi) rice growing districts of Tamil Nadu, India were obtained between August 2017 and January2018. In-season site visits were conducted across 280 monitoring locations in the footprints for classification purposes and more than 1665 field observations were made for accuracy assessment. A total rice area of 1.07 million ha was mapped with classification accuracy from 90.3 to 94.2 per cent with Kappa values ranging from 0.81 to 0.88. Using ORYZA2000, a weather driven process based crop growth simulation model developed by IRRI, yield estimates were made by integrating remote sensing products viz., seasonal rice area, start of season and backscatter time series. By generating average backscatter for each time series and dB stack for each SoS, LAI values were estimated. The model has generated rice yield estimate for each hectare which were aggregated at administrative boundary level and compared against CCE yield. Yield Simulation accuracy of more than 86-91% at district level and 82-97% at block level from the study indicates the suitability of these products for policy decisions. SAR products and yield information were used to meet the requirements of PMFBY crop insurance scheme in Tamil Nadu and helped in identifying or invoking prevented/failed sowing in 529 villages and total crop failure in 821 villages. In total 303703 farmers were benefitted by this technology in getting payouts of INR 9.94 billion through crop insurance. The satellite technology as an operational service has helped in getting quicker payouts. © Authors 2019.

However, moving back more than a thousand years, the real pioneers of remote observation were probably the Nasca, a pre-Hispanic civilization living in southern Peru, between 100BC and 700 AD. They used ‘earth observation’ as a mean of cultural expression drawing the geoglyphs (known as Nasca Lines) only visible from above. These drawings were made on flat desert surface of the Pampa by removing or clearing sand or stones, to create paths for ritual functions to please the gods and create harmonious relationships between man and environment. In this paper, the Nasca geoglyphs in Pampa de Atarco, are object of remote sensing based investigations with the twofold aim to identify and characterize them as well as to analyse and monitor their fragile state of conservation, threatened mainly by vandalism and off road vehicles. The approach herein proposed includes the integration and reuse of diverse remote sensing dataset, from multispectral satellite to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based LSAR data and close range photogrammetry. In particular, a multidate (2002–2013) very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite dataset has been processed in the spatial and temporal domain using textural indicators, including Skewness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and automatic classification tools which allowed us to enhance the visibility of disturbance features and to automatically extract them. The best results in terms of enhancement and automatic extraction capability of disturbance features have been obtained by Skewness. Moreover, the reuse of UAV L SAR-based correlation map, available free of charge from NASA, provided useful information on the state of disturbance from 2013 to 2015, widening the observation time window of the VHR satellite data set from 2002 to 2013. Finally, the integrated use of satellite VHR data with UAV-based photographs and DTMs, processed using structure from motion (SfM), allowed us to characterize, identify and reconstruct the relative chronological sequence of geoglyphs thus providing new insights and opening new perspectives for archaeological studies. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Ica; Nazca; Peru; Aerial photography; Antennas; Classification (of information); Data handling; Higher order statistics; Integration; Military operations; Military photography; Monitoring; NASA; Off road vehicles; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Automatic classification; Chronological sequences; Close range photogrammetry; Multi-temporal; Nasca geoglyphs; Observation time windows; Pampa de atarco; State of conservations; aerial photography; civilization; environmental monitoring; knowledge; nature-society relations; principal component analysis; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; unmanned vehicle; Principal component analysis","Integration; Monitoring; Nasca geoglyphs; Pampa de atarco; Principal component analysis; Satellite multitemporal textural analysis; Synthetic aperture radar; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074655608"

Nevertheless, this is a misunderstanding because 1) we have proven that the difference images before and after logarithmic transformation have the same receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; and 2) by comparing their capability in detecting different change types, we figured out the reason of the inaccurate results is that there are two intensity change types in multi-temporal SAR images and many scholars regarded them as one type (intensity increasing or decreasing).

Analysis of multi-temporal backscatter characteristics based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provides an effective approach to spatially map maize on a regional scale. Accordingly, we acquired nine European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR dual-polarimetric (VV and VH) radar time series data at a 20 m spatial resolution for a segment of the North China Plain in 2016. After observing variability in C-Band VV and VH backscattering coefficients and analysing microwave backscattering characteristics for different structures at different growth and development stages, as well as a comparison between different crops, we selected the optimum temporal phases to construct Sentinel-1A SAR time series data sequences for classification. To assess the performance of different polarization modes in identifying maize, both single- and dual-polarimetric data were used. Results showed that a high-recognition accuracy could be achieved for maize using SAR time series data. Specifically, long-sequenced dual-polarimetric SAR time series data performed better with an overall accuracy of 93.57% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92 compared to dual-polarimetric SAR data from July (45.13% and 0.34, respectively). Although an increment increase in the number of images used improved overall accuracy, more than five could result in an increase in errors. Single-polarimetric data from a single temporal phase yielded an accuracy of only 31.58%. Additionally, classification accuracy obtained by applying dual-polarization could be improved by 13% compared to single-polarimetric SAR data from a single temporal phase time acquisition alone.

Recent research has demonstrated that the change detection methodologies using satellite images, such as multi-temporal visible light remote sensing image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, are particularly useful for damage assessment after various disasters, e.g., earthquakes, fires, floods, and landslides. The level set method, because of its implicit handling of topological changes and low sensitivity to noise, is one of the most effective unsupervised change detection techniques for satellite images. The signed pressure force function (SPF) improved the performances of conventional level set methods through including two grayscale parameters, i.e., the average pixel intensity inside and outside the contour, respectively. However, the mean of region pixel intensity is not a good indicator in case that the images are inhomogeneities grayscale, e.g., confused-edge objects in satellite images. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel model, denoted as dynamic SPF (D-SPF) model, which can dynamically learn a discriminative indicator for distinguishing the pixels inside or outside the contour. Specifically, the principle of maximizing entropy between the regions inside and outside the contour is used to learn the K distinguish parameters, which help to guide the segmentation contour to end on the object’s edge. The experiments are conducted on a public satellite image dataset, i.e., ERS, which contain 670 SAR and 670 optical images; each image covers approximately 150 m2 area including forests, lakes, and cities, etc. These images are challenging due to the inhomogeneities of landforms and unknown natural disasters. The experimental results demonstrate that D-SPF model reduces almost 30.4% missed detection rate on the optical images and 41.2% missed detection rate on the SAR images in comparison with SPF and obtains the best detection performances in ERS dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Damage detection; Disasters; Drag reduction; Drop breakup; Geometrical optics; Level measurement; Numerical methods; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Image change detection; Level Set method; Remote sensing images; Signed pressure forces; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Unsupervised change detection; Visible-light remote sensing; Radar imaging","Change detection; Dynamic signed pressure force model; Level set method; Remote sensing image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081668928"

Additionally, the selection and exploration of polarimetric parameters are not comprehensive. This study evaluates the potential of a set of polarimetric parameters derived from multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 datasets for rice LAI estimation. The relationships of rice LAI with backscattering coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters have been examined in a complete phenological cycle. Most polarimetric parameters had weak relationships (R2 < 0.30) with LAI at the transplanting, reproductive, and maturity phase. Stronger relationships (R2 > 0.50) were observed at the vegetative phase. HV/VV and RVIFD had significant relationships (R2 > 0.80) with rice LAI for the whole growth period. They were utilized to develop empirical models. The best LAI inversion performance (RMSE = 0.81) was obtained when RVIFD was used. The acceptable error demonstrated the possibility to use the decomposition parameters for rice LAI estimation. The HV/VV-based model had a slightly lower estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.29) but can be a practical alternative considering the wide availability of dual-polarized datasets. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Leaf Area Index; Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; Rice; Parameter estimation","Leaf area index (LAI); Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); RADARSAT-2; Rice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075352022"

Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. As a result, prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understorey vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires. Information on prescribed burning outcomes is important for evaluating the extent to which land management objectives have been achieved. This study focused on the ability of Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based multi-temporal index, to appraise the outcome of prescribed burns in eucalypt forests of Western Australia. L-band datasets acquired by the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) sensor were used to relate changes in radar backscatter coefficient with the effects of prescribed burning. Two modelling approaches based on post- to pre-fire ratios were used to evaluate prescribed burn impacts. Post-fire tree survival in areas affected by high fire impacts was inferred by assessing the recovery rates of the backscatter coefficient for the first year after the burn. The impact of prescribed burns was estimated with relatively high overall accuracy (79%) using cross-polarized backscatter (HV) under dry conditions. The HH polarization and the Normalized Difference Backscatter Intensity (NDBI) showed certain ability to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The results suggest that L-band backscatter coefficient may contribute to evaluating the success of prescribed burns in Western Australian eucalypt forests through its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure. In addition, tree survival (as opposed to mortality) and recovery towards the pre-fire state might be inferred by analysing short-term post-fire trends of the backscatter coefficient in areas affected by high fire impacts. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Australia; Western Australia; Eucalyptus; Backscattering; Fires; Forestry; Recovery; Vegetation; Change detection; Fire impacts; Forest recovery; L-band SAR; Prescribed burn; accuracy assessment; deciduous forest; detection method; dicotyledon; estimation method; forest fire; land management; NDVI; PALSAR; polarization; prescribed burning; radar; satellite data; satellite sensor; survival; vegetation structure; wildfire; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; Fire impact; Forest recovery; L-band SAR; Prescribed burns; Radar Burn Ratio","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061406026"

The monitoring can be done by using satellite data, both optical and radar data, which can cover a large area. In tropical area, cloudy day usually occurred, so that problems can't be handle with optical data. Utilization of radar data that can penetrate the cloud condition can solve the problem, either as a complement of optical data or used alone to monitor the paddy field conversion. The research was conducted to investigate the capability of Sentinel 1 SAR multi temporal data to detect paddy field based on growth phenology of rice crop. This research explores SAR Sentinel-1A data (C-band, VV and VH polarization) for several growing seasons in 2017 (January-December) to detect paddy fields in Subang Regency, West Java. Stacking layer is carried out prior to classification, time series image and polarization composite image (VH/VV), stacking maximum, minimum, mean and range values, standard deviation and taking sample training and statistical analysis. Taking sample training takes into account the phenology of rice plants (phases of paddy crop) using references to appropriate Landsat imagery. Classification is done by the time series algorithm, while the accuracy is calculated with Kappa coefficients from the 1: 5000 paddy field map reference. The results found that SAR data in dual polarization (HV, VV), and Polarization Index (PI = 1-NDPI) can be used to detect paddy field.

This can be occurs due to heavy rains, spring snowmelt, wind surge, destruction of dams, rubbish, straightening of rivers or deforestation. Satellite observing systems are the main tool for solving problems such as monitoring of flooded areas. Since it is often not possible to use optical images due to high cloud cover, data from radar satellite imagery is used to ensure all-weather satellite monitoring of the dynamics and effects of flooding. The paper proposes a computer information technology for satellite monitoring of floods based on multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The technology allows you to determine flood areas and quickly get floodplain area. In this paper we consider the possibility of remote detection of flooding in the Transcarpathian region in December 2017. Four multi-temporal radar images from the satellite Sentinel-1 were used for flood detection. Dates of shooting are 14, 17, 18 and 20 December 2017. The first image was taken before the flood, the next two – in the midst of a natural disaster, the last – after the decline of the water level. All presented radar images have the dual polarization VV+VH. The studies have shown that satellite radar images provide an opportunity to qualitatively determine the flooded area in the Transcarpathian region of Ukraine. The proposed methodology made it possible to qualitatively determine more than 2000 ha and identify damage areas after the flood. Using archival data in the methodology allows you to build cartograms for the previous period and identify regularity of flood areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Data handling; Deforestation; Disasters; Floods; Geometrical optics; Intelligent systems; Polarization; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Weather satellites; Computer information technology; Dual-polarizations; Flood monitoring; Multi-temporal image; Observing systems; Radar data processing; Satellite monitoring; Sentinel-1; Radar imaging","Flood monitoring; Polarization; Radar data processing; Satellite multi-temporal images; Sentinel-1","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077013319"

The still ongoing displacement of the areas, especially the underground frozen soil wall installed, should be quantitatively estimated. In usual, the displacement estimated by persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI)[1,2] is obtained only in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction.

We used 13 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images acquired on the ascending and descending orbits, respectively in addition to the displacement data measured at 10 GPS stations.

Especially with the development of deep learning, numerous methods have been proposed in recent years. However, the requirement to have a certain number of high-quality samples has become one of the main reasons for the limited development of these methods. Thus, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised SAR change detection method that is based on stochastic subspace ensemble learning. The proposed method consists of two stages: The first stage involves the automatic determination of high-confidence samples, which includes a fusion strategy and a refinement process; and the second stage entails using the stochastic subspace ensemble learning module, which contains three steps: obtaining the subsample sets, establishing and training a two-channel network, and applying the prediction results and an ensemble strategy. The subsample sets are used to solve the problem of imbalanced samples. The two-channel networks are used to extract high-dimensional features and learn the relationship between the neighborhood of the pixels in the original images and the labels. Finally, by using an ensemble strategy, the results predicted by all patches reclassified in each network are integrated as the detection result. The experimental results of different SAR datasets prove the effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed method. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep learning; Radar imaging; Stochastic systems; Automatic determination; Change detection; Ensemble learning; Ensemble strategies; High dimensional feature; Multi-temporal SAR images; Stochastic subspace; Two channel; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; Stochastic subspace ensemble learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Two-channel network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067396799"

As nitrogen dioxide exhibited spatial clustering, we evaluated the following spatial specifications against a linear model: spatially autoregressive (lag), spatially autoregressive (error), and geographically weighted regression. The spatially autoregressive (lag) specification performed best, achieving goodness-of-fit aligned with or greater than values reported in the literature. We compared the 2015–16 spatially autoregressive models with the 2010–11 models and reparametrized them on the 2010–11 and the 2015–16 data. Finally, we identified a single set of predictors to best fit the data. Nitrogen dioxide concentration decreased over the 5 years, retaining consistent spatial and seasonal patterns, with higher concentrations over traffic corridors and industrial areas, and greater variation in summer than winter. The multi-temporal analysis suggested that spatial land use regressions were robust over the time interval, despite moderate land use change.

Previous research has verified the applicability of SAR imagery in object-oriented crop classification, however, speckle noise limits the generation of optimal segmentation. This paper proposed an innovative SAR-based maize mapping method supported by optical image, Gaofen-1 PMS, based segmentation, named as parcel-based SAR classification assisted by optical imagery-based segmentation (os-PSC). Polarimetric decomposition was applied to extract polarimetric parameters from multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data. One Gaofen-1 image was then used for parcel extraction, which was the basic unit for SAR image analysis. The final step was a multi-step classification for final maize mapping including: the potential maize mask extraction, pure/mixed maize parcel division and an integrated maize map production. Results showed that the overall accuracy of the os-PSC method was 89.1%, higher than those of pixel-level classification and SAR-based segmentation methods. The comparison between optical- and SAR-based segmentation demonstrated that optical-based segmentation would be better at representing maize field boundaries than the SAR-based segmentation. Moreover, the parcel- and pixel-level integrated classification will be suitable for many agricultural systems with small landownership where inter-cropping is common. Through integrating advantages of the SAR and optical data, os-PSC shows promising potentials for crop mapping. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Zea mays; image classification; image resolution; maize; noise; pixel; RADARSAT; satellite imagery; segmentation; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation mapping","Maize; Optical imagery; Parcel- and pixel-level integrated classification; PolSAR imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062914208"

In order to solve the change detection problem in optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, this paper proposes an improved method that combines cooperative multitemporal segmentation and hierarchical compound classification (CMS-HCC) based on our previous work. Considering the large radiometric and geometric differences between heterogeneous images, first, a cooperative multitemporal segmentation method is introduced to generate multi-scale segmentation results. This method segments two images together by associating the information from the two images and thus reduces the noises and errors caused by area transition and object misalignment, as well as makes the boundaries of detected objects described more accurately. Then, a region-based multitemporal hierarchical Markov random field (RMH-MRF) model is defined to combine spatial, temporal, and multi-level information. With the RMH-MRF model, a hierarchical compound classification method is performed by identifying the optimal configuration of labels with a region-based marginal posterior mode estimation, further improving the change detection accuracy. The changes can be determined if the labels assigned to each pair of parcels are different, obtaining multi-scale change maps. Experimental validation is conducted on several pairs of optical and SAR images. It consists of two parts: Comparison on different multitemporal segmentation methods and comparison on different change detection methods. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the changes in heterogeneous images, with low false positive and high accuracy. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Magnetorheological fluids; Markov processes; Object detection; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Experimental validations; hierarchical compound classification (HCC); Marginal posterior modes; Markov random field models; Multi-temporal; Multiscale segmentation; Remote sensing images; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; accuracy assessment; detection method; estimation method; image analysis; image classification; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite imagery; segmentation; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Heterogeneous remote sensing images; hierarchical compound classification (HCC); multi-scale and multitemporal segmentation; region-based Markov random field (MRF) model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075689269"

However, in this milieu of cloud-computing platforms and open-source datasets, radar data analysis has become convenient and can now be performed for more exploratory researches. This study aims to perform multi-temporal analysis of radar backscatter to characterize dense and sparse forest from Sentinel-1 images. The area of study are reforested sites under the National Greening Program (NGP) of the Philippines. Ground data were collected: (1) in 2019, from a 1.35 ha-site in Brgy. Calula, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay, (2) in 2019, from a 1.10 ha-site in Brgy. Cabatuanan, Basay, Negros Oriental, and (3) from PhilLiDAR 2-Project 3: FRExLS' 2.4 ha-validated site in Ubay, Bohol. SAR intensity values were derived from Sentinel-1 from Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform with a repository of satellite images and functionalities for data extraction and processing. The temporal variation in C-band radar backscatter from 2014 to 2018 were analyzed. The results show, for the whole period of analysis, that: in VH polarization, dense forest samples backscatter range from-11 to-18 dB in VH and-2 to-13 dB in VV; sparse forest samples range from-12 to-21 dB in VH and-7 to-14 dB in VV; ground samples range from-12 to-24 dB in VH and-6 to-15 dB in VV; and water samples range from-21 to-30 dB in VH and-11 to-26 dB in VV. Forest backscatter are expected to saturate over time, especially in dense forests. These variations are due to differences in forest species, landscape, environmental and climatic drivers, and phenomenon or interventions on the site. © 2020 Authors.","Backscattering; Data handling; Engines; Forestry; Open systems; Radar imaging; Cloud based platforms; Cloud computing platforms; Exploratory research; Forest; Google earths; Multi-temporal analysis; Radar data analysis; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar","Forest; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-1A; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081594754"

Researchers have introduced a series of filtering methods, such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) filter, based on time-frequency analysis to determine the characteristics of the interferometric phase for non-stationary signals. Given the differences in time-frequency distribution between signal and noise of interferogram, InSAR interference phase filtering method based on EMD is proposed and effectively applied in InSAR interferogram filtering with improved capability of phase noise filtering and detail preserving in edge area. However, in existing EMD filtering methods, some high-frequency modal components are eliminated as noise directly without objective assessment. The mode-mixing problem of EMD also influences the filtering effect. To address the problems of interferometry phase filtering in EMD, a newly improved InSAR interference phase filtering method based on EMD and noise-screening assessment is proposed. In the new algorithm, ensemble EMD (EEMD) is applied to obtain modal components of different time scales to the two-dimensional real and imaginary parts of the interferogram by fully utilizing the capability of EEMD in effectively reducing modal aliasing. Then, Kernel Entropy Component Analysis (KECA) algorithm is used for nonlinear analysis of signal noise identification and separation. Finally, interferogram is reconstructed with modal components after noise elimination. After the decomposition and reconstruction of mixed signals, the noise in the interferogram is effectively filtered out. The performance of the proposed filtering method is tested on simulated data and real SAR images by comparing the filtering effects of Goldstein filter, periodic-median filter, EMD, and EMD-PCA filter with the proposed EEMD-KECA filter. Speckle, variance, and edge-keeping indexes are used for quantitative evaluation. Unlike the classical InSAR interferogram filtering, the proposed method combined with EEMD-KECA filtering algorithm can effectively filter out the interference noise figure and has an advantage in maintaining the fringe edge details. In the proposed method, EEMD is used to decompose interferogram signal instead of EMD, and KECA is applied to evaluate the phase noise quantitatively. The proposed method can achieve good filtering results while preserving the advantages of strong edge detail maintenance and can avoid the incomplete and partly filtering of image information caused by modal aliasing. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only can obtain excellent filtering performance in the slowly changing region of fringe but also has excellent filtering effect and high phase fidelity in the dense fringe area and phase edge details. The proposed filtering method is suitable for interference fringes of different densities. © 2019, Science Press.

Sinop Nuclear Power Plant, which will be built on Sinop Ä°nceburun peninsula at the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is one of the three different nuclear power plants planned to be built in Turkey. The Sinop Nuclear Power Plant consist of four different reactors. The construction of the first unit is expected to be completed by 2023, and the fourth unit is planned to be activated by 2028. On the other hand, the construction of the nuclear power plant will alter the land use at the actual plant site and its surroundings and hence may cause significant environmental changes. As an indicator, more than 650000 trees have been cut so far for the construction of nuclear power plant, and this can adversely affect the ecological balances of the region by endangering habitats and creating ecological damages. The aim of this study is to analyse the land use/land cover changes (LULC) in the forestry-dominated areas due to the construction of nuclear power plants using the multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images. For this purpose, different change detection methods such as SAR intensity image differencing, supervised image classification method (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were applied to Sentinel 1 satellite image datasets (2016-2019) to evaluate the annual changes due to construction. In addition, a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy structure and vegetation biomass using Sentinel 2 NDVI dataset (2016-2019) and calibrated Sentinel 1 backscatter values. Furthermore, using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), the Landsat 8 NDVI time series of the affected forest area, generated at 8-day intervals, was used to validate changes in vegetation. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Classification (of information); Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecology; Forestry; Land use; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Radar imaging; Satellites; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Change detection; Land use/land cover change; Land-cover/land-use change; Multi-temporal data; Optical satellite images; Sentinel-1; Supervised image classifications; Support vector machine algorithm; Nuclear power plants","Change Detection; Multi-temporal Data; Nuclear Power Plant; Sentinel 1&2.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074281174"

An appropriate monitoring scheme is necessitated to legally activate, reactivate, or terminate mining operations. Usually such monitoring relies on in situ surveys, which are unrealistic to cover an extensive mining area. Alternatively, remote sensing based on spaceborne data offers efficient and cost-effective solutions for regular surveillance of large areas. Spaceborne SAR sensors provide images captured rapidly over vast areas at fine spatiotemporal resolution. These sensors are characterized by weather independent and day-and-night vision, which guarantees intensive image series without cloud occlusion. Using multi-temporal SAR images, advanced DInSAR such as PSI and SBAS is a mature technique to evaluate surface deformation at best millimetre level. This technique has been commercialized as a standard service in many Geoinformation companies. Nevertheless, experts from other fields like mining engineers often doubt the information about movement derived from DInSAR. Our duty in industry is to solve these doubts and tailor our techniques for various applications. With the support of STINGS project, we have developed an initial prototype of our monitoring system. The final goal is to launch an interactive GIS-based platform as an early warning system to the public. In this paper, we demonstrate our initial test result using Sentinel-1 images at a mining site in Chile. We also propose the strategies to solve the problems in real applications and discuss how to improve the overall quality. © Authors 2019.","Cost effectiveness; Disaster prevention; Indium compounds; Interferometry; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Cost-effective solutions; Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal SAR images; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Sentinel-1; Small baseline subsets; Space-borne SAR sensors; Spatio-temporal resolution; Monitoring","Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR); Disaster Prevention; Mining Monitoring; Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI); Sentinel-1; Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067431130"

For the tropical forest sites in Gabon, which differ significantly with respect to forest composition and climatic conditions, we find that i) P-band allows for estimating AGB with the highest accuracy, ii) multi-temporal L-band backscatter may achieve accuracies close to what can be achieved with few P-band observations, iii) the use of multi-temporal observations is beneficial/crucial at all frequencies, in particular when the imaging conditions are persistently moist and the sensitivity of individual images to AGB reduced, and iv) combining P- and L-band backscatter allows for improving the AGB retrieval primarily when few P-band observations are complemented by a larger number of L-band observations.

Accurate and up-to-date assessment of the spatial distribution of soybean cultivated area is a key information requirement of all stakeholders including policy makers, soybean farmers and consumers. A methodology for timely assessment with high precision of soybean crop using satellite data is yet not operational in India. In this scenario, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been shown to be a reliable form of gathering crop information, especially during monsoon season. In this work, repeat coverage from the C-band Sentinel-1 satellite over Ujjain district, Madhya Pradesh is used for in-season soybean crop mapping along with other agricultural land-cover types. The data were processed through four steps: (a) data preprocessing, (b) constructing smooth time series backscatter data, (c) soybean crop classification using knowledge-based decision rule classifier and support vector machines (SVM) and (d) accuracy assessment. The results indicated that the smooth VH backscatter profiles reflected the temporal characteristics of soybean crop growing in the study region. Phenological characteristics were also derived from the smoothed S-1 VH backscatter time series to segregate early and late sown soybean. This information was used as an input to a decision-rule classifier and SVM in order to classify the input data into soybean and other crops. An overall accuracy of more than 80% using SVM and 75% using rule based classifier, in Ujjain district was achieved. These results demonstrate the scope for using time-series S-1 VH data to develop an operational soybean crop-monitoring framework. © Authors 2019.

This process can reduce the salt and pepper effect that is inevitable in pixel-based methods and reduce the false alarms caused by area transitions and object misalignment in traditional object-based methods. Then, compound classification is carried out at the object level. This process exploits temporal correlations and overcomes the error propagation of traditional postclassification comparison methods.

A major concern during tunnelling operations is the evaluation of the response of existing buildings to induced ground movements, with a considerable economic impact on the total project cost. Since traditional monitoring is based on costly in-situ installations, only a limited amount of observations is typically provided for each structure. Without a systematic increase in the availability of monitored building deformations, lesson learned from previous projects cannot be effectively used to improve existing damage assessment procedures. Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques, providing high quality measurements of building deformations, have been recently validated to be used in combination with damage assessment procedures. In particular, Multi-Temporal InSAR can provide cumulative displacement maps for a high density of monitoring points with millimetric accuracy, enabling to assess buildings nearby the excavation. In this paper, results from post-tunnelling damage assessment of hundreds of buildings along the Crossrail route in London are presented. By exploiting InSAR-based displacements, a semi-automated assessment tool is used to investigate the structural response to tunnelling-induced settlements. Results are compared to the ones obtained through the greenfield-based assessment, enabling to evaluate their accuracy.

Remote sensing applications that have profited from those techniques include translating images of different sensors, improving the image resolution and completing missing temporal or spatial data such as in cloudy optical images. In this context, this letter proposes a new deep-learning-based framework to synthesize missing or corrupted multispectral optical images using multimodal/multitemporal data. Specifically, we use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to generate the missing optical image by exploiting the correspondent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a SAR-optical data from the same area at a different acquisition date. The proposed framework was evaluated in two land-cover applications over tropical regions, where cloud coverage is a major problem: crop recognition and wildfire detection. In both applications, our proposal was superior to alternative approaches tested in our experiments. In particular, our approach outperformed recent cGAN-based proposals for cloud removal, on average, by 7.7% and 8.6% in terms of overall accuracy and F1-score, respectively. © 2019 IEEE.","Crops; Data handling; Deep learning; Fires; Geometrical optics; Image resolution; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Adversarial networks; Crop recognition; Land cover applications; Learning techniques; Multi-temporal data; Performance of classifier; Remote sensing applications; Wildfire detection; artificial neural network; data acquisition; experimental study; image analysis; image resolution; optical method; pattern recognition; remote sensing; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; wildfire; Image enhancement","Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs); crop recognition; deep learning; remote sensing; wildfire detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069501813"

However, very limited work with application of SAR data has been performed for the alpine glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) of China. In this study, we attempted to investigate the change of coherence level in alpine glacier zone and access the glacier boundaries in the QTP using time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images. The DaDongkemadi Glacier (DDG) in the central QTP was selected as the study area with land cover mainly classified into wet snow, ice, river outwash and soil land. We utilized 45 Sentinel-1A C-band SAR images collected during October of 2014 through January of 2018 over the DDG to generate time series of interferometric coherence maps, and to further extract the DDG boundaries. Based on the spatiotemporal analysis of coherence values in the selected sampling areas, we first determined the threshold as 0.7 for distinguishing among different ground targets and then extracted the DDG boundaries through threshold-based segmentation and edge detection. The validation was performed by comparing the DDG boundaries extracted from the coherence maps with those extracted from the Sentinel-2B optical image. The testing results show that the wet snow and ice present a relatively low level of coherence (about 0.5), while the river outwash and the soil land present a higher level of coherence (0.8-1.0). It was found that the coherence maps spanning between June and September (i.e., the glacier ablation period) are the most suitable for identifying the snow- and ice-covered areas. When compared with the boundary detected using optical image, the mean value of Jaccard similarity coefficient for the total areas within the DDG boundaries derived from the coherence maps selected around July, August and September reached up to 0.9010. In contrast, the mean value from the coherence maps selected around December was relatively lower (0.8862). However, the coherence maps around December were the most suitable for distinguishing the ice from the river outwash around the DDG terminus, as the river outwash areas could hardly be differentiated from the ice-covered areas from June through September. The correlation analysis performed by using the meteorological data (i.e., air temperature and precipitation records) suggests that the air temperature and precipitation have a more significant influence on the coherence level of the ice and river outwash than the wet snow and soil land. The proposed method, applied efficiently in this study, shows the potential of multi-temporal coherence estimation from the Sentinel-1A mission to access the boundaries of alpine glaciers on a larger scale in the QTP. © 2019 by the authors.","Atmospheric temperature; Edge detection; Geometrical optics; Ice; Image processing; Radar imaging; Rivers; Snow; Soil testing; Soils; Time series; Alpine glacier; Coherence estimation; Correlation analysis; Interferometric coherence; Jaccard similarity coefficients; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Sentinel-1; Spatiotemporal analysis; Synthetic aperture radar","Alpine glacier boundary; DaDongkemadi Glacier; Multi-temporal SAR coherence estimation; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Sentinel-1A","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062483712"

However, their performances can vary depending on the types of the damages, the characteristics of the scatterers and the corresponding capability of algorithms. In particular, the coherence-based methods have been used as promising detectors over urban areas where high coherences are observed, but their detection accuracies still remain controversial over the area where low coherences are mainly observed such as the 2018 Hokkaido landslides. In order to understand the characteristics of landslide (damage) detectors for low-coherence areas and find an alternative and complementary method, we designed the coherence difference, coherence normalized difference, log-ratio, intensity correlation difference, and normalized differences of the intensity correlation assuming limited availability of dataset, and also developed multi-temporal algorithms using the coherence, intensity, and intensity correlation. They were tested and evaluated using multiple polygons extracted from aerial photos. We were able to observe that the multi-temporal intensity correlation method has the potential to detect the landslides over the low coherence region and all types of land uses. © 2020 by the authors.","Antennas; Disasters; Land use; Landslides; Radar imaging; Change detection; Coherence-based method; Coherent change detection; Complementary methods; Landslide detection; Natural disasters; Normalized differences; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","Coherent change detection; Incoherent change detection; Landslide detection; Natural disaster; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081088724"

The aim of this study is to assess and compare Sentinel-1 C-band, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and combined C/L-band SAR-based land cover mapping over a large tropical area in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The overall approach is to benefit from multi-temporal observations acquired from 2015 to 2017 to extract statistical parameters and seasonality of backscatters to improve forest land cover (FLC) classification. We investigate whether and to what extent the denser time series of C- band SAR can compensate for the L-band's deeper vegetation penetration depth and known better FLC mapping performance. The supervised classification differentiates into forest, inundated forest, woody savannah, dry and wet grassland, and river swamps. Several feature combinations of statistical parameters from both, single and multi-frequency observations in a multivariate maximum-likelihood classification are compared. The FLC maps are reclassified into forest, savannah, and grassland (FSG) and validated with a systematic sampling grid of manual interpretations of very-high-resolution optical satellite data. Using the temporal variability of the dual-polarized backscatters, in the form of either wet/dry seasonal averages or using the statistical variance, in addition to the average backscatter, increased the classification accuracies by 4-5 percent points and 1-2 percent points for C- and L-band, respectively. For the FSG validation overall accuracies of 84.4%, 89.1%, and 90.0% were achieved for single frequency C- and L-band, and C/L-band combined, respectively. The resulting forest/non-forest (FNF) maps with accuracies of 90.3%, 92.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, are then compared to the Landsat-based Global Forest Change program's and JAXA's ALOS-1/2 based global FNF maps. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Deforestation; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Land cover; REDD/MRV; Sentinel-1; Tropical forest; Space-based radar","ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Land cover; MLC; REDD/MRV; SAR; Sentinel-1; Tropical forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077904790"

The SAR specular reflectance separates open water and land surface, and its canopy penetration capability allows enhanced backscatter from flooded vegetation. Further, under certain conditions, the SAR signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent between two acquisitions, which can be exploited using the InSAR technique. With these SAR capabilities in mind, this study examines the use of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 C band SAR intensity and coherence components to monitor wetland extent, inundation and vegetation of a tropical wetland, such as Amazon lowland. For this study, 22 multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 images (21 pairs) were used for InSAR processing and the pairs in the low water stage (November, December) showed high coherence over the wetland areas. The three-year intensity stack was used for assessing wetland boundary, inundation extent, flood pulse, hydroperiod, and wetland vegetation. In addition to the intensity, derived coherence was used for classifying wetland vegetation. Wetland vegetation types were successfully classified with 86% accuracy using the statistical parameters derived from the multi-temporal intensity and coherence data stacks. We have found that in addition to SAR intensity, coherence provided information about wetland vegetation. In the next year, the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide more data with frequent revisits, enhancing the application of SAR intensity and coherence for monitoring these types of wetlands at large scales. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Coherent light; Floods; Surface waters; Vegetation; Wetlands; Amazon; Constellation missions; Enhanced backscatter; InSAR; Open water; Specular reflectance; Statistical parameters; Wetland vegetation; Synthetic aperture radar","Amazon; Coherence; Flooded vegetation; InSAR; Open water; SAR; Wetland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066734027"

This makes the selection of a statistic model more difficult for describing opposite classes. To address this issue, this article developed an unsupervised change-detection approach for multitemporal SAR images that specifies a priori knowledge about the spatial characteristics of the classes through Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and embeds it into the Expectation-Maximization (EM) iteration process. It is based on the consideration that each pixel in the difference image is unique due to its neighbourhood, although some of them may have the same pixel value. Thus, under the hypothesis that local and global a priori knowledge are independent sources, a global-local a priori model is developed through Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The EM algorithm allows one to estimate the statistical parameters of the opposite classes associated with this a priori model. As a consequence, the change-detection result can be obtained within the framework of Bayes.

River basin development, such as dams and water infrastructure in transboundary rivers, can be a potential factor of tensions between upstream and downstream countries since dams constructed upstream can adversely affect downstream riparians. However, because most of the information related to North Korea has been limited to the public, the information about dams constructed and their locations were inaccurate in many previous studies. In addition, water resources in transboundary rivers can be exploited as a political tool. Specifically, due to the unexpected water release from the Hwanggang Dam, upstream of the transboundary Imjin River in North and South Korea, six South Koreans died on 6 September 2009. The Imjin River can be used as a political tool by North Korea, and seven events were reported as water conflicts in the Imjin River from 2001 to 2016. In this paper, firstly, we have updated the information about the dams constructed over the Imjin River in North Korea using multi-temporal images with a high spatial resolution (15-30 cm) obtained from Google Earth. Secondly, we analyzed inter-and intra-water variability over the Hwanggang Reservoir using open-source images obtained from the Global SurfaceWater Explorer. We found a considerable change in water surface variability before and after 2008, which might result from the construction of the Hwanggang Dam. Thirdly, in order to further investigate intra-annual water variability, we present a method monitoring water storage changes of the Hwanggang Reservoir using the area-elevation curve (AEC), which was derived from multi-sensor Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images (Sentinel-1A and-1B) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SrTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Since many previous studies for estimating water storage change have depended on satellite altimetry dataset and optical images for deriving AEC, the method adopted in this study is the only application for such inaccessible areas since no altimetry ground track exists for the Hwanggang Reservoir and because clouds can block the study area for wet seasons. Moreover, this study has newly proven that unexpected water release can occur in dry seasons because the water storage in the Hwanggang Reservoir can be high enough to conduct a release that can be used as a geopolitical tool. Using our method, potential risks can be mitigated, not in response to a water release, but based on pre-event water storage changes in the Hwanggang Reservoir. © 2020 by the authors.","Dams; Geometrical optics; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Space-based radar; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Water supply; Watersheds; Digital elevation model; High spatial resolution; Multi-temporal image; River basin development; Shuttle radar topography mission; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Trans-boundary rivers; Water infrastructure; Rivers","International river basin; Korea; Remote sensing; Transboundary river; Water variability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083332264"

Very effective methods have been developed in the recent years for singleimage speckle reduction and multi-temporal speckle filtering. However, to reduce the presence of sidelobes around bright targets, SAR images are spectrally weighted and this processing impacts the speckle statistics by introducing spatial correlations. These correlations severely impact speckle reduction methods that require uncorrelated speckle as input. Thus, spatial down-sampling is typically applied to reduce the speckle spatial correlations prior to speckle filtering. To better preserve the spatial resolution, we describe how to correctly resample SAR images and extract bright targets in order to process full-resolution images with speckle-reduction methods.  © 2019 IEEE.","Image processing; Remote sensing; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Full resolution images; Multi-temporal; Spatial correlations; Spatial resolution; Speckle decorrelation; Speckle filtering; Speckle reduction; Speckle statistics; Radar imaging","Deramping; Despeckling; Sentinel-1; Sidelobe reduction; Sub-pixel target detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095098278"

Ensemble learning algorithms have received great attention in remote sensing for classification due to their greater performance compared to single classifiers in terms of accuracy. Extreme gradient boosting is the regularized extension of traditional boosting techniques and could overcome the overfitting constrain of gradient boosting (a.k.a gradient boosting machine). Three types of booster which are linear booster, tree booster and DART (Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees) booster were tested on XGBoost for crop classification. From the multi-temporal PolSAR data, two types of polarimetric dataset (linear backscatter coefficients and Cloude-Pottier decomposed parameters) were extracted and incorporated into the classification step. The impacts of polarimetric features for crop classification were also analyzed in detailed besides exploring the boosting types of XGBoost. Our experimental results demonstrated that tree booster and DART booster were found to be superior compared the linear booster in terms of overall classification accuracy for both polarimetric dataset.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has an advantage in crop classification because of its all-weather imaging capabilities. The objective of this study was to investigate the capability of SAR data for estimation of cotton and maize area in Perambalur district of Tamil Nadu. The multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data was acquired from 02nd September, 2017 to 24th January, 2018. Both the Vertical - Vertical (VV) and Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarized data was used. Ground truth data collection was performed for cotton and maize during the vegetative, flowering and harvesting stages. Sixty per cent of the ground truth data were used for training and remaining forty per cent were utilized for validation. The temporal backscattering coefficient (σ0) for cotton and maize were extracted using the training datasets.. The mean backscattering values for cotton crop during the entire cropping period had a range from -11.729 dB to -8.827dB and from -19.167 dB to -14.186 dB for VV and VH polarization respectively. For maize crop it ranged from -11.248 dB to -8.878dB and from -19.043 dB to -14.753 dB for VV and VH polarized data respectively. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Decision Tree classifier (DT) methods were adopted for cotton and maize area estimation. SAM classified 73259 and 51489 hectares (ha) as cotton and maize respectively in VV polarization. DT classified the area of 61501 and 64530 ha for cotton and maize respectively in VH polarization. The accuracy measures, such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy and user's accuracy and kappa coefficient were estimated. SAM classifier exhibits the overall accuracy of 73.3% for VV Decision tree classifier reported the overall accuracy of 75.0% for VH. It is evident from the present study, that the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR sensor can be well used for the discrimination of cotton and maize crops because of its high temporal resolution which captures the complete phenology of the crops during the cropping period. © Authors 2019.

In this study, we retrieved the annual glacier mass balance of the Puruogangri ice field, which is the largest modern ice mass in the ITP, by differencing multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) generated with five pairs of TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired between April 2011 and January 2016. We compared the TanDEM-X DEMs in January and April 2012 to estimate the X-band radar penetration depth difference (0.61 ± 0.06 m), which enabled systematic bias correction in the estimation of annual glacier mass balance. The observed mass balance reveals a glacier mass gain of 0.44 ± 0.10 m w.e. yr−1 in 2011–12, which was followed by accelerated glacier mass loss in 2012–16. Glacier mass balances of −0.13 ± 0.03, −0.34 ± 0.06, and − 0.52 ± 0.10 m w.e. yr−1 were estimated for the periods of 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–16, respectively. This accelerating trend of glacier mass loss is likely caused by the continuous decrease in annual precipitation, according to the climate data recorded by adjacent meteorological stations.

Accurate and timely acquisition of information on dryland crop types, planting areas and spatial distribution in dryland can provide an important basis for agricultural production and management, as well as the formulation of national food policy and economic plan, therefore, it is of great significance for promoting structural reform of agricultural supply side and national food security. The key stage of crop growth in the north of China is affected by cloud and rain weather, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient effective optical data, and the current recognition accuracy of dryland crops based on polarized SAR data is low. In order to solve these problems, this study selected Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, using the full-polarization RADARSAT -2 data of July 17, August 7 and September 24, 2018, and then selected three polarization decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier decomposition, Freeman decomposition and Yamaguchi decomposition) and two classification methods (maximum likelihood and random forest) to construct 18 classification combinations. The identification of corn and cotton in study area was studied by using various schemes. Finally, the accuracy of dry land crop identification under various combination schemes was compared quantitatively with the ground survey data. The results showed that, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with maximum likelihood classification method was used on August 7 (flowering and boll period of cotton), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was 78.98%). For corn, Yamaguchi decomposition combined with random forest classification method was used on September 24 (mature period of corn), and the classification accuracy was the highest (production accuracy was over 90%). I For the decomposition method, Yamaguchi decomposition has the highest classification accuracy among the three decomposition methods, followed by Freeman decomposition, Cloude-Pottier decomposition has the lowest classification accuracy; as far as the classification method is concerned, the maximum likelihood classification method has the highest recognition accuracy for cotton, but the random forest classification has the highest recognition accuracy for corn; in terms of the best identification phase, the flowering and boll period is the best recognition period for cotton, and the maturity period is the best recognition time for corn..

The general aim of this research was to explore the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to discriminate between C3, C4, and mixed-C3/C4 compositions. In this study, three Random Forest (RF) classification models were created using features derived from polarimetric SAR (polSAR) and grey-level co-occurrence textural metrics (glcmTEX). The first RF model involved only polSAR features and produced a prediction accuracy of 68% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.49. The second RF model used glcmTEX features and produced prediction accuracies of 76%, 62%, and 75% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 grasses, respectively. The glcmTEX model achieved an overall prediction accuracy of 73% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.57. The polSAR and glcmTEX features were then combined (COMB model) to improve upon their individual classification performances. The COMB model produced prediction accuracies of 89%, 81%, and 84% for C3, C4, and mixed C3/C4 pasture grasses, and an overall prediction accuracy of 86% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.77. The contribution of the various model features could be attributed to the changes in dominant species between sampling sites through time, not only because of climatic variability but also because of preferential grazing. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Decision trees; Forecasting; Remote sensing; C-bands; Classification models; Classification performance; Climatic variability; Fertilizer applications; Grey level co-occurrence matrixes; Prediction accuracy; Satellite remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar","C-band synthetic aperture radar; Grey-level co-occurrence matrix; Pasture grass classification; Satellite remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061360424"

Recent studies carried out for Sentinel-1 imagery have shown that more efficient pre-filtering usually results in better classification. Thus, here we propose a modification of block matching three-dimensional (BM3D) filter adapted to the properties of Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate that its use leads to improved classification of crops in agricultural region of Ukraine compared to earlier methods which are based on other filters.

Multi-temporal SAR image datasets are used for such investigations. To eliminate the issues of signal decorrelation associated with DInSAR based processing, Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR) technique has come in a big way in the recent years where deformation studies at small scales and fine accuracy (mm-level) have been at-tempted and measured. In this paper, ground deformation of the area near Naples, Italy has been estimated for the year 2014 using a spatial correlation based PSInSAR method. Here, Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) SLC (ascending orbit, single polarisation, stripmap Himage mode) images of Very High Resolution (VHR) were used in this study due to its capability to detect small-scale ground deformation signal over an urban area. The PSInSAR processing, used here, involves two stage selection of PS points or stable scatterers, with the coregistered SLCs and differential interferograms, using amplitude and phase analysis. The PSInSAR results were validated using time series data of two continuous GPS (cGPS) stations over the same period for the study area. The mean deformation rate over the study area was observed to be varying from-15 to +18 mm/year along line-of-sight (LOS) of Cosmo-SkyMed.

Easily updatable hot-spot analyses, frequently repeated following the update of Sentinel-1 images, represent very useful tools for MTInSAR (Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data analysis. Mountain regions are a challenging environment for interferometric analyses because of their climatic, morphological and land cover characteristics. In this context, MTInSAR data can retrieve reliable information over wide areas, with high cost-benefits ratio and where the installation of ground-based devices is not feasible. Considering the well-known limitations of interferometric techniques (such as fast motions or temporal and spatial decorrelation), hot-spot analyses are a viable solution for semi-automatic ground movements extraction over mountain regions. In this work, we present an example of a hot-spot analysis applied to a large stack of MTInSAR products generated by means of SqueeSAR technique over an alpine region (Valle d’Aosta, north-western Italy). The obtained outputs allow detecting 277 moving areas connected to landslides and mass wasting processes in general. These products are intended to be implemented in the landslide risk management chain of the region, focusing on landslide state of activity definition and landslide mapping. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The adopted noise-filtering algorithm is incorporated into the improved extended Minimum Cost Flow (EMCF) Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) differential interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing chain, which has extensively been used for the generation of Earth's surface displacement time-series in several different contexts. Originally, the input of the InSAR EMCF-SBAS processing toolbox consisted of a sequence of multi-looked, small baseline interferograms, which were unwrapped using the space-time EMCF phase unwrapping algorithm. Subsequently, the unwrapped interferograms were inverted through the SBAS algorithm to retrieve the expected InSAR deformation products. The improved processing chain complemented the original codes with two additional steps. In particular, a new multi-temporal noise-filtering algorithm for sequences of time-redundant multi-looked DInSAR interferograms, followed by a proper interferogram selection step, has been proposed. This research study is aimed at primarily assessing the performance of the E-MTInSAR noise-filtering algorithm from a theoretical perspective. To this aim, the principles of directional statistics and errors propagation are exploited. Experimental results, carried out by applying the E-MTInSAR algorithm to a sequence of SAR data collected over the Los Angeles bay area, have been used to corroborate the academic outcome of this research. © 2019 by the authors.","Cost accounting; Deformation; Interferometry; Signal filtering and prediction; Spurious signal noise; D-inSAR; Directional statistics; Noise filtering; Random signal; Small baselines; Synthetic aperture radar","Deformation; DInSAR; Directional statistics; Noise filtering; Random signal theory; Small baseline","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061373858"

Sentinel-1 images from March, April, June, and August 2017 were used to generate inundation extents of the corresponding months. The 2017 pre-flood land cover maps were prepared using Landsat-8 images to identify major land cover on the ground before flooding. The overall accuracy of flood inundation mapping was 96.44% and the accuracy of the land cover map was 87.51%. The total flood inundated area corresponded to 2.01%, 4.53%, and 7.01% for the months April, June, and August 2017, respectively. Based on the Landsat-8 derived land cover information, the study determined that cropland damaged by floods was 1.51% in April, 3.46% in June, 5.30% in August, located mostly in the Sylhet and Rangpur divisions. Finally, flood inundation maps were distributed to the broader user community to aid in hazard response.

In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based time-series analysis method to extract and organize spatial features to improve parcel-based crop classification using high-resolution optical images and multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Central to this method is the use of multiple deep convolutional networks (DCNs) to extract spatial features and to use the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to organize spatial features. First, a precise farmland parcel map was delineated from optical images. Second, hundreds of spatial features were retrieved using multiple DCNs from preprocessed SAR images and overlaid onto the parcel map to construct multivariate time-series of crop growth for parcels. Third, LSTM-based network structures for organizing these time-series features were constructed to produce a final parcel-based classification map. The method was applied to a dataset of high-resolution ZY-3 optical images and multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data to classify crop types in the Hunan Province of China. The classification results, showing an improvement of greater than 5.0% in overall accuracy relative to methods without spatial features, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting and organizing spatial features for improving parcel-based crop classification. © 2019 by the authors.

Here we propose a new change detection method using an adaptive temporal subset multi-temporal InSAR method. Single pixel change detection is developed using amplitude time series in order to identify the step-times: changes in the temporal domain. Then the parameters, e.g. deformation velocity are estimated and the coherent intervals are determined using interferometric phase time series. With the identified TCS, we distinguish different types of changes based on their coherent intervals. The main advantages of our method are reliable unsupervised change detection and detecting different types of changes without additional information.

Although in-situ measurements have been adopted in general, these have a number of limitations of spatial and temporal resolutions because of the high cost. However, the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) can overcome these disadvantages. In this study, we carried out two experiments using the InSAR method. We then compared the interferometric coherence between ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X data and measured the ground subsidence using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data acquired from ascending and descending paths. The mean coherences from the ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X interferograms were 0.26 and 0.54, respectively. The coherence from TerraSAR-X was nearly 2 times higher than that of ALOS PALSAR, despite its shorter wavelength of radar signal. These results showed that the data with the shorter temporal baseline is appropriate to monitor the ground subsidence on landfill park areas. As a result of measuring surface deformation, the mean line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rates estimated from the small baseline subset (SBAS) method were −2.4 and −3.2 cm/year for the ascending and descending data of TerraSAR-X, respectively. Also, the mean deformation rate in the vertical and east–west directions were −5.7 and −1.7 cm/year, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) of InSAR measurements by comparing with the in-situ measurements was about 1.2 cm/year and the coefficient of determination ((Formula presented.)) was about 0.97. These results indicated good agreements between the InSAR measurements and the in-situ measurements. © 2018, © 2018 The Institute of Urban Sciences.","","ground subsidence; interferometric coherence; landfill; multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR); SAR interferometry (InSAR); Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046641439"

Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can capture a large area of radar images quickly with fine spatiotemporal resolution and are not affected by weather conditions, making multi-temporal SAR images suitable for change detection. In this paper, a new urban building change detection method based on an improved difference image and residualU-Net network is proposed. In order to overcome the intensity compression problem of the traditional log-ratio method, the spatial distance and intensity similarity are combined to generate a weighting function to obtain a weighted difference image. By fusing the weighted difference image and the bitemporal original images, the three-channel color difference image is generated for building change detection. Due to the complexity of urban environments and the small scale of building changes, the residual U-Net network is used instead of fixed statistical models and the construction and classifier of the network are modified to distinguish between different building changes. Three scenes of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath data are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that our proposed method is effective for urban building change detection and is superior to the original U-Net and SVMmethod. © 2019 by the authors.","Buildings; Color; Colorimetry; Image enhancement; Synthetic aperture radar; Building change detection; Color difference; Multi-temporal SAR images; Residual U-Net; Spaceborne synthetic aperture radars; Spatio-temporal resolution; Urban buildings; Weighted function; Radar imaging","Color difference image; Residual U-Net; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Urban building change detection; Weighted function","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065743240"

In addition, mapping and change detection of water bodies as an essential natural resource is imperative for robust operations and sustainable management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors with long wavelengths have a high potential for delineating the extent of the flooded areas and providing timely and accurate maps of surface water for risk mitigation and disaster or sustainable management. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images were utilized to investigate the performance of the sensor backscatter image on permanent water bodies monitoring and flooded areas mapping. Lake Urmia as a permanent water system and two floods in Golestan and Khuzestan provinces of Iran have been investigated. The backscatter values of an image acquired before the event that is referred as an Archive image and another one after the event as a Crisis image are analysed. As a preliminary result, it is concluded that with overlaying of the two bands from Archive and Crisis images and creating a color composite image, the permanent water bodies have a uniformly dark return due to the very low backscatter in both images. The flooded areas and changes in water level show relatively higher backscatter in the Crisis image, whereas the other land cover features indicate very high backscatter values with tones of grey. Therefore, Sentinel-1 SAR data provides beneficial information on flood risk management and change detection. © 2019 R.

Therefore, accurate measurements of such deformation are urgently needed for characterizing the seasonal freeze-thaw process. In this paper, we present a time-series InSAR method for monitoring permafrost deformation, named ""DSs-SBAS"", which combines both cut-edge algorithms for identification of radar distributed scatters (DSs) and eigenvalue-decomposition-based optimization of DS interferometric phases to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions of deformation measurements. Taking into account difficulty in selecting reference points for the InSAR analysis in the permafrost region, we introduce a new strategy based on the relationship between ground temperature and deformation to improve the reliability of the selected reference point. This DSs-SBAS InSAR method is applied to investigate ground deformation over permafrost regions at the upstream west branch of the Heihe River, Qilian Mountain. A total of 27 Sentinel-1 SAR images are employed to derive deformation time series and annual deformation rates between 2014 and 2016. In addition, the Stefan model constrained by the ground temperatures is adopted to calculate the seasonal deformation amplitude. The results indicate that (1) most of the permafrost in the study area was stable (-1.0~+1.0 cm•a-1), and large deformations occurred in the southern slope and the bottom part of the upper reaches of the Yeniugou River, (2) there are two main temporal processes of deformation with annual cycles, namely seasonal cycle deformation and seasonal subsidence. The largest deformation rate and maximum deformation amplitude were up to 6.0 cm and -3.0 cm•a-1, respectively, (3) a significant heterogeneous pattern in freeze-thaw cycles and permafrost deformation is found, which is mainly controlled by permafrost landscapes, soil types and ALT. This proposed DSs-SBAS InSAR method has a great potential for monitoring large-scale deformation and retrieving ALT variations over permafrost regions in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2019, Science Press.

Remote sensing allows for efficient mapping and characterization of rice areas. In this study, we derived the rice planting window in all rice growing regions in the Philippines from 2016 to 2018 using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), specifically TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1. Using a rule-based method, rice area and Start of Season (SoS) were mapped based on the unique backscatter behaviour of rice corresponding to the initial deliberate agronomic flooding followed by rapid biomass increase. We defined the planting window per year and semester as the 15th and 85th percentile and the peak of planting as the dominant planting date. The accuracy of the rice map was 93% and the SoS was strongly correlated with the actual planting dates reported by farmers (R2 Combining double low line 0.71) based on 482 ground observations in the Philippines in 2018 Semester 1. From this analysis, the planting window in the Philippines for the Semester 2 (wet season) is April-August (peak in June-July), and for Semester 1 (dry season) is September-February (peak in November-December) with large differences across regions. In majority of the regions, the planting window spans more than 100 days, which can have implications on incidence of pests and diseases. © 2020 Authors.","Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Decision making; Food supply; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Systems engineering; Biotic and abiotic stress; Ground observations; Multi-temporal SAR; Philippines; planting duration; Rice; Sentinel-1; Start of seasons (SOS); Radar imaging","Crop calendar; Philippines; planting duration; Rice; SAR; Sentinel-1","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081625627"

Sinkhole formation causes the surface to subside or collapse suddenly without any prior warning, and therefore can lead to extensive damage and even loss of life and property. Delineating sinkholes is important for understanding hydrological processes and mitigating geological hazards in karst areas. The recent development in deriving high-resolution digital elevation models from space missions such as TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX) enables us to delineate and analyze geomorphologic features and landscape structures at small scale (up to 2 m). In this study we use time-series of TSX/TDX data and develop an adaptive sinkhole-analysis method using interferometry observations. A wavelet-based refinement approach is implemented on interferomeric processing to reduce the baseline bias effects and align the interferometrically-derived DEMs. The multi-temporal DEMs are then successfully stacked using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to reconstruct a higher quality DEM. Finally, feature extraction using watershed algorithm is applied to precisely delineate geomorphometric characteristics of the sinkholes. Five TSX/TDX images are selected to evaluate the performance of our approach for sinkholes in Hamedan, West Iran. Results show that applying our methodology on high-resolution TSX/TDX data from different geometries and time periods enables us to effectively distinguish sinkholes from other depression features of the basin. Different TSX/TDX pairs produce consistent results for diameter and depth of sinkholes with the standard deviation of approximately 1 m, in agreement with field observations. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Nevertheless, flood detection in urban areas still proves to be particularly challenging by using SAR. In this paper, we assess the roles of SAR intensity and interferometric coherence in urban flood detection using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X data. We further introduce an active self-learning convolution neural network (A-SL CNN)framework to alleviate the effect of a limited annotated training dataset. The proposed framework selects informative unlabeled samples based on a temporal-ensembling CNN model. These samples are subsequently pseudo-labeled by a multi-scale spatial filter. Consistency regularization is introduced to penalize incorrect labels caused by pseudo-labeling. We show results for a case study that is centered on flooded areas in Houston, USA, during hurricane Harvey in August 2017. Our experiments show that multi-temporal intensity (pre- and co-event)plays the most important role in urban flood detection. Adding multi-temporal coherence can increase the reliability of the inundation map considerably. Meanwhile, encouraging results are achieved by the proposed A-SL CNN framework: the к statistic is improved from 0.614 to 0.686 in comparison to its supervised counterpart. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Satellite images are nowadays massively used by archaeologists to systematically document sites affected by looting. In parallel, remote sensing scientists are increasingly developing processing methods with a certain degree of automation to quantify looting using satellite imagery. To capture the state-of-the-art of this growing field of remote sensing, in this work 47 peer-reviewed research publications and grey literature are reviewed, accounting for: (i) the type of satellite data used, i.e., optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR); (ii) properties of looting features utilized as proxies for damage assessment (e.g., shape, morphology, spectral signature); (iii) image processing workflows; and (iv) rationale for validation. Several scholars studied looting even prior to the conflicts recently affecting the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Regardless of the method used for looting feature identification (either visual/manual, or with the aid of image processing), they preferred very high resolution (VHR) optical imagery, mainly black-and-white panchromatic, or pansharpened multispectral, whereas SAR is being used more recently by specialist image analysts only. Yet the full potential of VHR and high resolution (HR) multispectral information in optical imagery is to be exploited, with limited research studies testing spectral indices. To fill this gap, a range of looted sites across the MENA region are presented in this work, i.e., Lisht, Dashur, and Abusir el Malik (Egypt), and Tell Qarqur, Tell Jifar, Sergiopolis, Apamea, Dura Europos, and Tell Hizareen (Syria). The aim is to highlight: (i) the complementarity of HR multispectral data and VHR SAR with VHR optical imagery, (ii) usefulness of spectral profiles in the visible and near-infrared bands, and (iii) applicability of methods for multi-temporal change detection. Satellite data used for the demonstration include: HR multispectral imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation, VHR X-band SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed mission, VHR panchromatic and multispectral WorldView-2 imagery, and further VHR optical data acquired by GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3, available through Google Earth. Commonalities between the different image processing methods are examined, alongside a critical discussion about automation in looting assessment, current lack of common practices in image processing, achievements in managing the uncertainty in looting feature interpretation, and current needs for more dissemination and user uptake. Directions toward sharing and harmonization of methodologies are outlined, and some proposals are made with regard to the aspects that the community working with satellite images should consider, in order to define best practices of satellite-based looting assessment. © 2019 by the authors.","Damage detection; Feature extraction; Image processing; Infrared devices; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Processing; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Cosmo skymed; Looting; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2; Radar imaging","Archaeological remote sensing; Change detection; COSMO-SkyMed; Feature extraction; Looting; Pattern recognition; SAR; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074207846"

We focused on the analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X Multi-temporal SAR Interferometric (MT-InSAR) results, for the post-unrest period 2012-17. Data from multiple Sentinel-1 tracks and acquisition geometries were used to constrain the E-W and vertical components of the deformation field along with their evolution in time. The interpretation of the InSAR observations and modelling provided insights on the post-unrest deformation pattern of the volcano, allowing the further re-evaluation of the unrest event. The increase of subsidence rates on Nea Kameni, in accordance with the observed change of the spatial deformation pattern, compared to the pre-unrest period, suggests the superimposition of various deformation sources. Best-fitting inversion results indicate two deflation sources located at southwestern Nea Kameni at 1 km depth, and in the northern intra-caldera area at 2 km depth. A northern sill-like source interprets the post-unrest deflation attributed to the passive degassing of the magma intruded at 4 km during the unrest, while an isotropic source at Nea Kameni simulates a prevailing subsidence occurring since the pre-unrest period (1992-2010). © 2019 by the authors.","Deformation; Interferometry; Radar imaging; Subsidence; Volcanoes; Acquisition geometry; Deformation pattern; Post-unrest deflation; Santorini; SAR interferometry; Spatial deformation; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Vertical component; Synthetic aperture radar","Inversion modelling; Post-unrest deflation; Santorini; SAR interferometry; Volcano deformation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061381392"

Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations enable us to provide dramatic changes over a very wide swath of the glacier. Although differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) can estimate very accurate glacier movement, it is often suffered from a loss of coherence due to significant temporal and volume decorrelation. Hence, we used intensity offset tracking, which is capable to apply even if the displacement is large, using estimation of the displacement between the two adjacent areas determined by the cross-correlation of the amplitude between two SAR images.

Although in recent decades it has mainly erupted through vents along the middle East Rift Zone and summit caldera, eruptions can occur anywhere along its laterally extensive rift zones, as demonstrated by the dramatic eruptive activity of 2018. Forecasting eruptive activity requires an understanding of whether an episode of volcano-seismic unrest at Kīlauea and similar volcanoes is caused directly at the edges of an active intrusion or reservoir, or in a volume of wall rock at a distance from the intrusion. Seismic unrest in Kīlauea's upper East Rift Zone (UERZ) has to date been interpreted as the result either of magma intrusion in this region of the volcano or of stresses due to seaward flank migration. However, recent observations suggest that UERZ seismicity may result from variable pressurization of Kīlauea's summit magma system. We analyze seismic and deformation (multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar [InSAR] and GPS) data during a period of variable summit deformation and UERZ seismicity in mid- to late 2007 and calculate Coulomb stress changes on UERZ faults due to modeled summit inflation or deflation. UERZ seismicity during our study period can be explained entirely by stresses arising from pressure changes within Kīlauea's summit reservoirs. Furthermore, a comparison of UERZ fault plane solutions (FPSs) calculated for this study to published UERZ FPSs for previous periods suggests that the UERZ has undergone a transition from a mechanically strong, discontinuous, and immature magma transport system to a mature, mechanically weak, and fully connected transport system over the course of the 1983-2018 eruption. © 2019 Geological Society of America.","Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; Kilauea; Deformation; Pressurization; Seismology; Volcanoes; Coulomb stress changes; Eruptive activity; Fault plane solutions; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Magmatic plumbing system; Pressure change; Seismic activity; Transport systems; caldera; deformation; igneous intrusion; magmatism; rift zone; seismicity; stress change; volcanic eruption; volcanism; volcanology; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072025759"

Mapping of the spatiotemporal variations of ground deformation is urgently needed, along with summarization of the causes of the subsidence over Kunming with the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. In this study, for the first time, a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique with L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-1) and X-band Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) data was applied to Kunming to derive the time series deformation from 2007 to 2016. The annual deformation velocity revealed two severe subsiding regions in Kunming, with a maximum subsidence of 35 mm/y. The comparison of the deformation between InSAR and leveling showed root-mean-square error (RMSE) values of about 4.5 mm for the L-band and 3.7 mm for the X-band, indicating that our results were reliable. We also found that the L-band illustrated a larger amount of subsidence than the X-band in the tested regions. This difference was mainly caused by the different synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-acquired times and imaging geometries between the L-and X-band SAR images. The vertical time series deformation over two severe subsiding regions presented an approximate linear variation with time, where the cumulative subsidence reached 209 mm during the period of 2007–2016. In view of relevant analyses, we found that the subsidence in Kunming was the result of soft soil consolidation, building load, and groundwater extraction. Our results may provide scientific evidence regarding the sound management of urban construction to mitigate potential damage to infrastructure and the environment. © 2019 by the authors.

Based on their proximity to the adjacent infrastructure, their size, and their flow dynamics, FDLs represent potential geohazards. Eight FDLs (FDL-A, -B, -C, -D, -4, -5, -7, -11) within the Dalton Highway corridor in the Brooks Range, Alaska, USA are the subject of this paper. We examined temporal and spatial variation of FDL displacement using medium-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and differential SAR Interferometry (dInSAR) techniques. European Remote Sensing satellite 1/2 (ERS 1/2) and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) acquisitions were used to generate coherent interferograms to study the displacement history of FDLs for 1995–1996 and 2006–2010. We conducted an initial assessment of the capability of satellite InSAR to monitor FDL movement depending on data resolution, season, and vegetation coverage, which also helped us to select useful interferograms. With multi-temporal interferometric displacement maps, we found that seven investigated FDLs (FDL-7 was excluded from this sub-experiment due to limited data coverage) demonstrated strong spatial and seasonal variations in their movement patterns, with maximum displacement rates typically occurring in October and minimum displacement rates during February or March, which is consistent with previously published field study results. Overall, through this study we: (1) delineated the active FDLs during the winter period using a wrapped PALSAR interferogram; (2) analyzed the spatial variation of the deformation field within each FDL body; (3) modeled the seasonal changes of FDL deformation rates through the analysis of multi-temporal ERS tandem interferograms; and (4) integrated InSAR-derived deformation rates with those obtained through historical imagery analysis to determine long-term deformation rates. Results from this study fill the gaps left in the historical imagery analysis and provide important seasonal and spatial deformation data, which are essential in the development of a mitigation plan as these features approach infrastructure. We also summarize our research experience studying these moving features using satellite radar interferometry and believe this can be useful for future studies of similar features. © 2018 The Authors","Alaska; Brooks Range; United States; Debris; Deformation; Image analysis; Interferometry; Landslides; Permafrost; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Alaska; Differential SAR interferometry; European remote sensing satellites; Frozen debris lobe; InSAR; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Temporal and spatial variation; ERS; landslide; PALSAR; permafrost; radar interferometry; reconstruction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; spatial variation; synthetic aperture radar; Space-based radar","Alaska; Frozen debris lobe; InSAR; Landslide; Permafrost","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058629557"

Land subsidence can accelerate the increase in relative sea level, lead to a series of potential hazards, and threaten the stability of the ecological environment and human lives. In this paper, we adopted two commonly used multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR) techniques, Small baseline subset (SBAS) and Temporarily coherent point (TCP) InSAR, to monitor the land subsidence along the entire coastline of Guangdong Province. The long-wavelength L-band ALOS/PALSAR-1 dataset collected from 2007 to 2011 is used to generate the average deformation velocity and deformation time series. Linear subsidence rates over 150 mm/yr are observed in the Chaoshan Plain. The spatiotemporal characteristics are analyzed and then compared with land use and geology to infer potential causes of the land subsidence. The results show that (1) subsidence with notable rates (>20 mm/yr) mainly occurs in areas of aquaculture, followed by urban, agricultural, and forest areas, with percentages of 40.8%, 37.1%, 21.5%, and 0.6%, respectively; (2) subsidence is mainly concentrated in the compressible Holocene deposits, and clearly associated with the thickness of the deposits; and (3) groundwater exploitation for aquaculture and agricultural use outside city areas is probably the main cause of subsidence along these coastal areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Agriculture; Aquaculture; Coastal zones; Deformation; Deposits; Groundwater; Land use; Sea level; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Coastal area; Deformation time-series; Guangdong; Land subsidence; MTInSAR; Subsidence","Coastal areas; Deformation time-series; Guangdong; Land subsidence; MTInSAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081079772"

Existing studies on the retrieval of biomass with multi-frequency backscatter relied on single observations of the backscatter and were thus not able to demonstrate the potential of multi-temporal C- and L-band data that are now available from spaceborne missions. Based on spaceborne C- and L-band and airborne P-band images acquired over a forest site in southern Sweden, we investigated whether Cand L-band backscatter may complement retrievals of above-ground biomass from P-band. To this end, a retrieval framework was adopted that utilizes a semi-empirical model for C- and L-bands and an empirical parametric model for P-band. Estimates of above-ground biomass were validated with the aid of 20 m-diameter plots and a LiDAR-derived biomass map with 100 m × 100 m pixel size. The highest retrieval accuracy when not combining frequencies was obtained for P-band with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 30% at the hectare scale. The retrieval with multi-temporal L- and C-bands produced errors of the order of 40% and 50%, respectively. The P-band retrieval could be improved for 4% when using P-, L-, and C-bands jointly. The combination of C- and L-bands allowed for retrieval accuracies close to those achieved with P-band. A crucial requirement for achieving an error of 30% with C- and L-bands was the use of multi-temporal observations, which was highlighted by the fact that the retrieval with the best individual L-band image was associated with an error of 61%. The results of this study reconfirmed that P-band is the most suited frequency for the retrieval of above-ground biomass of boreal forests based on backscatter, but also highlight the potential of multi-temporal C- and L-band imagery for mapping above-ground biomass, for instance in areas where the planned ESA BIOMASS P-band mission will not be allowed to acquire data. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Biomass; Errors; Mean square error; Optical radar; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Above ground biomass; Boreal forests; Multi frequency; Multi-temporal; P-band radar mission; Retrieval frameworks; Root mean square errors; Semi-empirical modeling; Forestry","Above-ground biomass; Hemi-boreal forest; Multi-frequency; Multi-temporal; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071575637"

However, owing to various reasons, there is inevitable loss of information for whatever difference image and actually helpful to change detection. To address such drawbacks, in this paper, an unsupervised change detection approach for SAR images is proposed based on clustering with the relationship of different scale. Primarily, the similarity of difference images is defined by radial basis function (RBF). In order to use complementary information from a mean-ratio image and a log-ratio image, the third difference image is generated by fusion processing. Before all the pixels are classified into changed and unchanged regions by k-means, the difference images are considered as features of the ground truth and their contributions to classification are given by RBF. Furthermore, making use of the statistical analysis and Markov Random Fields (MRF) of pixels, the most likely change pixels are classified to change class and the most likely unchanged pixels to another, the final change detection map is obtained. Experimental results obtained on two real SAR multi-temporal image sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2019 IEEE.","Functions; Image segmentation; Industrial electronics; Magnetorheological fluids; Markov processes; Pixels; Radial basis function networks; Synthetic aperture radar; Difference images; Image change detection; Markov Random Fields; Multi-temporal image; Radial Basis Function(RBF); Relationship analysis; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Unsupervised change detection; Radar imaging","Image change detection; Markov Random Fields (MRF's); Radial basis function (RBF); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073048173"

For agricultural crop discrimination, compared with single-temporal data, multi-temporal data can dramatically increase crop classification accuracies since the same crop shows different external phenomena as it grows up. In practice, the utilization of multi-temporal data encounters a serious problem known as a ""dimension disaster"". Aiming to solve this problem and raise the classification accuracy, this study developed a feature dimension reduction method using stacked sparse auto-encoders (S-SAEs) for crop classification. First, various incoherent scattering decomposition algorithms were employed to extract a variety of detailed and quantitative parameters from multi-temporal PolSAR data. Second, based on analyzing the configuration and main parameters for constructing an S-SAE, a three-hidden-layer S-SAE network was built to reduce the dimensionality and extract effective features to manage the ""dimension disaster"" caused by excessive scattering parameters, especially for multi-temporal, quad-pol SAR images. Third, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was constructed and employed to further enhance the crop classification performance. Finally, the performances of the proposed strategy were assessed with the simulated multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data for two experimental sites established by the European Space Agency (ESA). The experimental results showed that the overall accuracy with the proposed method was raised by at least 17% compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) method in the case of a 1% training ratio. Meanwhile, for a CNN classifier, the overall accuracy was almost 4% higher than those of the principle component analysis (PCA) and locally linear embedded (LLE) methods. The comparison studies clearly demonstrated the advantage of the proposed multi-temporal crop classification methodology in terms of classification accuracy, even with small training ratios. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Disasters; Incoherent scattering; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Network layers; Polarimeters; Principal component analysis; Signal encoding; Auto encoders; Classification accuracy; Crop classification; Decomposition algorithm; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Principle component analysis; Quantitative parameters; Synthetic aperture radar","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Crop classification; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); Stacked sparse auto-encoder (S-SAE)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081084430"

Excessive groundwater withdrawal, rapid urbanisation and industrial activities contribute to land subsidence in this area. In this study, we used the multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of land subsidence in Changzhou. Twenty-five ENVISAT ASAR and 29 TerraSAR-X images acquired from 2004 to 2013 were used to determine the rate and temporal evolution of land subsidence. We used the ERA-Interim model instead of spatiotemporal filtering in traditional MT-InSAR to mitigate the atmospheric phase screen. The InSAR-derived results were evaluated by comparing data from three time series methods and different bands (C and X bands), and accuracy was validated through levelling surveys and GPS measurements. For three regions, a distinct subsidence pattern was observed in major industrial areas with a maximum subsidence rate of up to − 39.9 mm/year. We also characterised the spatiotemporal variations of land subsidence in major industrial areas in Changzhou. The deformation of large-scale man-made linear features, namely high-speed railways, highway networks and a bridge, was analysed. The spatiotemporal characteristics and possible reasons for the observed subsidence were discussed to provide a reference for future urban development planning in Changzhou. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Changzhou; China; Jiangsu; Yangtze Delta; deformation; Envisat; GPS; industrial location; leveling; satellite data; spatiotemporal analysis; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; transportation infrastructure; transportation safety; urban transport","Changzhou City; Infrastructure; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR); TerraSAR-X; Validation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068794408"

ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) multi-temporal data have been used in this work. Normalised radar cross-section (NRCS) and polarimetric features extracted from HH and HV polarised data allowed recognising different categories of land covers termed as NRCS classification. Grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features were extracted by using a different moving window sizes applied on local regions previously obtained by binarisation of the NRCS results. A total of 300 samples of regions and five GLCM characteristics have been used here. The detection of deforestation appears clearly in the resulted images with a very satisfactory precision of the reached regions, and the obtained results of the proposed supervised approach have indeed led to very good detection results of the deforestation change. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.","Deforestation; Image fusion; Image processing; Radar cross section; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Change detection; Efficient detection; Grey-level co-occurrence matrixes; Local texture feature; Multi-temporal data; Observation satellites; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Polarimetric features; Radar imaging","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077436529"

Majority of Rice is sown in kharif season in the country. This is monsoon season for the country where cloud cover poses a major problem for optical remote sensing. Therefore, for these states rice acreage estimation is being done using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data operationally in India since 1998. A case study is presented in this paper for analysis of past 6 years' (2012-13 to 2017-18) estimations. Multi temporal Radarsat-2 (HH), RISAT-1 ScanSAR (HH) and Sentinel-1 (VV) data was used in years 2012, 2013-2016, and 2017, respectively for paddy identification. Hierarchal Decision Rule based classification (HDRC) approach was used to identify rice areas under sample segments. Extensive ground truth collected by state remote sensing departments and agriculture departments was utilized in setting the limits of HDRC models and accuracy assessment. Yield was estimated using weather based and remote sensing-based models. Area, production and yield estimates were made and compared with those given by DES. RMSE and R2 were used as statistical measures to assess the accuracy of results. The RMSE % ranged from 2.3 to 4.3; 0.84 to 1.35; 0.24 to 0.27 for area, production and yield respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) ranged from 0.62 to 0.92; 0.75 to 0.91; 0.5 to 0.83 for area, production and yield respectively. The study showed that use of multi temporal SAR data (both HH and VV) is quite useful for paddy acreage estimation, especially during monsoon. © Authors 2019.

They are planted in a wide range and account for a high proportion of the total grain output. Quick and accurate acquisition of Dryland Crop Planting area can provide decision support for agricultural production managers, provide basis for food policy formulation, and provide guarantee for national food security. Different from the initial stage of rice growth, the underlying surface water layer and rice plant can form obvious dihedral angle, which can produce strong backscatter to microwave. Intercropping and interplanting of dryland crops are common, and the planting structure is complex, so it is difficult to identify them. At present, there is a lack of research on scattering characteristics of Dryland crops, and the universality of recognition methods is also poor, which leads to the low accuracy of dry land crop recognition based on SAR data. The purpose of studying the scattering characteristics of dryland crops and their changes with time is to provide basis for the identification of dryland crops and improve the classification accuracy. This paper chooses Jizhou City, Hebei Province as the research area, and takes corn and cotton as the research objects. The full polarization RADARSAT -2 data of three phases in 2018 (July 17, August 7 and September 24) were used. The changes of basic scattering characteristics (average scattering angle, entropy, volume scattering, dihedral angle scattering, surface scattering) of crops with different target decomposition methods (Cloude-Pottier, Freeman, Yamaguchi) were studied and compared, and the proportion of basic scattering power and its changing trend at different growth stages were analyzed. The results showed that the counter-entropy of the two crops changed little in the whole growth period, and mainly consisted of surface scattering and volume scattering. For corn, with the growth of crops, the entropy and average scattering angle increased first and then decreased, the proportion of surface scattering power decreased from 67% to 48% and then increased to 55%, and the proportion of volume scattering power increased from 33% to 52% and then decreased to 45%. On August 7, the volume scattering power is greater than the surface scattering power. For cotton, with the increase of crop growth entropy and average scattering angle, the proportion of surface scattering power decreases from 66% to 54%, and the volume scattering power increases from 33% to 46%. The surface scattering power is larger than volume scattering in the whole growth period. This study will help to determine the scattering mechanism of corn and cotton, and provide reference for the study of scattering characteristics of other dryland crops. © 2019 IEEE.","Cotton; Crops; Decision support systems; Dihedral angle; Entropy; Food supply; Plasma interactions; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural productions; Classification accuracy; Different growth stages; Dryland crops; Multi-temporal; Scattering char-acteristics; Scattering mechanisms; Target decomposition methods; Surface scattering","Dryland crops; Multi-temporal; Scattering characteristics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072917082"

Satellite remote sensing is an important tool to monitor variability in lake surface area, but monitoring depth is challenging. The distribution of bottomfast ice within a lake provides an indicator of depth and previous research shows that as lake ice develops and becomes bottomfast it exhibits a distinct signature when observed using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This research proposes an efficient computational technique for identifying bottom-fast ice across lakes in the Northwest Territories using multi-temporal SAR backscatter images and applies a function called dynamic time warping (DTW), which provides a shape-based similarity metric for time series data. We used backscatter profiles from surveyed lakes with known bottomfast ice to generate a DTW similarity metric on a pixel by pixel basis for a set of lakes. The similarity metric was used to categorize ice status as bottomfast or floating ice with 89.1% accuracy. DTW is an effective technique to map bottomfast ice using SAR time series and has potential to address limitations of other approaches where certain ice structures over deep lakes can produce backscatter responses similar to bottomfast ice. ©, Copyright © CASI.","Backscattering; Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Lakes; Pixels; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface water resources; Time series; Backscatter profiles; Computational technique; Dynamic time warping; Multi-temporal SAR; Satellite remote sensing; Shape based similarities; Similarity metrics; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074606293"

Specific attention was directed at realizing an integrated geomorphological study of the Boulder Clay Glacier, a partially debris-covered glacier belonging to the Northern Foothills (Victoria Land, Antarctica). This area was recently chosen as the location for the construction of a new semi-permanent gravel runway for MZS logistical airfreight operations. Photogrammetric analysis was performed by comparing three historical aerial photogrammetric surveys (carried out in 1956, 1985, and 1993) and Very High Resolution (VHR) GeoEye-1 satellite stereo-image coverage acquired in 2012. The comparison of geo-referenced orthophoto-mosaics allowed the main changes occurring in some particular areas along the coast nearby MZS to be established. Concerning the study of the Boulder Clay Glacier, it has to be considered that glaciers and moraines are not steady-state systems by definition. Several remote sensing and geophysical investigations were carried out with the main aim of determining the general assessment of this glacier: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR); Geodetic Global Positioning System (GPS) network; multi-temporal satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. The analysis of Boulder Clay Glacier moraine pointed out a deformation of less than 74 mm y-1 in a time span of 56 years, value that agrees with velocity and deformation data observed by GPS and InSAR methods. The presence of unexpected brine ponds at the ice/bedrock interface and the deformation pattern observed in the central part of the moraine has to be monitored and studied, especially under the long-term maintenance of the future runway. © 2019 by the authors.","Antennas; Deformation; Geodetic satellites; Geological surveys; Geophysics; Global positioning system; Gravel; Ground penetrating radar systems; Interferometry; Lakes; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Stereo image processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Geomorphological studies; Geophysical measurements; Glacier dynamics; Ground penetrating radar (GPR); Multi-temporal remote sensing; SAR interferometry; Semi permanents; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Geophysical prospecting","Brine ponds; Deformation; Glacier dynamics; GPR; GPS; Photogrammetry; SAR interferometry; Semi-permanent gravel runway","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068188653"

In particular, a classical eigenvalue-eigenvector-based decomposition approach named after Cloude-Pottier decomposition (or ""H/A/α"") has been frequently used to construct classification approaches. A model-based decomposition approach proposed by Neumann some years ago provides two parameters with very similar physical meanings to polarimetric scattering entropy H and the alpha angle α in Cloude-Pottier decomposition. However, the main aim of the Neumann decomposition is to describe the morphological characteristics of vegetation. Therefore, it is worth investigating the performance of Neumann decomposition on crop classification, since vegetation is the principal type of targets in agricultural scenes. In this paper, a multi-temporal supervised classification method based on Neumann decomposition and Random Forest Classifier (named ""ND-RF"") is proposed. The three parameters from Neumann decomposition, computed along the time series of data, are used as classification features. Finally, the Random Forest Classifier is applied for supervised classification. For comparison, an analogue classification scheme is constructed by replacing the Neumann decomposition with the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, hence named CP-RF. For validation, a time series of 11 polarimetric RADARSAT-2 SAR images acquired over an agricultural site in London, Ontario, Canada in 2015 is employed. Totally, 10 multi-temporal combinations of datasets were tested by adding images one by one sequentially along the SAR observation time. The results show that the ND-RF method generally produces better classification performance than the CP-RF method, with the largest improvement of over 12% in overall accuracy. Further tests show that the two parameters similar to entropy and alpha angle produce classification results close to those of CP-RF, whereas the third parameter in the Neumann decomposition is more effective in improving the classification accuracy with respect to the Cloude-Pottier decomposition. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Entropy; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Supervised learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Vegetation; Crop classification; Multi-temporal; Neumann; Polarimetric SAR; Pottier decomposition; Radarsat-2; Random forests; Target decomposition; Radar target recognition","Cloude-Pottier decomposition; Crop classification; Multi-temporal; Neumann decomposition; Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR); RADARSAT-2; Random forest; Target decomposition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063984069"

Here, remote sensing data and machine learning techniques that could support or substitute traditional field-based data collection are evaluated. For the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario, Canada, different combinations of multi-angle/temporal quad pol RADARSAT-2, simulated compact pol RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and high and low spatial resolution Digital Elevation and Surface Models (DEM and DSM, respectively) were used to classify six land cover classes with Random Forests: shallow water, marsh, swamp, water, forest, and agriculture/non-forested. Results demonstrate that high accuracies can be achieved with multi-temporal SAR data alone (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image and a summer image), or via fusion of SAR and DEM and DSM data for single dates/incidence angles (e.g., user’s and producer’s accuracies ≥90% for a model based on a spring image, DEM, and DSM data). For all models based on single SAR images, simulated compact pol data generally achieved lower accuracies than quad pol RADARSAT-2 data. However, it was possible to compensate for observed differences through either multi-temporal/angle data fusion or the inclusion of DEM and DSM data (i.e., as a result, there was not a statistically significant difference between multiple models). With a higher repeat-pass cycle than RADARSAT-2, RCM is expected to be a reliable source of C-band SAR data that will contribute positively to ongoing efforts to inventory wetlands and monitor change in areas containing the same land cover classes evaluated here. © 2019 by the authors.

The study area is a farmland in North India having relatively large patches of winter crops with medium heterogeneity. Ten POLSAR parameters are evaluated for this work including polarimetric entropy (H), polarimetric alpha angle (α), Yamaguchi decomposition components, radar vegetation index (RVI), volume scattering index, canopy scattering index, biomass index, and pedestal height (PH). We choose polarimetric RVI, polarimetric entropy, and polarimetric alpha angle parameter, after sensitivity analysis, to be incorporated into building the multi-temporal POLSAR decision tree. The proposed algorithm accepts, as input, a precisely co-registered multi-date stack of fully POLSAR imagery. The algorithm makes use of the temporal profiles of the selected POLSAR parameters in achieving the crop discrimination. We provide a quantitative assessment of classification accuracy of various classes based on extensive ground truth data. The multi-temporal algorithm is compared with the well-established, single-date, supervised Wishart classifier. Statistically significant improvement of accuracies is observed across various classes as compared to single-date methodology.

Much work so far has focused on the usage of remote sensing data from multiple sensors to derive FMC; however, little attention has been devoted to the usage of the C-band Sentinel-1A data. In this study, we aimed to test the performance of C-band Sentinel-1A data for multi-temporal retrieval of forest FMC by coupling the bare soil backscatter linear model with the vegetation backscatter water cloud model (WCM). This coupled model that linked the observed backscatter directly to FMC, was firstly calibrated using field FMC measurements and corresponding synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatters (VV and VH), and then a look-up table (LUT) comprising of the modelled VH backscatter and FMC was built by running the calibrated model forwardly. The absolute difference (MAEr) of modelled and observed VH backscatters was selected as the cost function to search the optimal FMC from the LUT. The performance of the presented methodology was verified using the three-fold cross-validation method by dividing the whole samples into equal three parts. Two parts were used for the model calibration and the other one for the validation, and this was repeated three times. The results showed that the estimated and measured forest FMC were consistent across the three validation samples, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.53% (Sample 1), 12.64% (Sample 2) and 15.45% (Sample 3). To further test the performance of the C-band Sentinel-1A data for forest FMC estimation, our results were compared to those obtained using the optical Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data and the empirical partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The latter resulted in higher RMSE between estimated and measured forest FMC with 20.11% (Sample 1), 26.21% (Sample 2) and 26.73% (Sample 3) than the presented Sentinel-1A data-based method. Hence, this study demonstrated that the good capability of C-band Sentinel-1A data for forest FMC retrieval, opening the possibility of developing a new operational SAR data-based methodology for forest FMC estimation. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Cloud computing; Cost functions; Erbium compounds; Fires; Forestry; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Moisture; Moisture determination; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Table lookup; Vegetation; Fuel moisture content; Linear modeling; Operational land imager; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Root mean square errors; Sentinel-1; Three fold cross validation; Water cloud models; Fuels","Bare soil backscatter linear model; Dual polarimetric Sentinel-1A; Fuel moisture content; Vegetation backscatter water cloud model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068518993"

In order to understand how those deformations occurred and developed, the knowledge of bridge deformation characteristics and mechanisms is essential for users to manage and maintain bridges sustainably. The Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique is an effective tool to observe the bridge deformation and has achieved a few impressive results. Nevertheless, the previous studies often focused on bridges with simple structure and high coherence, avoiding the difficulties in identifying dense and accurate point-like targets (PTs) upon complexly structured bridges with more severe de-correlation effects. Moreover, the traditional two-dimensional (2D) deformation maps of complexly structured bridges are difficult for non-expert users to understand in multi-dimensional views, increasing the difficulty of deformation interpretation. Finally, simply analyzing all the PTs’ deformation velocities equivalently without considering the structural information is insufficient to explore the deformation characteristics and mechanisms of complexly structured bridges. Starting from these limitations, we proposed a bridge-tailored multi-temporal DInSAR approach, and for the first time, explored the deformation characteristics and mechanisms of the complexly structured arch bridge and cable-stayed bridge. The density and accuracy of detectable PTs on bridges are improved by implementing a structure coherence-driven PTs selection strategy. A simple and fast algorithm for 3D visualization of bridge results is accomplished through integrating orthorectified PTs’ measurements from multi-track SAR datasets. Based on the 3D products, the deformation characteristics of different types of bridges are investigated by identifying the damage sensitive points (DSPs) and revealing the global deformations, and the deformation mechanisms of different bridge components are explored by analyzing the different types of PTs classified based on the spatial-temporal semantics. It is derived that the deformation characteristics of bridges are associated with their structural and material characteristics, and the deformation mechanisms of their DSPs are similar. The subsidence of land surface and foundations control the deformation of the pier-DSPs which mainly reflect the trend deformation of bridges, whereas the temperature variation drives the deformation temporal evolution of the span-DSPs which represent the elastic deformation of bridges. © 2019","Bridge components; Bridges; Cable stayed bridges; Mechanisms; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Weather satellites; 3D Visualization; D-inSAR; Deformation Characteristics; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Material characteristics; Multi-dimensional view; Structural deformation; Structural information; algorithm; arch; bridge; deformation; interferometry; land surface; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; temporal evolution; time series; visualization; Arch bridges","3D visualization; Bridge; Deformation characteristics; Mechanisms; Time-series DInSAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070233308"

This is of particular concern, given the availability of such data from RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) shortly. Previous studies have illustrated potential for accurate crop mapping using DP and FP SAR features, yet what contribution each feature makes to the model accuracy is not well investigated. Accordingly, this study examined the potential of the early- to mid-season (i.e., May to July) RADARSAT-2 SAR images for crop mapping in an agricultural region in Manitoba, Canada. Various classification scenarios were defined based on the extracted features from FP SAR data, as well as simulated DP and CP SAR data at two different noise floors. Both overall and individual class accuracies were compared for multi-temporal, multi-polarization SAR data using the pixel- and object-based random forest (RF) classification schemes. The late July C-band SAR observation was the most useful data for crop mapping, but the accuracy of single-date image classification was insufficient. Polarimetric decomposition features extracted from CP and FP SAR data produced relatively equal or slightly better classification accuracies compared to the SAR backscattering intensity features. The RF variable importance analysis revealed features that were sensitive to depolarization due to the volume scattering are the most important FP and CP SAR data. Synergistic use of all features resulted in a marginal improvement in overall classification accuracies, given that several extracted features were highly correlated. A reduction of highly correlated features based on integrating the Spearman correlation coefficient and the RF variable importance analyses boosted the accuracy of crop classification. In particular, overall accuracies of 88.23%, 82.12%, and 77.35% were achieved using the optimized features of FP, CP, and DP SAR data, respectively, using the object-based RF algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Data mining; Decision trees; Ellipsometry; Mapping; Polarimeters; Polarization; Compact polarimetries; Constellation missions; Crop classification; Multi-polarization; Multi-temporal; Radarsat-2; Synthetic aperture radar","Compact-polarimetry; Crop classification; Multi-polarization; Multi-temporal; RADARSAT Constellation Mission; RADARSAT-2; RCM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068500819"

Sentinel-1 satellites provide regular Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions that are potentially useful to monitor these areas, but they can be affected by temporal decorrelation due to rapid changes in the surface. The application of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) therefore seems difficult due to loss of coherence. On the other hand, Corner Reflectors (CR) can be used as coherent targets in SAR images for accurate displacement measurement thanks to their strong backscattering property and temporal stability. The use of CRs in multi-temporal InSAR analysis in Alpine mountain areas can thus be beneficial. In this study, we present a comparison between triangular and rectangular CRs, based on Radar Cross Section (RCS) measurements in an anechoic chamber and on long-term experiments over the Argentière glacier and the surrounding slopes and moraine. The visibility in both summer and winter of 10 CRs installed on the test site was investigated. As this area is exposed to heavy precipitation including snow falls, two perforated CRs were tested. The amplitude stability and the phase error of each CR were estimated. A precise tracking of two CRs installed at the glacier surface was also able to measure the displacement of the Argentière glacier, giving results close to previous GPS measurements. Furthermore, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) study was conducted, using the most stable CR as reference point to estimate slope instabilities, which led to the identification of an area corresponding to a tectonic fault called ""Faille de l'angle"".

Firstly, multi-temporal segmentation is carried out to segment two temporal SAR images simultaneously. It considers the homogeneity in two temporal images, and could generate homogeneous objects in spectral, spatial and temporal. In addition, through setting different segmentation parameters, the multi-temporal images can be segmented in a set of scales. This process exploits the advantages of OBIA that could effectively reduce spurious changes, and considers the scale of change detection task. Secondly, a multiplicative noise model called Nakagami-Rayleigh distribution is employed to describe SAR data, and then applied to Bayesian formulation. Thus, a new statistical distance that is insensitive to speckles is derived to measure the distances between pairs of parcels. Then, cluster ensemble algorithm is utilized to improve accuracy of individual result in each scale to obtain the final change detection map. Finally, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other four methods. © 2018 IEEE.","Bayesian networks; Image segmentation; Object detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Multi scale analysis; Multi-temporal image; Multiplicative noise; Object based image analysis; Object-based methods; Rayleigh distributions; Statistical distance; Radar imaging","Change detection; Multi-scale analysis; Object-based image analysis; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061809865"

Remote sensing has been considered as an effective means for crop growth monitoring due to its timely updating and complete coverage. In this paper, we explored the potential of L-band fully-polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data for crop monitoring and classification. The study site was located in the Sacramento Valley, in California where the cropping system is relatively diverse. Full season polarimetric signatures, as well as scattering mechanisms, for several crops, including almond, walnut, alfalfa, winter wheat, corn, sunflower, and tomato, were analyzed with linear polarizations (HH, HV, and VV) and polarimetric decomposition (Cloude–Pottier and Freeman–Durden) parameters, respectively. The separability amongst crop types was assessed across a full calendar year based on both linear polarizations and decomposition parameters. The unique structure-related polarimetric signature of each crop was provided by multitemporal UAVSAR data with a fine temporal resolution. Permanent tree crops (almond and walnut) and alfalfa demonstrated stable radar backscattering values across the growing season, whereas winter wheat and summer crops (corn, sunflower, and tomato) presented drastically different patterns, with rapid increase from the emergence stage to the peak biomass stage, followed by a significant decrease during the senescence stage. In general, the polarimetric signature was heterogeneous during June and October, while homogeneous during March-to-May and July-to-August. The scattering mechanisms depend heavily upon crop type and phenological stage. The primary scattering mechanism for tree crops was volume scattering (>40%), while surface scattering (>40%) dominated for alfalfa and winter wheat, although double-bounce scattering (>30%) was notable for alfalfa during March-to-September. Surface scattering was also dominant (>40%) for summer crops across the growing season except for sunflower and tomato during June and corn during July-to-October when volume scattering (>40%) was the primary scattering mechanism. Crops were better discriminated with decomposition parameters than with linear polarizations, and the greatest separability occurred during the peak biomass stage (July-August). All crop types were completely separable from the others when simultaneously using UAVSAR data spanning the whole growing season. The results demonstrate the feasibility of L-band SAR for crop monitoring and classification, without the need for optical data, and should serve as a guideline for future research. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","California; Sacramento Valley; United States; Helianthus; Juglans; Lycopersicon esculentum; Medicago sativa; Prunus dulcis; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; assessment method; crop production; decomposition analysis; future prospect; image analysis; monitoring; scattering; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar; wheat","Classification; Crop growth monitoring; Full-polarimetric SAR; Multi-temporal image; Polarimetric decomposition; Scattering mechanisms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062916915"

Identifying the timing of these phases is crucial for river discharge, avalanches and snow contaminants monitoring. An alternative to the sporadic and punctual snow water equivalent (SWE) and liquid water content (LWC) measurements is represented by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). We analyze the correlation between the multi-temporal C-band SAR backscattering and the snow melting timing. The backscattering was compared with in situ observations and snow modelling simulations for two test sites in the Alpine region. SAR sensitivity to LWC variation and snow properties enables the identification of the snow melting phases. A strong decrease of the backscattering in correspondence of an increase of LWC, e.g. during the moistening phase, is observed. Furthermore, an increase of backscattering happens in correspondence of SWE decrease, e.g. during the run-off phase. We discuss the possible mechanisms which affect SAR backscattering, related both to LWC and snow structure variations.

For regions with dense vegetation cover the use of remote sensing data provides an attractive solution to soil prediction through the relationship between soil and remotely sensed information of vegetation, especially considering the availability of multi-temporal series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1. In this study, we used a structural equation model (SEM) to link soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density (BD) with temporal variation of SAR signals, taking into account possible interacting relationships of the soil-vegetation system. The test area is in the coastal wetlands of east-central China, where Sentinel-1 data were acquired during the vegetation growing season in 2017. A total of fifteen sites were sampled at three depths: 0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and 60–100 cm. Predictive accuracy was assessed using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Results showed that SE models successfully predicted SOC (RMSE = 1.63 g kg−1, RPD = 1.22) and BD (RMSE = 0.14 g cm−3, RPD = 1.25) at three depths. We found that SEM supported the idea that the interrelationships exist among soil, vegetation, and remotely sensed information, and improved our ability to investigate relationships between SAR backscatters and soil attributes. The use of time series Sentinel-1 data allowed capturing characteristics of vegetation dynamics and the possible relationships between soil attribute and vegetation. The findings from this study highlight the usefulness of dense temporal SAR data and SEM in soil prediction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","coastal zone; modeling; organic carbon; prediction; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil biota; soil organic matter; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; vegetation cover; wetland","Cause-effect modeling; Soil carbon; Soil-vegetation relationship; Synthetic aperture radar; Temporal variation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081166795"

In order to eliminate the scattering influence of vegetation effectively, this paper developed a modified vegetation backscattering model to retrieve vegetation-covered soil moisture based on multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data and field measurements. This model combined the advantages of optical and radar methods by considering scattering contributions of underlying bare soil and vegetation canopy. Vegetation coverage was used to separate the scattering mechanism of the vegetation from bare soil component in a pixel. In addition, advanced integral equation method was presented to define the scattering of underlying bare soil. PROSAIL optical model was applied to calculate crown water content, which is an important variable associated with the scattering of vegetation canopy. Results demonstrated that the modified model on March 29, 2014 performed better in soil moisture retrieval than that at other growth stages with R2 of 0.806 and root-mean-square error of 0.043 m3·m-3, respectively. Soil moisture can be effectively retrieved by using the modified model in an agricultural region where the surface type is ranging from relatively sparse to full cover. Overall, the modified model provides an insight into extensive application of vegetation-covered soil moisture retrieval in agricultural regions. © 2018 IEEE.","Agriculture; Backscattering; Integral equations; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Water content; Advanced integral equations; Backscatter coefficients; Backscattering models; Influence of vegetations; Root mean square errors; Scattering mechanisms; Soil moisture retrievals; Vegetation coverage; backscatter; data set; RADARSAT; remote sensing; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation mapping; water content; Soil surveys","Backscatter coefficient; crown water content; remote sensing; soil moisture; vegetation backscattering model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062634840"

However, for the successful interpretation of the observed deformation within a structure, or between structures, it is imperative to associate a radar scatterer unambiguously with an actual physical object. Unfortunately, the limited positioning accuracy of the radar scatterers hampers this attribution, which limits the applicability of MT-InSAR. In this study, we propose an approach for health monitoring of railway system combining MT-InSAR and LiDAR (laser scanning) data. An amplitude-augmented interferometric processing approach is applied to extract continuously coherent scatterers (CCS) and temporary coherent scatterers (TCS), and estimate the parameters of interest. Based on the 3D confidence ellipsoid and a decorrelation transformation, all radar scatterers are linked to points in the point cloud and their coordinates are corrected as well. Additionally, several quality metrics defined using both the covariance matrix and the radar geometry are introduced to evaluate the results. Experimental results show that most radar scatterers match well with laser points and that LiDAR data are valuable as auxiliary data to classify the radar scatterers. © 2019 by the authors.","Bridges; Covariance matrix; Deformation; Interferometry; Monitoring; Optical radar; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Deformation monitoring; Geolocations; Multi-temporal; Point cloud; Railway; Synthetic aperture radar","Deformation monitoring; Geo-location; Multi-temporal InSAR; Point cloud; Railway","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073411484"

Accordingly, a multi-frequency soil moisture retrieval framework has been proposed, being applicable for SAR missions operating at the commonly used remote sensing frequencies of L-, C- and X-band. A combination of numerical, physical and semi-empirical scattering models was selected to build a series of forward modeling look up tables (LUTs) covering the typical radar configurations and nature surface conditions. An unsupervised change detection method was integrated to identify areas with abrupt roughness and vegetation changes, so that time-series data collected from different SARs can be combined with the assumption of time-invariant roughness and vegetation. The multi-frequency backscattering coefficient (σ0) with negligible scattering from soil surface (equivalent to calibration uncertainty) was then removed before soil moisture retrieval. Finally, soil moisture retrieval was carried out independently for each landcover type using an optimization method and forward LUTs. Evaluation based on the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment-5 dataset consisting of L-band airborne data, C-band RADARSAT-2 data and X-band COSMO-SkyMed data showed an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.058 cm3/cm3 at the paddock scale (~0.1 – 0.5 km). The comparison with single and dual frequency retrieval suggests that multi-frequency retrieval is not necessary to have the highest accuracy. However, it is still valuable to joint use multi-frequency data consider the limited deterioration in accuracy and the significantly enhanced temporal resolution. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Backscattering; Deterioration; Forward scattering; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Space applications; Surface roughness; Surface scattering; Synthetic aperture radar; Table lookup; Time series; Vegetation; Backscattering coefficients; Calibration uncertainty; Multi frequency; Multi-temporal; Root mean square errors; Soil moisture mapping; Soil moisture retrievals; Unsupervised change detection; accuracy assessment; calibration; COSMO-SkyMed; detection method; forward modeling; RADARSAT; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite mission; soil moisture; soil surface; soil-vegetation interaction; synthetic aperture radar; Soil surveys","Multi-frequency; Multi-temporal; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074197048"

Change detection as well as other interpretation tasks of SAR images always involves non-linear/non-convex problems. Complex (non-linear) change criteria or models have thus been proposed for SAR images, instead of direct difference (e.g., change vector analysis) with/without linear transform (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, Slow Feature Analysis) used in optical image change detection. In this paper, inspired by the powerful deep learning techniques, we present a deep autoencoder (AE) based non-linear subspace representation for unsupervised change detectionwithmulti-temporal SAR images. The proposed architecture is built upon an autoencoder-like (AE-like) network, which non-linearly maps the input SAR data into a latent space. Unlike normal AE networks, a self-expressive layer performing like principal component analysis (PCA) is added between the encoder and the decoder, which further transforms the mapped SAR data to mutually orthogonal subspaces. To make the proposed architecture more efficient at change detection tasks, the parameters are trained to minimize the representation difference of unchanged pixels in the deep subspace. Thus, the proposed architecture is namely the Differentially Deep Subspace Representation (DDSR) network for multi-temporal SAR images change detection.

Multi-temporal Interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) is able to monitor long-term and periodic deformation with high precision by time-series analysis. However, when a new image comes, it is time-consuming to reprocess the whole dataset using the traditional algorithm. Here we propose a recursive approach to deal with InSAR time series by subsequently analyzing the amplitude and the interferometric phase. Sequential change detection is developed to identify surface changes jointly with amplitude observation and initial dataset. Based on the predicted phase residual, scatterers with a phase anomaly are identified by a generalized ratio test while the parameters of other stable scatterers are updated using a static Kalman filter. The main advantage of this method is the real-time data process. Experimental results by the proposed method show that the estimated parameters by the recursive approach agree well with that by the standard approach, and InSAR technique can be used for the real-time evaluation of the deformation risk. © 2019 IEEE.","Deformation; Interferometry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Real time systems; Risk perception; Time series analysis; Deformation monitoring; Estimated parameter; Interferometric phase; Periodic deformation; Real time deformations; Real time evaluation; Sequential change detection; Static Kalman filters; Synthetic aperture radar","deformation monitoring; Kalman filter; MT-InSAR; recursive process","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083487842"

Firstly, the pixel intensity similarities between the two pixels of the multitemporal SAR images are calculated respectively, which are then combined using a weight factor to form a new similarity measurement. Additionally, the edge magnitudes of the two multitemporal SAR images as well as their log-ratio image are detected, and the maximum value among which is chosen to form a binary edge map image. Finally, the weighted similarity based on pixel intensity, location distance and edge information is used to replace the CIELAB space similarity for local clustering in simple linear iterative clustering. The multitemporal SAR images are then cosegmented with accurate boundaries and spatial correspondence. The experimental results conducted on a pair of simulated SAR images and a pair of real-world multitemporal SAR images demonstrate that the boundary recall, undersegmentation error and achievable segmentation accuracy of the proposed method are better than those of other four state-of-the-art methods. © 2019, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

We then used a combination of multi-temporal PALSAR-2/ScanSAR images, multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) images to map annual forest cover for mainland Vietnam during 2015-2018.

Our estimates of mainland Vietnam's forest area were close to that of the Vietnamese government. A comparison of the spatial distribution of forest estimated from JAXA and ESA FNF maps showed that our FNF map in 2015 agreed relatively well with the ESA map, with 77% of pixels being consistent.

However, the way to combine time series multi-angular data acquired from both descending and ascending orbits with different imaging modes (e.g., ScanSAR and Stripmap) remains unresolved. Consequently, a multi-temporal algorithm is proposed for soil moisture retrieval at the pixel – paddock scale (25–500 m) using time series multi-angular L-band (1.26 GHz) radar data. The method assumes time-invariant roughness and vegetation for the retrieval period together with a soil moisture dry-down constraint for noise reduction, while utilizing multi-angular data without incidence angle normalization. The Numerical Maxwell Model of Three-Dimensional simulations and distorted Born approximation (NMM3D-DBA) were used to build a set of landcover specific multi-angular look up tables (LUTs). Effective isotropic roughness values were assumed suitably able to account for the periodic features in cultivated surfaces, with values determined as part of the soil moisture retrieval. A genetic algorithm was used to minimize the difference between LUTs and time series multi-angular radar observations with the dry-down constraint. Evaluation based on the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment dataset (SMAPEx-5) has shown an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.070 m3/m3 at the 25-m pixel scale and 0.056 m3/m3 at the paddock (field) scale (~0.1–0.5 km). Further investigations on the effect of polarization combination and time interval of radar data have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method for irregularly collected data with different imaging modes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Genetic algorithms; Mean square error; Noise abatement; Pixels; Radar imaging; Soil surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Table lookup; Time series; Distorted Born Approximations; Multi-angular; Multi-angular data; Multi-temporal; Radar observations; Root mean square errors; Soil moisture retrievals; Three dimensional simulations; algorithm; Born approximation; data acquisition; genetic algorithm; radar; roughness; satellite data; soil moisture; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Soil moisture","Multi-angular; Multi-temporal; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066958023"

SWE provides useful information for hydrological, climatic and meteorological applications. Retrieving SWE from active microwave remote sensing data has attracted widespread attention in the academic community. This paper took Nongan County, Jilin Province, China as the study area, and selected two scenes of Sentinel-1 interference wide-mode (IW) SAR images to retrieve the SWE in the shallow dry snow area in winter. A mathematical expression that defines the relationship between the backscattering coefficient ratio and the thermal resistance calculated from the measured snow data was established. By using the relationship between the measured thermal resistance and the measured SWE, the value of SWE in the study area can be retrieved by the backscattering coefficient ratio. The result shows that the method used in this paper has high precision (MAE=0.198cm, RMSE=0.24cm). It is feasible to use the C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data to retrieve SWE. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We used the combination of ascending Sentinel-1A, descending Sentinel-1B and ascending ALOS-2 PALSAR data to measure the coseismic deformation. The line-of-sight (LOS) coseismic deformation implies that the earthquake was dominated by right-lateral strike-slip. Ignoring the fault-perpendicular deformation, the fault-parallel and up–down deformation was extracted based on the combination of Sentinel-1A and 1B observations. Results show that the maximum fault-parallel deformation is ~ 13.7 cm at the north wall and the minimum is ~ −16.5 cm at the south wall of the Muji fault. Then, coseismic slip distribution was derived using the steepest descent method (SDM) based on a single-segment fault model using the three InSAR LOS observations as constraints. The slip distribution reveals two slip centers. The maximum slip of the eastern center is 0.5 m at a depth of 8.8 km, where the rake angle is ~ 181.2°. The maximum slip of the western center is 0.6 m at a depth of 10.8 km, where the rake angle is ~ 181.1°. The derived seismic moment obtained equals the Mw 6.6 earthquake. In this study, postseismic deformation time series in 1.5 years after the earthquake were retrieved from 26 multi-temporal Sentinel-1 descending scenes. The postseismic LOS deformation at the north and south walls of Muji fault both increases with time but in opposite directions. The cumulative deformation is 60–80 mm at the north wall, and –30 to −20 mm at the south wall. The postseismic deformation shows similar patterns with the coseismic deformation, and has the same mechanism.

However, training samples are traditionally extracted from the whole image, which leads to longer training time and an unbalanced number of pixels in the changed and unchanged classes. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel change detection method combining saliency detection with a principal component analysis network, named SDPCANet. To enhance the reliability of the training samples and reduce the amount of training samples, the SDPCANet uses context-aware saliency detection to obtain the salient region, from which the training samples are extracted. In addition, to alleviate the gap between the numbers of training samples in two classes, we regulate the candidate samples using the uniform-selecting strategy to enhance the reliability of the training samples for the SDPCANet. Then, the SDPCANet is trained with the extracted training samples and the remaining pixels are classified in the salient region to obtain the final change map.

In these regions, optical images can only obtained fragmented data through the cloud gap or even impossible to get, which cannot meet the requirements of rapid and accurate agricultural monitoring.

Because Japan has so many dikes to survey, an efficient surveying approach is needed. This paper presents the results and accuracy of dike elevation estimation using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, the displacement along the radar line-of-sight direction was calculated by applying persistent-scatterer interferometry to SAR images observed on ascending and descending orbits. The least-squares method was then applied to those results, and the east-west and vertical displacement velocities were estimated by assuming that no north-south displacement occurred. Finally, the displacement velocity was multiplied by a chosen time period, and the elevation at the end of that time period was obtained by adding the known initial elevation. The experimental results show that the root-mean-square error of the elevation of the dike crown was 5.3 cm whereas that of the dike slope exceeded 25 cm. It is concluded that the presented approach is effective for monitoring the dike crown, and the accuracy of the elevation of the dike slope is expected to improve. © 2019 IEEE.","Geology; Hydraulic structures; Least squares approximations; Levees; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Displacement monitoring; Displacement velocity; Multi-temporal SAR images; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); PS-InSAR; Root mean square errors; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Vertical displacements; Radar imaging","dike displacement monitoring; multi-temporal SAR image analysis; PSInSAR; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077707120"

The interplay of gravity, magmatic or hydrothermal fluids, and often active tectonics on a volcanic edifice results in complex spatial and temporal variations in deformation kinematics. While this makes the recognition, assessment, and monitoring of volcano slope instability challenging, advancements in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology have significantly accelerated our knowledge of instability phenomena and our ability to assess their hazards. This review discusses the applications and challenges of SAR imagery to various slope instabilities at volcanoes around the world. SAR amplitude images are powerful tools for mapping areas of geomorphological changes. These snapshots can be combined using Interferometric SAR (InSAR) to create multi-temporal deformation maps that provide unique information on the evolution of slope failures. Space-borne InSAR has become an economic way to detect changes at volcanoes at very high resolution. Ground-Based InSAR (GBInSAR) can produce frequent SAR images (on the order of seconds to minutes), propelling InSAR from monitoring to surveillance and early-warning applications. However, interpreting InSAR-derived ground deformation signals related to volcano slope instability is still challenging. Deformation from magma rise or variations in hydrothermal systems may be inseparable from persistent, deep-seated flank motion. Similarly, shallow or localized ground motion may occur in overlap with thermal contraction or subsidence of newly emplaced lava or tephra deposits. If triggered to failure, landslides can vary over several magnitudes, from small-volume rock falls that pose only a localized hazard, to large-volume debris avalanches capable of travelling tens of kilometers away from the source. These collapses can have cascading hazards if accompanied by directed blasts or tsunamis, emphasizing the need for continued advancement of our understanding of these events and their consequences. To highlight the utility of SAR for measuring and monitoring mass movement, two case studies of Stromboli (Italy) and Pacaya (Guatemala) volcanoes are discussed in detail, where recent instability events, persistent volcanic activity, and ground truth constraints have resulted in excellent case-histories in applying SAR imagery to understand these potentially hazardous slope instabilities. © 2019","Guatemala [Central America]; Italy; Lipari Islands; Messina [Sicily]; Pacaya Volcano; Sicily; Stromboli; debris avalanche; deformation; geomorphology; interferometry; slope failure; slope stability; synthetic aperture radar; volcano","Collapse triggers; Debris avalanche; Deformation; Ground-based InSAR; Interferometry; Pacaya; Spreading; Stromboli","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063090262"

The method assumes that only soil moisture varies in the period of interest, while all other parameters such as vegetation water content and soil surface roughness are sufficiently time invariant. However, this assumption is not easy to satisfy in agricultural areas where cultivation practices such as ploughing and irrigation are irregularly conducted between radar acquisitions. The paper has proposed an unsupervised change detection method to serve as a pre-processing procedure for multi-temporal retrieval. Briefly, the temporal ratio of HV and the temporal difference of HV/VV and VV polarizations were selected as the optimal feature space, using a genetic algorithm based feature selection algorithm and an extensive synthetic data set. The change map is determined from a two-step procedure with the first step producing multiple over-detected change maps for the period of interest using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method. The second step merges the multiple change maps to remove the false alarms with a principle similar to the ensemble machine learning. Evaluation on a synthetic data set demonstrated that the proposed method can largely remove the error in multi-temporal soil moisture retrieval that is caused by abrupt roughness and vegetation changes. Evaluation on real radar data sets, including airborne L-band radar, RADARSAT-2 at C-band and COSMO SkyMed at X-band, demonstrated an accurate identification (>0.9) while yielding a low false-alarm rate (<0.1). These results suggest that the method may be used as a pre-processing stage of global soil moisture retrieval from radar satellite missions with a high revisit frequency, such as Sentinel-1 and SAOCOM-1. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cultivation; Errors; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Soil moisture; Space-based radar; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Vegetation; Water content; Change detection; Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Feature selection algorithm; Multi-temporal analysis; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil surface roughness; Unsupervised change detection; Vegetation water content; algorithm; backscatter; COSMO-SkyMed; data set; detection method; imagery; machine learning; polarization; radar; RADARSAT; soil moisture; soil surface; surface roughness; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; vegetation dynamics; water content; Radar imaging","Change detection; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Time series analysis; Vegetation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062346520"

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is not suitable for detection and monitoring of floods during rainy seasons with clouds in the sky due to non-penetrating capability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surface from the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and is characterised by near all-weather / day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surface areas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in the microwave spectrum and act as specular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from spaceborne SAR sensors resulting into dark pixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding areas of the Earth surface. Change detection techniques using multi-temporal SAR images based on the behaviour of backscattered signals for threshold value for detecting the flood between nonflooding and flooding periods provide information related to the status of water surface of river systems. Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of spaceborne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors due its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the Earth surface depending upon the repeat orbit and SAR payloads on the satellites. Spaceborne SAR payloads can be placed in the orbit into fully active or semi-active configuration based on both transmit and receive capability of signals. In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi- static space-borne SAR sensors is described for the development of real time space-borne SAR surveillance system for monitoring of various characteristics of river basins and detection of floods using threshold / change detection techniques. Furthermore, the concept for the development of constellation of multi-static SAR satellite imaging receivers in LEO and geostationary radar illuminating system is described for real time detection and monitoring of floods. © 2019, Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence.","","Bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors; Detection and monitoring of floods; Radar backscattering coefficient; Rain drop size distribution (RDSD); Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072771355"

The city is located on the northern side of the Volcan de Colima area, one of the most active Mexican volcanoes. On September 21 2012, Ciudad Guzm'n was struck by ground fissures of about 1.5 km of length, causing the deformation of the roads and the propagation of fissures in adjacent buildings.

We processed a new stack of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR acquisition mode images along both descending and ascending paths and spanning the 2016'2018 temporal period.

The method has been considerably evolved in the last decades into an operational tool, which has contributed to advancements in the study of volcanoes, glaciers, forests and urban environments, to name a few examples. Although multi-temporal and multi-baseline methods such as Persistent Scatterer Inter-ferometry (PSI) and SAR Tomography (TomoSAR) have been developed to tackle main shortcomings of conventional InSAR, they still suffer from the inherent limitations of SAR side-looking imaging, including the one-dimensional (1-D) deformation retrieval and the shadow phenomenon, as well as the relative nature of InSAR topographic and displacement measurements. In the recent years, the launch of the German TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite, that is characterized with high precision orbit determination and high spatial resolution, has led to the rise of new SAR geodetic applications. By applying a meticulous correction scheme to TSX timing measurements, SAR imaging geodesy allows the absolute two-dimensional (2-D) localization of bright point targets in SAR images with centimeter accuracy. The three-dimensional (3-D) absolute positioning has been also demonstrated through using stereo SAR. Nevertheless, the difficulty of identical target detection from multi-aspect data, which is the prerequisite for stereo SAR, and the fact that the precision of these methods are in general lower than phase-based methods due to the exploitation of amplitude information only, limit their ubiquitous applicability. This thesis is dedicated to merging the capabilities of InSAR and SAR geodetic techniques, a framework referred to as geodetic InSAR. The ultimate goal is to overcome the pitfalls of both methods and produce detailed 3-D InSAR point clouds with absolute coordinates, with a focus on urban infrastructure monitoring. Three approaches based on fusion of multi-track PSI point clouds, high resolution optical data and vector road network data are proposed for the detection of identical point targets from multi-aspect SAR images. Although the first technique is suitable for targets visible in a same-heading configuration, the latter two are able to detect targets visible in cross-heading configurations i.e., from orbits with opposite heading directions. This enhances the precision of the retrieved absolute 3-D coordinates using stereo SAR especially in the height component. With the aforementioned detection procedures thousands of Persistent Scatterer (PS) can be absolutely localized in urban areas, which has paved the way for automatic SAR-based Ground Control Point (GCP) generation. A practical demonstration of the GCP extraction framework is shown in this work using two pairs of cross-heading data over Oulu, Finland. The absolute height of the SAR GCPs and the radar timing corrections provided by the imaging geodesy method are exploited to introduce an approach for geocoding error correction of InSAR point clouds. The proposed method is flexible in the sense that it can be either used prior to the reference point selection in any InSAR stacking techniques or it can be utilized as a post-processing step after the generation and the geocoding of point clouds. Applications of this technique in both mentioned scenarios are shown for high resolution spotlight PSI and TomoSAR, where the latter is termed geodetic SAR tomography. Strategies have been also developed to evaluate the positioning accuracy of the produced absolute InSAR point clouds with respect to high accuracy Digital Terrain Model (DTM)s of urban areas. Horizontal and vertical accuracy of 20 cm and 10 cm has been achieved using PSI and TomoSAR processing over Berlin, respectively. Multi-aspect absolute InSAR point clouds are used for the first demonstration of geodetic point cloud fusion, where no external positioning data is required for the coreg-istration and tying the point clouds to a geodetic reference frame. As the final contribution, an algorithm has been developed for the task of 1-D to 3-D motion decomposition using fused TomoSAR point clouds. The technique is robust with respect to the high number of outliers available in TomoSAR estimates and allows for highly detailed deformation monitoring of urban areas using high resolution SAR data. © 2019 Deutschen Forschungsanstalt fur Luft-und Raumfahrt.

In this study a new method was developed for delineating river networks using Sentinel-1 imagery. Unsupervised classification was applied to multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data to discriminate water bodies from other land cover types then the outputs were combined to generate a single persistent water bodies product. A thinning algorithm was then used to delineate river centre lines which were converted into vector features and built into a topologically structured geometric network. The complex river system of the Niger Delta was used to compare the performance of the Sentinel-based method against alternative freely available waterbody products from USGS, ESA and OpenStreetMap and a river network derived from a SRTM DEM. From both raster-based and vector-based accuracy assessments it was found that the Sentinel-based river network products were superior to the comparator data sets by a substantial margin. The resulting geometric river network was used to perform flow routing analysis which is important for a variety of environmental management and planning applications.

Radar sensors are capable of imaging Earth's surface independently of the weather conditions, local time of day, penetrating of waves through clouds, and containing spatial information on agricultural crop types. Based on these characteristics, the main goal sought in this research is to reveal the SAR imaging data capability in recognizing various agricultural crops in the main growth season in a more clarified and detailed way by using a deep-learning-based method. In the present research, the multi-temporal C-band Sentinel 1 images were used to classify 14 major classes of agricultural crops plus background in Denmark. By considering the capability of a deep learning method in analyzing satellite images, a novel, optimal, and lightweight network structure was developed and implemented based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. The average pixel-based accuracy and Intersection over Union obtained from the proposed network were 86% and 0.64, respectively. Winter rapeseed, winter barley, winter wheat, spring barley, and sugar beet had the highest pixel-based accuracies of 95%, 94%, 93%, 90%, and 90%; respectively. The pixel-based accuracies for eight crop types and the background class were more than 84%. The network prediction showed that in field borders the classification confidence was lower than the center regions of the fields. However, the proposed structure has been able to identify different crops in multi-temporal Sentinel 1 data of a large area of around 254 thousand hectares with high performance. © 2019 by the authors.","Brain; Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Pixels; Remote sensing; Sugar beets; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification confidence; Convolutional networks; Crop classification; Learning-based methods; Multi-temporal data; Network structures; Sentinel; Spatial informations; Radar imaging","Crop classification; Fully convolutional network; Long-short term memory; Multi-temporal data; Sentinel; Sequential network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065037054"

The high spatial resolution and continuous time coverage of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis techniques provide data and a basis for the development of methods for the investigation and evolution mechanism study of regional land subsidence. Beijing, the capital city of China, has suffered from land subsidence for decades since it was first recorded in the 1950s. It was reported that uneven ground subsidence and fractures have seriously affected the normal operation of the Beijing Capital International Airport (BCIA) in recent years before the overhaul of the middle runway in April 2017. In this study, InSAR time series analysis was successfully used to detect the uneven local subsidence and ground fissure activity that has been gradually increasing in BCIA since 2010. A multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique was performed on 63 TerraSAR-X/TanDem-X (TSX/TDX) images acquired between 2010 and 2017, then deformation rate maps and time series for the airport area were generated. Comparisons of deformation rate and displacement time series from InSAR and ground-leveling were carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of the InSAR-derived measurements. After an integrated analysis of the distribution characteristics of land subsidence, previous research results, and geological data was carried out, we found and located an active ground fissure. Then main cause of the ground fissures was preliminarily discussed. Finally, it can be conducted that InSAR technology can be used to identify and monitor geological processes, such as land subsidence and ground fissure activities, and can provide a scientific approach to better explore and study the cause and formation mechanism of regional subsidence and ground fissures. © 2019 by the authors.","Airports; Continuous time systems; Crane runways; Deformation; Geology; Groundwater; Harmonic analysis; Subsidence; Time series analysis; Beijing capital international airports; Displacement time series; Distribution characteristics; Ground settlement; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; MT-InSAR; Quaternary sediments; Regional land subsidences; Synthetic aperture radar","Ground settlement; Groundwater; MT-InSAR; Quaternary sediment thickness; Runways","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068159358"

The aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of 10 parameters derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, to crop height and canopy coverage (CC) of maize, sunflower, and wheat. The correlation coefficient values indicate a high correlation for maize during the early growing stage. The coefficient determinations (R                             2                             ) of 0.82 and 0.81 indicate that there is a strong relationship between the maize height and SAR parameters including VV + VH and VV, respectively. The maize CC is well correlated with VV parameter (R                             2                              = 0.73), but it is observed that at the later growing stage the correlation became weaker. This means that the sensitivity decreases with increasing vegetation cover growth. Compared to maize, the sensitivity of SAR parameters to wheat variables is often good at the early stage. However, the highest correlation with wheat height represented by Alpha (α) decomposition parameter (R                             2                              = 0.67). The sunflower height has an insignificant correlation with the majority of SAR parameters and only VH polarization shows low sensitivity (R                             2                              = 0.31). The sunflower CC shows relatively higher correlation with VV polarization (R                             2                              = 0.46) at the early stage while no considerable correlation is observed at the later stage. It is found that Sentinel-1 has a high potential for estimation of crop height and CC of the maize as a broad-leaf crop. The same is not true for sunflower as another broad-leaf crop.                          © 2019 by the authors.","","Agricultural monitoring; Crop variables; PolSAR; Scattering coefficient; Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061610639"

While field surveys are time consuming and expensive, remote sensing techniques offer an efficient and fast alternative. The Copernicus programme provides large amounts of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multi-spectral data that can be used for this purpose. This study presents two methods for forest cover classification, one using a multitemporal dataset of SAR images from one orbit, and the other combining SAR images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits and almost cloud-free (<10%) multi-spectral images. The SAR-LC classification system, a rule-based decision tree which is designed to classify land cover types using radar backscatter is used to extract forest cover extent from the 2016 dataset. For the second method, Sentinel-1 images from 2017 in both ascending and descending orbits are combined with 10 m resampled almost cloud free Sentinel-2 images to form one multi-temporal dataset with 88 bands. This is then segmented into objects before forest extent is classified using a rule-based classification. The SAR-LC thresholds were optimised to include the ReNDVI values from the Sentinel-2 images for this purpose. While the final objective of this study is to produce forest cover maps for the whole of Germany, this paper will only focus on the forests around the region of Frankfurt.

The crop yield information is an important basis for the country to formulate food policies and economic plans, so the study of crop classification is of great significance. Traditional optical remote sensing is susceptible to sunlight and clouds, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be used all-time and all-weather. Compared to single- polarization SAR, full-polarization SAR has more abundant information. In this paper, C-band GF- 3(GaoFen-3) satellite data and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data were used as data sources. Changchun City in northeastern China is selected as the experimental area and the scattering characteristics of typical crops in this area are analyzed. Firstly, the GF-3 and multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data were preprocessed. Then, polarization decomposition of GF-3 data was performed to obtain three polarization characteristics: scattering angle, entropy and anisotropy (H/α/A). The Supports vector machine (SVM) algorithm was implemented as the classifier. Polarization characteristics, multi-source and multi-temporal SAR were used for classification features.

We revealed that even with classical machine learning approaches (K nearest neighbors, random forest, and support vector machine), good performance classification could be achieved with F-measure/Accuracy greater than 86 % and Kappa coefficient better than 0.82. We found that the results of the two deep recurrent neural network (RNN)-based classifiers clearly outperformed the classical approaches. Finally, our analyses of Camargue area results show that the same performance was obtained with two different RNN-based classifiers on the Rice class, which is the most dominant crop of this region, with a F-measure metric of 96 %. These results thus highlight that in the near future, these RNN-based techniques will play an important role in the analysis of remote sensing time series. © 2018 SPIE.","Crops; Decision trees; Image processing; Nearest neighbor search; Radar imaging; Recurrent neural networks; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Classical approach; K-nearest neighbors; Land cover; Learning techniques; Machine learning approaches; Multi-temporal; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Sentinel-1; Deep learning","Land cover map; Multi-temporal; Recurrent neural network; SAR; Sentinel-1","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059018566"

In order to drain water out of potential flooding zones and assess property damage, it is important to map the extent and magnitude of the flooded areas at various stages of the storm. We use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) observations, acquired by Sentinel-1 before, during and after the hurricane passage, which enable us to evaluate surface condition during different stages of the hurricane. This study uses multi-temporal images acquired under dry condition before the hurricane to constrain the background backscattering signature. Flooded areas are detected when the backscattering during the hurricane is statistically significantly different from the average dry conditions. The detected changes can be either an increase or decrease of the backscattering, which depends on the scattering characteristics of the surface. In addition, water level change information in Palmdale, South Florida is extracted from an interferogram with the aid of a local water gauge as the reference. The results of our flooding analysis revealed that the majority of the study area in South Florida was flooded during Hurricane Irma. © Authors 2018.

Multi-temporal analyses of single- (VV-) polarization SAR imagery indicate that the surface roughness is more variable at shorter scales (responsible for the X-band backscatter) than at longer scales (C-band). Less variation at both radar bands was found in sea-grass meadows. TerraSAR-X dual-co-polarization data were used for polarimetric analyses based on a decomposition of the Kennaugh matrix, whose elements provide information on the total intensity at both co-polarizations and on the relative strength of even- and odd-bounce backscattering. At steep incidence angles (around 30°) the radar backscatter from bare sand flats is similarly strong at both co-polarizations, while the vertically polarized radar return dominates at higher incidence angles (above 40°). At low water levels, resulting in lower moisture of the sandy sediments, strong single-bounce radar backscattering was observed, while higher water levels (and moisture) caused weak mixed (single- and double-bounce) backscattering. Apart from the absolute water level its history, e.g. the time and level of the closest low tide, must be considered. During the vegetation period, sea-grass meadows cause a stronger increase in horizontally (HH-) polarized radar backscatter, along with an increased double-bounce backscattering. We conclude that the Kennaugh element framework has potential to be used for classification purposes in intertidal areas, but also that, for a full interpretation of the SAR imagery, the exact topography and the surface roughness have to be known. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Germany; North Sea Coast [Germany]; Backscattering; Moisture; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar; Satellites; Sediments; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Water levels; Wind; Environmental conditions; Intertidal flat; Multi-temporal analysis; Polarimetric analysis; Radar backscattering; Sea grass; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Vegetation periods; backscatter; environmental conditions; intertidal environment; meadow; polarization; RADARSAT; satellite imagery; seagrass; surface roughness; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; TerraSAR-X; Radar imaging","Intertidal flats; Kennaugh elements; Multi-temporal analyses; Polarimetry; Sea grass; Sediments; Synthetic Aperture Radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037523493"

In this paper, we consider the use of differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR), multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR), and the pixel offset tracking technique to monitor the surface deformation of a coal mining area. In this study, we use the two-pass D-InSAR method to generate 19 interferometric image pairs from 20 TerraSAR-X SpotLight images. The results show that D-InSAR can be used to obtain high accuracy surface deformation in the mining areas where there is no high gradient deformation, and the pixel offset tracking method offers advantages in those areas where high gradient deformation is found, but its performance is not stable. This means that the unilateral use of these technologies cannot obtain reliable subsidence information in mining areas. Therefore, it is essential to find a new way to integrate the respective advantages of these different methods. In this paper, a new fusion method combining the D-InSAR result with the offset tracking result based on a spatial decorrelation distribution map is proposed to obtain the subsidence results in a mining area. To ensure the reliability of the results, a decision rule is proposed for the spatial decorrelation distribution map, which is generated manually by union analysis in ArcGIS. In the experiments, the mean absolute error of the fusion result is 0.0748 m, while that of D-InSAR is 0.1890 m, and that of offset tracking is 0.1358 m. It is therefore clear that the proposed fusion method is more reliable and more accurate than the use of individual methods, and it may be able to serve as a reference in mining subsidence monitoring. © 2018 by the authors.","Coal; Coal mines; Cutting machines (mining); Deformation; Interferometry; Motion compensation; Pixels; Reliability analysis; Subsidence; D-inSAR; Decision fusion; Mining subsidence; MT-InSAR; Offset tracking; Synthetic aperture radar","D-InSAR; Decision fusion; Mining subsidence; MT-InSAR; Offset tracking","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050469206"

InSAR technique is used to estimate the topographic reconstruction of the earth surface. The main problem of the range-Doppler focusing technique is the nature of the two-dimensional SAR result, affected by the layover indetermination. In order to resolve this problem, a minimum of two sensor acquisitions, separated by a baseline and extended in the cross-slant-range, are needed. However, given its multi-temporal nature, these techniques are vulnerable to atmosphere and Earth environment parameters variation in addition to physical platform instabilities. Furthermore, either two radars are needed or an interferometric cycle is required (that spans from days to weeks), which makes real time DEM estimation impossible. In this work, the authors propose a novel experimental alternative to the InSAR method that uses single-pass acquisitions, using a data driven approach implemented by Deep Neural Networks. We propose a fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder architecture, training it on radar images in order to estimate DEMs from single pass image acquisitions. Our results on a set of Sentinel images show that this method is able to learn to some extent the statistical properties of the DEM.

The types of vegetation mapping in first time are those belonging to the major vegetation types, but especially those that can be observed on the processed images that are the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 series and SPOT-6. The types of classes considered for this study are: no vegetation, forest and undergrowth, moors and lawns, summer crops, winter crops, grassland and water. Several time series stacking has been made on that series containing 140 images radar representing different dates (2017) and the best combination method is to use both the two polarizations VV and VH to the calculation of the matrix of confusion. On the other hand, combinations of SAR images with different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, S2rep, IRECI) calculated from the Images Sentinel-2 have been made. The series of times series stacking ends with combinations between SPOT-6 and Sentinel-1. The times series stacking Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 are satisfactory, with an overall accuracy that reaches 93%. Such precision is very good for data that are available free. © SPIE.

With this work we show how these two techniques in the field of remote sensing and structural engineering can be synergistically used to complement and replace the traditional ground based analysis by providing an extended coverage and a temporally dense set of data. © 2018 by the authors.","Electron tunneling; Remote sensing; Soil structure interactions; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Structural design; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Damage assessments; Ground-based analysis; InSAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Monitoring techniques; Multi-temporal; Relative stiffness; Structural damage assessments; Damage detection","Damage assessment; InSAR; Multi-temporal InSAR; Relative stiffness method; Soil-structure interaction; Structural engineering; Subsidence; Tunneling","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042538311"

Various polarimetric processing methods are applied to multi-temporal S-1 data set in order to obtain several inputs parameters for land-cover classification: e.g. time-series coherence matrices from dual-polarization data (shows coherence among polarizations in matrix for separated time points t1, t2, to tn); scatter zone time series; multi-temporal single and dual-polarization coherence matrices (reveal coherences among time points for one or two polarizations); and parameters from the H/α decomposition. Then, the classification potential of each polarimetric data set is compared to a reference classification, which was derived from time series of dual-polarization backscatter (σ0) images. We evaluate if polarimetric processing of dual-polarization images brings better classification results than alone classification of backscatter image. Finally, we evaluate the impact of segment size and the classifier on classification accuracy. The classification based on polarimetric data sets is consistently better than that of backscatter time series. A maximum overall accuracy of 93.2% was achieved for the classification of four basic land-cover classes (urban, agriculture, forest, and water) using a composite data set made up time series of scatter zone derived from the H/α plane and scatter zone temporal stability maps. This accuracy was 4.5% better compared to our reference classification based on σ0 time series. Similar trends were observed for more detailed land-cover classes. Classification accuracy is heavily influenced by segment size and can drop by about 15% for very small segments. The most suitable classifier proved to be the Support Vector Machine, which performed up to 12% better than the worst one. This study demonstrates the suitability of multi-temporal polarimetry processing for land--cover classification. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Backscattering; Ellipsometry; Image classification; Matrix algebra; Polarimeters; Polarization; Processing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Dual-polarizations; Land cover classification; Overall accuracies; Polarimetric data; Processing method; Temporal stability; data processing; data set; image processing; land classification; land cover; radar imagery; satellite data; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Classification (of information)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048879395"

A possible alternative is to benefit from weather-insensitive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In many real-world applications, critical decisions are made based on some informative optical or radar features related to items such as water, vegetation or soil. Under cloudy conditions, however, optical-based features are not available, and they are commonly reconstructed through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants. In this work, we propose to estimate missing optical features through data fusion and deep-learning. Several sources of information are taken into account-optical sequences, SAR sequences, digital elevation model-so as to exploit both temporal and cross-sensor dependencies. Based on these data and a tiny cloud-free fraction of the target image, a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to perform the desired estimation. To validate the proposed approach, we focus on the estimation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using coupled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series acquired over an agricultural region of Burkina Faso from May-November 2016. Several fusion schemes are considered, causal and non-causal, single-sensor or joint-sensor, corresponding to different operating conditions.

However, the aquifer system responses to groundwater changes are poorly understood in this region, although it is extremely important for groundwater management and land subsidence control. In this study, aquifer parameters and GWS variations of the confined aquifer system in central Cangzhou are quantified by using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and hydraulic head measurements. We apply the multitemporal InSAR method to detect land deformation time series with Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data from 2003 to 2010. Seasonal signals in land deformation and head data are isolated by multichannel singular spectrum analysis to derive the elastic skeletal storativity (Ske). The results reveal a spatially heterogeneous Ske pattern with values ranging from 1.7 × 10−4 to 4.4 × 10−3 that agree well with those derived from pumping tests. An abnormal Skezone is found in the land uplift zone, and a gradual increase of Ske is revealed in the eastern coastal plain, which are likely attributed to the hydrological properties in the aquifer systems. Additionally, we characterize spatiotemporal variations in the total GWS, recoverable GWS, and irreversible GWS. The annual depletion rates of recoverable GWS and irreversible GWS are −0.52 ± 1.27 × 107 and −7.68 ± 2.68 × 107 m3/year, accounting for 6.4% and 93.6% of annual total GWS depletion, respectively, suggesting that previous groundwater pumping practices are unsustainable in this region. Finally, we find a 1-year lag of the IGWS depletion variations behind the head changes due to low vertical hydraulic conductivities in aquitards. ©2018. American Geophysical Union.

Remote sensing technology has proven to be a useful and frequent application in monitoring and mapping wetlands. Combining optical and microwave satellite data can help with mapping and monitoring the biophysical characteristics of wetlands and wetlands' vegetation. Also, fusing radar and optical remote sensing data can increase the wetland classification accuracy. In this paper, data from the fine spatial resolution optical satellite, Sentinel-2 and the Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite, Sentinel-1, were fused for mapping wetlands. Both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were pre-processed. After the pre-processing, vegetation indices were calculated using the Sentinel-2 bands and the results were included in the fusion data set. For the classification of the fused data, three different classification approaches were used and compared. The results showed significant improvement in the wetland classification using both multispectral and microwave data. Also, the presence of the red edge bands and the vegetation indices used in the data set showed significant improvement in the discrimination between wetlands and other vegetated areas. The statistical results of the fusion of the optical and radar data showed high wetland mapping accuracy, showing an overall classification accuracy of approximately 90% in the object-based classification method.

With the objective of reducing the effect of noise on SAR image change detection, this paper presents an approach based on mathematical morphology filtering and K-means clustering for SAR image change detection. First, the multiplicative noise in two SAR images is transformed into additive noise by a logarithmic transformation. Second, the two multitemporal SAR images are denoised by morphological filtering. Third, the mean ratio operator and subtraction operator are used to obtain two difference images. Median filtering is applied to the difference image based on a simple combination of the two difference images. Since an accurate statistical model for the difference image cannot be easily established, the results of change detection are clustered using the K-means algorithm. A comparison of the experimental approach with other algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm can decrease the detection time and improve the detection result. © 2013 IEEE.","Additive noise; Image denoising; K-means clustering; Mathematical morphology; Mathematical transformations; Median filters; Morphology; Synthetic aperture radar; Environmental Monitoring; Experimental approaches; Image change detection; Logarithmic transformations; Mathematical morphology filter; Mathematical morphology filtering; Multi-temporal SAR images; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","Image change detection; K-means clustering; logarithmic transformation; mathematical morphology filter; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064674311"

The technique can measure deformation with a millimeter-level accuracy. It overcomes the limitations of Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) such as geometric, temporal decorrelation and atmospheric variations between master and slave images. In our study, Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode descending pass images from May 2016 to December 2017 (23 images) are used to identify the stable targets called persistent scatterers (PS) over Bengaluru city. Twenty-two differential interferograms are generated after topographic phase removal using the SRTM 30 m DEM. The main objective of this study is to analyze urban subsidence in Bengaluru city in India using the multi-temporal interferometric technique such as PSI. The pixels with Amplitude Stability Index &geq;&thinsp;0.8 are selected as initial PS candidates (PSC). Later, the PSCs having temporal coherence &gt;&thinsp;0.5 are selected for the time series analysis. The number of PSCs that are identified after final selection are reduced from 59590 to 54474 for VV polarization data and 15611 to 15596 for VH polarization data. It is interesting to note that a very less number of PSC are identified in cross-polarized images (VH). A high number of PSC have identified in co-polarized (VV) images as the vertically oriented urban targets produce a double bounce, which results in a strong return towards the sensor. The velocity maps obtained using VV and VH polarizations show displacement in the range of &plusmn;&thinsp;20&thinsp;mm&thinsp;year&minus;1. The subsidence and the upliftment observed in the city shows a linear trend with time. It is observed that the eastern part of Bengaluru city shows more subsidence than the western part. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.","","Persistent Scatterer Interferometry; Polarization; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Urban subsidence","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058153666"

To secure rice production, farmers in these areas grow off-season rice crops, which can be produced only with irrigated water. However, due to prevailing drought conditions, the cultivation of off-season rice crops cannot commence simultaneously. The availability of irrigated water is the critical factor for farmers in deciding when to begin off-season cultivation. To assess off-season rice production, a map of the cultivated area is required. Using multi-polarization/multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data, this study aims to estimate and map the off-season rice paddies. The potential of using support vector machine classification to map off-season rice paddies with C-band SAR data was also established.

These time series require innovative processing and preprocessing approaches including novel speckle suppression algorithms. Here we propose an image transform for hypertemporal SAR image time stacks. This proposed image transform relies on the temporal patterns only, and therefore fully preserves the spatial resolution. Specifically, we explore the potential of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a data-driven approach to decompose the temporal signal into components of different frequencies. Based on the assumption that the high-frequency components are corresponding to speckle, these effects can be isolated and removed. We assessed the speckle filtering performance of the transform using hypertemporal Sentinel-1 data acquired over central Germany comprising 53 scenes. We investigated speckle suppression, ratio images, and edge preservation. For the latter, a novel approach was developed. Our findings suggest that EMD features speckle suppression capabilities similar to that of the Quegan filter while preserving the original image resolution. © 2012 IEEE.","Image resolution; Signal processing; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Data-driven approach; Different frequency; Empirical Mode Decomposition; High frequency components; Multi-temporal; Preprocessing approaches; Radar data; Temporal decomposition; algorithm; image processing; image resolution; radar; satellite data; Sentinel; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Radar imaging","Multitemporal filtering; radar data; speckle; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042704344"

This research aims to monitor and analyze the surface deformation, especially the subsidence that occurred in Surabaya urban area over the last two years. We use Remote Sensing Technology that has been widely developed, not only aims to observe and analyze objects on the earth, but also very useful to monitor land surface changes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is the first known technique to get surface deformation measurement effectively on large areas (thousands of km2) up to sub-centimeters. However, the technique also has limitations. In order to overcome the limitations of InSAR, multi-temporal InSAR techniques have been recently developed and one of them is Small Baseline Subset (SBAS). This time-series technique tries to overcome the temporal decorrelation due to atmosphere effect and measure transient movement on the Earth surface by using multi-look interferograms combination and small baseline temporal selection. Using SBAS technique we processed 24 Sentinel-1A images from Mei 2015 to Mei 2017 and 28 Sentinel-1A images from May 2015 to September 2017 to extract information of vertical displacement in Surabaya and compare both of them. The result shows that during the observation period, the rate of deformation in the form of Line of Sight Displacement (LOS) is varies from -60mm/year to +20mm/year.

Among various technologies, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been successfully applied in urban settlement mapping in the past two decades. Although much effort with varying degrees of success has been made in previous studies, the research work is still ongoing, and three challenges should be highlighted. First, the effect of de-speckling is usually underestimated, to the extent that the improvement of the SAR image quality is totally ignored in some studies. Second, a method that combines full Interferometric SAR (InSAR) information is as yet missing. Third, training samples are generally required to process SAR images to extract urban settlements, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive, or even impractical when classifying satellite data at the regional/global scale. To address these issues, this paper presents an automatic method for urban settlement mapping trained by multi-temporal InSAR using social media. To improve the detection performance and reduce false alarm ratio, intensity and coherence are first accurately estimated without loss of image resolution by homogeneous pixel selection and robust estimators. The homogeneous pixels will be also applied to measure urban characteristics from the geometrical prospective. After that, training samples are automatically generated from social media based on the fact that cities and urban areas are nowadays full of individual geo-referenced data such as social network data Finally, these multiple information sources will be fused to extract urban areas based on an improved one class classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in extracting urban areas with good accuracy. This study provides a new de-speckling means to process multi-temporal InSAR and sheds new light on the applications of social media in the field of remote sensing. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).","Classification (of information); Data mining; Extraction; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Mapping; Pixels; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sampling; Social networking (online); Automatically generated; Biological changes; Detection performance; Information sources; Interferometric SAR; One-class classifier; Urban characteristics; Various technologies; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060946459"

Therefore, Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of these bridges is urgently needed by civil engineers to effectively reduce the risk of bridge damage or collapse on public safety. An essential method for SHM, the modern Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique, can detect subtle deformation of bridges at relatively low costs. Nevertheless, identifying dense point-like targets (PTs) on such partially coherent arch bridges in SAR image is more difficult than that for other man-made objects, owing to their complex structures and backscattering behaviors. Furthermore, the complex mechanical properties of arch bridges, due to the varying arch-beam interactions, make it hard to separate the surface deformation and thermal dilation accurately, and the lack of specific structural knowledge, that can help to understand the deformation evolution process, limits the global structural risk assessment. Aiming at these problems, we developed a structure-driven multi-temporal DInSAR approach for arch bridge-specific SHM. By introducing three structure-driven steps, i.e. backscattering geometrical interpretation, linear thermal dilation estimation and validation, and Deformation Feature Points (DFPs) based risk assessment, into the traditional DInSAR method, the reliability of PTs identification, thermal dilation separation, and structural risk assessment for arch bridges are significantly improved. The effectiveness of our approach was fairly presented by two case studies of the Rainbow and Lupu bridges, and the experimental results were verified by leveling benchmark validation, cross-sensor comparison, as well as structural-reliability assessment. Our results revealed that arch bridges exhibit a similar pattern of PTs distribution that is dense around piers and sparse on the spans, as well as a symmetrical progressive pattern of surface deformation with the subsidence increasing from piers and reaching a peak at the central spans. In contrast, magnitudes and mechanisms of thermal dilation are different, and highly dependent on the materials and structural characteristics of specific bridges. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","China; Arches; Backscattering; Deformation; Health risks; Interferometry; Piers; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Structural health monitoring; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Weather satellites; Deformation feature; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Structural characteristics; Structural health monitoring (SHM); Structural reliability assessment; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Thermal dilation; Transportation infrastructures; bridge; dilation; interferometry; mapping method; model validation; numerical method; risk assessment; safety; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; transportation infrastructure; Arch bridges","Arch bridges; Deformation Feature Points; Structural Health Monitoring (SHM); synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR); Thermal dilation; Time-series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049322384"

Structural similarity (SSIM), a measure of similarity between two images, has been widely used in image quality assessment. Given the fact that the change detection techniques identify the changed area by the similarity of multi-temporal images, SSIM has significant prospect in change detection of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the experimental results show that SSIM performs worse in change detection of multi-temporal SAR images. In this study, we first propose an advanced SSIM (ASSIM) based on a two-step assumption of extracting structural information and a visual attention measure (VAM) model. Then, we propose a novel approach based on ASSIM for change detection in SAR images. SSIM, ASSIM, and state-of-the-art methods are tested on two datasets to compare their performances in change detection of SAR images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can acquire a better difference image than SSIM and other state-of-the-art methods, and improve the accuracy of change detection in SAR images effectively. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Behavioral research; Image enhancement; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Human visual system (HVS); Image quality assessment; Measure of similarities; Multi-temporal SAR images; State-of-the-art methods; Structural information; Structural similarity; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; accuracy assessment; data set; detection method; image processing; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041443633"

It is expected that fusing different classifiers in a way that the advantages of each are selected can boost the accuracy in the classification of complex land covers, such as wetlands, compared to using a single classifier. Classification of wetlands using remote-sensing methods is a challenging task because of considerable similarities between wetland classes. This fact is more important when utilizing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which contain speckle noise. Consequently, discriminating wetland classes using only SAR data is generally not as accurate as using some other satellite data, such as optical imagery. In this study, a new Multiple Classifier System (MCS), which combines five different algorithms, was proposed to improve the classification accuracy of similar land covers. This system was then applied to classify wetlands in a study area in Newfoundland, Canada, using multi-source and multi-temporal SAR data. The results demonstrated that the proposed MCS was more accurate for the classification of wetlands in terms of both overall and class accuracies compared to applying one specific algorithm. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed system improves the classification accuracy of other complex landscapes. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Canada; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Wetlands; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Multi-temporal SAR; Multiple classifier systems; Newfoundland , Canada; Optical imagery; Satellite data; Wetland classification; accuracy assessment; algorithm; image classification; land cover; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation mapping; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046019759"

In this article, we investigate a novel class-relativity non-local means (CRNLM) algorithm that reduces the effect of speckle noise in the principal component analysis (PCA) feature space for SAR image change detection. Note that the non-local means averaging process is particularly true when the assumed noise model is additive. Thus, we adopt the difference image produced by the ratio image expressed in logarithmic scale and then transform it onto PCA space. This is done so that its signal energy is concentrated, and the noise spreads over the whole PCA space and is additive. A task-dependent CRNLM algorithm is applied to the PCA transformed data set so as to combine local and non-local geometries and capture the robustness to noise. The idea is based on the assumption that non-local similar patches have similar class structures.

In this context, this paper proposes approaches, which include the application of mathematical expressions and application of thresholds on multi-temporal data, for recognizing and classifying various types of land cover, on the basis of ERS and Envisat C-band SAR backscatter and coherence properties.

The European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel1 constellation provides synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coverage with a 6 days revisit period at a high spatial resolution of pixel spacing 20 m. Sentinel-1 data are considerable useful, as they provide valuable information of the vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of Sentinel-1 radar images for rice height and dry biomass retrievals. To do this, we train Sentinel1 data against ground measurements with classical machine learning techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF)) to estimate rice height and dry biomass. The study is carried out on a multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 dataset acquired from May 2017 to September 2017 over the Camargue region, southern France. The ground in-situ measurements were made in the same period to collect rice height and dry biomass over 11 rice fields. The images were processed in order to produce an intensity radar data stack in C-band including dual-polarization VV (Vertical receive and Vertical transmit) and VH (Vertical receive and Horizontal transmit) data. We found that non-parametric methods (SVR and RF) had a better performance over the parametric MLR method for rice biophysical parameter retrievals. The accuracy of rice height estimation showed that rice height retrieval was strongly correlated to the in-situ rice height from dual-polarization, in which Random Forest yielded the best performance with correlation coefficient R2 = 0.92 and the root mean square error (RMSE) 16% (7.9 cm). In addition, we demonstrated that the correlation of Sentinel-1 signal to the biomass was also very high in VH polarization with R2 = 0.9 and RMSE = 18% (162 g.mâ) (with Random Forest method). Such results indicate that the highly qualified Sentinel-1 radar data could be well exploited for rice biomass and height retrieval and they could be used for operational tasks ©  SPIE.

This is mainly aimed at overcoming the limitation of the traditional multi-temporal InSAR techniques that require SAR data from at least three significantly different imaging geometries to fully retrieve time-series 3-D displacements of mining areas. The SGI-based method first generates the multi-temporal observations of the mining-induced vertical subsidence from the single-geometry InSAR data, using a previously developed method for retrieving 3-D mining-related displacements from a single InSAR pair (SIP). The weighted least-squares solutions of the time series of vertical subsidence are estimated from these generated multi-temporal observations of vertical subsidence. Finally, the time series of horizontal motions in the east and north directions are estimated using the proportional relationship between the horizontal motion and the subsidence gradient of the mining area, on the basis of the SGI-derived time series of vertical subsidence. Seven ascending ALOS PALSAR images from the Datong mining area of China were used to test the proposed SGI-based method. The results suggest that the SGI-based method is effective. The SGI-based method not only extends the SIP-based method to time-series 3-D displacement retrieval from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, but also limits the uncertainty propagation from InSAR-derived deformation to the estimated 3-D displacements. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","data set; displacement; geometry; mine; mining; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","3-D displacements; InSAR; Mining subsidence; SAR; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032478124"

Snow cover extent monitoring has been one such application where microwave sensors have been a popular choice due to their sensitivity toward the dielectric property. Snow is a dynamic matter since its dielectric state is dependent on climatic factors prevailing locally around it. In the literature, the polarization fraction (PF) has been used for landcover characterization. In this paper, we utilize the seasonal variation of the PF for mapping snow cover over the Himalayan terrain. Temporal variation of the strength in the polarized return due to change in landcover and season is the prime motivation behind this approach. In addition, the effect of SAR data acquisition time on mapping algorithms is considered in this work which is seldom discussed in the literature. Furthermore, a study is conducted to analyze the seasonal variation in the entropy (H) and the scattering type ( α) parameters over the bare snow-covered ground and the forested areas. The seasonal response of the terrain in the H/α plane corresponding to specific scattering characteristics is analyzed.

For three test sites in Sweden and Finland, coherence decreased for increasing repeat-pass interval from 3- to 12-days due to increasing temporal decorrelation. Overall strong decorrelation was observed for images acquired under unfrozen conditions or thawing conditions. Coherence was best preserved under stable frozen conditions and, in addition, short perpendicular component of the interferometric baseline (i.e., <300 m). Stem volume was estimated with the Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) and multi-temporal combination of single-image estimates. For the test site of Tuusula, Finland, data from eight 3-days image pairs yielded a relative RMSE of 28.2% for stem volumes ranging between 3 and 482 m3/ha. For the 6-days repeat-pass interval, the relative RMSE was only slightly worse (32.4%). For longer repeat-pass intervals, the relative RMSE was above 50%.

During the last two decades, satellite remote sensing data have been extensively used for wetland mapping and monitoring worldwide. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) imagery is a complex and multi-dimensional data, which has high potential to discriminate different land cover types. However, despite significant improvements to both information content in PolSAR imagery and advanced classification approaches, wetland classification using PolSAR data may not provide acceptable classification accuracy. This is because classification accuracy using PolSAR imagery strongly depends on the polarimetric features that are incorporated into the classification scheme. In this paper, a novel feature weighting method for PolSAR imagery is proposed to increase the classification accuracy of complex land cover. Specifically, a new coefficient is determined for each element of the coherency matrix by integration of Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and physical interpretation of the PolSAR data. The proposed methodology was applied to multi-temporal polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 data in the Avalon Peninsula, Deer Lake, and Gros Morne pilot sites in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Different combinations of input features, including original PolSAR features, polarimetric decomposition features, and modified coherency matrix were used to evaluate the capacity of the proposed method for improving the classification accuracy using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The results demonstrated that the modified coherency matrix obtained by the proposed method, Van Zyl, and Freeman-Durden decomposition features were the most important features for wetland classification. The fine spatial resolution maps obtained in this study illustrate the distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the three wetland pilot sites in Newfoundland using the modified coherency matrix and other polarimetric features. The classified maps provide valuable baseline data for effectively monitoring climate and land cover changes, and support further scientific research in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Avalon Peninsula; Canada; Deer Lake [Michigan]; Gros Morne National Park; Michigan; Newfoundland; Newfoundland and Labrador; Newfoundland and Labrador; United States; Cervidae; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Matrix algebra; Polarimeters; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Fisher linear discriminant analysis; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; Random forests; Wetland classification; algorithm; classification; data interpretation; discriminant analysis; land cover; machine learning; matrix; polarization; radar imagery; RADARSAT; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; wetland; Classification (of information)","Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis; Machine learning; Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar; RADARSAT-2; Random Forest; Wetland classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040096280"

This study reveals that the local ∂h/∂t patterns of Amazon floodplains are spatially complex with highly interconnected floodplain channels, but the large-scale (with 350 km swath) ∂h/∂t patterns are simply characterized by river water flow directions. © 2018 by the authors.","Banks (bodies of water); Fits and tolerances; Flow of water; Interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar; Water levels; Wetlands; Basic procedure; D-inSAR; Differential interferometry; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Flood plains; InSAR; Multi-temporal image; Water level changes; Floods","DInSAR; Floodplain; InSAR; SAR; Water level change; Wetland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048963754"

Previous researches proved the effectiveness of multitemporal SAR in land classification, but the characterizations of temporal information were still inadequate. In this paper, we proposed a crop classification scheme, which made full use of multitemporal SAR backscattering responses. In this method, the temporal intensity models were established by the K-means clustering method. The intensity vectors were treated as input features, and the mean intensity vectors of cluster centers were regarded as the temporal models. The temporal models summarized the backscatter evolutions of crops and were utilized as the criterion for crop discrimination. The spectral similarity value (SSV) measure was introduced from hyperspectral image processing for temporal model matching. The unlabeled pixel was assigned to the class to which the temporal model with the highest similarity belonged. Two sets of Sentinel-1 SAR time-series data were used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison between SSV and other measures demonstrated the superiority of SSV in temporal model matching. Compared with the decision tree (DT) and naive Bayes (NB) classifiers, the proposed method achieved the best overall accuracies in both VH and VV bands. For most crops, it either obtained the best accuracies or achieved comparable accuracies to the best ones, which illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 by the authors.","Backscattering; Barium compounds; Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Clustering algorithms; Crops; Decision trees; Image processing; Spectroscopy; Time series; Crop classification; Crop discrimination; K-means clustering method; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-1; Spectral similarity; Temporal information; Temporal modeling; Synthetic aperture radar","Crop classification; Multitemporal; Sentinel-1; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Temporal model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059965303"

Particularly, monitoring of the forests in the Russian Federation is important as some regions have not been inventoried for many years. This study explores the combination of multi-frequency, multi-polarization, and multi-temporal radar data as one key approach to provide an accurate estimate of forest biomass. The data from L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR-2), together with C-band RADARSAT-2 data, were applied for AGB estimation. Backscatter coefficients from L- and C-band radar were used independently and in combination with a non-parametric model to retrieve AGB data for a boreal forest in Siberia (Krasnoyarskiy Kray). AGB estimation was performed using the random forests machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrated that high estimation accuracies can be achieved at a spatial resolution of 0.25 ha. When the L-band data alone were used for the retrieval, a corrected root-mean-square error (RMSEcor) of 29.4 t ha-1 was calculated. A marginal decrease in RMSEcor was observed when only the filtered L-band backscatter data, without ratio and texture, were used (29.1 t ha-1). The inclusion of the C-band data reduced the over and underestimation; the bias was reduced from 5.5 t ha-1 to 4.7 t ha-1; and a RMSEcor of 30.2 t ha-1 was calculated. © 2018 by the authors.","Backscattering; Biomass; Decision trees; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Above ground biomass; Advanced land observing satellites; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Backscatter coefficients; Boreal forests; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; Root mean square errors; Synthetic aperture radar","Above-ground biomass; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Backscatter; Boreal forest; RADARSAT-2; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055419190"

Nevertheless, for the neighborhood-based method, it is unreasonable to use a fixed window size for the entire image because the optimal window size of different pixels in an image is different. Hence, if you let the neighborhood-based method use a large window to significantly suppress noise, it cannot preserve the detail information such as the edge of a changed area. To overcome this drawback, we propose a spatial-temporal adaptive neighborhood-based ratio (STANR) approach for change detection in SAR images. STANR employs heterogeneity to adaptively select the spatial homogeneity neighborhood and uses the temporal adaptive strategy to determine multi-temporal neighborhood windows. Experimental results on two data sets show that STANR can both suppress the negative influence of noise and preserve edge details, and can obtain a better difference image than other state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 by the authors.","Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Adaptive; Change detection; Heterogeneity; Neighborhood information; Ratio operator; Radar imaging","Adaptive; Change detection; Heterogeneity; Neighborhood information; Ratio operator; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051679200"

For the first time, a multidimensional landslide activity matrix was implemented to update the landslide state of activity during the monitored time span. For the definition of the state of activity, the representative velocity of each landslide was divided by the standard deviation of the velocities along the slope of the whole dataset. Thus, a common stability threshold of ±1 was introduced for multi-sensors A-DInSAR data, allowing to distinguish a phenomenon with stable targets (PS-DS) or unstable PS-DS. By combining activity classes estimated during different time spans allows to determine if a phenomenon is active, reactivated, or dormant. Furthermore, an innovative confidence degree assessment was carried out to verify the reliability of the procedure, by considering the measuring points distribution and the variability of the movements for each landslide. The results were validated using the landslide inventory of the study area and in-situ monitoring systems for representative case studies. Thanks to this approach an updated state of activity until 2014 was assigned to 507 landslides out the 1657 which were previously mapped in the study area. © 2018","Alps; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Remote sensing; Soils; Confidence degree; D-inSAR; In- situ monitoring; Inventory; Landslide inventories; Representative case; Stability thresholds; Standard deviation; COSMO-SkyMed; landslide; map; methodology; RADARSAT; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; Landslides","Inventory; Landslides; Multi-temporal A-DInSAR; State of activity maps","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051628213"

Baekdu is known as a still active volcano and is located on the border betweenKorea and China.

So necessity of the periodic observation was always existed. Especially after the fact that asignificant magma storage is under the Mt. Baekdu was suggested, the importance of magmasource movements were gradually larger. As SAR could observe wide area with centimetreprecision, SAR-derived deformation based magma source modelling approach was widely applied.In this study, we estimated the location of magma source under the Mt. Baekdu by adapting pointsource (Mogi) model to a deformation rate map. For that we collected multi-temporal Sentinel-1interferometric wide mode acquisitions from descending orbits. In succession we generatedinterferometric pairs whose longest temporal baseline is 48 days because the study area tend to betemporally decorrelated. After that deformation rate map was generated by stacking qualifiedmulti-temporal interferograms. As a result, the volume change and source depth were about 0.0066km3 and 7.4 km respectively. This results was very similar to previously published parameters.The final result would validate with the same result from the independent data, which is multitemporal Sentinel-1 interferometric wide mode acquisitions from ascending orbits. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018.

To optimize production, information about the extent and location of irrigated and rainfed rice areas is important for effective targeting of appropriate ecosystem-specific technologies and interventions. This study is a first attempt to develop a methodology to classify irrigated and rainfed ecosystems using multi-temporal Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and other derived layers from ancillary sources. Random Forest (RF), an ensemble machine learning classifier, was used for rice ecosystem classification. Sentinel-1A VH-polarized Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode images acquired during 2016 wet season cropping (between May and December) were used to derive a rice mask and 21 predictor variables for the RF classification. Additional predictor variables that were derived from ancillary sources include elevation, flow accumulation, proximity to water bodies, and cumulative rainfall. Ground observations were used for training the random forest. In addition to field data, government statistics and an irrigation network map were used to validate the results. The rice mask had an overall accuracy of 93% with kappa index of 0.86, and the ecosystem classification yielded an overall accuracy of 68.3% with kappa index of 0.37. We found that the mean backscatter difference between the ecosystems was most evident at the start of the season (SoS), i.e., agronomic flooding, wherein irrigated rice had lower mean backscatter (-19.5 dB) than rainfed rice (- 17.6 dB). The key factors in the RF classification were the backscatter at the SoS, the span from the SoS to the peak of SAR (PoS), and the sum of absolute gradients within the temporal series. However, significant discrepancies from government statistics were observed, with underestimation of irrigated areas (R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 998 ha) and overestimation of rainfed areas (R2 = 0.54 and RMSE = 971 ha). Comparison with existing maps showed correct classification of irrigated rice areas near the stream and irrigation network. This suggests good agreement in areas with surface water irrigation. The results suggest that further improvement in the methodology is necessary to achieve better accuracy. Nevertheless, findings from this initial study contribute to future research on the development of a robust method for rice ecosystem classification. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Backscattering; Decision trees; Irrigation; Learning systems; Machine learning; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Systems engineering; Cumulative rainfall; Ecosystem classification; Government statistics; Ground observations; Irrigated rice; Irrigation Networks; Rainfed; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Ecosystems","Irrigated rice; Machine learning; Rainfed rice; Synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071887205"

The presented MT-InSAR monitoring system comprises three C-band radar (~5,7 cm wavelength) datasets from the European satellites ERS-1/2 (1992-2000), Envisat (2003-2008), and Sentinel-1A/B (2014-2018). ERS-1/2 and Envisat datasets were processed using StaMPS. In the case of Sentinel-1A/B, two different algorithms were applied, SARPROZ and ISCE-SALSIT, allowing the comparison of the estimated LOS velocity pattern. The obtained results confirm that LaViñuela dam is deforming since its construction, as an earth-fill dam. Maximum deformation rates were measured in the initial period (1992-2000), being around -7 mm/yr (LOS direction) on the coronation of the dam. In the period covered by the Envisat dataset (2003-2008), the average deforming pattern was lower, of the order of -4 mm/yr. Sentinel-1A/B monitoring confirms that the deformation is still active in the period 2014-2018 in the central-upper part of the dam, with maximums of velocity reaching -6 mm/yr. SARPROZ and ISCE-SALSIT algorithms provide similar results. It was concluded that MT-InSAR techniques can support the development of new and more effective means of monitoring and analyzing the health of dams complementing actual dam surveillance systems. © 2018 The Authors.

This information has been successfully compiled using the Multi-Data Approach (MDA). However, the current implementation of the approach is based on optical remote sensing, which fails to deliver the relevant information under cloudy conditions. We therefore extend the MDA by using Land Use/Land Cover classifications derived from six multitemporal and dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X stripmap images, which do not require cloud-free conditions. These classifications were then combined with auxiliary, official geodata (ATKIS and Physical Blocks (PB)) data to lower misclassification and provide an enhanced LULC map that includes further information about the annual crop classification. These final classifications showed an overall accuracy (OA) of 75% for seven crop-classes (maize, sugar beet, barley, wheat, rye, rapeseed, and potato). For potatoes, however, classification does not appear to be as consistently accurate, as could be shown from repeated comparisons with variations of training and validation fields.

The Kairouan plain, a semi-arid region in central Tunisia (North Africa), was selected as a test area for this study. Firstly, an algorithm for the direct inversion of the Water Cloud Model (WCM) was developed for the spatialization of the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. The soil moisture retrieved from these observations was first validated using ground measurements, recorded over 20 reference fields of cereal crops. A second method, based on the use of neural networks, was also used to confirm the initial validation. The results reported here show that the soil moisture products retrieved from remotely sensed data are accurate, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 5% between the two moisture products. In addition, the analysis of soil moisture and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products over cultivated fields, as a function of time, led to the classification of irrigated and rainfed areas on the Kairouan plain, and to the production of irrigation maps at the scale of individual fields. This classification is based on a decision tree approach, using a combination of various statistical indices of soil moisture and NDVI time series. The resulting irrigation maps were validated using reference fields within the study site. The best results were obtained with classifications based on soil moisture indices only, with an accuracy of 77%. © 2018 by the authors.","Arid regions; Cloud computing; Decision trees; Irrigation; Mapping; Mean square error; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural fields; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remotely sensed data; Root mean square errors; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Water cloud models; Soil surveys","Irrigation; NDVI; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; Soil moisture; Water cloud model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058895722"

The underlying hypothesis is that, in SAR images, built-up areas exhibit very high backscattering values that are coherent in time. Several particular characteristics of the Sentinel-1 satellite mission are put to good use, such as its high revisit time, the availability of dual-polarized data, and its small orbital tube. The newly developed algorithm is based on an adaptive parametric thresholding that first identifies pixels with high backscattering values in both VV and VH polarimetric channels. The interferometric SAR coherence is then used to reduce false alarms. These are caused by land cover classes (other than buildings) that are characterized by high backscattering values that are not coherent in time (e.g., certain types of vegetated areas). The algorithm was tested on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath data from five different test sites located in semiarid and arid regions in the Mediterranean region and Northern Africa. The resulting building maps were compared with the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) derived from the TerraSAR-X mission data and, on average, a 92% agreement was obtained. © 2018 by the authors.","Backscattering; Coherent light; Interferometry; Orbits; Built-up areas; Hierarchical split-based approach (HSBA); Intensity; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-1; Thresholding; Synthetic aperture radar","Built-up areas; Coherence; Hierarchical split-based approach (HSBA); Intensity; Multi-temporal; Parametric thresholding; SAR urban maps; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057113063"

It has long been related to optical spectral signatures such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or spectral shifts in the red-edge range. In recent years, more efforts have been made to explore the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly polarimetric SAR signatures, to crop biophysical parameters or phenological stages. In this study, phenological metrics of canola (Brassica napus) and spring wheat (Triticum spp.) are related with temporal evolution of polarimetric SAR parameters derived from the C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. Both crops are very common in north eastern Ontario, Canada, but have very anatomically different development processes. From multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data acquired in three consecutive years (2012–2014), significant correlations were observed between a number of SAR polarimetric parameters and the growth parameters of both crops. Strong correlation was observed between plant height and the Alpha angle of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, with the R2 of 0.91 and 0.66 for canola and wheat, respectively. The R2 increased when the polarimetric parameters were smoothed in the time domain (R2 of 0.98 for canola and 0.88 for wheat). Strong correlation was also observed for the two crops between the effective leaf area index (LAIe) and the Beta angle, and between days-after-seeding (DAS) and a combination of the Alpha and the Beta angles. These findings show that multi-temporal C-band polarimetric SAR parameters could be used for tracking crop phenological development stages. © 2017","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Crops; Cultivation; Plants (botany); Polarimeters; Canola; Crop phenology; Plant height; Polarimetric parameters; Wheat; canola; crop plant; crop yield; data acquisition; developmental stage; growth; height; leaf area index; NDVI; phenology; RADARSAT; satellite data; seeding; synthetic aperture radar; temporal evolution; wheat; Synthetic aperture radar","Canola; Crop phenology; LAI; Plant height; Polarimetric parameters; SAR; Wheat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029765557"

These results aremeaningful since they provided the effective approach to measure time-series deformation on the landfillparks. However, additional quantitative study for the various perpendicular and temporal baselines shouldbe performed.

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a ""full optical"" approach, the ""combined"" method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Decision trees; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Tracking radar; Water management; Crop mapping; Irrigated crops; LANDSAT; Random forests; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; Mapping","Irrigated crops; Landsat-8; Random Forest; Satellite image time series; Seasonal crop mapping; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060670633"

With appropriate modifications, the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and the SAR-SIFT operators are used to extract two types of features including texture points and corner points from the SAR images. The input images are divided into a certain number of blocks and the two types of features are extracted from each of the blocks for the uniform distribution of the features. A novel scheme is presented to obtain these features in the same proportion from the input images. The proposed method has the advantages of proper controllability of the number of extracted features and the uniform distribution of the features. A correct match identification by local searching algorithm is proposed to significantly increase the number of correct matches between the SAR images.

In the past, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) had been extensively studied for classification. However, limited work has been done on multi-temporal datasets owing to the lack of data availability and computational power. As Earth observation (EO) becomes more and more imperative, it becomes essential to exploit the information embedded in multi-temporal datasets. In this paper, we present a framework for SAR pixel labeling. Specifically, we exploit spatio-temporal information for pixel labeling. The proposed scheme includes four steps: (1) extraction of spatio-temporal observations; (2) feature computation; (3) feature reduction and (4) pixel labeling. First, an adaptive approach is applied to the data cube to extract spatio-temporal observations in both coherent and incoherent domains. Second, features in distinct domains are designed and computed to boost information content embedded in the multi-temporal datasets. Third, sequential feature selection is utilized for selecting the most discriminative features among the entire feature space. Last, the discriminative classifier is used to label the class of each pixel. By integrating pixel-/object-based processing techniques, spatial/temporal observations and coherent/incoherent data attributes, the proposed method explores diverse observations to solve complex labeling problems. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method on 64 TanDEM-X images and 70 COSMO-SkyMed high-resolution images, respectively. Both experiments reveal high accuracies for multi-class labeling. The proposed technique, therefore, provides a new solution for classifying multi-temporal single-polarized datasets. © 2018 by the authors.","Image classification; Pixels; Radar imaging; Statistics; Synthetic aperture radar; Discriminative classifiers; Land cover classification; Multi-temporal analysis; Sequential feature selections; Single-polarized images; Spatio-temporal statistics; Spatiotemporal information; Supervised classification; Classification (of information)","Multi-temporal analysis; Single-polarized images; Spatio-temporal statistics; Supervised classification; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050478760"

Average deformation rates are calculated by weighted averaging (stacking) of the interferograms to detect small-scale loess landslides. Heifangtai loess terrace, Gansu province China, is taken as a test area. Aiming to generate multi-temporal landslide inventory maps and to analyze the landslide evolution features from December 2006 to November 2017, a large number of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets acquired by L-band ascending ALOS/PALSAR, L-band ascending and descending ALOS/PALSAR-2, X-band ascending and descending TerraSAR-X and C-band descending Sentinel-1A/B images covering different evolution stages of Heifangtai terrace are fully exploited. Firstly, the surface deformation of Heifangtai terrace is calculated for independent SAR data using the InSAR technique. Subsequently, InSAR-derived deformation maps, SAR intensity images and a DEM gradient map are jointly used to detect potential loess landslides by setting the appropriate thresholds. More than 40 active loess landslides are identified and mapped. The accuracy of the landslide identification results is verified by comparison with published literatures, the results of geological field surveys and remote sensing images. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of the landslides during the last 11 years are revealed for the first time. Finally, strengths and limitations of different wavelength SAR data, and the effects of track direction, geometric distortions of SAR images and the differences in local incidence angle between two adjacent satellite tracks in terms of small-scale loess landslides identification, are analyzed and summarized, and some suggestions are given to guide the future identification of small-scale loess landslides with the InSAR technique. © 2018 by the authors.","Deformation; Image analysis; Interferometry; Landslides; Mapping; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Scales (weighing instruments); Sediments; Heifangtai; InSAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Landslide identification; Landslide inventories; Loess landslides; Multi-temporal; Spatiotemporal evolution; Synthetic aperture radar","Heifangtai; InSAR; Loess landslide; Multi-temporal inventory mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057104334"

However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate-resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground-truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site-specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is ~9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Atlantic Ocean; Canada; East Bay; Gulf of Mexico; Nunavut; Southampton Island; Cost effectiveness; Database systems; Drilling platforms; Environmental impact; Offshore structures; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Systematic errors; Environmental enforcement; Geo-referenced images; Ground control points; LANDSAT; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Off shore platforms; Platform status assessment; Remote sensing approaches; assessment method; database; gas platform; ground control; Landsat; offshore structure; oil platform; optimization; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; time series; VIIRS; Time series","Landsat; Northern Gulf of Mexico; Offshore platform; Platform status assessment; Remote sensing; SAR; Time-series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042044623"

Since crop plants involve dielectric elements of complex shapes, sizes and orientations, a number of scattering mechanisms combine together to yield the microwave backscatter response. This paper aims at assessing soil moisture variations through a canopy imaged by an airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Multi-temporal co-polarized and cross-polarized response is compared to volumetric insitu soil moisture for two crops with contrasting biomass and plant height, namely soybean and corn. The considered dataset is comprised by several soybean and corn fields, whose response to microwaves is averaged leading to an overall assessment for each crop. For canopies with large stalks such as corn, observations suggest an important contribution of the double bounce mechanism when soil surface is wet. For drier conditions, response is insensitive to moisture variations in accordance to backscattering from plant elements.

High temporal frequency observations are often required todistinguish between various crop types. This type of data is often available from coarse spatial resolutioninstruments (MODIS) (250-500m) and mediumuch as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer spatial resolution instruments such as the Landsat series (30m), but with many applications finer spatial details aredesired. With the launch of European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel series, higher spatial resolution data (10m)at high temporal frequency provide new opportunities for agricultural applications.To improve available regional information and methods, we explored high temporal resolution radar and opticalobservations from the Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectralInstrument (MSI) for mapping major crop types (corn, soybean, and rice) in Eastern and Northeastern China. Toaccomplish this, we construct Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 growing season time series data sets, and usedunsupervised clustering for our exploratory land cover/crop type classification. Moving forward, we plan to buildsupervised models for Eastern and Northeastern China to account for difference in crop phenology. Different setof inputs including SAR only, optical only, and SAR and optical combined will be assessed to determine the mostsuitable for each region. Additionally, the crop type information generated using the Sentinel fusion approach willbe migrated to field/patch level through object-based approach. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018.

Twelve summertime TanDEM-X acquisitions from the boreal test site, Krycklan, in Sweden, with a known digital terrain model, DTM, have been used to study phase height and aboveground biomass change over 3.2 years based on the Interferometric Water Cloud Model, IWCM. The maximum phase height rate was determined to 0.29 m/yr, while the mean phase height rate was 0.16 m/yr. The corresponding maximum growth rate of the aboveground dry biomass, AGB, was 4.0 Mg/ha/yr with a mean rate of 1.9 Mg/ha/yr for 27 stands, varying from 23 to 183 Mg/ha. The highest relative AGB growth was found for young stands and high growth rates up to an age of 150 years. Growth rate differences relative a simplified model assuming AGB to be proportional to the phase height were studied, and the possibility to avoid a DTM was discussed. Effects of tree species, thinning, and clear cutting were evaluated. Verifications using in situ data from 2008 and a different in situ dataset combined with airborne laser scanning data from 2015 have been discussed. It was concluded that the use of multi-temporal TanDEM-X interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations with AGB estimates of each individual observation can be an important method to derive growth rates in boreal forests. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass; Cloud computing; Forestry; Growth (materials); Growth rate; Interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar; Temperature control; Above ground biomass; Airborne Laser scanning; Change; Digital terrain model; High growth rate; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Interferometric water cloud models; TanDEM-X; Ecology","Biomass; Change; Growth; Interferometric Water Cloud Model; TanDEM-X","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045986756"

In the last two decades, instrumental and computational advances have allowed the development of effective remote sensing methodologies, such as those based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry or change detection techniques (Tomás & Li, 2017). These techniques have enhanced the possibilities of making geomorphic observations and modelling. Specifically, Earth Observations (EO) techniques using airborne or satellite platforms have increased the ability to map and monitor geomorphological processes. In such a framework, historical landscape data, such as those available from aerial photographs taken since the early 1940s, are key instruments for studying the geomorphological evolution of a territory. In this work, the application of the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique to analyse the geomorphological evolution of sample areas by historical aerial photos is tested, examined, and discussed. Towards this aim, multi-temporal analysis by means of three-dimensional (3D) land models of four test areas reconstructed through the application of the SfM technique using available aerial images was performed. Although it is well known that SfM requires a considerable number of digital images and a significant overlap between them, the challenge of this approach was to reconstruct 3D land models using a reduced set of analogical aerial photos for satisfactory results. The resulting 3D reconstructions succeeded in recognizing and studying the geomorphological evolution of the test areas, represented by: a) a region in southern Italy affected by landslides; b) a territory in central Italy affected by badland-type intense erosional phenomena; c) a sector in northwestern Italy with open-pit mining activity; and d) a coastal zone affected by changes in its coastline. Despite some disadvantages that arose during the application of the SfM technique, the proposed methodology has been shown to be useful for geomorphological analysis. This can be considered an alternative to the use of analogical and digital stereoscopic techniques to recognize geomorphological shapes and analyse Earth surface evolution and the effects of different anthropic activities. © Comitato Glaciologico Italiano.

Accordingly, this study statistically analysed interferometric coherence and SAR backscatter variation in a study area located on the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, consisting of various wetland classes, including bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow-water. Specifically, multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR-1, C-band RADARSAT-2, and X-band TerraSAR-X data were used to investigate the effect of SAR frequency and polarization, as well as temporal baselines on the coherence degree in the various wetland classes. SAR backscatter and coherence maps were also used as input features into an object-based Random Forest classification scheme to examine the contribution of these features to the overall classification accuracy. Our findings suggested that the temporal baseline was the most influential factor for coherence maintenance in herbaceous wetlands, especially for shorter wavelengths. In general, coherence was the highest in L-band and intermediate/low for both X- and C-band, depending on the wetland classes and temporal baseline. The Wilcoxon rank sum test at the 5% significance level found significant difference (P-value < 0.05) between the mean values of HH/HV coherence at the peak of growing season. The test also suggested that L-band intensity and X-band coherence observations were advantageous to discriminate complex wetland classes. Notably, an overall classification accuracy of 74.33% was attained for land cover classification by synergistic use of both SAR backscatter and interferometric coherence. Thus, the results of this study confirmed the potential of incorporating SAR and InSAR features for mapping Canadian wetlands and those elsewhere in the world with similar ecological characteristics. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For the benchmark AIRSAR data, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracies. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multi-temporal UAVSAR datasets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracies as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains average 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method.

This study proposes a workflow for reconstructing the water cultivation paleoenvironment-based primarily on X- and L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data.

At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging. The noise level is reduced by a factor of 70% in Greenland test areas and 90% in Antarctic test areas. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Ice; Interferometry; Ionosphere; Ionospheric measurement; Radar; Radar measurement; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Data stacking; Environmental parameter; Ice velocity; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Ionospheric correction; Ionospheric effects; Range split spectrum; SAR interferometry; accuracy assessment; data processing; environmental factor; ice cover; ionosphere; measurement method; PALSAR; performance assessment; polar region; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Data stacking; Ice velocity; Ionosphere correction; Ionosphere effect; Range split spectrum; SAR interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042693320"

Landslides reactivated by the Wenchuan 2008 earthquake and debris flows triggered by rainfall, such as the 2010 Zhouqu debris flow, have caused more than 1700 casualties and estimated economic losses of some US$0.4 billion. Earthflows presently cover some 79% of the total landslide area and have exerted a strong influence on landscape dynamics and evolution in this region. In this study, we use multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) data and time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar to investigate slow-moving landslides in a mountainous region with steep topography for the period December 2007–August 2010 using the Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) technique. This enabled the identification of 11 active earthflows, 19 active landslides with deformation rates exceeding 100 mm/year and 20 new instabilities added into the pre-existing landslide inventory map. The activity of these earthflows and landslides exhibits seasonal variations and accelerated deformation following the Wenchuan earthquake. Time series analysis of the Suoertou earthflow reveals that seasonal velocity changes are characterized by comparatively rapid acceleration and gradual deceleration with distinct kinematic zones with different mean velocities, although velocity changes appear to occur synchronously along the landslide body over seasonal timescales. The observations suggest that the post-seismic effects (acceleration period) on landslide deformation last some 6–7 months. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bailong River; China; Gansu; Gansu; Zhouqu; Debris; Deformation; Earthquakes; Losses; Metamorphic rocks; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Advanced land observing satellites; Earthflow; InSAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Low grade metamorphic rocks; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Seismic effect; Zhouqu; ALOS; debris flow; deformation mechanism; economic impact; hazard assessment; interferometry; inventory; landslide; livelihood; metamorphic rock; mountain region; PALSAR; satellite data; seismicity; Sichuan earthquake 2008; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; timescale; Landslides","Deformation; Earthflow; InSAR; Landslide; Seismic effects; Zhouqu","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045035596"

However, only a few studies have provided large-scale assessments in a spatially detailed way to address the reaction of individual glaciers in Patagonia and hence to better understand and explain the underlying processes. In this work, we use repeat radar interferometric measurements of the German TerraSAR-X-Add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) satellite constellation between 2011/12 and 2016 together with the digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in 2000 in order to derive surface elevation and mass changes of the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI). Our results reveal a mass loss rate of -11.84 ± 3.3 Gt·a-1 (corresponding to 0.033 ± 0.009 mm·a-1 sea level rise) for an area of 12573 km2 in the period 2000-2015/16. This equals a specific glacier mass balance of -0.941 ± 0.19 m w.e.·a-1 for the whole SPI. These values are comparable with previous estimates since the 1970s, but a magnitude larger than mass change rates reported since the Little Ice Age. The spatial pattern reveals that not all glaciers respond similarly to changes and that various factors need to be considered in order to explain the observed changes. Our multi-temporal coverage of the southern part of the SPI (south of 50.3° S) shows that the mean elevation change rates do not vary significantly over time below the equilibrium line. However, we see indications for more positive mass balances due to possible precipitation increase in 2014 and 2015. We conclude that bi-static radar interferometry is a suitable tool to accurately measure glacier volume and mass changes in frequently cloudy regions. We recommend regular repeat TanDEM-X acquisitions to be scheduled for the maximum summer melt extent in order to minimize the effects of radar signal penetration and to increase product quality. © 2018 by the authors.","Indium compounds; Interferometry; Radar; Sea level; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Digital elevation model; Glacier mass balance; InSAR; Interferometric measurement; Mass balance; Patagonia; Satellite constellations; Shuttle radar topography mission; Radar measurement","Geodectic mass balance; Glacier elevation change; InSAR; Patagonia; SPI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042541277"

Advanced deep learning techniques represented by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been utilized to enhance the application performance. One current challenge is how to adapt deep CNN model for PolSAR target detection and classification with limited training samples while keeping good generalization performance. This work attempts to contribute to this problem. The core idea is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN model training and improve the final application performance. A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN detection and classification scheme is established. Both classical polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain are used to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For ship detection application, two methods respectively driven by classical polarimetric features and the selected polarimetric features show relatively good performances, with detection probabilities over 90.8% for Radarsat-2 data. Considering the overall detection and false-alarm probabilities, the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach achieves even better performance. For land cover classification, the proposed method achieves the state of the art classification accuracy for the benchmark AIRSAR data. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multi-temporal UAVSAR datasets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracy as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains average 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method. © 2018 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE).","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Polarimeters; Radar target recognition; Synthetic aperture radar; Application performance; Classification accuracy; Convolutional neural network; Detection probabilities; False alarm probability; Generalization performance; Land cover classification; Target detection and classifications; Classification (of information)","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060916524"

Therefore, this paper addresses the measuring surface area of Mae Kham dam in Northern Thailand from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) in single-and dual-polarization and fully polarimetric data obtained from different temporal variation. All polarization combinations are investigated quantitatively by supervised classification in order to generate the water surface area automatically. Within this framework, the combination with gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based mean textural measure and enhanced frost adaptive filtering is considered in order to remove multiplicative speckle noise. The fusion of measured daily data from telemetry system for water level measurement with SAR satellite imagery is taken into account. Because it corresponds to spatial change in an appropriate time interval. Classification results were generated by taking water surface level area using multi-Temporal SAR data and telemetry data. The Geographic Information System (GIS) process involved in creating upper depth contour. Experimental results reveal that the combined cross-polarized (HV+VH) power data with the mean textural is the most suitable. Because the supplement of cross-polarization data used as the characteristics for the HV and VH data are mostly similar with the smoothing effect on the image of the texture. This operational approach enhances water surface area monitoring and measurement. It supports several applications e.g., hydrological modeling, drought/flood prediction, and reservoir area utilization planning. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

Rice is one of the major food sources for many regions of the world especially in monsoon Asia and accounts for more than 11% of the global cropland. Accurate, on-time and early information on spatial distribution of rice would be useful for stakeholders (cultivators, fertilizer/pesticide manufacturers and agriculture extension agencies) to effectively plan supply of inputs, market activities. Also, government agencies can plan and formulate policies regarding food security. Conventional methods involves manual surveying for developing spatio-temporal crop datasets while remote sensing satellite observations provide cost effective alternatives with better spatial extent and temporal frequency. Remote sensing is one of the effective technologies to map the areal extent of the crops using optical as well as microwave/Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) sensors. Cloud cover is the major problem faced in using the optical datasets during monsoon (June to Sept. locally called Kharif season). Hence, Sentinel-1 C-band (center frequency: 5.405 GHz) RADAR sensor launched by European Space Agency (ESA) which has an Interferometric Wide-swath mode (IW) with dual polarization (VV and VH) has been used for rice area mapping. Limited studies have attempted to establish operational early season rice area mapping to facilitate local governance, agri-input management and crop growers. The key contribution of this work is towards operational near real time and early season rice area mapping using multi-temporal SAR data on GEE platform. The study has been carried out in four districts viz., Guntur, Krishna, East Godavari and West Godavari from Andhra Pradesh (AP), India during the period of Kharif 2017. The study region is also called as coastal AP where rice transplanting during the Kharif season is carried out during mid Jun. till Aug. and harvesting during Oct. to mid Dec. months. The training data for various classes viz, Rice, NonRice-Agriculture, Waterbodies, Settlements, Forest and Aquaculture have been obtained from GEE, Global Land Cover (GLC) layers developed by ESA and field observations. We have evaluated the performance of Random Forest (RF) classifier by varying the number of trees and incrementally adding the SAR images for model training. Initially the model has been trained considering two images available from mid June 2017. Further, various models have been trained by adding one consecutive image till end of August 2017 and classification performance has been evaluated on validation dataset. The classified output has been further masked with agriculture non-agriculture layer derived from global land-cover layer obtained from ESA. Analysis shows that incremental addition of temporal observations improves the performance of the classifier. The overall classification accuracy ranges between 78.11 to 87.00%. We have found that RF classifier with 30 trees trained on six images available from mid June till end August performed better with classification accuracy of 87.00%. However, accuracy assessment performed using independent stratified random sampling approach showed the classification accuracy of 84.45%. An attempt is being made to follow the proposed approach for current (i.e. 2018) season and provide incremental rice area estimates in near real-time. © Authors 2018.","Agricultural implements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision trees; Engines; Food supply; Forestry; Mapping; Microwave sensors; Remote sensing; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Area mapping; Classification accuracy; Classification performance; Google earths; Random forests; Remote sensing satellites; Sentinel-1; Stratified random sampling; Classification (of information)","Classification; Google earth engine; Random forest; Rice area mapping; Sentinel 1","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056165119"

We first estimate each pixel’s temporal coherences in different image subsets. Computed from temporal coherences, a change index sequence is introduced to quantify each pixel’s probabilities of being change points at different times. All pixels’ change indices are then utilized to extract change points by a global, automatic, and statistical-based scheme. We then eliminate blunders by a spatial filtering. Finally, the occurrence times of the change points are detected based on the temporal variation in their change index sequences. We implement a simulated data test to validate and assess our method.

However, multitemporal SAR images have either increase or decrease in the backscattering values. Therefore, the changed areas can be further classified into positive and negative changed classes. This paper presents an unsupervised change detection approach for detecting the positive and negative changes based on a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, the widely adopted mean-ratio and log-ratio operators are extended to generate SAR ratio images for distinguishing the positive and negative changes. In order to reduce the corruption of speckle noise present in the multitemporal SAR images, a fuzzy cluster validity index is established to exploit local spatial and gray level information. Then the objective functions are simultaneously optimized by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.

It has proven especially successful for the restoration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images: single-look and multi-look amplitude images, multi-temporal stacks, polarimetric data. Recently, powerful nonlocal filters have been proposed also for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) data, with excellent results. Nonetheless, a severe decay of performance has been observed in regions characterized by a uniform phase gradient, which are relatively common in InSAR images, as they correspond to constant slope terrains. This inconvenience is ultimately due to the rare patch effect, the lack of suitable predictors for the target patch. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose the use of offset-compensated similarity measures in nonlocal filtering. With this approach, the set of candidate predictors is augmented by including patches that differ from the target only for a constant phase offset, which is automatically estimated and compensated. We develop offset-compensated versions of both basic nonlocal means and InSAR-Block-Matching 3D (BM3D), a state-of-the-art InSAR phase filter.

In this article, we propose an unsupervised change detection approach based on frequency difference in wavelet domain and a modified fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. First, the proposed method extracts high-frequency and low-frequency components using wavelet transform, and then constructs highfrequency and low-frequency difference images using different detectors.

A rule-based algorithm was applied to synthetic statistical metrics (TSDs-Temporal Spectra Descriptors) computed from temporal datasets of optical spectral indices and SAR backscattering coefficient. Temporal series are available up to the tillering/full canopy cover stage which is identified as the optimum timing for delivering in-season information on rice area (i.e. mid July). The approach relies on a-priori knowledge on crop dynamics to adapt time horizons for TSD computation and thresholds to local conditions. Output products consist of maps of rice cultivated areas, rice seeding techniques (dry and flooded rice) and flooding practices. Validation showed rice mapping overall accuracy to be 87.8% with commission and omission errors of 3.5% and 24.7%, respectively. Mapping of rice seeding technique showed good agreement with farmer declarations aggregated at the municipality scale (dry rice r2 = 0.71 and flooded rice r2 = 0.91).

However, the penetration of the X-band into the canopy results in a height bias and substantially affects this estimation. The aim of the study was to apply a physical model to compensate the penetration depth (i.e. height bias) in canopy height estimation and evaluate its performance. We applied a penetration depth model on different TanDEM-X data in three German forests. This model is based on the volume coherence and imaging geometry of the InSAR acquisitions. We extracted the volume coherence from the TanDEM-X data and retrieved the height bias based on the penetration depth compared to actual surface heights. The modeled height bias was used to compensate the height bias in InSAR heights. The corrected TanDEM-X heights were evaluated with LiDAR data. In general, the penetration depth compensation in the InSAR heights improved the performance compared to the original InSAR heights resulting in elevations with a lower root mean squared error and the mean error decreased to less than 1 m with the LiDAR heights used as reference. This suggested that the height bias was accurately modeled for temperate forests, which can be of high relevance when InSAR heights are used for canopy height estimation or used in multi-temporal analysis such as forest growth, degradation and deforestation monitoring. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Standard methods for feature selection in machine learning seldom take into account the domain knowledge associated with the data. Multitemporal crop classification studies with full-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data ought to consider the changes in the scattering mechanisms with their phenological growth stages. Hence, it is desirable to incorporate these changes while determining a feature subset for classification. In this study, a random forest (RF) based feature selection technique is proposed that takes into account the changes in the physical scattering mechanism with crop phenological stages for multitemporal PolSAR classification. The partial probability plot, which is an attribute of RF, provides information about the marginal effect of a polarimetric parameter on the desired crop class. Moreover, it is used to identify the specific range of a parameter where the probability of the presence of a particular crop class is high. The proposed technique identifies features that change significantly with crop phenology. The selected features are the ones whose ranges show maximum separation amongst crop classes. Additionally, the feature subset is refined by eliminating correlated features. The E-SAR L-band dataset of the AgriSAR-2006 campaign over the Demmin test site in Germany is used in this study. The classification accuracy using the novel feature selection technique is 99.12%. This is nominally better than using the features obtained from a standard feature selection method used in RF, such as mean decrease Gini (98.73%) and mean decrease accuracy (98.68%) that do not take into account the information based on crop phenology. © 2018 IEEE.","Demmin; Germany; Mecklenburg-West Pomerania; Artificial intelligence; Biology; Crops; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Polarimeters; Set theory; Statistical tests; Synthetic aperture radar; Feature selection methods; Feature selection techniques; Feature subset selection; Multi-temporal; phenology; Polarimetric parameters; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Random forests; accuracy assessment; algorithm; crop; phenology; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; Classification (of information)","Classification; crop; feature selection; multitemporal; phenology; polarimetric random forest (RF); synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054288697"

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective approach, and differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) technique has been widely known as wide land subsidence measurement method. In particular, Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) can accurately measure wide land subsidence by using multi-temporal SAR images. However, the estimated displacement is obtained only along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Therefore, it is expected to develop a method for measuring three-dimensional (3-D) displacements by combining multi-directional observation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a method to estimate the 3-D displacement velocities by merging the results from PSI and geodetic deformation measurements, i.e. Global Positioning System (GPS) and leveling data. We applied the least square (LS) based method to of Kansai International Airport by using 13 ALOS2/PALSAR2 ascending images from 2014 to 2018 and 17 ALOS2/PALSAR2 descending images from 2015 to 2018. The validation demonstrates that the root mean squared errors (RMSEs) were 14, 16 and 15 mm/year for the east-west, north-south and vertical components, respectively. It was found that the fusion of the results from PSI and geodetic deformation measurements is effective for land subsidence monitoring. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Climate change; Deformation; Displacement measurement; Geodesy; Geodetic satellites; Global positioning system; Groundwater; Interferometry; Least squares approximations; Leveling (machinery); Mean square error; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Subsidence; Differential interferometric sar; Geodetic deformation; International airport; Land subsidence; Multi-temporal SAR images; Persistent scatterers; Root mean squared errors; Threedimensional (3-d); Synthetic aperture radar","GPS; Land subsidence; Leveling; PSI; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071878671"

In this article, we elaborate on proven characteristics of TerraSAR-X that are responsible for development of operational applications. This article is written from the perspective of a commercial data and service provider and the focus is on the following applications with high commercial relevance, and varying operational maturity levels: Surface Movement Monitoring (SMM), Ground Control Point (GCP) extraction and Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). Based on these applications, the article highlights the successful transition of innovative research into sustainable and operational use within various market segments. TerraSAR-X's high orbit accuracy, its precise radar beam tracing, the high-resolution modes, and high-quality radiometric performance have proven to be the instrument's advanced characteristics, through, which reliable ground control points and surface movement measurements are obtained. Moreover, TerraSAR-X high-resolution data has been widely exploited for the clarity of its target signatures in the fields of target intelligence and identification. TerraSAR-X's multi temporal interferometry applications are non-invasive and are now fully standardised autonomous tools to measure surface deformation. In particular, multi-baseline interferometric techniques, such as Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PSI) and Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) benefit from TerraSAR-X's highly precise orbit information and phase stability. Similarly, the instrument's precise orbit information is responsible for sub-metre accuracy of Ground Control Points (GCPs), which are essential inputs for orthorectification of remote sensing imagery, to locate targets, and to precisely georeference a variety of datasets. While geolocation accuracy is an essential ingredient in the intelligence field, high-resolution TerraSAR-X data, particularly in Staring SpotLight mode has been widely used in surveillance, security and reconnaissance applications in real-time and also by automatic or assisted target recognition software. © 2018 by the authors.","Automatic target recognition; Image coding; Interferometry; Network security; Neural networks; Quality control; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellites; Support vector machines; Surface mount technology; Synthetic aperture radar; Wave propagation; Automated target recognition; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Deep CNN; Ground control points; Radargrammetry; Surface movement; Application programs","Automated target recognition; Convolutional neural networks (CNN); Deep CNN; Ground control points; Interferometry; Radargrammetry; Support vector machine; Surface movement monitoring; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055442496"

Nevertheless, the low spatial density of coherent radar targets detected by conventional time series InSAR methods in mountainous areas with complex topography and vegetation cover introduces considerable uncertainties into the deformation measurements, and thus results in a high probability of omissions for landslide detection. In this study, a new time series InSAR method named Coherent Scatterers InSAR (CSI) is proposed to solve this problem through the joint exploitation of Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Distributed Scatterers (DS) to increase the quantity of Measurement Points (MPs) in rural environments. We applied this approach to detect potentially unstable slopes at a catchment scale, delineate sliding boundaries, and measure the deformation of major landslides. The archived ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR data stacks covering the Danba County in the upper reach of the Dadu River Basin in southwest China, were processed. The PALSAR-measured deformation rate map revealed 17 suspected landslides and their sliding boundaries. By contrast, only six out of these 17 landslides were detected from the ASAR results, as the other 11 landslides were undetected due to the much lower density of coherent points. These detection results were indirectly verified by two different approaches. Two differential interferograms for recently acquired L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data pairs were visually inspected to check whether these landslides are still in active deformation. The reliability of the InSAR results was further evaluated by comparisons against field survey and in-situ GPS measurements. The spatial and temporal patterns of surface displacements at several slow-moving landslides were analyzed in detail, and general guidelines on the application of the CSI method for landslide investigations were discussed and summarized. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Dadu River; Danba; Sichuan; Catchments; Data visualization; Deformation; Disaster prevention; Geodetic satellites; Holography; Indium compounds; Landslides; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Watersheds; Dadu rivers; Deformation monitoring; Distributed scatterers; Landslide detection; Persistent scatterers; SAR interferometry; deformation; displacement; landslide; monitoring; radar interferometry; river basin; slope stability; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Interferometry","Deformation monitoring; Distributed scatterers; Landslide detection; Persistent scatterers; SAR interferometry; The Dadu River Basin","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046031385"

In this study, we apply a multi-temporal change detection analysis to investigate the flooded areas occurred in Edirne province of Turkey. The study area is located at the lower course of Meric River (Evros in Greece or Maritsa in Bulgarian) which is the border between Turkey and Greece.

In such regions, the use of SAR systems (Synthetic Aperture Radar), which are nearly independent form weather conditions, is particularly promising. With an ever-growing number of SAR satellites, as well as the increasing accessibility of SAR data, potentials for multi-frequency remote sensing are becoming numerous. In our study, we evaluate the synergistic contribution of multitemporal L-, C-, and X-band data to tropical land cover mapping. We compare classification outcomes of ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X datasets for a study site in the Brazilian Amazon using a wrapper approach. After preprocessing and calculation of GLCM texture (Grey Level Co-Occurence), the wrapper utilizes Random Forest classifications to estimate scene importance. Comparing the contribution of different wavelengths, ALOS-2 data perform best in terms of overall classification accuracy, while the classification of TerraSAR-X data yields higher accuracies when compared to the results achieved by RADARSAT-2. Moreover, the wrapper underlines potentials of multi-frequency classification as integration of multi-frequency images is always preferred over multi-temporal, mono-frequent composites. We conclude that, despite distinct advantages of certain sensors, for land cover classification, multi-sensoral integration is beneficial. © 2018 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Deforestation; International cooperation; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Amazon; Classification accuracy; Earth observation data; Environmental treaties; Forest; Land cover classification; Random forest classification; Remote sensing data; Mapping","Amazon; Forest; Land cover classification; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042539028"

This study evaluates the impacts of classical roll-invariant polarimetric features such as entropy (H), anisotropy (A), mean alpha angle (α¯) and total scattering power (SPAN) for the crop classification from multitemporal polarimetric SAR data. For this purpose, five different data set were generated as following: (1) Hα¯, (2) Hα¯Span, (3) Hα¯A, (4) Hα¯ASpan and (5) coherency [T] matrix. A time-series of four PolSAR data (Radarsat-2) were acquired as 13 June, 01 July, 31 July and 24 August in 2016 for the test site located in Konya, Turkey. The test site is covered with crops (maize, potato, summer wheat, sunflower, and alfalfa). For the classification of the data set, three different models were used as following: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs) and Naive Bayes (NB). The experimental results highlight that HαASpan (91.43% for SVM, 92.25% for RF and 90.55% for NB) outperformed all other data sets in terms of classification performance, which explicitly proves the significant contribution of SPAN for the discrimination of crops. Highest classification accuracy was obtained as 92.25% by RF and HαASpan while lowest classification accuracy was obtained as 66.99% by NB and Hα. This experimental study suggests that roll-invariant polarimetric features can be considered as the powerful polarimetric components for the crop classification. In addition, the findings prove the added benefits of PolSAR data investigation by means of crop classification. © Authors 2018.

Advanced deep learning techniques represented by deep convolutional neural network (CNN) have been utilized to enhance the classification performance. One current challenge is how to adapt deep CNN classifier for PolSAR classification with limited training samples, while keeping good generalization performance. This letter attempts to contribute to this problem. The core idea is to incorporate expert knowledge of target scattering mechanism interpretation and polarimetric feature mining to assist deep CNN classifier training and improve the final classification performance. A polarimetric-feature-driven deep CNN classification scheme is established. Both classical roll-invariant polarimetric features and hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain are used to drive the proposed deep CNN model. Comparison studies validate the efficiency and superiority of the proposal. For the benchmark AIRSAR data, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art classification accuracy. Meanwhile, the convergence speed from the proposed polarimetric-feature-driven CNN approach is about 2.3 times faster than the normal CNN method. For multitemporal UAVSAR data sets, the proposed scheme achieves comparably high classification accuracy as the normal CNN method for train-used temporal data, while for train-not-used data it obtains an average of 4.86% higher overall accuracy than the normal CNN method. Furthermore, the proposed strategy can also produce very promising classification accuracy even with very limited training samples. © 2012 IEEE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Image classification; Neural networks; Polarimeters; Sampling; Synthetic aperture radar; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Multi-temporal; Polarimetric features; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Rotation domain; algorithm; artificial neural network; data set; image classification; polarization; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; Classification (of information)","Classification; convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; multitemporal; polarimetric feature; polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); rotation domain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042129659"

A framework of a two-step similarity measure strategy is adopted to further enhance the filtering results. Firstly, bi-date analysis using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is conducted in step 1 to extract homogeneous patches for 3-D patch stacks generation. Subsequently, the similarity between patch stacks is compared by a sliding time-series likelihood ratio (STSLR) test algorithm in step 2, which utilizes the multi-dimensional data structure of the stacks to improve the accuracy of unchanged pixels detection. Finally, the filtered values are obtained by averaging the similar pixels in time-series. The experimental results and analysis of two multitemporal datasets acquired by TerraSAR-X show that the proposed method outperforms the other typical methods with regard to the overall filtering effect, especially in terms of the consistency between the filtered images and the original ones. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is also discussed by analyzing the results from step 1 and step 2. © 2018 by the authors.","Ability testing; Image enhancement; Pixels; Radar imaging; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Hypothesis tests; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Multi-temporal SAR images; Multidimensional data; Similarity measurements; Spatiotemporal information; Suppression effects; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Information filtering","Hypothesis test; Multitemporal SAR images filtering; Similarity measurement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053639905"

This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi-temporal statistics of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of “flooded” areas; either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping.

The method is based on the computation of a “super-image”, with a large number of looks, by temporal averaging. Then, ratio images are formed by dividing each image of the multi-temporal stack by the “super-image”. In the absence of changes of the radiometry, the temporal fluctuations of the intensity at a given spatial location are due to the speckle phenomenon. In areas affected by temporal changes, fluctuations cannot be ascribed to speckle only but also to radiometric changes. The overall effect of the division by the “super-image” is the spatial stationarity improvement: ratio images are much more homogeneous than the original images. Therefore, filtering these ratio images with a speckle-reduction method is more effective, in terms of speckle suppression, than filtering the original multitemporal stack. After denoising of the ratio image, the despeckled multi-temporal stack is obtained by multiplication with the “super-image”. Results are presented and analyzed both on synthetic and real SAR data and show the interest of the proposed approach. © 2018 IEEE.","Geology; Radar imaging; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; De-speckling; Multi-temporal SAR; Ratio images; Speckle phenomenon; Speckle suppression; Super-image; Temporal averaging; Temporal fluctuation; Image enhancement","Despeckling; Multi-temporal SAR series; Ratio image; SAR; Super-image","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064272195"

Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSInSAR), based on DInSAR, circumvents these limitations using temporally stable reflectors or permanent scatterers (PS) of earth surface using a long temporal stack of SAR images.

It is difficult to obtain the dominant part of mining subsidence by only using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and its derivative technology. Therefore, the paper proposes a novel solution, which combines, multi-temporal DInSAR time series analysis and Probability Integral Method (PIM) to realize the dynamic simulation of the mining subsidence characteristics and model reconstruction by integrating the theoretical calculation and observation satellite. Eighteen set of high resolution SAR images (RADARSAT-2, 5 m Multi-Fine resolution beam (MF5)) acquired from January 2012 to June 2013 were adopted for analysis. Firstly, continuous repeat cycle DInSAR technology to gain the seventeen time sequence mining subsidence phase variation, so as to monitor the surface deformation evolution law through generation, development and recession for high intensity mining workface 22201-1/2 of Bu'ertai mine in Shendong. Then the high reliability of subsidence basin edge information was combined with PIM technique to predict the large deformation and acquire the hybrid data set. Finally, Gauss function was adopted to fit the hybrid data set so that the reconstruction of the subsidence characteristic curve can be realized. The results show that the mining subsidence prediction of probability integral method can make up the deficiency of DInSAR technology in the extraction of large deformation. The Gauss model established by the hybrid data set has a very high degree of fitting for the dominant deformation values of finite mining (not fully mining) or fully mining.

Results were compared with 31 field measurement points for six wetlands at riparian transition zones and surface water extents in the Utikuma Regional Study Area (URSA). The methodology was repeated in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) to determine the transferability of the methods to other boreal environments. Water mask frequency analysis showed accuracies of 93% to 97%, and kappa values of 0.8-0.9 when compared to optical data.

The backscattering intensity, the short time interferometric coherence and the decorrelation time of scatterers have been used to separate different ground backscattering behavior both in VV and VH polarization. Then, these six parameters have been projected into a domain with reduced dimensionality by means of a Covariance Matrix Analysis. The resulting covariance values show that the main contribution to the image segmentation from the VH polarization comes when the short time interferometric coherence is different from that of the VV polarization. Preliminary results are presented on an agricultural area. Moreover, the VV-VH complex coherence has been exploited to identify urban areas and permanent scatterers. It has been verified that the coherence phase in urban environments can be only 0 or π accordingly to the theory of dihedral and trihedral backscattering. © 2018 IEEE.","Backscattering; Coherent light; Covariance matrix; Environmental engineering; Interferometry; Land use; Polarization; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural areas; Backscattering intensity; De correlations; Interferometric coherence; Multi-temporal SAR; Permanent scatterers; Urban areas; Urban environments; Image segmentation","Coherence; Interferometry; Land-use; SAR; Segmentation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049940906"

The points are aggregated through a measure of the similarity between their displacement time series and form clusters, whose properties can then be evaluated. The analysis can be complemented by additional information for a better understanding of the influence on the ground of the storage of such a large amount of water.

The Mussoorie region is situated in the lesser Himalayas and is one of most visited tourist sites of the Uttarakhand state. The region is facing social and economic crisis due to the damage caused by multiple landslide events, which requires continuous monitoring for better planning and rescue operations. This study shows the time series analysis of landslide events occurring in the Mussoorie region using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The processing steps required to process the Sentinel-1 data stacks using both differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) and PSI are presented. 13 Sentinel-1A C-band interferometric wide swath (IW) images covering a time period of one year are used for PSI processing, resulting in the generation of 12 differential interferograms. The PSI approach extracted 5593 measurement points in the study area. The one dimensional line of sight (1D LOS) time series displacement estimates obtained from PSI processing show a maximum velocity of - 55.7 mm year-1 in the radar line of sight (LOS) direction, indicating subsidence. The displacement map further used to characterize the landslide susceptible zones show higher displacement magnitude for areas near Jabarkhet, Bhataghat, Bansagad and Raipur range. Use of more Sentinel-1 images and better DInSAR processing algorithms can improve the displacement estimation and pattern detection. © Authors 2018.","Image enhancement; Indium compounds; Interferometry; Landslides; Optical radar; Pattern recognition; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Differential interferograms; Differential SAR interferometry; Displacement estimation; Geodetic technique; Landslide monitoring; Network adjustment; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","Geodetic techniques; GNSS network adjustment; Landslide monitoring; LiDAR","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058145168"

Among them, the potential of SAR for ionospheric studies is gaining importance. The susceptibility of SAR to space weather dynamics, and ionosphere in particular, comes at low frequencies of L-and P-bands. This paper discusses one such scintillation event that was observed by L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-2 Phased Array L-type SAR (PALSAR) over southern India on March 23, 2015. The sensors also acquired data sets on four other days on which the ionosphere was quiet. Ionospheric parameter measurements of total electron content (TEC) and amplitude scintillation (S4) index from ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver at Tirunelveli was used to establish the ionospheric conditions on the days of SAR acquisition as well as to corroborate the S4 estimated from SAR. Multi-temporal ALOS-2 data sets were utilized to calculate S4 from two separate methods and the results have a good agreement with GNSS receiver measurements. This highlights the potential of SAR as an alternate technique of monitoring ionospheric scintillations that can be utilized as complementary to the highly accurate and dedicated measurements from the GNSS networks. © 2018 Authors.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057608892"

Soil moisture (SM) of permafrost is one of the most important factors influencing the energy flux, ecosystem, and hydrologic process. The objectives of this paper are to retrieve the permafrost SM using time-series SAR images, without the need of auxiliary survey data, and reveal its variation patterns. After analyzing the characteristics of time-series radar backscattering coefficients of different landcover types, a two-component SM retrieval model is proposed. For the alpine meadow area, a linear retrieving model is proposed using the TerraSAR-X time-series images based on the assumption that the lowest backscattering coefficient is measured when the soil moisture is at its wilting point and the highest backscattering coefficient represents the water-saturated soil state. For the alpine desert area, the surface roughness contribution is eliminated using the dual SAR images acquired in the winter season with different incidence angles when retrieving soil moisture from the radar signal. Before the model implementation, landcover types are classified based on their backscattering features. 22 TerraSAR-X images are used to derive the soil moisture in Beiluhe, Northern Tibet with different incidence angles. The results obtained from the proposed method have been validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements, thus obtaining RMSE and Bias of 0.062 cm3/cm3 and 4.7%, respectively. The retrieved time-series SM maps of the study area point out the spatial and temporal SM variation patterns of various landcover types. © 2018 by the authors.","Backscattering; Moisture control; Permafrost; Radar imaging; Satellites; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Backscattering coefficients; Model implementation; Multimodes; Radar backscattering coefficient; Situ soil moistures; Soil moisture monitoring; Tibet; Water saturated soils; Soil surveys","Multi-mode; Permafrost; SAR; Soil moisture; Tibet","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055428051"

This study investigated the use of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR data and Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to map the spatial distribution of paddy rice fields across parts of the Sanjiang plain, in northeast China. The satellite sensor data were acquired throughout the rice crop-growing season (May-October). A co-registered set of 10 dual polarization (VH/VV) SAR and NDVI images depicting crop phenological development were used as inputs to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithms in order to map paddy rice fields. The results showed a significant increase in overall classification when the NDVI time-series data were integrated with the various combinations of multi-temporal polarization channels (i.e. VH, VV, and VH/VV). The highest classification accuracies overall (95.2%) and for paddy rice (96.7%) were generated using the RF algorithm applied to combined multitemporal VH polarization and NDVI data. The SVM classifier was most effective when applied to the dual polarization (i.e. VH and VV) SAR data alone and this generated overall and paddy rice classification accuracies of 91.6%and 82.5%, respectively. The results demonstrate the practicality of implementing RF or SVM machine learning algorithms to produce 10 m spatial resolution maps of paddy rice fields with limited ground data using a combination of multi-temporal SAR and NDVI data, where available, or SAR data alone.

Monitoring and mapping of forest distribution are of great significance. With the successive launch of new synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, microwave remote sensing data acquisition methods have been developed from single-band, single-polarization and single-angle to multi-frequency, multi-polarization, multi-angle, multi-temporal and so on. That provides an unprecedented potential and opportunity for SAR in the research and application of forest identification. In this paper, the data source mainly included the quad-polarization C-band GaoFen-3(GF-3) and dual-polarization L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR. First, the single-look complex (SLC) data was preprocessed with multi-look, filtering, radiation calibration, geocoding, registration and clipping. Three polarization characteristic parameters of entropy (H), scattering angle (α) and anisotropy (A) were obtained by using Cloude-Pottier polarization decomposition, and three texture features of the mean (MEAN), variance (VAR) and dissimilarity (DIS) were extracted based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix(GLCM). Combined with the advantages of GF-3 high-resolution quad-polarization and PALSAR L-band, multi-dimensional information including frequency, polarization, temporal and texture features was used synthetically. Then support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier was used to obtain the four classification results, including coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and others. The experimental result shows that proposed method achieved a better classification result based on multi-dimensional POLSAR, the overall accuracy of forest type identification is approximately 89.47% and the Kappa coefficient is 0.85. © 2018 SPIE.","Air conditioning; Data acquisition; Ecosystems; Microwave sensors; Polarization; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Forest type; Gray level co occurrence matrix(GLCM); Microwave remote sensing; Multi dimensional; Polarization characteristics; Research and application; Single-look complex datum; Texture features; Forestry","Forest type identification; Multi-dimensional POLSAR; Polarization decomposition; SVM; Texture feature","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057302112"

It is demanding to develop automatic change detection techniques to take advantage of these images. Most existing techniques directly analyze the difference image (DI), and therefore, they are easily affected by the speckle noise. We proposed an SAR image change detection method based on frequency-domain analysis and random multigraphs. The proposed method follows a coarse-To-fine procedure: in the coarse changed regions localization stage, frequency-domain analysis is utilized to select distinctive and salient regions from the DI. Therefore, nonsalient regions are neglected, and noisy unchanged regions incurred by the speckle noise are suppressed. In the fine changed regions classification stage, random multigraphs are employed as the classification model. By selecting a subset of neighborhood features to create graphs, the proposed method can efficiently exploit the nonlinear relations between multitemporal SAR images. The experimental results on two real SAR datasets and one simulated dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Directed graphs; Image analysis; Radar imaging; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Automatic change detection; Change detection; Earth observation programs; Multi-temporal SAR images; Multigraphs; Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images; Saliency map; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Frequency domain analysis","change detection; frequency-domain analysis; random multigraphs; saliency map; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041117922"

However, landslides are usually located in mountainous areas and the area of interest can be partially or even heavily vegetated. The inherent temporal decorrelation that dramatically reduces the number of Persistent Scatters (PSs) of the scene limits in practice the application of this technique. Thus, it is crucial to be able to detect as much PSs as possible that can be usually embedded in decorrelated areas. High resolution imagery combined with efficient pixel selection methods can make possible the application of DInSAR techniques in landslide monitoring. In this paper, different strategies to identify PS Candidates (PSCs) have been employed together with 32 super high-spatial resolution (SHR) TerraSAR-X (TSX) images, staring-spotlight mode, to monitor the Canillo landslide (Andorra). The results show that advanced PSI strategies (i.e., the temporal sub-look coherence (TSC) and temporal phase coherence (TPC) methods) are able to obtain much more valid PSs than the classical amplitude dispersion (DA) method. In addition, the TPC method presents the best performance among all three full-resolution strategies employed. The SHR TSX data allows for obtaining much higher densities of PSs compared with a lower-spatial resolution SAR data set (Sentinel-1A in this study). Thanks to the huge amount of valid PSs obtained by the TPC method with SHR TSX images, the complexity of the structure of the Canillo landslide has been highlighted and three different slide units have been identified. The results of this study indicate that the TPC approach together with SHR SAR images can be a powerful tool to characterize displacement rates and extension of complex landslides in challenging areas. © 2018 by the authors.","Image resolution; Interferometry; Landslides; Losses; Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Weather satellites; D-inSAR; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); High resolution imagery; High spatial resolution; Landslide monitoring; Pixel selection; Temporal phase coherence; TerraSAR-X; Radar imaging","DInSAR; Landslide monitoring; Measurement pixels' density; Pixel selection; PSI; Super high-spatial resolution TerraSAR-X images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048979706"

In the past, multilooking algorithms were mainly implemented in the spatial domain on single interferometric pairs. With continuous development in repeat pass capabilities, multitemporal coherent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are now generally acquired more easily, thus providing the possibility to exploit also the temporal signature for multilooking. In this field, the possibility to carry out adaptive multilooking is fundamental for the improvement of interferometric processing. A basic similarity test has been introduced in the SqueeSAR approach, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Furthermore, similarity tests have been discussed in terms of real-valued data vector, so only amplitude information can be utilized: The influence of the phase signal is typically ignored. To fully exploit the complex information acquired by coherent SAR systems, this paper proposes an adaptive multilooking algorithm based on complex patch (AMCP). The complex signal, which is fundamental in interferometric systems, is here exploited for the derivation of a new patch selection method. The AMCP algorithm can be applicable to all multitemporal techniques that need filtering, including the InSAR stacks of single main image and multi main images. Experiments on simulated data and real data validate that the proposed algorithm has the highlighting major advantages in improving measurement precision compared with traditional methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Coherent light; Interferometry; Monitoring; Radar; Radar imaging; Strain; Algorithm design and analysis; Continuous development; De correlations; Interferometric processing; Interferometric system; Multi-temporal; Multilooking; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; algorithm; computer simulation; data processing; data set; interferometry; model test; model validation; numerical model; precision; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Adaptive multilooking; complex patch; interferometric model; multitemporal; small baseline subset (SBAS)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042106695"

In this model, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture retrieval from SAR data is minimized by using the water-cloud model (WCM), in which vegetation contribution is quantified using the backscatter coefficient of HV polarization. The wavelet transform is used to fuse high resolution Sentinel-1A SAR backscatter with low resolution SMOS soil moisture, where the difference in spatial heterogeneity between scales is also accounted for. The influence of soil surface roughness is eliminated by using multi-temporal data. The multi-temporal SMOS soil moisture and dual-pol Sentinel-1/SAR data are the only inputs of this downscaling model. The model is tested in southern Ontario, Canada to downscale 40 km resolution SMOS soil moisture to 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions. The downscaled results show good agreements with the in-situ soil moisture collected in May and July of 2016 with an unbiased root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.045 m3/m3 and 0.047 m3/m3 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.54 and 0.70 at 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions respectively. The results suggest that the model can be applied for C-band at regional scales to provide continuous soil moisture mapping at higher resolutions. The high revisit frequency of the up-coming Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) combined with its large areal coverage characteristics are ideal for the generation of downscaled products. © 2018","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; backscatter; data set; downscaling; Sentinel; SMOS; soil moisture; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar","Downscaling; SAR; Sentinel; SMOS; Soil moisture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053606091"

The Interferometric SAR coherence allows discriminating false alarms caused by other land cover classes characterized by high backscattering values which are not coherent in time (e.g. certain types of vegetated areas). Both the intensity in VV and VH, as well as coherence features are obtained by averaging multi-temporal SAR series. This allows reducing the speckle without any loss in spatial resolution.

With this aim, interferometric data of an urbanized sector of the Venetian-Friulian Plain were considered. The data derive by permanent scatterers InSAR processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by ERS 1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO SKY-Med and Sentinel-1 missions from 1992 to 2017. The obtained velocity maps identify, with high accuracy, the border of a fluvial incised valley formed after the last glacial maximum (LGM) and filled by unconsolidated Holocene deposits. These consist of lagoon and fluvial sediments that are affected by a much higher subsidence than the surrounding LGM deposits forming the external plain. Displacement time-series of localized sectors inside the post-LGM incision allowed the causes of vertical movements to be explored, which consist of the consolidation of recent deposits, due to the loading of new structures and infrastructures, and the exploitation of the shallow phreatic aquifer. © 2019 by the authors.","Aquifers; Deposits; Geodetic satellites; Interferometry; Landforms; Mapping; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Structural geology; Subsidence; D-inSAR; Differential compaction; Geomorphological mapping; Late quaternary; Venetian-Friulian plain; Synthetic aperture radar","Differential compaction; Geological and geomorphological mapping; Late-Quaternary deposits; Multi-temporal DInSAR; Venetian-Friulian plain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060672953"

Multi-temporal C-band VV and VH polarized SAR images were acquired simultaneously by in-situ measurements which was conducted at Konya basin, central Anatolia Turkey. During the measurements, plant height of maize plant was collected and relationship between backscatter values and plant height was analysed. The maize growth development was described under Biologische Bundesanstalt, bundessortenamt und CHemische industrie (BBCH). Under BBCH stages, the test site was classified as leaf development, stem elongation, heading and flowering in general. The correlation coefficient values indicated high correlation for both polarimetry during the early stages of the plant, while late stages indicated lower values in both polarimetry. As a last step, multi-temporal coverage of crop fields was analysed to map seasonal land use. To this aim, object based image classification was applied following image segmentation.

Knowledge of wetland species distribution is critical for sustainable management and resource assessment. In this study, multi-temporal single- and full-polarized RADARSAT-2 and single-polarized TerraSAR-X data were applied to characterize the wetland extent of a test site located in the north east of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The accuracy and information content of wetland maps using remote sensing data depend on several factors, such as the type of data, input features, classification algorithms, and ecological characteristics of wetland classes. Most previous wetland studies examined the efficiency of one or two feature types, including intensity and polarimetry. Fewer investigations have examined the potential of interferometric coherence for wetland mapping. Thus, we evaluated the efficiency of using multiple feature types, including intensity, interferometric coherence, and polarimetric scattering for wetland mapping in multiple classification scenarios. An ensemble classifier, namely Random Forest (RF), and a kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) were also used to determine the effect of the classifier. In all classification scenarios, SVM outperformed RF by 1.5-5%. The classification results demonstrated that the intensity features had a higher accuracy relative to coherence and polarimetric features. However, an inclusion of all feature types improved the classification accuracy for both RF and SVM classifiers. We also optimized the type and number of input features using an integration of RF variable importance and Spearman's rank-order correlation. The results of this analysis found that, of 81 input features, 22 were the most important uncorrelated features for classification. An overall classification accuracy of 85.4% was achieved by incorporating these 22 important uncorrelated features based on the proposed classification framework. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Canada; Labrador; Newfoundland and Labrador; data set; interferometry; mapping method; optimization; RADARSAT; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; wetland","Interferometric coherence; Random Forest; Support Vector Machine; Wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050486863"

The vertical and horizontal movements that we observe in the central crater are particularly complex and cannot be explained by any single crater formation mechanism; rather, we suggest that short-term activities superimposed on a combination of ongoing crater evolution processes, including gravitational slumping, cooling and compaction of eruption products, as well as possible piston-like subsidence, are responsible for the small-scale geomorphological changes apparent in our data. Our results demonstrate how high-temporal resolution synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) time series can add constraints on the geomorphological evolution and structural dynamics of active crater and vent systems at volcanoes worldwide. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Antofagasta; Chile; Lascar; crater; formation mechanism; geomorphological response; interferometry; spatial resolution; TerraSAR-X; volcanic eruption","Láscar volcano; MT-InSAR; Nested crater systems; Pit crater evolution; Pléiades-1; SARproZ; TerraSAR-X SpotLight interferometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041931439"

A large amount of information obtained during the first years of this system exploitation allows estimating its value for characterization of these regions. We have examined a time series of Sentintel-1A/C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) backscatter coefficient for the period between November 2014 and November 2016 to assess their potential for detecting major seasonal changes of the surface within Kotelny Island (New Siberian Islands archipelago). Temporal backscatter signatures of ten test sites located within the typical landscapes of the island were analyzed. A set of additional information sources about the area (maps, optical images, meteorological data) used for radar images interpretation allowed revealing the main factors influencing the backscattering signal. The largest backscatter variations observed within the studied sites are associated with the processes accompanying the periods of established negative (freezing of active layer, snowfall) and positive (thawing of snow cover and active layer, vegetation growth) temperatures. Differences of backscatter within each image are related to peculiarities of the relief, soils, the type and density of vegetation, amount of standing water. A good separability of Arctic landscapes based on SAR backscatter trends makes it promising to use multi-temporal radar data for landscape types classification and mapping. © 2018 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The melt water from seasonal snow and glaciers, especially during of 15 March to 15 June acts as important source of water for drinking, hydropower and irrigation requirements of many areas in North India. This work has highlights the use of C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from RISAT-1, Sentinel-1A and 1B satellites and ALOS-PALSAR-2 PolInSAR data for snow cover and glacier dynamics study for parts of North West Himalaya. Glacier velocity was derived using InSAR based method using 6 day temporal interval images from Sentinel-1 satellites and 14 day interval for PALSAR-2 satellite. High coherence was obtained for main glacier in both the data sets, which resulted accurate line of site (LOS) glacier velocity estimates for test glaciers. These InSAR data glacier velocity results are obtained after a gap of 21 years. Glacier facies was estimated using multi-temporal SAR image composition based classification. All these maps were verified by extensive ground surveys done at these sites during 2014-2017. The time series data of C-band SAR in VV/VH polarisation was also used to map snow cover in test basins of Bhagirathi and Beas River. The VV/VH data clearly shows difference between dry and wet snow, thus helping in improved snow cover mapping using SAR data.

The traditional pixel-based earthquake damaged building detection method is prone to be affected by speckle noise. In this paper, an object-based change detection method is presented for the detection of earthquake damage using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The method is based on object-level texture features of SAR data. Firstly, the principal component analysis is used to transform the optimal texture features into a suitable feature space for extracting the key change. And then, the feature space is clustered by the watershed segmentation algorithm, which introduces the concept of object orientation and carries out the calculation of the difference map at the object level. Having training samples, the classification threshold values for different grade of earthquake damage can be trained, and the detection of damaged building is achieved. The proposed method could visualize the earthquake damage efficiently using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) images. Its performance is evaluated in the town of jiegu, which was hit severely by the Yushu Earthquake.

However, while SAR data has shown great potential for large-scale crop mapping, there have been few studies on the use of SAR images for large-scale multispecies crop classification at present. In this paper, a large-scale crop mapping method using multi-temporal dual-polarization SAR data was proposed. To reduce multi-temporal SAR data redundancy, a multi-temporal images optimization method based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Jeffries-Matusita (J-M) distance was applied to the time series of images after preprocessing to select the optimal images. Facing the challenges from smallholder farming modes, which caused the complex crop planting patterns in the study area, U-Net, an improved fully convolutional network (FCN), was used to predict the different crop types. In addition, the batch normalization (BN) algorithm was introduced to the U-Net model to solve the problem of a large number of crops and unbalanced sample numbers, which had greatly improved the efficiency of network training. Finally, we conducted experiments using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data from Fuyu City, Jilin Province, China in 2017, and we obtained crop mapping results with an overall accuracy of 85% as well as a Kappa coefficient of 0.82. Compared with the traditional machine learning methods (e.g., random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)), the proposed method can still achieve better classification performance under the condition of a complex crop planting structure. © 2019 by the authors.","Complex networks; Crops; Decision trees; Mapping; Radar imaging; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Classification performance; Convolutional networks; Crop mapping; Dual-polarization SAR; Machine learning methods; Multi-temporal; Sentinel-1; Structural information; Analysis of variance (ANOVA)","Crop mapping; Multi-temporal; SAR; Sentinel-1; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059931564"

Research evaluated primarily (i) L-band observations of SAR backscatter; and, (ii) single-image or multi-polarized retrieval schemes. The use of multi-temporal or multi-frequency data improved the biomass estimates when compared to single-image retrieval. Low frequency SAR backscatter contributed the most to the biomass estimates. Single-pass InSAR height was reported to be a more reliable predictor of biomass, overcoming the loss of sensitivity of SAR backscatter and coherence in high biomass forest. A variety of empirical and semi-empirical regression models relating biomass to the SAR observables were proposed. Semi-empirical models were mostly used for large-scale mapping because of the simple formulation and the robustness of the model parameters estimates to forest structure and environmental conditions. Non-parametric models were appraised for their capability to ingest multiple observations and perform accurate retrievals having a large number of training samples available. Some studies argued that estimating compartment biomass (in stems, branches, foliage) with different types of SAR observations would lead to an improved estimate of total biomass. Although promising, scientific evidence for such an assumption is still weak. The increased availability of free and open SAR observations from currently orbiting and forthcoming spaceborne SAR missions will foster studies on forest biomass retrieval. Approaches attempting to maximize the information content on biomass of individual data streams shall be pursued. © 2018 by the authors.","Backscattering; Biomass; Coherent light; Forestry; Image enhancement; Interferometry; Radar imaging; Regression analysis; Above ground biomass; Environmental conditions; Forest; Information contents; Non-parametric model; Retrieval; Semiempirical models; Spaceborne sar missions; Synthetic aperture radar","Above-ground biomass; Backscatter; Coherence; Forest; Interferometry; Retrieval; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045999782"

The sub-optimal CNN, pre-trained on an aerial optical image dataset and further optimized for using on SAR images by tuning the batch normalization layer of the CNN, enables us to obtain multi-temporal deep features that are pixelwise compared to identify the changed pixels.

The radar backscattering coefficient, one of the most direct and accessible parameters has been proved to be capable of retrieving rice growth parameters.

Four RADARSAT-2 datasets were analyzed at 30 sample plots in Meishan City, Sichuan Province, China. By exploiting the relationships of the backscattering coefficients and their combinations versus the phenology of rice, HH/VV, VV/VH, and HH/VH ratios were found to have the greatest potential for phenology monitoring. A decision tree classifier was applied to distinguish the four phenological phases, and the classifier was effective. The validation of the classifier indicated an overall accuracy level of 86.2%.

This study aims to map rice planting areas with a field-based approach through the integration of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 OLI data in Wuhua County of South China where has many basins and mountains. This paper, using multi-temporal SAR and optical images, proposes a methodology for the identification of rice-planting areas. This methodology mainly consists of SSM applied to time series SAR images for the calculation of a similarity measure, image segmentation process applied to the pan-sharpened optical image for the searching of homogenous objects, and the integration of SAR and optical data for the elimination of some speckles. The study compares the per-pixel approach with the per-field approach and the results show that the highest accuracy (91.38%) based on the field-based approach is 1.18% slightly higher than that based on the pixel-based approach for VH polarization, which is brought by eliminating speckle noise through comparing the rice maps of these two approaches.

As a remote sensing technique, PolSAR has been proved to have the ability to provide high-resolution information of illustrated objects. However, single-temporal PolSAR data are restricted to provide sufficient information for crop identification due to the complicated condition of varying morphology within various growing stages. With an increasing number of spaceborne PolSAR systems launched, a large amount of real PolSAR data are being generated and used to provide great opportunities for multitemporal analysis. The main contribution of this paper is to improve crop classification accuracy with various features of classical Hα parameters. First, in order to deal with dual-PolSAR data, Hα decomposition algorithm for quad-PolSAR is modified to suit to the case of dual polarization. Second, according to the differential scattering characteristics of main crops, a new parameter is innovatively defined to measure the differential characteristics in the Hα classification plane. Third, crop types are discriminated by applying a supervised classification method with the newly defined parameter. Furthermore, the correctness of the parameter is verified with simulated and real Sentinel-1 data as well as AirSAR data. Finally, the performances of the classification method are investigated by the comparison with complex Wishart, Freeman-Wishart, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Hence, the experimental results show that the proposed method and SVM classifier with the newly defined parameter have the ability to improve crop classification accuracy. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Crops; Image classification; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Scattering parameters; Support vector machines; Crop classification; Differential characteristic; Dual-polarizations; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; accuracy assessment; algorithm; image analysis; numerical method; parameter estimation; performance assessment; polarization; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; scattering; Sentinel; supervised classification; support vector machine; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation classification; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047229011"

This means the feature space used for the classification is very important in the procedure of change detection. To build an effective discriminative subspace for the change detection of SAR images, a two-stage based SAR change detection algorithm was proposed in this paper. Specifically, for the difference map obtained from two SAR images (before and after change), K-means clustering method was firstly adopted for the subspace dividing, while Principle Component Analysis method was adopted consequently for the construction of the subspace. Then, using the obtained subspace, the neighborhood of each confused pixel in the difference map was projected and re-classified with K-means method to obtain the final change map. In the experiments, using synthetic two-temporal speckled images, the parameters of our method were firstly analyzed in detail. Then, using one real two-temporal SAR images, the performance of our method was further analyzed and compared with some classical methods.

The valley is in one of the most seismically active regions of the Italian peninsula, and presents slope instability and widespread landslide phenomena. We measured ground deformations by applying the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique, a multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) methodology that is used to process datasets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ground displacements are only partially visible with the InSAR technique. Visibility depends on the geometry of the acquisition layout, such as the radar acquisition angle view, and the land use. These two factors determine the backscattering of the reflected signal. Most of the ground deformation detected by InSAR can be attributed to the gravitational mass movements of the hillslopes (i.e., landslides), and the subsidence of the quaternary deposits filling the valley. The movements observed along the valley slopes were compared with the available landslide catalog. We also identified another cause of movement in this area, i.e., ground subsidence due to the compaction of the quaternary deposits filling the valley. This compaction can be ascribed to various sources, such as urban population growth and sprawl, industrial water withdrawal, and tectonic activity. © 2018 by the authors.

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum isnot suitable for detection and monitoring of flood during rainy season and clouds in the sky due to non-penetratingcapability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensorsin optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)Sensor is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surfacefrom the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and characterized by near all-weather/day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surfaceareas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in microwave spectrum and acts asspecular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from space borne SAR sensors resulting into darkpixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding area of earth surface. The change detection techniques using multitemporal SAR images based on the behavior of back-scattered signals for threshold value for detecting the floodbetween non-flooding and flooding period, and provide information related the status of water surface of river system.Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of space-borne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensorsdue its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the earth surface depending uponthe repeat orbit and SAR payloads on satellite.

The modern Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique has great potential in applications of their thermal dilation mapping and characterization due to the techniques' unique capabilities for use in large areas, with high-resolution, and at low-costs for deformation measurements. However, the practical application of DInSAR in thermal dilation estimation is limited by difficulty in the precise separation from the residual topographic phase and the trend deformation phase. Moreover, due to a lack of thermal dilation characteristics analyses in previous studies, the thermal dilation mechanisms are still unclear to users, which restricts the accurate understanding of the thermal dilation evolution process. Given the above challenges, an advanced multi-temporal DInSAR approach is proposed in this study, and the effectiveness of this approach was presented using three cases studies concerning different infrastructure types. In this method, the coherent, incoherent, and semantic information of structures were combined in order to refine the detection of point-like targets (PTs). Interferometric subsets with small temporal baselines and temperature differences were used for high-resolution topography estimation. A pre-analysis was adopted to determine the transmission direction, spatial pattern, and temporal variation of the thermal dilation. Then, both the traditional least squares estimation and our robust coherence-weighted least squares regression analysis were performed between the time series displacements and the corresponding temperatures to quantitatively estimate the thermal dilation model. The results were verified in terms of the estimated linear thermal dilation coefficient, which indicates the greater reliability of our method. Furthermore, the thermal dilation characteristics of different civil infrastructure types were analysed, which facilitates a greater understanding of the thermal dilation evolution process of civil infrastructures. © 2018 by the authors.","Deformation; Interferometry; Mapping; Regression analysis; Semantics; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Weather satellites; Civil infrastructures; D-inSAR; Least Square; TerraSAR-X; Thermal dilation; Radar measurement","Civil infrastructures; Least squares; Multi-temporal DInSAR analysis; TerraSAR-X; Thermal dilation characteristics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048963695"

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the regional scale. This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence information. The proposed method can classify permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds. First, a land cover map is generated through the combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. An overall accuracy of 98% is achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79% is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with one year of single-polarized acquisitions. Second, the distributions of the permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the classified landscapes. Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost, and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land cover map. The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually delineated references. The proposed method can produce permafrost landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes. This classification strategy can be transferred to other time-series SAR datasets, e.g., Sentinel-1, and other heterogeneous environments. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Nowadays, several satellite missions are available providing interferometric SAR data at different wavelengths, spatial resolutions, and revisit time. A new and interesting opportunity is provided by Sentinel-1, which has a spatial resolution comparable to that of previous ESA C-band sensors, and revisit times improved by up to 6 days. According to these different SAR space-borne missions, the present work discusses current and future opportunities of MTI applications in terms of ground instability monitoring. Issues related to coherent target detection, mean velocity precision, and product geo-location are addressed through a simple theoretical model assuming backscattering mechanisms related to point scatterers. The paper also presents an example of a multi-sensor ground instability investigation over Lesina Marina, a village in Southern Italy lying over a gypsum diapir, where a hydration process, involving the underlying anhydride, causes a smooth uplift and the formation of scattered sinkholes. More than 20 years of MTI SAR data have been processed, coming from both legacy ERS and ENVISAT missions, and latest-generation RADARSAT-2, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A sensors. Results confirm the presence of a rather steady uplift process, with limited to null variations throughout the whole monitored time-period. © 2018 by the authors.

Unfortunately, the issue has been inadequately assessed; hence, various outcomes could be expected when a single date of observation is employed for a specific task. This article considers seasonal discrepancies in SAR data backscatters returned by different ages of rubber trees. We selected Jalupang rubber plantation situated in Subang, Indonesia to illustrate the problem using dense multi-Temporal Cosmo/SkyMed X-band SAR data. Large variation occurs amongst young trees of 1-4 years age indicating a strong contribution of non-Tree scatterers. Mature stands < 20 years act as stable scattering objects, which could serve as a potential natural entity for SAR calibration. Backscatter from old growth > 25 years appears less stable, perhaps due to increasing canopy gaps. Extreme variation due to season was observed in young trees, with the discrepancy being about 4 db in HH polarization between observations in wet and dry seasons. The ambiguity tends to be lower for maturing trees (6-20 years) to ca. 1.5 db. The research suggests that variations due to associated seasonal events could be significant in X-band, which is an important issue for long-Term monitoring of tropical woodlands. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

HTV was then summarized by calculating the percentage of the total pixel stack, which was detected as water. Comparison to the waterbodies in the Government of Alberta Base Features Hydrography Polygon dataset shows that the HTV dataset is able to differentiate between permanent and recurring lakes as well as capture rivers with a width of over 30 m.

It is further able to sense the geometric structure of forests more than passive optical sensors, making it a valuable tool for mapping forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB). This paper studies the ability of the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 and polarimetric L-band PALSAR-2 data to estimate live AGB based on ground truth data collected in New England, USA in 2017. Comparisons of results using the Simple Water Cloud Model (SWCM) on both VH and VV polarizations show that C-band reaches saturation much faster than the L-band due to its limited forest canopy penetration. The exhaustive search multiple linear regression model over the many polarimetric parameters from PALSAR-2 data shows that the combination of polarimetric parameters could slightly improve the AGB estimation, with an adjusted R2 as high as 0.43 and RMSE of around 70 Mg/ha when decomposed Pv component and Alpha angle are used. Additionally, the single- and multi-temporal C-band Sentinel-1 data are compared, which demonstrates that the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 significantly improves the AGB estimation, but still has a much lower adjusted R2 due to the limitations of the short wavelength. Finally, a site-level comparison between paired control and treatment sites shows that the L-band aligns better with the ground truth than the C-band, showing the high potential of the models to be applied to relative biomass change detection. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass; Linear regression; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Above ground biomass; Forest; Geometric structure; Multiple linear regression models; PALSAR-2; Polarimetric parameters; Sentinel-1; Water cloud models; Forestry","Aboveground biomass; Forest; PALSAR-2; SAR; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053596501"

The architecture takes advantage from the characteristics of the recently introduced RGB products of the Level-1 α and Level-1β families, and employs self-organizing map clustering and object-based image analysis. In particular, the input products are clustered using color homogeneity and automatically enriched with a semantic attribute referring to clusters' color, providing a preclassification mask. Then, in the frame of an application-oriented object-based image analysis, opportune layers measuring scattering and geometric properties of candidate objects are evaluated, and an appropriate rule-set is implemented in a fuzzy system to extract the feature of interest. The obtained results have been compared with those given by existing techniques and turned out to provide high degree of accuracy and negligible false alarms.

A review on different applications of Persistent Scatterers InSAR approaches, proposed and applied over Tuscany region (Italy) across time, is here presented. The study area is characterized by both subsidence of alluvial plains and landslides on hilly and mountainous reliefs. Tuscany has a leading role in Italy in the field of interferometric applications: the first InSAR analyses, which date back to 2003, were performed at local basin scale, by exploiting various PSI-based approaches for risk mapping. The first InSAR applications at regional scale date back to 2009, relying on historical SAR archives of ERS and ENVISAT satellites for updating subsidence and landslide inventory maps at a certain temporal date. Nowadays, the availability of Sentinel-1 SAR data with a regular and systematic 6-days acquisitions plan, allows near-real time monitoring of deformative scenario at regional scale rather than solely mapping of geo-hydrological phenomena. Most recent innovative InSAR applications over Tuscany region scan the territory, exploiting the regular repeat pass of Sentinel-1, and promptly highlight the sites affected by the highest ground movements with high temporal frequency. Such approaches permit us to pass from a static ‘picture’ of regional slope instability to a weekly updated ‘movie’ with improved detail, useful for civil protection practices. These last ongoing works significantly enhance the value of multi-temporal InSAR approaches for investigating and managing geo-hazards over the Region. © 2018 Bianchini, Raspini, Solari, Del Soldato, Ciampalini, Rosi and Casagli.","Italy; Tuscany; Deformation; Geodetic satellites; Interferometry; Landslides; Mapping; Monitoring; Slope protection; Space-based radar; Subsidence; Ground deformations; High temporal frequency; InSAR; Landslide inventories; Near-real-time monitoring; Persistent scatterers; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Tuscany; accuracy assessment; deformation mechanism; detection method; displacement; geological hazard; ground conditions; ground movement; interferometry; landslide; mountain region; relief; satellite data; site investigation; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Ground deformations; InSAR; Monitoring; Persistent scatterers interferometry; Tuscany","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056919983"

The paper presents an automatic procedure that integrates SAR and optical data, which can be effectively used to generate land consumption maps or update existing maps. The main input of the procedure is a series of SAR amplitude images acquired over a given geographical area and observation period. The main assumption of the procedure is that land consumption is associated with an increase of the SAR amplitude values. Such an increase is detected in the SAR amplitude time series using an automatic Bayesian algorithm. The results based on the SAR amplitude are then filtered using an NDVI map derived from optical imagery.

Twenty-six scenes of TerraSAR-X single-look complex (SLC) interferometric images were acquired for the period of May 2013 to February 2015 and applied for urban change detection as well as surface subsidence monitoring by means of interferometric SAR (InSAR) technologies. Firstly, a small baseline strategy in conjunction with a fast statistically homogeneous pixel selection (FaSHPS) approach were applied for the coherence imagery generation and for the coherent change detection, resulting in a correct probability of better than 90%. Second, the surface deformation was derived with millimetre accuracy using an enhanced multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) tool by synergistically analyzing the amplitudes and phases of the SAR acquisitions.

This paper presents a new fast DEM coregistration method based on a given SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imaging geometry to overcome the divergence and time-consuming problem of the conventional DEM coregistration method. First, intensity images are simulated for two DEMs under the given SAR imaging geometry. 2D (Two-dimensional) offsets are estimated in the frequency domain using the intensity cross-correlation operation in the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) tool, which can greatly accelerate the calculation process. Next, the transformation function between two DEMs is achieved via the robust least-square fitting of 2D polynomial operation. Accordingly, two DEMs can be precisely coregistered. Last, two DEMs, i.e., one high-resolution LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DEM and one low-resolution SRTM (Shutter Radar Topography Mission) DEM, covering the Yangjiao landslide region of Chongqing are taken as an example to test the new method. The results indicate that, in most cases, this new method can achieve not only a result as much as 80 times faster than the minimum elevation difference (Least Z-difference, LZD) DEM registration method, but also more accurate and more reliable results. © Authors 2018.

This solution can imply that SAR images can be used to estimate extend of water bodies with precise spatial details. The obtained results from SAR images indicate that water-extend changes over the time of study. The obtained results also show that the extend of water bodies is dynamic and spatially heterogeneous which is impossible to be mapped based on readings from sparsely distributed gauge stations.

We build on our previous work, which constructed a pair of dictionaries. The main shortcoming of this method was its dependence on a large amount of training data. In practice, there is often a shortage of ground-truthed training images, which limits the expression capability of the resulting dictionaries. This paper overcomes this challenge by incorporating the concept of deformation, wherein each atom of a dictionary is no longer a simple image patch, but instead is a flexible image deformation function. This enables the creation of more expressive dictionaries, capable of generalizing to a far greater variety of image patterns, while using a far smaller amount of ground-truthed images for supervised dictionary training. Deformation similarity is employed for patch matching to find the best set of atoms in the difference image (DI) dictionary for reconstructing image patches for a new input DI. Each such atom can be deformed to achieve a better match, thus extending generality while reducing the number of atoms needed in the dictionary. Multiple deformed atoms are weighted and combined to best reconstruct the input DI patch. Then, the same set of deformations and weights is projected to the corresponding atoms in the CD dictionary to obtain the output change-detection map. Experiments in six realistic synthetic aperture radar data sets demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with five other state-of-the-art methods from the literature. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atoms; Deformation; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; deformable patches; Dictionary learning; Dictionary trainings; Multi-temporal image; Sparse representation; State-of-the-art methods; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; data set; deformation; detection method; image analysis; learning; remote sensing; supervised learning; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Change detection; deformable patches; remote sensing; sparse representation; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047020117"

However, only azimuth or line of sight (LOS) measurements can be directly extracted from SAR images which restrict further applications, especially for people who are not expertise in radar remote sensing. Aiming at this problem, we proposed an approach of retrieving time series three-dimensional displacements from multi-angular SAR datasets. Firstly, time series displacements in the azimuth and LOS direction can be estimated using traditional methods of SAR interferometry (InSAR) and SAR pixel offset tracking. Then, a fitting and interpolation procedure was applied to parameterize the displacement history and interpolate the displacements from different datasets with identical dates. Thus, three dimensional displacements can be obtained by making use of the different observation geometry of different SAR datasets.

The contributions of the present paper for the sake of parsimonious analysis of such huge datasets are associated with a framework having two main processing stages. The first stage is the derivation of an index called geometric multi-wavelet total variation for fast and robust anomaly spotting. This index is useful for identifying significant abnormal patterns appearing as geo-spatial non-stationarities in multi-wavelet total variation map. The second stage consists in the proposal of a concise asymmetric multi-date change information matrix on regions associated with significant multi-wavelet total variations.

The core of the method is focalised on the use of circular (directional) statistics. Unlike other methods recently proposed in the literature, which identify homogenous distribuited scatterers (DS) that are present into a resolution cell by analysing statistics of the complex valued single-look-complex (SLC) SAR images, the proposed method is exclusively based on the analysis of hig resolution interferograms. It does not need of any other type of assumption, and it uses the two sample Kuiper test to check the statistical homogeneity of neighbouring SAR pixels. The technique can be applied to generate adaptive multi-look interferograms both at the native grid of full-resolutions images and at the multi-look resolution scale. Also, the method can be simply complemented with other space/time noise-filtering techniques, such as the one adopted within the Extended Minimum Cost Flow (EMCF) based Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) processing chain, based on the optimal combination of multi-look interferograms.

The H/A/Alpha decomposition gives a better characterization of the flooded area. The separability analysis is done with a different combination of decomposition parameters and the parameters having high-class separability between water and non-water areas are selected. Polarimetric classification using Random forest classifier is done on these selected decomposition parameters to classify the study into water and non-water areas.

We present an algorithm that is based on the linear dispersion relation between water depth and swell parameters like swell wavelength, direction, and period to estimate shallow water depth using multitemporal SAR data with a short repeating cycle. This is accomplished via circular convolution and Kalman filter that provides both the estimates and a measure of their uncertainty at each location.

Prompted by the high demand for temporal and spatial information about the wetland's hydrological regimes and landscape patterns, eight time series Radarsat-2 images were utilized to detect the flooding characteristics of the Zhalong wetland. Subsequently, a random forest model was built to discriminate wetlands from other land cover types, combining with optical, radar, and hydrological regime data derived from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The results showed that hydrological regimes variables, including flooding extent and flooding frequency, derived from multitemporal SAR images, improve the land cover classification accuracy in the natural wetlands distribution area. The permutation importance scores derived from the random forest classifier indicate that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from optical imagery and the flooding frequency derived from multitemporal SAR imagery were found to be the most important variables for land cover mapping. Accuracy testing indicate that the addition of hydrological regime features effectively depressed the omission error rates (from 52.14% to 2.88%) of marsh and the commission error (from 77.34% to 51.27%) of meadow, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy (from 76.49% to 91.73%).

Monitoring of ore mining and processing enterprise areas is conducted regularly and includes engineering, geological and geodetic works. Earth radar sensing data have a huge potential for resolving tasks of ground surface dynamics control. Satellite interferometry method is based on mathematical processing of multi-Temporal radar images obtained from repeat acquisitions of area of interest. The research work included processing of 44 scenes acquired from ascending and descending passes of Sentinel-1A for the period 2015-2016 using persistent scatterers interferometry technique. TOPSAR mode is a feature of Sentinel-1A which provides medium spatial resolution data and wide swath. Results of interferometric processing of radar images acquired from two directions and information about sensing geometry make it possible to assess vertical and horizontal (west-east) displacements components. Results of post-processing permitted to extract vertical and horizontal displacement components. The conducted research work proves effectiveness of multi-Temporal radar data for monitoring hydraulic structures local displacements. Further joint use of Sentinel-1A/B/ C/D radars will decrease the repeat passes period down to 2 days, increase source data volume and help obtaining more precise results.

Traditional field-based methods are too time and cost consuming and limited to good visibility and accessible terrain. Different remote sensing methods have been proposed to assist in monitoring of snow avalanche activity, with satellite-borne radar remote sensing allowing for all-weather and all-light conditions monitoring. Here we present a complete, two-year snow avalanche activity record from a Norwegian forecasting region using Sentinel-1A radar satellite imagery. We used a change detection method to manually identify avalanche debris based on localized backscatter increase in avalanche runout zones and assess these detections using multi-temporal and multi-sensor datasets. We then used the complete dataset of snow avalanche activity to exemplify different applications from validating issued avalanche bulletins, to generating avalanche path maps, and creating a snow climate classification. Comparing manual identification in Sentinel-1A images and a very high resolution Radarsat-2 image suggest overall underestimation of avalanche activity, also when considering the non-detectability of small avalanche debris. We foresee that with the further increase in satellite-radar data availability and the improvement of automatized snow avalanche detection, the presented methodologies will be able to assist in operational avalanche forecasting worldwide in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Norway; Classification (of information); Debris; Forecasting; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Snow; Synthetic aperture radar; Avalanche forecasting; Manual identification; Radar remote sensing; RADARSAT-2 images; Satellite radar data; Sentinel-1; Snow avalanche; Very high resolution; detection method; forecasting method; future prospect; monitoring; RADARSAT; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; snow avalanche; synthetic aperture radar; Space-based radar","Avalanche forecasting; Remote sensing; SAR; Sentinel-1; Snow avalanche activity; Snow avalanche detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028065062"

Its application capability has recently been emphasized by the Sentinel-1 satellite mission, providing extensive spatial coverage, regular temporal sampling and free data availability. We perform MT-InSAR analysis over the wider Upper Nitra region in Slovakia, utilizing all Sentinel-1 images acquired since November 2014 until March 2017. This region is notable for its extensive landslide susceptibility as well as intensive brown coal mining. We focus on two case studies, being impaired by recent activation of these geohazards, which caused serious damage to local structures. We incorporate a processing chain based on open-source tools, combining the current Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) implementation. MT-InSAR results reveal substantial activity at both case studies, exceeding the annual displacement velocities of 30 mm/year. Moreover, our observations are validated and their accuracy is confirmed via comparison with ground truth data from borehole inclinometers and terrestrial levelling. Detected displacement time series provide valuable insight into the spatio-temporal evolution of corresponding deformation phenomena and are thus complementary to conventional terrestrial monitoring techniques. At the same time, they not only demonstrate the feasibility of MT-InSAR for the assessment of remediation works, but also constitute the possibility of operational monitoring and routine landslide inventory updates, regarding the free Sentinel-1 data. © 2017 by the authors.

The study area selected is Chandigarh City (UT, India) and its near vicinities, which is located at the junction of three Indian states namely Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. PS-InSAR is a well-established technique to identify and monitor the ground deformation using the satellite imagery. This technique has been extensively used for monitoring the earth surface deformations. Time series Sentinel-1 data comprising of 43 ascending images acquired during 2014 to 2017 over the study area have been used in this study. The high spatial and temporal resolution of this data allowed to carry out the time series analysis in an effective manner. Sarproz software package has been used for all PS-InSAR processing. The atmospheric phase screen (APS) of the SAR data has also been estimated and removed to minimise the noise in the estimated values. The results indicate the significant rate of the subsidence over the study area. The maximum rate of subsidence estimated is around -20 mm/year in specific locations. However, a large part of the study area showed a comparably low rate of subsidence. The possible cause for the high rate of subsidence in this area may be the depleting ground water levels in the region which also corroborates with the available literature. This study provides preliminary information on the probable danger to the urban infrastructure in the area.

The purpose is to provide guidance on how to train a powerful learning machine for change detection in SAR images and to contribute to a better understanding of potentials and limitations of supervised change detection approaches. This becomes particularly important on the background of a rapidly growing demand for SAR change detection to support rapid situation awareness in case of natural disasters. The application environment of this study thus focuses on detecting changes caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, where single polarized TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR intensity images are used as input. An unprecedented reference dataset of more than 18,000 buildings that have been visually inspected by local authorities for damages after the disaster forms a solid statistical population for the performance experiments. Several critical choices commonly made during the training stage of a learning machine are being assessed for their influence on the change detection performance, including sampling approach, location and number of training samples, classification scheme, change feature space and the acquisition dates of the satellite images. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approach is compared with the widely used change image thresholding. The study concludes that a well-trained and tuned SVM can provide highly accurate change detections that outperform change image thresholding. While good performance is achieved in the binary change detection case, a distinction between multiple change classes in terms of damage grades leads to poor performance in the tested experimental setting. The major drawback of a machine learning approach is related to the high costs of training. The outcomes of this study, however, indicate that given dynamic parameter tuning, feature selection and an appropriate sampling approach, already small training samples (100 samples per class) are sufficient to produce high change detection rates. Moreover, the experiments show a good generalization ability of SVM which allows transfer and reuse of trained learning machines. © 2016 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Damage detection; Disasters; Earthquakes; Feature extraction; Geophysics; Learning systems; Population statistics; Radar; Radar signal processing; Sampling; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Application environment; Change detection; Earthquake and tsunamis; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Machine learning approaches; Performance experiment; Supervised change detection; Radar imaging","Change detection; Earthquake; Machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunami","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017640549"

The results pointed out that single-date satellite radar data were useful for the identification of subsurface traces buried under desert in the landscape-scale, whereas for the identification of emerging monuments, Sentinel-1 was limited by its lower spatial resolution compared to TerraSAR and PALSAR data. Multi-date products, such as interferometric coherence, the averaged radar signatures and RGB multi-temporal composites, were effective to sharpen archaeological traces as well as for change detection in Yumen Frontier Pass.

Three representative change indices, the co-event coherence, the ratio between the co- and pre-event coherence, and the z-factor combining the difference and correlation coefficients, were adopted to extract the collapsed buildings in the central district of Mashiki Town, the most severely affected area. The results of a building-by-building damage survey in the target area were used to investigate the most suitable threshold value for each index.

Given two multitemporal images, Gabor wavelets and fuzzy c-means are utilized to select interested pixels that have high probability of being changed or unchanged. Then, new image patches centered at interested pixels are generated and a PCANet model is trained using these patches.

However, it has limitations due to the influence of noise sources such as atmospheric and topographic artefacts, data processing errors, etc. In particular, atmospheric effect is one of the most prominent noise sources in InSAR for the monitoring of small magnitude deformations. In this paper, we proposed an efficient multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) approach to measure small co-seismic deformations by minimizing atmospheric anomalies. This approach was applied to investigate the 18 September 2004 earthquake over Huntoon Valley, California, using 13 ascending and 22 descending ENVISAT synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The results showed that the co-seismic deformation was ±1.5 and ±1.0 cm in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The earthquake source parameters were estimated using an elastic dislocation source from the ascending and descending acquisitions. The root mean square errors between the observed and modelled deformations were improved by the proposed MTInSAR approach to about 3.8 and 1.8 mm from about 4.0 and 5.2 mm in the ascending and descending orbits, respectively. It means that the MTInSAR approach presented herein remarkably improved the measurement performance of a small co-seismic deformation. © 2017 The Author(s).

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used to measure soil moisture in recent years due to its capacity to operate under different weather conditions, relatively strong penetrability, and sensitivity to soil moisture. However, the application of SAR to mountainous areas introduces two problems. On the one hand, geometric distortion and polarimetric rotation occur in SAR images. One the other hand, vegetation reduces the sensitivity of SAR images to soil moisture. Therefore, the retrieval of soil moisture from mountainous areas covered with low vegetation is still intractable. To this end, we present a soil moisture estimation method for mountainous areas covered with low vegetation. To solve the problem of geometric distortion and polarimetric rotation caused by undulate terrain in SAR images, the images are classified as measured and unmeasured areas in terms of incident, slope, and aspect angles. Second, backscattering coefficients are corrected in terms of the irradiated area and local coordinates with respect to horizontal and vertical polarizations. Furthermore, a scattering model for low vegetation is developed based on the Michigan microwave canopy scattering model. Under the assumption that the characteristics of vegetation and soil are fixed, the change in backscattering coefficients is only related to the change in soil moisture. Consequently, a method of soil moisture estimation is established by combining the proposed scattering model with the previously corrected data. Two spots with different levels of soil moisture are selected as the experimental sites from Maoxian, Sichuan, China. A field investigation is then carried out to collect the characteristics of vegetation and soil over the study areas. The soil moisture levels measured by two methods from the two experimental sites are 11.45% and 15.80% respectinely. The estimated results from the corresponding Radarsat-2 SAR image are 14% and 15%, with absolute errors of 2.55% and 0.80% and relative errors of 22% and 5%. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is suited for general applications. Moreover, a soil moisture distribution map over the study area is generated, assuming that a similar vegetation observed from the two experimental sites covers the whole study area. Thus, the variation range of soil moisture is acceptable. Different from the current studies focusing on the soil moisture estimation from plain areas covered with monotype vegetation such as crops and grassland, the proposed method can estimate soil moisture from mountainous areas covered with low vegetation. The proposed method monitors the soil moisture in mountains. Our next work will focus on the classification of mountainous areas. The integration of the classification result of the proposed method and the employment of multi-temporal SAR images can provide accurate and continuous monitoring over the observed areas. © 2017, Science Press.

However, in the majority of disaster investigations, there is more interest in the vertical deformation component than that of the horizontal direction, for example, in measuring ground subsidence in urban areas, or ground subsidence due to underground mining. To estimate the vertical deformation component accurately, it is in theory necessary to create at least three independent equations, and solve the vertical, the North–South, and the East–West deformation components by exploiting at least three-track InSAR LOS measurements or combining at least two-track InSAR LOS measurements with azimuth measurements. However, these methods are greatly limited and sometimes not even practical because there is typically little chance of obtaining a three-track SAR data set covering the same area in the same time span, and the accuracy of the azimuth measurements is far lower than that of InSAR LOS measurements. In this article, we found that it is possible to solve for the vertical deformation component from two-track InSAR LOS measurements in some circumstances. Then, an approach for accurately retrieving the vertical deformation component from two-track InSAR LOS measurements is proposed, and the analytical expression is presented. The approach is illustrated through an investigation of the ground subsidence in an area of Beijing, China. Unlike previous methods, this approach can accurately retrieve the vertical deformation component from two-track InSAR LOS measurements, and provide more reliable results for improving the interpretation of ground subsidence phenomena. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Deformation; Interferometry; Subsidence; Analytical expressions; Deformation component; Differential synthetic-aperture-radar interferometries; Disaster investigations; Reliable results; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; Underground mining; Vertical deformation; accuracy assessment; azimuth; data interpretation; data set; deformation; mining; radar interferometry; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012159747"

Based on a correlation analysis and constructed models, the VV model (R2>0.8) was clearly better than HH model, and a VV image can be used to retrieve the LAI (vegetative stage, entire growth season); The crop height can also be derived from the VV image using the water cloud model with a determination coefficient above 0.6. The applicability of the models and SAR data from a different year (2013) was also assessed for Chizhou. The LAI time series and the crop height maps represented the rice growth status. The study demonstrated that the C-band SAR data and models would be useful for rice growth parameters retrieval independent of the region and year in regional scale. © 2016 IEEE.","Backscattering; Cloud computing; Crops; Forestry; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Correlation analysis; Crop height; Determination coefficients; Ground measurements; High temporal frequency; Reproductive stage; Rice cropping systems; Search engines","crop height; LAI; reproductive stage; rice cropping system; SAR; vegetative stage","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994099338"

Then, in order to obtain accurate changed regions, rather than directly obtaining the change-detection map from the difference image as in some traditional change detection methods, we make segmentation around the extracted keypoints in the two original multitemporal SAR images, where the edges of detection regions are much clearer than those in the difference image, and further compare the two segmentations to generate the change-detection map.

Consequently, it is common that the available InSAR pairs do not cover the entire time period of SAR acquisitions, i.e., temporal gaps exist in the multi-temporal InSAR observations. In this case, it is very difficult to accurately estimate mining-induced dynamic subsidence using the traditional time-series InSAR techniques. In this investigation, we employ a logistic model which has been widely applied to describe mining-related dynamic subsidence, to bridge the temporal gaps in multi-temporal InSAR observations. More specifically, we first construct a functional relationship between the InSAR observations and the logistic model, and we then develop a method to estimate the model parameters of the logistic model from the InSAR observations with temporal gaps. Having obtained these model parameters, the dynamic subsidence can be estimated with the logistic model. Simulated and real data experiments in the Datong coal mining area, China, were carried out in this study, in order to test the proposed method. The results show that the maximum subsidence in the Datong coal mining area reached about 1.26 m between 1 July 2007 and 28 February 2009, and the accuracy of the estimated dynamic subsidence is about 0.017 m. Compared with the linear and cubic polynomial models of the traditional time-series InSAR techniques, the accuracy of dynamic subsidence derived by the logistic model is increased by about 50.0% and 45.2%, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.","Coal; Coal mines; Interferometry; Subsidence; Time series; Dynamic subsidences; InSAR; Logistic models; Mining areas; Temporal gaps; Synthetic aperture radar","Dynamic subsidence; InSAR; Logistic model; Mining areas; Temporal gaps","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013684788"

Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004–2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015–2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high-resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Great Salt Lake; Salt Lake County; United States; Utah; Chloride minerals; Geodetic satellites; Lakes; Optical radar; Settlement of structures; Space-based radar; Time series; Time series analysis; Water levels; Consolidation model; Consolidation settlement; Field instrumentation; Geotechnical analysis; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Remotely sensed data; Space-borne SAR; Stability monitoring; ALOS; consolidation; data set; digital elevation model; Envisat; geotechnical survey; impoundment; lidar; mining; PALSAR; pore pressure; precision; radar altimetry; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; Sentinel; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; sustainable development; synthetic aperture radar; tailings; terrain; time series analysis; water level; Synthetic aperture radar","Consolidation settlement; Multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR datasets; Stability monitoring; Tailings impoundment; Time-series InSAR analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020020669"

Adequate damage assessment as well as protection and preservation of the built patrimony are priorities at national and local levels, so they require advanced integration and analysis of environmental, architectural and historical parameters. The GEPATAR project (GEotechnical and Patrimonial Archives Toolbox for ARchitectural conservation in Belgium) aims to create an online interactive geo-information tool that allows the user to view and to be informed about the Belgian heritage buildings at risk due to differential soil settlements. Multi-temporal interferometry techniques (MTI) have been proven to be a powerful technique for analyzing earth surface deformation patterns through time series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. These techniques allow to measure ground movements over wide areas at high precision and relatively low cost. In this project, Persistent Scatterer Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (PS-InSAR) and Multidimensional Small Baseline Subsets (MSBAS) are used to measure and monitor the temporal evolution of surface deformations across Belgium. This information is integrated with the Belgian heritage data by means of an interactive toolbox in a GIS environment in order to identify the level of risk. At country scale, the toolbox includes ground deformation hazard maps, geological information, location of patrimony buildings and land use; while at local scale, it includes settlement rates, photographic and historical surveys as well as architectural and geotechnical information. Some case studies are investigated by means of on-site monitoring techniques and stability analysis to evaluate the applied approaches. This paper presents a description of the methodology being implemented in the project together with the case study of the Saint Vincent's church which is located on a former colliery zone.

Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide radar images captured rapidly over vast areas at fine spatiotemporal resolution. In addition, the active microwave sensors are capable of day-and-night vision and independent of weather conditions. These advantages make multi-temporal SAR images suitable for scene monitoring. Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) detects and analyses PS points, which are characterized by strong, stable, and coherent radar signals throughout a SAR image sequence and can be regarded as substructures of buildings in built-up cities. Attributes of PS points, for example, deformation velocities, are derived and used for further analysis. Based on PSI, a 4D change detection technique has been developed to detect disappearance and emergence of PS points (3D) at specific times (1D). In this paper, we apply this 4D technique to the centre of Berlin, Germany, to investigate its feasibility and application for construction monitoring. The aims of the three case studies are to monitor construction progress, business districts, and single buildings, respectively. The disappearing and emerging substructures of the buildings are successfully recognized along with their occurrence times. The changed substructures are then clustered into single construction segments based on DBSCAN clustering and α-shape outlining for object-based analysis. Compared with the ground truth, these spatiotemporal results have proven able to provide more detailed information for construction monitoring. © 2017 Copernicus GmbH.

It is important to obtain accurate wheat planting area. Optical imagery has been widely used in crop classification and made great progress, but the optical imagery in the critical period of wheat growth is often affected by weather and other external conditions. In contrast, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is potentially effective data source for wheat mapping because of its all-weather, all-day imaging capabilities. The study site was located in a typical urban agricultural region in Gaochun District of Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu Province, China, with the central coordinates of 118°52′E and 31°19′N. Six SAR (Sentinel-1A) and 4 optical (Landsat-8) images were obtained from the ESA during the growing period of winter wheat. The objective of this study was to explore the abilities of multi-temporal satellite SAR data, optical images and the combination of both types of images to identify winter wheat in an urban agriculture region with complex planting structures. The investigations were through the following steps: 1) The texture features were extracted from the SAR images using the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the backscatter intensity data were also obtained; 2) A support vector machine (SVM) was used as the classifier to map winter wheat, using the different combinations of the Sentinel-1A derived information and optical images. 3) Then, the classification accuracies for different combinations of SAR variables and optical images were evaluated. The results showed that: 1) In the process of winter wheat growth, the backscatter characteristics changed obviously. In the middle of April, the backscatter characteristics were different between winter wheat and other vegetation in the study area, which could provide the theoretical basis for winter wheat classification. 2) Using single polarization, single-temporal SAR data were difficult to meet the accuracy requirements of winter wheat with complex planting structures, and the classification accuracy of VV polarization was higher than that of VH polarization; 3) Compared with VV polarization, the producer's and user's accuracy of VV+VH combination were increased by 27.3% and 13.6%, respectively. When VV polarization was added to VH backscatter intensity images, the producer's and user's accuracy were increased from 50.3% to 85.7% and from 54.5% to 87.9%, respectively; 4) When texture images were added to backscatter intensity images, the winter wheat fields could be mapped with a satisfactory classification accuracy, and the user's and producer's accuracy could reach up to 94.6% and 93.3%, respectively; 5) The combination of multi-temporal SAR and optical images had the best classification accuracy, and the producer's and user's accuracy were 97% and 98.4% (overall accuracy 95.3%, Kappa coefficient 0.91), respectively. The addition of multi-temporal SAR to optical images allowed us to increase producer's and user's accuracy of winter wheat by 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively. The results in this paper show that the satisfactory classification of winter wheat can be achieved using Sentinel-1A data alone in urban agricultural regions with complex planting structures. In addition, texture features of SAR can improve SAR data classification accuracy. The SAR and optical images can make use of the advantages of information complementation of each other to make up for their deficiencies in crop classification. It is indicated that the SAR data can not only be used as a data source instead of optical images to distinguish winter wheat, but also as a supplementary data source to improve the classification accuracy of optical data. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

However, repetition intervals of radar instruments are in the order of several days for routine operations, reaching daily or higher frequencies only in tasked conditions. Therefore, to follow flood dynamics, images acquired by different sensors at different times may be beneficial. In the present work, multi-temporal SAR intensity, InSAR coherence and optical data are considered to describe a flood event occurred in the Basilicata region (southern Italy) on December 2013. In this case study, optical data have a twofold role: they allow to follow the flood dynamics (because SAR and optical data have been acquired in different dates during the inundation event), and they add information concerning the land cover of the analyzed area. The data fusion approach is based on Bayesian Networks (BNs). It is shown that the synergetic use of different information layers can help detect more precisely the areas affected by the flood, reducing false alarms and missed identifications which may affect algorithms based on data from a single source. The produced flood maps are compared to reference maps, independently obtained; the comparison indicates that the proposed methodology is able to reliably follow the temporal evolution of the phenomenon, assigning high probability to areas most likely to be flooded, reaching accuracies of up to 89%. © 2016 IEEE.","Bayesian networks; Data fusion; Dynamics; Floods; Radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Bayesian Networks (bns); High probability; Higher frequencies; Information concerning; Information layers; Multi-temporal SAR; Night capability; Temporal evolution; Monitoring","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980360416"

As an advanced remote-sensing technique, PolSAR has been proved to provide high-resolution information, including the intensity and polarization of illustrated land surface. However, single-temporal PolSAR data are restricted to provide sufficient information for crop classification and identification. With the increase of number of airborne and spaceborne PolSAR systems, a large number of real PolSAR data are generated, and thus provides opportunities for multi-temporal data analysis. The potential of improving crop classification accuracy by introducing the differential characteristics of H/α parameters for multi-temporal PolSAR images was investigated. Firstly, by analyzing the characteristics of several typical crops in different growing stages, a new parameter was defined for the first time to describe the differential characteristics of H/α distribution. Therefore, a new supervised classification method with the newly defined parameter was proposed to classify different crop types. The main idea of the proposed method was to apply various features of classical H/α parameters to improve the accuracy of crop classification. A validation test for the new approach was performed with Sentinel-1 data sets which were simulated by Radarsat-2 data sets and provided by ESA. The results showed that the mean accuracy of the proposed method was improved by 4 percentage points compared with the supervised complex Wishart classifier when the six kinds of crops were classified. Furthermore, the number of classes was reduced to 4 and the accuracy was almost improved by 6 percentage points. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

The PS selection and deformation parameter estimation of StaMPS-PS are closely related to the spatially uncorrected error, which is directly affected by external DEMs. However, it is still far from clear how the high resolution and accurate external DEM affects the results of the StaMPS-PS (e.g., PS selection and deformation parameter calculation) on different platforms (X band TerraSAR, C band ENVISAT ASAR and L band ALOS/PALSAR1). In this study, abundant synthetic tests are performed to assess the influences of external DEMs on parameter estimations, such as the mean deformation rate and the deformation time-series. Real SAR images, covering Shenzhen city in China, are also selected to analyze the PS selection and distribution as well as to validate the results of synthetic tests. The results show that the PS points selected by the 5 m TanDEM-X DEM are 10.32%, 4.25% and 0.34% more than those selected by the 30 m SRTM DEM at X, C and L bands SAR platforms, respectively, when a multi-look geocoding operation is adopted for X band in the SRTM DEM case. We also find that the influences of external DEMs on the mean deformation rate are not significant and are inversely proportional to the wavelength of the satellite platforms. The standard deviations of the mean deformation rate difference for the X, C and L bands are 0.54, 0.30 and 0.10 mm/year, respectively. Similarly, the influences of external DEMs on the deformation time-series estimation for the three platforms are also slight, except for local artifacts whose root-mean-square error (RMSE) ≥6 mm.

The dam is located on the Tigris river and is the biggest hydraulic structure in Iraq. From a geological point of view the dam foundation is unstable due to the underlying geology that is formed by alternate and variable strata of highly soluble materials such as gypsum, anhydrite, marl and limestone. Here we present the first comprehensive multi-sensor cumulative deformation map for the dam generated from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from the Italian constellation COSMO-SkyMed and the European Sentinel-1a satellite. We compared 2014-2016 data to an historic dataset spanning 2004-2010 acquired with the Envisat ASAR sensor. We found that deformation was rapid during 2004-2010, slowed down in 2012-2014, and restarted in August 2014 when grouting operations stopped due to the temporary capture of the dam by the self proclaimed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). We took advantage of the availability of data from multiple SAR satellites to infer the deformation at the dam in great spatial and temporal detail and shed new light on the processes of the ongoing destabilization. This study highlights how new constellations of SAR sensors together with the availability of historical datasets are leading to important advances in deformation monitoring of small scale geologic and manmade features. © 2017 IEEE.","","Dam; DInSAR; Infrastructure monitoring; Multi-temporal analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041832337"

The most accurate and widespread monitoring method to measure displacements is leveling, a point-like surveying technique that typically allows for tens of discrete in situ sub-millimeter measures per squared kilometer. Another emerging technique for mapping soil deformation is the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, which is based on SAR images acquired from orbiting satellites. This remote sensing technique can provide better spatial point density than leveling, more extensive spatial coverage and lower-cost acquisitions. This paper analyses, compares and discusses leveling and advanced multi-temporal InSAR measurements when they are used to measure the soil deformation induced by the dewatering associated with underground constructions in urban areas. This comparison, which has not been considered in previous works, is of paramount importance to ascertain the most suitable technique (or combination of techniques) in these contexts. To do so, an experiment was performed in the future railway station of La Sagrera, Barcelona (Spain), in which leveling and advanced multi-temporal InSAR were used to quantify ground deformation by dewatering. The results showed that soil displacements measured by leveling and InSAR were not always consistent. In the context of soil deformation measurements produced by dewatering in urban areas, InSAR measurements appear to be more accurate for investigating soil deformation, whereas leveling was more appropriate for quantifying the real impact on the nearby buildings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Spain; Deformation; Dewatering; Historic preservation; Interferometry; Leveling (machinery); Railroad stations; Railroads; Remote sensing; Soil surveys; Soils; Surveys; Existing structure; Ground deformations; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Land surveys; Multi-temporal; Orbiting satellites; Remote sensing techniques; Underground construction; dewatering; interferometry; leveling; monitoring; soil mechanics; synthetic aperture radar; underground construction; urban area; Synthetic aperture radar","Advanced multi-temporal InSAR; Dewatering; Interferometry; Land survey; Leveling; Underground construction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009084252"

We processed 26 time series TerraSAR-X images in Shanghai and focused on the temporal-spatial analysis of the subsidence along the road networks. In the space, the overall land subsiding characteristics of road network was first demonstrated, and then the detailed subsidence detail and the subsidence driving force of the typical road. In the temporal time, we discussed the temperature variation associated with temporal displacements of asphalt pavement and verified the accuracy of the results. The results show the settlement of Shanghai road network is mainly distributed in Pudong district, which is associated with the density of roads.

In order to solve these problems, a novel automatic and unsupervised change detection approach based on multi-temporal full PolSAR images is presented in this paper. The proposed method integrates the advantages of the test statistic, generalized statistical region merging (GSRM), and generalized Gaussian mixture model (GMM) techniques. It involves three main steps: (1) the difference image (DI) is obtained by the likelihood-ratio parameter based on a test statistic; (2) the GSRM method is applied to the DI; and (3) the DI, after segmentation, is automatically analyzed by the generalized GMM to generate the change detection map. The generalized GMM is derived under a non-Gaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of the changed and unchanged classes, and automatically identifies the optimal number of components. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated with multi-temporal PolSAR images acquired by Radarsat-2 over the city of Wuhan in China.

At this test site we use data from three different SAR sensors: ALOS PALSAR, Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. The forest disturbance maps are validated by visual interpretation and compared to the Landsat based Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alerts available from Global Forest Watch. Change mapping accuracies for plots larger than 0.5 ha are very high: 76% for ALOS PALSAR, 96% for TerraSAR-X and 98% for Sentinel-1. For Sentinel-1, producer accuracies were derived for different forest disturbance types. The overall accuracy is 81.8%, with highest values for deforestation in oil palm plantations and burnt areas. The results are similar to the accuracy of the Humid Tropical Forest Disturbance Alert layer, which detects 85.6% of all reference areas.

The multi-temporal set of 19 TanDEM-X interferometric pairs and the 90th percentile forest height maps are derived from Airborne LiDAR Scanning (ALS), covering an area of 2211 ha of forests over Estonia.

Use of an advanced model with multiple parameters is not always justified when modeling the volume decorrelation in the boreal and hemiboreal forests. The proposed set of semi-empirical models, show higher robustness compared to a more advanced RVoG model under a range of seasonal and environmental conditions during data acquisition.

Advanced remote sensing is crucial to support cost-effective emergency response activities for disaster risk assessment and management. This preliminary study, as an effort to propose a good case study in risk management, suggested that three main steps, i.e., filtering, fusing and classifying, should be adopted to perform change detection before and after a natural disaster. We fused very high-spatial-resolution multi-temporal optical images (0.6 m spatial resolution) and X-band SAR images (2.5 m spatial resolution). The study also revealed that the decision-level method, i.e. morphological transform, was the most promising in image fusion of filtered images to classify urban surfaces in tsunami damage assessment, compared with the pixel-level method, i.e. wavelet transform, and feature-level method, i.e. segmentation extraction. This paper reports, coupled with the results from the image fusion, that the preliminary results are good enough to obtain urban impervious surface estimation of a wide disaster risk area but not good enough to make clear amplitude images to identify individual buildings of dwelling zone. The proposed normalized change index (NCI), an important indicator for detecting changes, was found capable of providing better estimation of urban impervious surfaces, such as transport-related land (e.g., bridges and parking lots) and building roof tops in residential and industrial areas over a coastal zone in Rikuzen-takada City, devastated in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake. © 2016 IEEE.","Cost effectiveness; Damage detection; Data fusion; Disasters; Emergency services; Geometrical optics; Housing; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Signal detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; Urban transportation; Wavelet transforms; Disaster risk assessments; Disaster risk reductions; Emergency response; Great east japan earthquakes; Spatial resolution; Supervised change detection; Urban impervious surfaces; Very high spatial resolutions; Image fusion","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978484357"

To reduce strong fluctuations due to speckle, total variation (TV) regularization has been proposed by several authors to smooth out noise without blurring edges. A specificity of SAR images is the presence of strong scatterers having a radiometry several orders of magnitude larger than their surrounding region. These scatterers, especially present in urban areas, limit the effectiveness of TV regularization as they break the assumption of an image made of regions of constant radiometry. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this paper an image decomposition approach. There exist numerous methods to decompose an image into several components, notably to separate textural and geometrical information. These decomposition models are generally recast as energy minimization problems involving a different penalty term for each of the components. In this framework, we propose an energy suitable for the decomposition of SAR images into speckle, a smooth background, and strong scatterers, and discuss its minimization using max-flow/min-cut algorithms. We make the connection between the minimization problem considered, involving the L0 pseudonorm, and the generalized likelihood ratio test used in detection theory. The proposed decomposition jointly performs the detection of strong scatterers and the estimation of the background radiometry. Given the increasing availability of time series of SAR images, we consider the decomposition of a whole time series. New change detection methods can be based on the temporal analysis of the components obtained from our decomposition. © 2016 IEEE.","Radiometry; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Decomposition model; Energy minimization problem; Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test; Geometrical informations; Minimization problems; Multi-temporal SAR images; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Total variation regularization; image analysis; radar imagery; scattering; speckle; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Change detection; image decomposition; L0; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); total variation (TV)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973915297"

Co-polarized C-band microwave backscatter (HH or VV) and the co-polarization ratio (HH/VV) are the most commonly used data sets for rice mapping due to their high data availability while the utilization of cross-polarized backscatter (HV or VH) has received less attention. In this study, Sentinel 1A time series – acquired in the dual-polarized (VV/VH) Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode during the spring growing season (October 2015 to March 2016) in the Mekong Delta – were used to analyse the relationship between the growing cycle of rice plants and the temporal variation of SAR backscatter at different polarizations. Results show that VH backscatter is more sensitive to rice growth than VV backscatter. Several vegetation phenological parameters including beginning date, heading date and the length of the growing season were extracted from the VH backscatter time series. A decision tree approach was applied to delineate rice-cultivated areas based on seasonal phenological parameters. The classification result was validated against a 2015 land use map.

In this study we classify reed belts and monitor their phenological changes at a natural lake in northeastern Germany using dual-co-polarized (HH, VV) TerraSAR-X time series. The time series comprises 19 images, acquired between August 2014 and May 2015, in ascending and descending orbit. We calculated different polarimetric indices using the HH and VV intensities, the dual-polarimetric coherency matrix including dominant and mean alpha scattering angles, and entropy and anisotropy (normalized eigenvalue difference) as well as combinations of entropy and anisotropy for the analysis of the scattering scenarios. The image classifications were performed with the random forest classifier and validated with high-resolution digital orthophotos. The time series analysis of the reed belts revealed significant seasonal changes for the double-bounce-sensitive parameters (intensity ratio HH/VV and intensity difference HH-VV, the co-polarimetric coherence phase and the dominant and mean alpha scattering angles) and in the dual-polarimetric coherence (amplitude), anisotropy, entropy, and anisotropy-entropy combinations; whereas in summer dense leaves cause volume scattering, in winter, after leaves have fallen, the reed stems cause predominately double-bounce scattering. Our study showed that the five most important parameters for the classification of reed are the intensity difference HH-VV, the mean alpha scattering angle, intensity ratio HH/VV, and the coherence (phase). Due to the better separation of reed and other vegetation (deciduous forest, coniferous forest, meadow), winter acquisitions are preferred for the mapping of reed. Multi-temporal stacks of winter images performed better than summer ones. The combination of ascending and descending images also improved the result as it reduces the influence of the sensor look direction. However, in this study, only an accuracy of ~50% correct classified reed areas was reached. Whereas the shorelines with reed areas (> 10 m broad) could be detected correctly, the actual reed areas were significantly overestimated. The main source of error is probably the challenging data geocoding causing geolocation inaccuracies, which need to be solved in future studies. © 2016 by the authors.","Anisotropy; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Ellipsometry; Entropy; Forestry; Mapping; Monitoring; Polarimeters; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Wetlands; North-eastern germany; Randomforest; Reed; SAR polarimetry; TerraSAR-X; Coherent scattering","Classification; Monitoring; Northeastern Germany; Randomforest; Reed; SAR polarimetry; TerraSAR-X; Wetlands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014052346"

In the present study, topographically corrected Medium Resolution ScanSAR (MRS) data of Indian RISAT-1 acquired during 2015-16 and global SAR mosaic products in HH/HV polarizations produced from Japanese ALOS-PALSAR 1/2 data for the years 2007-10 and 2015-16 were used to retrieve temporal forest AGB of Gujarat through semi-empirical model based on multi-linear regression coefficients of HH and HV polarization backscatter with field measured forest biomass. Gujarat has four major forest types namely, (1) tropical moist deciduous forest, (2) littoral and swamp forest, (3) tropical dry deciduous forest and (4) northern tropical thorn forest. Different model coefficients were derived for these forest types based on extensive ground measured forest parameters and the biomass maps of Gujarat were generated. High correlations were observed between HV and HH/HV with field measured biomass over different forest vegetation types with biomass densities ranging from 20-120 t/ha.

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunflower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described.

These constellations offer the advantage of reduced revisit times, providing low-latency data that enable analysis that can identify infrastructure instability and dynamic deformation processes. In this paper we use COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) data to monitor seasonal induced deformation at the Pertusillo dam (Basilicata, Italy) using multi-temporal SAR data analysis. We analyzed 198 images spanning 2010–2015 using a coherent and incoherent PS approach to merge COSMO-SkyMed adjacent tracks and TerraSAR-X acquisitions, respectively. We used hydrostatic-seasonal-temporal (HST) and hydrostatic-temperature-temporal (HTT) models to interpret the non-linear deformation at the dam wall using ground measurements together with SAR time-series analysis. Different look geometries allowed us to characterize the horizontal deformation field typically observed at dams. Within the limits of our models and the SAR acquisition sampling we found that most of the deformation at the Pertusillo dam can be explained by taking into account only thermal seasonal dilation and hydrostatic pressure. The different models show slightly different results when interpreting the aging term at the dam wall. The results highlight how short-revisit SAR satellites in combination with models widely used in the literature for interpreting pendulum and GPS data can be used for supporting structural health monitoring and provide valuable information to ground users directly involved in field measurements. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Basilicata; Italy; Pertusillo Lake; Potenza; COSMO-SkyMed; dam; GPS; modeling; monitoring system; radar interferometry; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; time series analysis","Dam; HST and HTT model; Interferometry; SAR; Time-series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997771283"

One of the most important problems associated with flood monitoring is the difficulty to determine the extent of the flood area as even a dense network of observations cannot provide such information. The flood extent information is used for damage assessment and risk management. The use of optical imagery for flood monitoring is limited by the presence of clouds. In turn, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements from space are independent of daytime and weather conditions and can provide valuable information to monitor flood events. This is mainly due to the fact that smooth water surface provides no return to antenna in microwave spectrum and appears black in SAR imagery. This study explored large inundation areas in the Idukki Reservoir in Kerala state. Sentinel-1A image with C-band and dual-polarization capability (HH+HV or VV+VH) was used in the study. This study aims to analyses Sentinel-1 SAR data for its potential to map standing water in the Idukki reservoir.15 SAR images of Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) C-band (5.405 GHz) collected in the Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode -during the period from January 2016 to December 2016 - were used to develop a procedure for reliable processing.

Owing to the all-weather response capability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become a key tool for collapse interpretation. As the requirement for multitemporal data is usually not satisfied in practice, interpretation using only postevent SAR imagery is indispensable for emergency rescue. Despite being found that texture has a relationship with building damage, only a few texture measures have been adopted using simple threshold criteria. To fully explore the spatial contextual information in very high resolution (VHR) SAR images, there are two questions that should be discussed: 1) Which textural features are helpful for collapse assessment? 2) How do diverse imaging configurations influence the interpretation? In response, five texture descriptors are used for the stricken area texture extraction in this paper, and a random forests classifier is applied to identify the building collapse level. It was found that most of the gray-level histogram features perform quite well, and several other primitive features, such as the isolated bright points originating from scattered rubble, can also help to discriminate different collapse levels. Moreover, the experiments with data from the Yushu earthquake of April 14, 2010, indicated that spatial detail quality is the key for texture interpretation, and the span image can be considered as an appropriate choice when VHR PolSAR data are available. The optimal interpretation results (with an overall accuracy of 84.7%) were obtained using the 122 proposed measures in a VHR X-band image. © 2016 IEEE.","Decision trees; Decision trees; Earthquakes; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Geophysics; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Contextual information; Contextual information; Earth observation techniques; Earth observation techniques; Imaging configurations; Imaging configurations; Multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal data; Response capability; Response capability; Texture descriptors; Texture descriptors; Texture information; Texture information; Very high resolution; Very high resolution; building; data interpretation; earthquake damage; hazard assessment; image classification; image resolution; radar imagery; synthetic aperture radar; urban area; Radar imaging; Radar imaging","Building collapse; earthquake; postevent; random forests (RFs); synthetic aperture radar (SAR); texture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978888897"

This paper presents results obtained by using Multi-temporal InSAR techniques with high resolution TerraSARX (TSX) data for monitoring the Carlantino landslide, located in the Daunian Subapennine (Apulia region, southern Italy) on a slope overlooking a water reservoir, and subjected to several investigations and consolidation works. The targets detected by using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) correspond to urban structures or peri-urban walls and guard rails, while the landslide body is almost completely devoid of stable targets, due to the widespread vegetation and variable land cover. To allow stability monitoring, a network of six Corner Reflectors (CR) was designed and deployed over the landslide test site. The TSX images were analyzed by using both the PSI processing and a procedure, based on the double difference analysis of InSAR phase values on the CR pixels. Despite residual noise and the loss of 2 CRs due to vandalism, the processing allowed verifying the stability of the upper and central part of the landslide body, and relating indirectly the movements at the toe of the landslide to the water level fluctuations of the reservoir. Finally, this experiment suggests some recommendations and guidelines in planning CR deployment in complex landslide sites. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Italy; Puglia; data processing; environmental monitoring; equipment; kinematics; landslide; pixel; radar interferometry; risk assessment; satellite data; satellite imagery; signal-to-noise ratio; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; vegetation cover; water level","Corner Reflectors; Landslide monitoring; Risk mitigation; Space-borne InSAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006355973"

For such reason, a considerable interest towards innovative approaches useful to provide information on their evolution and on the interaction with existing buildings has grown among the scientific community and land management institutions. To this purpose, the combined use of C-band satellites and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors, has been successfully applied in several analyses aimed at the detection of spatial and temporal effects, in term of building's damage induced by landslides. This work provides a general approach useful to investigate, at different levels of detail, the cause-effect relationship. The proposed methodology has been applied to the urban settlement of Moio della Civitella (Salerno province, Italy), whose whole territory is affected by several slow-moving landslides. C and X-band SAR data (acquired between 2002 and 2014), integrated with field survey of structural damage, enhanced an accurate examination of landslide effects on the urban texture of Moio della Civitella. The results allowed to generate empirical fragility curves for buildings on the study area. These curves can be used as a tool to forecast the future likelihood of the damage occurrence. Finally, the behavior of a masonry building aggregate has been assessed analyzing Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) time-series pre-and post-repair intervention, thus providing information also about the efficacy of restoration works. © 2017 IEEE.","Buildings; Damage detection; Interferometry; Landslides; Radar; Restoration; Structural analysis; Weather satellites; Cause-effect relationships; damage; Differential SAR interferometry; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Fragility curves; Innovative approaches; Interferometric data; X-band synthetic aperture radars; Synthetic aperture radar","buildings vulnerability; damage; Differential SAR Interferometry; fragility curves; slow-moving landslides","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034861066"

High-resolution SAR data offers a chance to reveal impressive details of large-scale man-made linear features (LMLFs) with Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) analysis. Despite these advantages, research validating highresolution MT-InSAR results along high-speed railways with high spatial and temporal density leveling data is limited. This paper explored the monitoring ability of high-resolution MT-InSAR in an experiment along Jingjin Inter-City Railway, located in Tianjin, China. Validation between these MT-InSAR results and a high spatial/temporal density leveling measurement was conducted. A total of 37 TSX images spanning half a year were processed for MT-InSAR analysis. The distance between two consecutive leveling points is 60 m along Jingjin Inter-City railway and the time interval of the study was about one month. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) index of average subsidence rate comparison between MT-InSAR results and leveling data was 3.28 mm/yr, with 34 points, and that of the displacement comparison was 2.90 mm with 464 valid observations. The experimental results along Jingjin Inter-City railway showed a high correlation between these two distinct measurements. These analyses show that millimeter accuracy can be achieved with MTInSAR analysis when monitoring subsidence along a high-speed railway. We discuss the possible reason for the subsiding center, and the characteristics of both leveling and MT-InSAR results. We propose further planning for the monitoring of subsidence over LMLFs. © 2017 by the authors.","Mean square error; Monitoring; Railroad engineering; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Satellites; Subsidence; Transportation; High - speed railways; High-density leveling campaign; Multi-temporal; Subsidence monitoring; TerraSAR-X; Validation; Synthetic aperture radar","High-density leveling campaign; High-speed railway; Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR); Subsidence monitoring; TerraSAR-X; Validation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022335511"

The study area was selected in major cotton and groundnut producing districts of Gujarat state which accounts for 85-90% of total area. The SAR (C -band) backscatter is the function of temporal behavior due to interaction of microwave radiation with soil moisture, soil roughness, soil type and other crop parameters including crop canopy and volume scattering increasing from the early vegetative stage to harvesting stage and the backscattering of different region for both HH and HV polarizations. The change in backscatter of the order of 2 to 4 dB in C-band was observed. Cotton and groundnut crops were classified based on backscatter values and cotton was further classified in desi (indigenous) cotton, early sown, timely sown and late sown category for hybrid cotton depending on its time of sowing. Variation in backscatter profile with respect to sowing time was observed depending on rainfall availability in different regions. Hierarchical decision rule model based on the temporal evaluation of SAR backscatter was attempted to classify cotton, groundnut and other land covers achieved about 89 per cent accuracy in the case of cotton and about 85 per cent for groundnut. This output was very consistent in the irrigated tracts of Gujarat for cotton crop. This methodology would be crucial for monitoring and early estimation of cotton area in the country and cotton-groundnut discrimination when cloud free optical data is a major hindrance to the crop inventory. © 2017, Association of Agrometeorologists.

Four test sites on the German North Sea coast were chosen, which represent typical surface compositions of different sediments, vegetation, and habitats, and of which a large amount of SAR is used for our analyses. Both Freeman-Durden and Cloude-Pottier polarimetric decomposition are utilized, and an additional descriptor called Double-Bounce Eigenvalue Relative Difference (DERD) is introduced into the feature sets instead of the original polarimetric intensity channels. The classification is conducted following Random Forest theory, and the results are verified using ground truth data from field campaigns and an existing classification based on optical imagery. In addition, the use of Kennaugh elements for classification purposes is demonstrated using both fully and dual-polarization multi-frequency and multi-temporal SAR data.

The prompt assessment of its conditions is critical for diagnosis and decision making especially under threats of climate change. With the recent availability of C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1, a 6320-m2 rice paddy field employing farmer's practice in Argao, Cebu, Philippines was monitored, such that its growth can be modeled from the satellite's backscatter readings. The multi-temporal backscatter of rice and its polarimetric difference were compared with reference surfaces. The results have shown that in terms of vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH) polarized backscatter magnitude alone, rice cannot be differentiated from the other reference surfaces. However in terms of its trend over time, rice can be identified using its unique specular signature during land preparation. The polarimetric difference (VV-VH and VH-VV) was also found to be a better metric in identifying rice areas. The results have shown that canopy height and hill diameter are highly correlated with the VH polarized backscatter with R2 values equal to 0.74 and 0.65, respectively. The other biophysical parameters (i.e. number of tillers, crop height, hill diameter) measured in situ did not correlate well with backscatter and its polarimetric difference. Sentinel-1 has the potential to detect small vegetative differences at closely-located ground truth (GT) points. It is recommended that further studies be conducted in this area such that the use of Sentinel-1 as an agricultural monitoring tool be maximized. © 2017 ACRS.

Two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) are the non-stationary signal processing theory of multi-scale transform. According to their implementation process and SAR image characteristic, this paper proposed a new multi-temporal SAR image change detection method based on the combination of the stationary wavelet transform and the bi-dimensional intrinsic mode function (BIMF) features, called SWT-BIMF algorithm. The contribution of the new algorithm includes two aspects. One is the design of the two selections of decomposition features, that is, the speckle noise filtering; another is the selected features to perform the enhance processing, so more effective change information will obtain. The feasibility of the SWT-BIMF algorithm is verified by the measured SAR image data, and good experimental results are obtained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Edge detection; Functions; Information filtering; Signal detection; Signal processing; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Wavelet decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Bi dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD); Information acquisitions; Intrinsic Mode functions; Multi-scale transforms; Multi-temporal SAR images; Nonstationary signal processing; Stationary wavelet transforms; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033681083"

Even large events may not leave records when they happen in remote areas or simply do not impact with vulnerable elements. This paper proposes a procedure to measure spatial autocorrelation changes induced by event landslides in a multi-temporal series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity Sentinel-1 images. The procedure first measures pixel-based changes between consecutive couples of SAR intensity images using the Log-Ratio index, then it follows the temporal evolution of the spatial autocorrelation inside the Log-Ratio layers using the Moran's I index and the semivariance. When an event occurs, the Moran's I index and the semivariance increase compared to the values measured before and after the event. The spatial autocorrelation growth is due to the local homogenization of the soil response caused by the event landslide. The emerging clusters of autocorrelated pixels generated by the event are localized by a process of optimal segmentation of the log-ratio layers. The procedure was used to intercept an event that occurred in August 2015 in Myanmar, Tozang area, when strong rainfall precipitations triggered a number of landslides. A prognostic use of the method promises to increase the availability of information about the number of events at the regional scale, and to facilitate the production of inventory maps, yielding useful results to study the phenomenon for model tuning, landslide forecast model validation, and the relationship between triggering factors and number of occurred events. © 2017 by the authors.","Autocorrelation; Landslides; Pixels; Spatial variables measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Landslide forecast; Multi-temporal SAR images; Multi-temporal series; Optimal segmentation; SAR intensity; Spatial autocorrelations; Temporal evolution; Triggering factors; Radar imaging","Event landslides; SAR intensity; Spatial autocorrelation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021164644"

In the proposed method, The Gauss filtering is combined with log-ratio to impair speckle. Then the difference map (DM) of Gauss-log ratio and the difference map of ratio based on Gabor feature are fused with shearlet transform. Meanwhile, DM is decomposed to low frequency image and four high frequency images, different fusion rules are used in multi-scales images respectively, the work of noise reduction is operated with mean filtering.

Lacking prior information of the cloudy areas, these methods are limited in reconstructing accuracy, especially when clouds lie on the boundaries of two types of landscapes. We propose a new method based on the inpanting method which take the SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images as a prior structure information of contaminated.

LCC maps derived from historical remote sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free moderate spatial resolution (~ 30 m) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC information from these images typically require “training data” for classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring. A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources (the OSM “landuse” and “natural” polygon datasets). A semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the 2007–2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2%, providing evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery, when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Laguna de Bay; Luzon; Philippines; Computer software maintenance; Data mining; Mapping; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Crowdsourced geodata; OpenStreetMap; Unsupervised classification; Volunteered geographic information; digital map; land cover; Landsat; mapping method; PALSAR; satellite imagery; unsupervised classification; urban region; Classification (of information)","Change detection; Crowdsourced geodata; OpenStreetMap; Semi-unsupervised classification; Synthetic aperture radar; Volunteered geographic information","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014109775"

Because of their complex community structure and rich surface vegetation, deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps are considered to be one of the most difficult types of wetland to classify. In this research, with the support of remote sensing and geographic information system, multi-temporal radar images L-Palsar were used initially to extract the forest hydrological layer and phenology phase change layer as two variables through image analysis. Second, based on the environmental characteristics of forested swamps, three decision tree classifiers derived from the two variables were constructed to explore effective methods to identify deciduous broad-leaved forested swamps. Third, this study focused on analyzing the classification process between flat-forests, which are the most severely disturbed elements, and forested swamps. Finally, the application of the decision tree model will be discussed. The results showed that: 1) L-HH band (a L band with wavelength of 0–235 m in HH polarization mode; HH means Synthetic Aperture Radars transmit pulses in horizontal polarization and receive in horizontal polarization) in the leaf-off season is shown to be capable of detecting hydrologic conditions beneath the forest; 2) the accuracy of the classification (forested swamp and forest plat) was 81.5% based on hydrologic features, and 83.5% was achieved by combining hydrologic features and phenology response features, which indicated that hydrological characteristics under the forest played a key role. The HHOJ (refers to the band created by the subtraction with HH band in October and HH band in July) achieved by multi-temporal radar images did improve the classification accuracy, but not significantly, and more leaf-off radar images may be more efficient than multi-seasonal radar images for inland forested swamp mapping; 3) the lower separability between forested swamps dominated by vegetated surfaces and forest plat covered with litter was the main cause of the uncertainty in classification, which led to misleading interpretations of the pixel-based classification. Finally, through the analysis with kappa coefficients, it was shown that the value of the intersection point was an ideal choice for the variable. © 2016, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","ALOS; broad-leaved forest; deciduous forest; image analysis; mapping; PALSAR; phenology; radar imagery; swamp forest","decision tree classifier; forest hydrological characteristics; forested swamp; multi-temporal technique; Palsar radar images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961150327"

So far, most of the decision fusion techniques developed for the remote sensing applications have the drawback of assuming conditional independence between the classification results and integrates only two sensor data. The proposed Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (MFCP) algorithm is rooted in the Baye's theorem and is the extended version of the Fusion of Correlated Probabilities (FCP) method by accounting for the cross conditional dependence between three multi-sensor information sources. At first, this dependence (or correlation) structure is efficiently formulated from the binary classification results of SVM by considering three sensor data and then finally used as weighting parameters in the proposed novel MFCP based fusion method. The proposed MFCP based fusion method is assessed in the multi-sensor land cover classification over the Beijing area. The data sets used consisted of two optical data sets (i.e., Landsat TM and CBERS) and one multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data set. We evaluated and validated our proposed methodology by comparing it with four existing fusion methods, i.e., Max rule based decision fusion method, Consensus theory based decision fusion method, SVM based decision fusion method and Tau model based decision fusion method. To further validate the effectiveness of the proposed MFCP based fusion method, we performed a significance test for kappa's between different fusion results. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed MFCP based fusion method outperformed all the compared fusion methods that do not take into account the cross conditional dependence between classifications, in terms of overall accuracy, kappa and class wise accuracies. © 2016 IEEE.","Data mining; Decision theory; Knowledge based systems; Observatories; Probability; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Conditional dependence; Conditional independences; Correlated probability; Decision fusion; Land cover classification; Multi-sensor information; Remote sensing applications; Significance test; Sensor data fusion","Cross conditional dependence; Decision fusion; Multi-sensor Fusion of Correlated Probabilities; significance test for kappa","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988036811"

Such a high accuracy can be achieved through geometric coregistration, using precise satellite orbits and a digital elevation model, followed by a refinement step using a time-series analysis of coregistration errors. These errors represent the misregistration between all TOPS acquisitions relative to the reference coordinate system. We develop a workflow to estimate the time series of azimuth misregistration using a network-based enhanced spectral diversity (NESD) approach, in order to reduce the impact of temporal decorrelation on coregistration. Example time series of misregistration inferred for five tracks of Sentinel-1 TOPS acquisitions indicates a maximum relative azimuth misregistration of less than 0.01 of the full azimuth resolution between the TOPS acquisitions in the studied areas. Standard deviation of the estimated misregistration time series for different stacks varies from 1.1e-3 to 2e-3 of the azimuth resolution, equivalent to 1.6-2.8 cm orbital uncertainty in the azimuth direction. These values fall within the 1-sigma orbital uncertainty of the Sentinel-1 orbits and imply that orbital uncertainty is most likely the main source of the constant azimuth misregistration between different TOPS acquisitions. We propagate the uncertainty of individual misregistration estimated with ESD to the misregistration time series estimated with NESD and investigate the different challenges for operationalizing NESD. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Harmonic analysis; Orbits; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Uncertainty analysis; Coregistration; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal analysis; Precise satellite orbit; Reference coordinate system; Spectral diversity; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS); accuracy assessment; algorithm; coordinate; data acquisition; digital elevation model; image processing; interferometry; pixel; satellite data; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis; Time series analysis","Coregistration; interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); spectral diversity; terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013173978"

The proposed approach exploits a discrete wavelet transform fusion strategy aimed at achieving the optimal difference image from the mean-ratio and log-ratio difference images. The generated binary change map (CM), by applying a thresholding method on the fused difference image, is used as the initial contour to produce a final CM on fused difference image using the LSM. Several non-fuzzy and fuzzy thresholding methods are considered to assess the generation of the initial contour for the LS segmentation. To indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are implemented on 2 sets of multitemporal SAR images from TerraSAR-X and ERS–2 satellites, respectively.

We propose the MHYSAN model (Modèle de bilan HYdrique des Sols Agricoles Nus) for simulating soil water balance of bare soils. This model was used to simulate surface evaporation fluxes and SM content at daily time scale over a semi-arid, bare agricultural site in Tunisia (North Africa). Two main approaches are considered in this study. Firstly, the MHYSAN model was successfully calibrated for seven sites using continuous thetaprobe measurements at two depths. Then the possibility to extrapolate local SM simulations at distant sites, based on soil texture similarity only, was tested. This extrapolation was assessed using SAR estimates and manual thetaprobe measurements of SM recorded at these distant sites. The results reveal a bias of approximately 0.63% and 3.04%, and an RMSE equal to 6.11% and 4.5%, for the SAR volumetric SM and manual thetaprobe measurements, respectively. In a second approach, the MHYSAN model was calibrated using seven very high-resolution SAR (TerraSAR-X) SM outputs ranging over only two months. The simulated SM were validated using continuous thetaprobe measurements during 15 months. Although the SM was measured on only seven different dates for the purposes of calibration, satisfactory results were obtained as a result of the wide range of SM values recorded in these seven images. This led to good overall calibration of the soil parameters, thus demonstrating the considerable potential of Sentinel-1 images for daily soil moisture monitoring using simple models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Tunisia; agricultural land; bare soil; calibration; hydrological modeling; image analysis; model validation; soil moisture; soil texture; TerraSAR-X","Bare soil hydrological model; Continuous soil moisture measurements; Satellite soil moisture products; Semi-arid area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007164476"

This model was used to simulate surface evaporation fluxes and soil moisture content (SMC) at daily time scale over a semi-arid, bare agricultural site in Tunisia (North Africa). The MHYSAN model was calibrated using seven very high-resolution SAR (TerraSAR-X) SM outputs ranging over only two months. Then, the simulated SM was validated using continuous thetaprobe measurements during 15 months. The high performances observed could be explained by the fact that although images were acquired during a short time range, the important soil moisture variation captured allowed a good calibration of the soil parameters.

The fact that this uplifting trend of the second decade is well correlated with hydrogeological data of the area that show a synchronous rise of the aquifer level, verifies the dominating driver of the human factor concerning the land subsidence phenomena taking place the last 55 years.

A valuable information source for such a procedure can be remote sensing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. However, flood scenarios are typical examples of complex situations in which different factors have to be considered to provide accurate and robust interpretation of the situation on the ground. For this reason, a data fusion approach of remote sensing data with ancillary information can be particularly useful. In this paper, a Bayesian network is proposed to integrate remotely sensed data, such as multitemporal SAR intensity images and interferometric-SAR coherence data, with geomorphic and other ground information. The methodology is tested on a case study regarding a flood that occurred in the Basilicata region (Italy) on December 2013, monitored using a time series of COSMO-SkyMed data. It is shown that the synergetic use of different information layers can help to detect more precisely the areas affected by the flood, reducing false alarms and missed identifications which may affect algorithms based on data from a single source. The produced flood maps are compared to data obtained independently from the analysis of optical images; the comparison indicates that the proposed methodology is able to reliably follow the temporal evolution of the phenomenon, assigning high probability to areas most likely to be flooded, in spite of their heterogeneous temporal SAR/InSAR signatures, reaching accuracies of up to 89%. © 2016 IEEE.","Basilicata; Italy; Bayesian networks; Complex networks; Data fusion; Floods; Geometrical optics; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Information layers; Information sources; Interferometric SAR; Multi-temporal SAR; Remote sensing data; Remotely sensed data; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Temporal evolution; accuracy assessment; Bayesian analysis; COSMO-SkyMed; data acquisition; detection method; flood; geomorphology; heterogeneity; interferometry; mapping method; methodology; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; synthetic aperture radar; temporal evolution; time series analysis; Radar imaging","Bayesian networks (BNs); data fusion; flood mapping; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/interferometric SAR (InSAR) time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960540109"

Rollinvariant polarimetric features such as iH/Ani/<span styleCombining double low line""text-decoration: overline"">α</span>/Span are commonly adopted in PolSAR land cover classification. However, target orientation diversity effect makes PolSAR images understanding and interpretation difficult. Only using the roll-invariant polarimetric features may introduce ambiguity in the interpretation of targets' scattering mechanisms and limit the followed classification accuracy. To address this problem, this work firstly focuses on hidden polarimetric feature mining in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight using the recently reported uniform polarimetric matrix rotation theory and the visualization and characterization tool of polarimetric coherence pattern. The former rotates the acquired polarimetric matrix along the radar line of sight and fully describes the rotation characteristics of each entry of the matrix. Sets of new polarimetric features are derived to describe the hidden scattering information of the target in the rotation domain. The latter extends the traditional polarimetric coherence at a given rotation angle to the rotation domain for complete interpretation. A visualization and characterization tool is established to derive new polarimetric features for hidden information exploration. Then, a classification scheme is developed combing both the selected new hidden polarimetric features in rotation domain and the commonly used roll-invariant polarimetric features with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Comparison experiments based on AIRSAR and multi-temporal UAVSAR data demonstrate that compared with the conventional classification scheme which only uses the roll-invariant polarimetric features, the proposed classification scheme achieves both higher classification accuracy and better robustness. For AIRSAR data, the overall classification accuracy with the proposed classification scheme is 94.91 %, while that with the conventional classification scheme is 93.70 %. Moreover, for multi-temporal UAVSAR data, the averaged overall classification accuracy with the proposed classification scheme is up to 97.08 %, which is much higher than the 87.79 % from the conventional classification scheme. Furthermore, for multitemporal PolSAR data, the proposed classification scheme can achieve better robustness. The comparison studies also clearly demonstrate that mining and utilization of hidden polarimetric features and information in the rotation domain can gain the added benefits for PolSAR land cover classification and provide a new vision for PolSAR image interpretation and application. © Authors 2017.","","Land Cover Classification; Polarimetric Feature Mining; Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR); Rotation Domain; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031011227"

The discrimination capability of observations acquired by these sensors can be used for land cover classification and mapping. The aim of this paper is to propose an optimized kernel-based C-means clustering algorithm for agriculture crop mapping from multi-temporal PolSAR data. Firstly, several polarimetric features are extracted from preprocessed data. These features are linear polarization intensities, and several statistical and physical based decompositions such as Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi techniques. Then, the kernelized version of hard and fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms are applied to these polarimetric features in order to identify crop types. The kernel function, unlike the conventional partitioning clustering algorithms, simplifies the non-spherical and non-linearly patterns of data structure, to be clustered easily. In addition, in order to enhance the results, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to tune the kernel parameters, cluster centers and to optimize features selection. The efficiency of this method was evaluated by using multi-temporal UAVSAR L-band images acquired over an agricultural area near Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, during June and July in 2012. The results demonstrate more accurate crop maps using the proposed method when compared to the classical approaches, (e.g. 12% improvement in general). In addition, when the optimization technique is used, greater improvement is observed in crop classification, e.g. 5% in overall. Furthermore, a strong relationship between Freeman-Durden volume scattering component, which is related to canopy structure, and phenological growth stages is observed. © 2017","Canada; Manitoba; Winnipeg; accuracy assessment; algorithm; canopy; cluster analysis; crop; phenology; resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; vegetation mapping","Crop mapping; Kernel-based C-means clustering; Multi-temporal; Polarimetric decompositions; Polarimetric SAR data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041470067"

Satellite imagery is extremely valuable source of data to provide crop maps in a timely way at moderate and high spatial resolution. Information on parcel boundaries that takes into account the spatial context may improve the quality of maps compared to pixel-based classification approaches. In general, parcels may contain several plots with different crops and such situations should be taken into account when using parcel boundaries. In this paper, we aim to compare pixel-based and parcel-based approaches to crop classification frommultitemporal optical (Landsat-8) and synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 imagery. For this, we propose a parcel-based approach that involves a pixel-based classification map and specifically designed rules to account for several plots within parcel.

To take necessary actions to rehabilitate abandoned agricultural lands, the identification of the spatial distribution of these lands must be acknowledged. While optical images had previously illustrated potentials in the identification of agricultural land abandonment, tropical areas often suffer cloud coverage problem that limits the availability of the imageries. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the potential of ALOS-1 and 2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 and 2) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images for the identification and classification of abandoned agricultural crop areas, namely paddy, rubber and oil palm fields. Distinct crop phenology for paddy and rubber was identified from ALOS-1 PALSAR; nonetheless, oil palm did not demonstrate any useful phenology for discriminating between the abandoned classes. The accuracy obtained for these abandoned lands of paddy, rubber and oil palm was 93.33% ± 0.06%, 78% ± 2.32% and 63.33% ± 1.88%, respectively. This study confirmed that the understanding of crop phenology in relation to image date selection is essential to obtain high accuracy for classifying abandoned and non-abandoned agricultural crops.

Here we focus on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), multi-temporal interferometry (MTI). With radar satellites periodically re-visiting the same area, MTI provides information on distance changes between the on-board radar sensor and the targets on the ground (e.g., human-made structures such as buildings, roads and other infrastructure). The detected distance changes are thus interpreted as evidence of ground and/or structure instability. In settings with limited vegetation cover, MTI can deliver very precise (mm resolution), spatially dense information (from hundreds to thousands measurement points/km2) on slow (mm-cm/year) deformations affecting the ground and engineering structures. Radar satellites offer wide-area coverage (thousands km2) and, with the sensors that actively emit electromagnetic radiation and thus can “see” through the clouds, one can obtain deformation measurements even under bad weather conditions. We illustrate the potential of high resolution MTI and explain what this technique can deliver to assist in infrastructure instability hazard assessment. This is done by presenting selected examples of MTI applied to monitor post-construction behavior of engineering structures. The examples are from Italy and include: an earthfill dam, an off-shore vertical breakwater built to protect an oil terminal, city buildings and a highway. We also stress that the current approach to the assessment of instability hazard can be transformed by capitalizing more on the presently underexploited advantage of the MTI technique, i.e., the capability to provide regularly spatially dense quantitative information for large areas where engineering infrastructure may currently be unaffected by instability, but where the terrain and infrastructure history (e.g., aging) may indicate potential for future failures. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","","Infrastructure instability; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Satellite interferometry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048586115"

In this method, multi-scale spatial features of an image are achieved by using the Gaussian pyramid analysis and combined into one visual saliency map by processing the center-surrounding difference maps. Then, the morphology theory and spatial characteristics of vehicles are exploited to detect salient locations in the saliency map. In the end, the salient locations between two saliency maps of the image pair are compared one by one and change detection of targets is acquired.

A reason for this is the impracticality of measuring ground instability associated with the many geohazard processes that are often hidden beneath buildings and are imperceptible to conventional geological survey detection techniques. Satellite radar interferometry, or InSAR, offers a remote sensing technique to map mm-scale ground deformation over wide areas given an archive of suitable multi-temporal data. The EC FP7 Space project named PanGeo (2011–2014), used InSAR to map areas of unstable ground in 52 of Europe's cities, representing ∼15% of the EU population. In partnership with Europe's national geological surveys, the PanGeo project developed a standardised geohazard-mapping methodology and recorded 1286 instances of 19 types of geohazard covering 18,000 km2. Presented here is an analysis of the results of the PanGeo-project output data, which provides insights into the distribution of European urban geohazards, their frequency and probability of occurrence.

Utilizing within-season multi-temporal optical and multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, this study introduces a combined object- and pixel-based image classification methodology for accurate crop-type classification. Particularly, the study investigates the improvement of crop-type classification by using the least number of multi-temporal RapidEye (RE) images and multi-polarization Radarsat-2 (RS-2) data utilized in an object- and pixel-based image analysis framework. The method was tested on a study area in Manitoba, Canada, using three different classifiers including the standard Maximum Likelihood (ML), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Using only two RE images of July and August, the proposed method results in overall accuracies (OAs) of about 95%, 78%, and 93% for the ML, DT, and RF classifiers, respectively. Moreover, the use of only two quad-pol images of RS-2 of June and September resulted in OAs of 92%, 75%, and 90% for the ML, DT, and RF classifiers, respectively. The best classification results were achieved by the synergistic use of two RE and two RS-2 images. In this case, the overall classification accuracies were 97% for both ML and RF classifiers. In addition, the average producer’s accuracies of 95% and 96% were achieved by the ML and RF classifiers, respectively, whereas the average user accuracy was 94% for both classifiers. The results indicated promising potentials for rapid and cost-effective local-scale crop-type classification using a limited number of high-resolution optical and multi-polarization SAR images. Very accurate classification results can be considered as a replacement for sampling the agricultural fields at the local scale. The result of this very accurate classification at discrete locations (approximately 25 × 25 km frames) can be applied in a separate procedure to increase the accuracy of crop area estimation at the regional to provincial scale by linking these local very accurate spatially discrete results to national wall-to-wall continuous crop classification maps. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Canada; Manitoba; Cost effectiveness; Crops; Decision trees; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Maximum likelihood estimation; Pixels; Polarization; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural fields; Classification accuracy; Classification methodologies; Classification results; Crop area estimations; Crop type classification; Object based image analysis; Spectral similarity; accuracy assessment; crop plant; image classification; optical method; pixel; polarization; RapidEye; remote sensing; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; Image classification","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032276095"

Additionally, the temporal change of the scattering mechanism of crops and other land cover classes is analyzed based on the PS. Firstly, the scattering mechanisms of corn, soybean, wheat, forest and urban over time are analyzed. The correlation coefficient is computed between their PS and the PS of canonical targets to study their relationships with the completely polarized surface, dihedral, dipole and helix scattering targets. The pedestal height (PH) of their PS is also calculated to investigate their un-polarized components such as multiple scattering. Then, a novel multi-temporal supervised binary-tree classification scheme (MTSBTCS) with a criterion that maximizes the power difference of PS (MDPS) is developed (MTSBTCS-MDPS), in which the MDPS is proposed to find the optimum orientation angle, ellipticity angle and image acquisition date to maximize the power difference of two different land cover classes and a binary-tree classifier is constructed for the final multi-temporal classification. Seven fully polarimetric C-band RADARASAT-2 images in Fine Quad (FQ) 21 mode acquired in southwestern Ontario, Canada during the entire growing season from May to September in 2012 are used for the purpose of the scattering mechanism analysis and validation of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. The experiment demonstrates that, the scattering mechanism varies with crop type and also changes greatly for each crop when they are in different growing stages. However, the scattering mechanisms of urban and forest areas remain almost the same. In terms of the classification, comparison of the MDPS with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and the Wishart distance (WD), shows that for the single-date image classification, both MDPS and WD achieve much higher accuracy on each date than that of the SVM and RF, but the MDPS consumes more time than that of the WD and its accuracy is also lower. However, when they are applied to the multi-temporal images, both SVM and RF suffer a severe misclassification between forest and urban with their accuracy lower than that of the MTSBTCS-MDPS. In addition, the MTSBTCS-MDPS developed in this paper is much less time-consuming approximately 2.5 times less than that of the MTSBTCS-WD, meanwhile, it also achieves the highest accuracy with its overall accuracy of 87.5% and kappa coefficient of 0.85 among all methods applied. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Bins; Crops; Decision trees; Image classification; Polarimeters; Polarization; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Land cover classification; Polarimetric SAR; Polarization signatures; Radarsat-2; Scattering mechanisms; canonical analysis; data acquisition; growing season; image classification; land cover; model validation; orientation; polarization; RADARSAT; satellite imagery; scattering; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; Binary trees","Land cover classification; Polarimetric SAR; Polarization signature; RADARSAT-2; Scattering mechanism analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014298878"

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions, and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes, which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT-2 InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time period for the 24-day repeat cycle of RADARSAT-2. However, open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes. In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes, enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques. © 2017 by the authors.","Backscattering; Coherent light; Disaster prevention; Floods; Forestry; Hydrology; Mapping; Radar; Signal detection; Space-based radar; Surface waters; Vegetation; Water levels; Wetlands; Backscatter intensity; Change detection; Constellation missions; Double-bounce scatterings; Electrical power generation; InSAR; Monitoring applications; Operational applications; Synthetic aperture radar","Change detection; Coherence; Flooded vegetation; Hydrology; InSAR; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013663349"

Popular SAR change detectors include ratio and logarithmic-ratio (log-ratio) operators, and those based on a statistical similarity between temporal images. The ratio and log-ratio operators are not ideal for polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) images, as only the intensity or amplitude information is used. Change detectors based on similarity comparison of probability distribution functions are difficult to implement and not reliable because of the uncertainties in estimating distribution parameters. Our research aims to find a reliable and computationally simple change detector from among three typical polarimetric distance measures. The change detection potential and abilities of these distance measures are analyzed from a mathematical point of view, and then compared through a test dataset composed of two RADARSAT-2 fine-quad polarized images. The symmetric revised Wishart (SRW) distance, originally developed for image segmentation, is found to be an effective change detector. Based on the test data, the change map derived from the SRW distance achieves 93.24 percent change rate and 5.67 percent false alarm rate. Furthermore, the eigendecompostion of the SRW distance is given for the first time, which uncovers the linkage of the SRW distance with the scattering mechanisms and the corresponding amplitudes embedded in two polarimetric covariance matrices, forming a theoretical explanation for the superiority of the SRW distance as a change detector. Our research indicates the general applicability of the SRW distance for POLSAR change detection. © 2016 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Covariance matrix; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Polarimeters; Probability distributions; Statistical tests; Synthetic aperture radar; Uncertainty analysis; Amplitude information; Change detection; Covariance matrices; Distance measure; Distribution parameters; Multi-temporal SAR images; Polarimetric SAR; Scattering mechanisms; algorithm; data set; detection method; image analysis; RADARSAT; satellite imagery; scattering; segmentation; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018287657"

Damage from this earthquake was assessed quantitatively by means of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence and SAR intensity methods using dual-polarized SAR data obtained from the Sentinel-1 (VV, VH) and ALOS-2 (HH, HV) satellites. We developed linear discriminant functions based on three items: (1) the differential coherence values; (2) the differential backscattering intensity values of pre- and post-event images; and (3) a binary damage map of the optical pre- and post-event imagery. The accuracy of the proposed model was 84% for the Sentinel-1 data and 76% for the ALOS-2 data.

A series of operational methodologies based on SAR data using either multi-temporal or only post-event SAR images have been developed and used to serve disaster activities. This presents a critical problem: which method is more likely to obtain reliable results and should be adopted for disaster response when both pre- and post-event SAR data are available? To explore this question, this study takes the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake as a case study. ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR images were employed with a machine learning framework to quantitatively compare the performance of building damage mapping using only post-event SAR images and mapping using multi-temporal SAR images. The results show that an overall accuracy of 64.5% was achieved when only post-event SAR images were used, which is 2.3% higher than the overall accuracy when multi-temporal SAR images were used.

Recently, the capabilities of MT-InSAR for risk monitoring and preventive analysis of heritage sites have increasingly been exploited. Considering the limitations of conventional MT-InSAR techniques, in this study a two-step Tomography-based Persistent Scatterers (PS) Interferometry (Tomo-PSInSAR) approach is proposed for monitoring ground deformation and structural instabilities over the Ancient City Walls (Ming Dynasty) in Nanjing city, China. For the purpose of this study we utilized 26 Stripmap acquisitions from TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X missions, spanning from May 2013 to February 2015. As a first step, regional-scale surface deformation rates on single PSs were derived (ranging from -40 to +5 mm/year) and used for identifying deformation hotspots as well as for the investigation of a potential correlation between urbanization and the occurrence of surface subsidence. As a second step, structural instability parameters of ancient walls (linear motion rates, non-linear motions and material thermodynamics) were estimated by an extended four-dimensional Tomo-PSInSAR model. The model applies a two-tier network strategy; that is, the detection of most reliable single PSs in the first-tier Delaunay triangulation network followed by the detection of remaining single PSs and double PSs on the second-tier local star network referring to single SPs extracted in the first-tier network. Consequently, a preliminary phase calibration relevant to the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) is not needed. Motion heterogeneities in the spatial domain, either caused by thermal kinetics or displacement trends, were also considered. This study underlines the potential of the proposed Tomo-PSInSAR solution for the monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage sites. The proposed approach offers a quantitative indicator to local authorities and planners for assessing potential damages as well as for the design of remediation activities. © 2017 by the authors.","Deformation; Historic preservation; Interferometry; Risk assessment; Thermodynamics; Ancient wall; Cultural heritages; Nanjing; PS-InSAR; Structural instability; Two-tier networks; Synthetic aperture radar","Ancient wall; Cultural heritage; Nanjing; Structural instability monitoring; Tomo-PSInSAR; Two-tier network approach","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017633639"

In this framework, monitoring oil and gas offshore platforms is a key topic taken into account the high risk of accident, e.g. exposed to extreme weather conditions, and the potential threats to the environment, e.g. release of polluting material into the ocean. In this study, offshore platform monitoring is discussed using multi-polarization X-band SAR imagery. For operational purposes, the analysis is undertaken using a data set of dual-polarization TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TS-X/TD-X) imagery collected over a test site in Gulf of Mexico at low and high incidence angles. Additionally, experimental Dual Receive Antenna (DRA) bistatic quad-polarization TD-X data will be used for a more in depth analysis of the backscattering properties and detection performance of different target polarimetric detectors. The motivation behind this work is the observation that, under low incidence angle and moderate wind conditions, co-polarized channels may fail in detecting offshore platforms even when fine-resolution imagery is considered. The multi-temporal dataset allows investigating the possible causes of this unexpected behavior and to draw some conclusions on the target's backscattering depending on polarization, resolution and incidence angle. © 2017 IEEE.","","Oil platform; Polarimetry; Radar; SAR; Target detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041812563"

Overall, the single filtering image performed higher accuracy compared to the multi-temporal filtering image. The multi-temporal filtering image has sharper and clearer edge compared to the single filtering image. However, it also contains more salt and pepper noise than the single filtering image.

The growth of cities over recent river deposits makes necessary the use of multidisciplinary approaches to characterize the evolution of drainage networks in urbanized areas. Since under-consolidated fluvial sediments are especially sensitive to compaction, their spatial distribution, thickness, and mechanical behavior must be studied. Here, we report on subsidence in the city of Seville (Southern Spain) between 2003 and 2010, through the analysis of the results obtained with the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique. In addition, the temporal evolution of the subsidence is correlated with the rainfall, the river water column and the piezometric level. Finally, we characterize the geotechnical parameters of the fluvial sediments and calculate the theoretical settlement in the most representative sectors. Deformation maps clearly indicate that the spatial extent of subsidence is controlled by the distribution of under-consolidated fine-grained fluvial sediments at heights comprised in the range of river level variation. This is clearly evident at the western margin of the river and the surroundings of its tributaries, and differs from rainfall results as consequence of the anthropic regulation of the river. On the other hand, this influence is not detected at the eastern margin due to the shallow presence of coarse-grain consolidated sediments of different terrace levels. The derived results prove valuable for implementing urban planning strategies, and the InSAR technique can therefore be considered as a complementary tool to help unravel the subsidence tendency of cities located over under-consolidated fluvial deposits.

Italy has always been exposed to numerous earthquakes, mostly concentrated in central and southern regions. Last year, two seismic events near Norcia (central Italy) have occurred, which led to substantial loss of life and extensive damage to properties, infrastructure and cultural heritage. This research utilizes remote sensing products and GIS software, to provide a database of information. We used both SAR images of Sentinel 1A and optical imagery of Landsat 8 to examine the differences of topography with the aid of the multi temporal monitoring technique. This technique suits for the observation of any surface deformation. This database is a cluster of information regarding the consequences of the earthquakes in groups, such as property and infrastructure damage, regional rifts, cultivation loss, landslides and surface deformations amongst others, all mapped on GIS software. Relevant organizations can implement these data in order to calculate the financial impact of these types of earthquakes. In the future, we can enrich this database including more regions and enhance the variety of its applications. For instance, we could predict the future impacts of any type of earthquake in several areas, and design a preliminarily model of emergency for immediate evacuation and quick recovery response. It is important to know how the surface moves, in particular geographical regions like Italy, Cyprus and Greece, where earthquakes are so frequent.

These are important information for monitoring, warning about, and preventing the occurrence of hazardous situations. Through image products acquired from sensors, it is possible to automatically extract information, replacing fieldwork in areas of difficult access. A well-known acquisition technique is obtained by airborne SAR/InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) resulting in images of phase measurements (height), digital elevation models, signal strength (amplitude), and coherence for a given area. As new technologies are developed, it is possible to capture higher resolution images, which require more sophisticated image processing tools. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating water levels from SAR/InSAR products. The proposed method is based on a graph framework, known as Image Foresting Transform (IFT). Here, we adapted this framework for detecting margins of rivers and reservoirs, enabling us to accurately estimate their water levels over time. A rigorous analysis with real world data is conducted and discussed.

Texture analysis is often discussed in image processing domain, but most methods do not exploit the fact that texture occurs at various spatial scales. Often used techniques such as the gray level co-occurrence statistics is limited to altering inter-neighbor spacing and hence does not capture the texture very well. The proposed approach exploits curvelet and contourlet based multi-scale decomposition of Pauli RGB decomposed images from SAR data where textural information is extracted at various scales and in different directions in terms of statistical moments and energy to generate the feature map. The L1-norm is used in the proposed method to generate the difference image, which is thresholded using the maximum entropy principle to obtain final change detection map. The results are compared with the changes detected by wavelet based textural features. Accuracy assessment is performed for change maps and comparative analysis is carried out in terms of missed changes, false-alarms and overall accuracies. It is found that the proposed method exhibits high change detection accuracy with better edge continuity. © 2017 ACRS.

The phase difference obtained from multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar images contains errors of several types, and the atmospheric phase delay can be an obstacle to estimating surface subsidence. In this study, we calculate PW from external meteorological data. Firstly, we interpolate the data with regard to their spatial and temporal resolutions. Then, assuming a range direction between a target pixel and the sensor, we derive the cumulative amount of differential PW at the height of the slant range vector at pixels along that direction. The atmospheric phase delay of each interferogram is acquired by taking a residual after a preliminary determination of the linear deformation velocity and digital elevation model (DEM) error, and by applying high-pass temporal and low-pass spatial filters. Next, we estimate a regression model that connects the cumulative amount of PW and the atmospheric phase delay. Finally, we subtract the contribution of the atmospheric phase delay from the phase difference of the interferogram, and determine the linear deformation velocity and DEM error. The experimental results show a consistent relationship between the cumulative amount of differential PW and the atmospheric phase delay. An improvement in land-deformation accuracy is observed at a point at which the deformation is relatively large.

The small surface deformations on such PS points are estimated. PSI particularly works well in monitoring human settlements because regular substructures of man-made objects give rise to large number of PS points. If such structures and/or substructures substantially alter or even vanish due to big change like construction, their PS points are discarded without additional explorations during standard PSI procedure. Such rejected points are called big change (BC) points. On the other hand, incoherent change detection (ICD) relies on local comparison of multi-temporal images (e.g. image difference, image ratio) to highlight scene modifications of larger size rather than detail level. However, image noise inevitably degrades ICD accuracy. We propose a change detection approach based on PSI to synergize benefits of PSI and ICD. PS points are extracted by PSI procedure. A local change index is introduced to quantify probability of a big change for each point. We propose an automatic thresholding method adopting change index to extract BC points along with a clue of the period they emerge. In the end, PS ad BC points are integrated into a change detection image. Our method is tested at a site located around north of Berlin main station where steady, demolished, and erected building substructures are successfully detected. The results are consistent with ground truth derived from time-series of aerial images provided by Google Earth. In addition, we apply our technique for traffic infrastructure, business district, and sports playground monitoring.","","Change Detection; Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR); Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); Urban Monitoring","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016963578"

Therefore, it is demanding to develop unsupervised methods for SAR image change detection. Recently, deep learning-based methods have displayed promising performance for remote sensing image analysis. However, these methods can only provide excellent performance when the number of training samples is sufficiently large. In this paper, a novel simple method for SAR image change detection is proposed. The proposed method uses two singular value decomposition (SVD) analyses to learn the non-linear relations between multi-temporal images. By this means, the proposed method can generate more representative feature expressions with fewer samples. Therefore, it provides a simple yet effective way to be designed and trained easily. Firstly, deep semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (Deep Semi-NMF) is utilized to select pixels that have a high probability of being changed or unchanged as samples. Next, image patches centered at these sample pixels are generated from the input multi-temporal SAR images. Then, we build SVD networks, which are comprised of two SVD convolutional layers and one histogram feature generation layer. Finally, pixels in both multi-temporal SAR images are classified by the SVD networks, and then the final change map can be obtained. The experimental results of three SAR datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. © 2017 by the authors.","Factorization; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Matrix algebra; Pixels; Radar; Remote sensing; Singular value decomposition; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Deep Semi-NMF; Earth observation programs; Fuzzy C mean; Multi-temporal SAR images; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Remote sensing platforms; Semi-nonnegative matrix factorizations; Radar imaging","Change detection; Deep Semi-NMF; Fuzzy c-means; Nonnegative matrix factorization; SVD networks; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019916979"

Rice variables as quantitative indicators of rice growth are critical for farming management and yield estimation, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has great advantages for monitoring rice variables due to its all-weather observation capability. In this study, eight temporal RADARSAT-2 full-polarimetric SAR images were acquired during rice growth cycle and a modified water cloud model (MWCM) was proposed, in which the heterogeneity of the rice canopy in the horizontal direction and its phenological changes were considered when the double-bounce scattering between the rice canopy and the underlying surface was firstly considered as well. Then, three scattering components from an improved polarimetric decomposition were coupled with the MWCM, instead of the backscattering coefficients. Using a genetic algorithm, eight rice variables were estimated, such as the leaf area index (LAI), rice height (h), and the fresh and dry biomass of ears (Fe and De). The accuracy validation showed the MWCM was suitable for the estimation of rice variables during the whole growth season. The validation results showed that the MWCM could predict the temporal behaviors of the rice variables well during the growth cycle (R2 > 0.8). Compared with the original water cloud model (WCM), the relative errors of rice variables with the MWCM were much smaller, especially in the vegetation phase (approximately 15% smaller). Finally, it was discussed that the MWCM could be used, theoretically, for extensive applications since the empirical coefficients in the MWCM were determined in general cases, but more applications of the MWCM are necessary in future work. © 2016 by the authors.","Backscattering; Cloud computing; Ecology; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Polarimeters; Radar; Radar imaging; Height; Heterogeneity; Paddy rice; Radarsat-2; Water cloud models; Synthetic aperture radar","Ear biomass; Height; Heterogeneity; LAI; Paddy rice; Polarimetry; RADARSAT-2; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Water cloud model (WCM)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019708432"

Therefore, ice velocity is an essential parameter for the assessment of mass balance. In this paper, we propose an approach for the multi-track extraction of two-dimensional ice surface velocity by the combined use of multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). The azimuth and ground range ice movements of each individual track are first estimated by the use of MAI and DInSAR, respectively. A seamless two-dimensional ice velocity map is then achieved by calibration and mosaicking of the estimated velocity of the multi-temporal and multi-track measurements over a large area. Finally, the dynamic behavior of the Amery Ice Shelf is analyzed by formulating a long-term series of ice flow velocities consisting of historical surface velocities (1968–1990), the estimated surface velocity by the proposed method with ERS-1/2 data (1996), existing surface velocity products such as the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) velocities (1997–2000) and Rignot's results (2007–2010), as well as the estimated velocities obtained by the use of the offset tracking method from Landsat 8 images (2013–2014). The results show that the estimated velocity obtained by the use of the proposed method is superior to the other methods, and the long-term series of ice velocity measurements shows that the ice velocity in the Amery Ice Shelf has hardly changed over the past 45 years (1968–2014). We conclude that the ice flow velocity of the Amery Ice Shelf has showed a slight deceleration over the past 45 years. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Amery Ice Shelf; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Extraction; Flow velocity; Interferometry; Sea level; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Weather satellites; Accuracy; Amery Ice Shelf; D-inSAR; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Global sea levels; Ice velocity; Multiple apertures; Two-dimensional surface; calibration; extraction method; flow velocity; glacier; ice movement; Landsat; long-term change; radar interferometry; satellite imagery; sea level change; synthetic aperture radar; tracking; two-dimensional modeling; Ice","Accuracy; Amery Ice Shelf; DInSAR; Ice velocity; MAI","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033609165"

Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) is the land subsidence measurement method by using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and it can accurately measure wide range of land subsidence. However, the estimated displacement is obtained only along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Therefore, it is expected to develop a method for measuring three dimensional (3D) displacements by combining multi-directional observation. In this work, we examine the fusion of the displacement results from SAR images observed on ascending- and descending-orbits. First, we estimate the displacement from the ascending- and descending-orbit SAR images, individually. Then, the vertical and horizontal land subsidence components are estimated from the two results. In experiments, we selected Kansai International Airport, located in the western Japan, as a study area because it is reported to show both vertical and horizontal displacements. We used 24 ALOS-PALSAR ascending images from 2006 to 2010 and 14 ALOS-PALSAR descending images from 2006 to 2010. We compared with the annual leveling data the vertical displacement estimated from the ascending-descending combination. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the velocities by ascending-descending combination analysis was 0.015 m/year. Further investigation is necessary to match pixels that represent the identical location among ascending- and descending- orbit SAR images, and to validate the estimated horizontal displacement. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

We apply the Wishart distribution-based distance and modify the combination form for the SLIC distance measure such that the SLIC method can be adapted to the statistical characteristics of PolSAR imagery. Compared with existing PolSAR image superpixel methods, the proposed method has better time cost efficiency while maintaining the performance on segmentation results.

In volcanology, elevation data are of particular importance when assessing material flows throughout a volcanic system. To obtain accurate estimates of time-varying topography in volcanic active regions, high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) are required. To monitor and evaluate topographical changes and especially volumetric gains and losses during the 2014–2015 Bárðarbunga eruption, Iceland, multi-temporal TanDEM-X DEM sequences were evaluated. The 2014–2015 volcanic eruption was associated with the rare event of a caldera collapse, visible on the surface of the Vatnajökull glacier, as well as major lava effusion in the Holuhraun plain. Before investigating topographical change at the two study areas, the TanDEM-X DEMs were analysed for absolute and relative height errors resulting from the radar system parameters, the SAR processing or the local environment. The uncertainty investigation determined that acquisitions over the snow-covered Bárðarbunga caldera were primarily affected by microwave penetration into snow and DEMs over the Holuhraun lava field exhibited increased height errors due to active lava flows and dynamic outwash plain. The topographical analysis of the 2014–2015 Bárðarbunga eruption revealed a maximum vertical displacement of approximately −65 m and +43 m at the study area of the Bárðarbunga caldera and Holuhraun lava field respectively. With a total subsidence volume of −1.40 ± 0.13 km3 and a dense-rock equivalent (DRE) lava volume of +1.36 ± 0.07 km3, known uncertainties in volume were decreased by approximately 35% and 77% accordingly. Taking into account the calculation of rates, the temporal development of caldera collapse and lava effusion was found to exhibit a near-exponential decrease. The ratio between subsidence and DRE lava volume moreover indicated the coupling between piston collapse and magma drainage. © 2017 The Authors","Baroarbunga; Holuhraun; Iceland; Vatnajokull; Digital instruments; Forestry; Geomorphology; Information management; Radar systems; Snow; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Uncertainty analysis; Volcanoes; DEM uncertainty; Digital elevation model; Holuhraun; TanDEM-X; Volcanology; Volumetric changes; caldera; collapse; communication network; digital elevation model; lava flow; morphometry; outwash; spatiotemporal analysis; TanDEM-X; uncertainty analysis; volcanic eruption; volcanology; volume change; Surveying","Bárðarbunga; DEM uncertainty; Digital elevation model (DEM); Holuhraun; TanDEM-X; Volcanology; Volumetric change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032388100"

A semi-empirical model was used to model C- and L-band backscatter as function of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass; a linear regression model was used for P-band. Calibrated with the aid of inventory plots, the models were used to estimate total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass for each individual scene in the multi-temporal and multi-frequency stack of observations. Individual estimates were then combined using weights reflecting each scenes' sensitivity to the biomass component in question. At the plot scale, the retrieval errors were 37, 40, and 33 % for total aboveground, stem, and branch biomass in terms of the relative RMSE; the error further reduced to 33, 38, and 27 % when calibrating models per species. We find that i) the retrieval of total aboveground, stem and branch biomass benefits from the availability of multi-temporal/-frequency data as the lowest retrieval errors with the best single image (P-band) were about 6 to 8 % higher, ii) there is no benefit in estimating total aboveground biomass via independent estimates of stem and branch biomass, iii) consideration of species specific differences associated with different allocations of biomass to stems and branches allows for improving the retrieval. © 2017 IEEE.","Errors; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Above ground biomass; Biomass components; Linear regression models; Multi frequency; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal SAR; Semi-empirical modeling; Species specifics; Biomass","Aboveground biomass; Multi-frequency; Multi-temporal; SAR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032378778"

Interpolation is usually done on the phase data after a phase unwrapping (PU) operation. In a previous work, we considered the alternative interpolation step applied directly to the complex phasor derived from the wrapped phase, thus bypassing the error-prone sparse PU operation. In this article, the performances of the proposed methodology are evaluated over atmospheric phase screen (APS) data estimated from a previous processing through persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) methods. The original persistent scatterer (PS) population is reduced by thresholding their inter-image coherence values, and then further subsampled randomly in a rectangle inside a detected subsidence bowl. Both the classical and the proposed interpolation procedures are applied to the subsampled APS phase values. The interpolated fields are then removed from the rest of the PS, and the residual phase values are compared in terms of inter-image coherence. Results confirm that interpolating complex phasors, thus avoiding PU, gives results equivalent to the standard procedure in good sampling conditions. Moreover, when point sparsity induces phase aliasing, thus hindering the PU operation, the proposed method allows to better recover phase information over unsampled pixels, improving the final results of the PSI processing. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Coherent scattering; Interferometry; Interpolation; Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Differential phase; Experimental validations; Persistent scatterers; Phase information; Phase unwrapping; Sampling conditions; Standard procedures; Synthetic aperture radar interferometry; image analysis; interferometry; performance assessment; pixel; scatterometer; synthetic aperture radar; terrain; Phase shifters","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010447217"

Our study area, Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan, consists of two landfilled islands, and the subsidence velocity of an island is much larger than that of the other one. In the preliminary examination, we observed that DInSAR analysis using multi-temporal TerraSAR-X (TSX), X-band SAR images, is subject to unwrapping errors in the second island. On the other hand, the analysis using multi-temporal Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) / Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Rader-2 (PALSAR2) images was found to include errors in estimating local subsidence velocity. The proposed method calibrates the mean subsidence velocity derived from TSX images by using the mean subsidence velocity derived from PALSAR-2 for avoiding the unwrapping errors.

Target polarimetric response is strongly dependent on its orientation. Backscattering responses of the same target with different orientations to the SAR flight path may be quite different. This target orientation diversity effect hinders PolSAR image understanding and interpretation. Roll-invariant polarimetric features such as entropy, anisotropy, mean alpha angle, and total scattering power are independent of the target orientation and are commonly adopted for PolSAR image classification. On the other aspect, target orientation diversity also contains rich information which may not be sensed by roll-invariant polarimetric features. In this vein, only using the roll-invariant polarimetric features may limit the final classification accuracy. To address this problem, this work uses the recently reported uniform polarimetric matrix rotation theory and a visualization and characterization tool of polarimetric coherence pattern to investigate hidden polarimetric features in the rotation domain along the radar line of sight. Then, a feature selection scheme is established and a set of hidden polarimetric features are selected in the rotation domain. Finally, a classification method is developed using the complementary information between roll-invariant and selected hidden polarimetric features with a support vector machine (SVM)/decision tree (DT) classifier. Comparison experiments are carried out with NASA/JPL AIRSAR and multi-temporal UAVSAR data. For AIRSAR data, the overall classification accuracy of the proposed classification method is 95.37% (with SVM)/96.38% (with DT), while that of the conventional classification method is 93.87% (with SVM)/94.12% (with DT), respectively. Meanwhile, for multi-temporal UAVSAR data, the mean overall classification accuracy of the proposed method is up to 97.47% (with SVM)/99.39% (with DT), which is also higher than the mean accuracy of 89.59% (with SVM)/97.55% (with DT) from the conventional method. The comparison studies clearly demonstrate the efficiency and advantage of the proposed classification methodology. In addition, the proposed classification method achieves better robustness for the multi-temporal PolSAR data. This work also further validates that added benefits can be gained for PolSAR data investigation by mining and utilization of hidden polarimetric information in the rotation domain. © 2017 by the authors.","Data mining; Decision trees; Feature extraction; Matrix algebra; Polarimeters; Radar; Rotation; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification methodologies; Coherence patterns; Conventional classification methods; Land cover classification; Polarimetric features; Polarimetric informations; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Rotation domain; Classification (of information)","Classification; Feature selection; Polarimetric coherence pattern; Polarimetric feature; Polarimetric matrix rotation; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR); Rotation domain","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022339352"

First, permanent open water, forest, macrophytes, and herbaceous plants have been classified over the central Congo Basin based on statistics of the backscattering coefficient values.

The continuous monitoring of their stability therefore is of utmost significance to prevent the public death and injures resulting from bridge collapses. Typically, the deformation of bridges is detected by traditional on-structure surveying methods which are limited by the sparse measurements and large consumption of time and manpower. Thanks to the availability of numerous archived high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images coupled with the technology development of multi-temporal interferometry SAR, currently, millimetre level of subtle deformation monitoring and health diagnosis on bridges through the estimation of subsidence velocities using time-series SAR images has become a precise and cost-effective solution, assisting the conventional measures for bridges monitoring. Due to the fine level of detail information in X-band SAR images, the identification of even smaller bridges is possible. In this article, the special appearance of bridges over water in TerraSAR-X Stripmap images is discussed based on the backscattering mechanism analysis. Besides, an advanced high-resolution multi-temporal SAR Interferometry processing and analysis approach to enhance the capabilities for bridge health monitoring is illustrated based on the case study of Lupu Bridge in Shanghai, before discussing the existing challenges and future developments associated with bridge-specific deformation surveillance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Shanghai; backscatter; bridge; deformation; health monitoring; radar imagery; radar interferometry; structural analysis; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X","backscattering; Bridges; deformation surveillance; high-resolution; InSAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030872832"

The method consists in finding the solution of a non-linear optimization problem that does not require the preliminary execution of any phase unwrapping operation. Therefore, the achievable estimates are not disturbed by phase unwrapping (PhU) errors. Noteworthy, the estimation of the ground displacement rate may reveal (in most cases) particularly suitable for retrieving geophysical information on the sources responsible for the observed deformations. Furthermore, the estimates of the DEM errors and the ground displacement rate can be used within advanced DInSAR processing chains for the retrieval of surface deformation time-series, with the aim to facilitate phase unwrapping operations and discriminate the desired signals (due to deformation) from residual phase artifacts. The first experimental results, carried out by applying the proposed method to stacks of simulated interferograms, demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.","","DEM errors; DInSAR; Ground mean displacement rate; Phase unwrapping; Synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041800759"

In this study, we generate five new DEMs of the Mont-Blanc area from TanDEM-X interferometric pairs acquired in 2012/2013. We conducted a multitemporal analysis of the DEMs in comparison with two high-resolution DEMs obtained from Pléiades stereo satellite images in 2012 and 2013. A vertical precision of 1-3 m of the radar DEMs is estimated over ice and snow free areas and slopes less than 40°. DEM-derived elevation changes are compared with outputs of the snowpack model Crocus and snow accumulation measurements. The results show that at altitudes below ∼2500-m a.s.l., the radar penetration is negligible in our study area. The DEM-derived elevation changes agree, within uncertainty, with the modeled and field snow height. At higher altitudes, the comparison between the radar and optical DEMs acquired only a few weeks apart allows estimating the interferometric bias of the X-band DEM in the dry snowpack. At 4000-m a.s.l, it reaches 4 m on average in October and February. A geodetic glacier mass balance calculated using the October radar DEM would be biased. For the least favorable case, the highly elevated Bossons glacier, the bias would correspond to 1.66-m w.e.

It is important to obtain reliable winter wheat acreage to guarantee the food security for the most populous country in the world. This paper focuses on assessing the feasibility of in-season winter wheat mapping and investigating potential classification improvement by using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, optical images, and the integration of both types of data in urban agricultural regions with complex planting structures in Southern China. Both SAR (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8) data were acquired, and classification using different combinations of Sentinel-1A-derived information and optical images was performed using a support vector machine (SVM) and a random forest (RF) method. The interference coherence and texture images were obtained and used to assess the effect of adding them to the backscatter intensity images on the classification accuracy. The results showed that the use of four Sentinel-1A images acquired before the jointing period of winter wheat can provide satisfactory winter wheat classification accuracy, with an F1 measure of 87.89%. The combination of SAR and optical images for winter wheat mapping achieved the best F1 measure—up to 98.06%. The SVM was superior to RF in terms of the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient, and was faster than RF, while the RF classifier was slightly better than SVM in terms of the F1 measure. In addition, the classification accuracy can be effectively improved by adding the texture and coherence images to the backscatter intensity data. © 2017 by the authors.

Azimuth ambiguities are a real problem in SAR images today, which can cause performance degradation in SAR ocean applications. In particular, littoral zones can be strongly affected by land-based sources, whereas they are usually regions of interest (ROI). Given the presence of complexity and diversity in littoral zones, azimuth ambiguities removal is a tough problem. As SAR sensors can have a repeat cycle, multi-temporal SAR images provide new insight into this problem. A method for azimuth ambiguities removal in littoral zones based on multi-temporal SAR images is proposed in this paper. The proposed processing chain includes co-registration, local correlation, binarization, masking, and restoration steps. It is designed to remove azimuth ambiguities caused by fixed land-based sources. The idea underlying the proposed method is that sea surface is dynamic, whereas azimuth ambiguities caused by land-based sources are constant. Thus, the temporal consistence of azimuth ambiguities is higher than sea clutter. It opens up the possibilities to use multi-temporal SAR data to remove azimuth ambiguities. The design of the method and the experimental procedure are based on images from the Sentinel data hub of Europe Space Agency (ESA). Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Stripmap (SM) mode images are taken into account to validate the proposed method. This paper also presents two RGB composition methods for better azimuth ambiguities visualization. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remove azimuth ambiguities in littoral zones effectively. © 2017 by the authors.","Radar; Surface waters; Synthetic aperture radar; Azimuth ambiguities; Experimental procedure; Littoral zone; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal SAR images; Performance degradation; Regions of interest; Sentinel-1; Radar imaging","Azimuth ambiguities; Littoral zones; Multi-temporal; RGB composition; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028300093"

Where and when the cloudiness limits the use of optical and thermal remote sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has proven to have several advantages (cloud penetration, day/night acquisitions and high spatial resolution). However, measured backscattering is controlled by several factors including SAR configuration (acquisition geometry, frequency and polarization), and target dielectric and geometric properties. Thus, uncertainties arise about the more suitable configuration to be used. With the launch of the ALOS Palsar, Cosmo-Skymed and Sentinel 1 sensors, a dataset of multi-frequency (X, C, L) and multi-polarization (co-and cross-polarizations) images are now available from a virtual constellation; thus, significant issues concerning the retrieval of soil-vegetation variables using SAR are: (i) identifying the more suitable SAR configuration; (ii) understanding the affordability of a multi-frequency approach. In 2006, a vast dataset of both remotely sensed images (SAR and optical/thermal) and in situ data was collected in the framework of the AgriSAR 2006 project funded by ESA and DLR. Flights and sampling have taken place weekly from April to August. In situ data included soil water content, soil roughness, fractional coverage and Leaf Area Index (LAI). SAR airborne data consisted of multi-frequency and multi-polarized SAR images (X, C and L frequencies and HH, HV, VH and VV polarizations). By exploiting this very wide dataset, this paper, explores the capabilities of SAR in describing four of the main soil-vegetation variables (SVV). As a first attempt, backscattering and SVV temporal behaviors are compared (dynamic analysis) and single-channel regressions between backscattering and SVV are analyzed. Remarkably, no significant correlations were found between backscattering and soil roughness (over both bare and vegetated plots), whereas it has been noticed that the contributions of water content of soil underlying the vegetation often did not influence the backscattering (depending on canopy structure and SAR configuration). Most significant regressions were found between backscattering and SVV characterizing the vegetation biomass (fractional cover and LAI). Secondly, the effect of SVV changes on the spatial correlation among SAR channels (accounting for different polarization and/or frequencies) was explored.

Increasing anthropogenic activities, like hydrocarbon exploitation, accelerate the subsidence, gradually threatening the stability of infrastructures and causing the inhabitants more vulnerable to natural hazards. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can measure ground movements in high resolution. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial and temporal variations in surface deformation over the Yellow River delta using a Small Baseline Subset InSAR technique and to assess the role of hydrocarbon exploitation in subsidence. The Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers/Multi-Temporal InSAR (StaMPS/MTI) package is employed to process ENVISAT ASAR images collected from 2007 to 2010. InSAR-derived surface deformation measurements are then compared to geological and petroleum geologic data, oil field data and hydrocarbon reservoir inversion information to address the causes of the observed subsidence. Spirit leveling data and standard deviation maps are used to verify the InSAR results and measurement accuracy. Consistent results of the two descending tracks indicate subsidence up to 40 mm/yr over oil field. The time-series deformation manifests that subsidence area and peak broaden over time and subsidence rate are approximately constant in Shikou oil field, while the rate decreases in Dongying oil field since 2009. Moreover, our results indicate that the land subsidence pattern is concentrated in hydrocarbon exploration field and has a good consistency with faults distributions. In addition, a multiple finite prolate ellipsoid sources model is implemented to model the InSAR-derived deformation in Shikou oil field. The model manifests that land subsidence and hydrocarbon exploitation can be quantitatively linked to each other. The intimate connection of surface deformation with reservoir change suggests that land subsidence over oil field in the Yellow River delta is primarily caused by hydrocarbon exploitation. The results provide new insights into the land subsidence mechanism in the Yellow River delta. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta; deformation; exploitation; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil field; radar interferometry; spatial variation; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation","Deltaic land subsidence; Multiple finite prolate ellipsoid sources model; Oil field; Small baseline subset–interferometric synthetic aperture radar; The Yellow River delta","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976354704"

However, it can be severely distorted, particularly in the case of L-band SAR systems mainly due to a frequent occurrence of ionospheric effects in the polar region. In this study, we developed an efficient method to extract and correct the ionospheric contribution from SAR offset tracking measurements. The method exploits an iterative directional filtering approach, which is based on the pattern and directionality of ionospheric streaks. The measurement performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three L-band advanced land observing satellite phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar pairs. Our results showed that the proposed correction achieved the improved measurement accuracies from 4.68-23.88 to 1.03-1.51 m/yr. It means that the accuracies of corrected measurements were about 5-16 times better than those of the original measurements. From the results, we concluded that our correction technique is highly suitable for the precise measurement of the glacier displacements even in the presence of strong ionospheric effects. Using the proposed method, the variations of glacier velocities were measured in the Vylki, Shury, and Kropotnika glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, which is located in the Russian Arctic Ocean, and the grounding zones were detected from the measurements in the Shury and Kropotnika glaciers. It further confirmed that the proposed correction method is allowed for the precise monitoring of glacier movements. However, in cases of severe ionosphere-distorted measurements, the proposed method may be limitedly applied. © 2017 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Arkhangelsk [Russian Federation]; Novaya Zemlya; Russian Federation; Ionosphere; Iterative methods; Radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced land observing satellites; Correction techniques; Directional filtering; Ionospheric correction; Measurement accuracy; Multi-temporal analysis; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Precise measurements; displacement; glacier; ionosphere; measurement method; observational method; polar region; synthetic aperture radar; tracking; Radar measurement","Glacier velocity variations; ionospheric effects; ionospheric streak correction; L-band SAR image; Novaya Zemlya; SAR offset tracking; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018648215"

Currently, large subsidence funnels exist, one each in southern and northern Beijing. We adopted the multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) method, incorporating both persistent scatterer (PS) and small baseline (SB) approaches on 47 Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) single look complex (SLC) images to map land subsidence in the Beijing plain area. The temporal and spatial variations of land subsidence and its seasonal variation were explained by the MT-InSAR results. Then, the InSAR results were combined with the dynamic monitoring of groundwater level, extensometer measurements, and hydrogeological data; the characterization and causes of land subsidence were analysed with Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis methods. The results show the following. 1) Land subsidence developed rapidly in the Beijing plain area from 2003 to 2010, with obviously uneven settlement; settlement rates exceeded 100 mm year−1 in some areas. Seasonal variation in settlement rates may be affected by changes in the precipitation rates and the exploitation of groundwater. 2) The contribution of different aquifer systems to land subsidence varies. The variation in the groundwater level in the second confined aquifer, at a depth of 100–180 m, has the greatest impact on land subsidence. 3) The settlement is centred in the lower part of the Wenyu–Chaobai and Yongding alluvial fan areas, where the compressible layer is more than 100 m thick. Meanwhile, land subsidence forms a structural feature with larger differences in the deformation gradient on both sides of faults. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Beijing [China]; China; Aquifers; Groundwater resources; Indium compounds; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced synthetic aperture radars; Deformation gradients; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Persistent scatterers; Precipitation rates; Regional land subsidences; Single-look complexes; Temporal and spatial variation; Envisat; GIS; groundwater; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; Landforms","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009454872"

Owing to the all-weather imaging capability, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has become a key tool for change detection. Change detection methods include both unsupervised and supervised methods. Supervised change detection, which needs some human intervention, is generally ineffective and impractical. Due to this limitation, unsupervised methods are widely used in change detection. The traditional unsupervised methods only use a part of the polarization information, and the required thresholding algorithms are independent of the multi-temporal data, which results in the change detection map being ineffective and inaccurate. To solve these problems, a novel method of change detection using a test statistic based on the likelihood ratio test and the improved Kittler and Illingworth (K & I) minimum-error thresholding algorithm is introduced in this paper. The test statistic is used to generate the comparison image (CI) of the multi-temporal PolSAR images, and improved K & I using a generalized Gaussian model simulates the distribution of the CI. As a result of these advantages, we can obtain the change detection map using an optimum threshold. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the use of multi-temporal PolSAR images acquired by RADARSAT-2 overWuhan, China. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and highly accurate. © 2017 by the authors.","","Change detection; Generalized Gaussian model (GGM); Improved Kittler and Illingworth (K & I); Multi-temporal; PolSAR; Test statistic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038004395"

There were no actual earthquake observations by InSAR in Georgia. We considered all available SAR data images from different space agencies. However, due to the long wavelength and the frequent acquisitions, only the multi-temporal ALOS Lband SAR data allowed us to produce interferograms spanning the 2009 earthquake. We detected a local uplift around 10 cm (along the line-of-sight propagation) in the interferogram near the earthquake's epicenter, whereas evidence of surface ruptures could not be found in the field along the active thrust fault.

These parameters have been targeted since they are considered key parameters to derive some important agronomical or physical indicators of the crop (i.e. grain yield, leaf nitrogen concentration, radiation interception). This study is based on the Multispectral Crop Monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the CESBIO laboratory in 2010 (MCM’10) for an agricultural region located in southwestern France. From sunflower emergence to harvest, satellite images were regularly acquired by TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2, Alos, Formosat-2, and Spot-4/5, quasi-synchronously with in situ measurements (combining soil and vegetation observations). The time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrate a wide range of configurations, with different frequencies, polarization states (XHH, CHH/VV/VH/HV, and LHH), and incidence angles (from 24 to 53°). The first results have shown that the angular radar sensitivity is greater in the C-band than in the X-band for the co-polarized signals (HH or VV) and for low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI < 0.4), and decreases with the increase of vegetation (from 0.4 dB/degree for bare soils to 0.05 dB/degree for fully vegetated fields).

The monitoring of land subsidence is vital for predicting and managing the disasters that might occur. Many methods have been established to conduct this work, such as using geotechnical monitoring instruments and applying artificial satellite technologies. Those methods can provide highly accurate measurements for small areas. However, it would be expensive and ineffective to apply them to extensive areas. Hence, a monitoring method, that is economical to conduct, can be applied quickly and continuously, and can provide accurate measurements over large areas, is needed. Multi-temporal Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-DInSAR), such as the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), is a powerful technique for meeting the above demands. And, since the lifespans of current SAR satellites are commonly designed to be around 5-7 years, continuous monitoring for longer periods by the MT-DInSAR technique is important. To deal with these types of issues, a new method is required that can utilize the data from multiple (different) satellites. In this study, a method for long-term land subsidence monitoring by MT-DInSAR, using multi-sensor data sets, is presented. Firstly, the SBAS method is performed for each time series SAR data set. Secondly, the hyperbolic fitting method is applied to estimate real values from the results of each data set. Finally, the hyperbolic curve is used to connect the results of the unlinked time series data sets. To verify this method, the land subsidence in Semarang City, Indonesia is taken as an example case.  2017 by Korean Society for Rock Mechanics.","","Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar; Land subsidence; Long-term Monitoring; Multi-temporal Analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048875666"

Our approach relies on the availability of a multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from ascending and descending orbits over an area of interest, and also permits us to estimate the vertical and horizontal (East-West) components of the Earth's surface deformation. The adopted methodology is based on an advanced cloud computing implementation of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) processing chain which allows the unsupervised processing of large SAR data volumes, from the raw data (level-0) imagery up to the generation of the corresponding DInSAR time series and maps. The solution presented, which is highly scalable, has been tested on ascending and descending ENVISAT SAR archives comprising approximately 400 GB of data, which have been acquired over a large area of southern California (US) that extends over about 90,000 km2. Such an input dataset has been processed in parallel by exploiting 280 computing nodes of the Amazon Web Services Cloud environment. The overall processing lasted about 8 h and cost approximately $1900 USD. Moreover, to produce the final mean deformation velocity maps of the vertical and horizontal (East-West) displacement components of the whole investigated area, we also took advantage of the information available from external GPS measurements that permit us to account for possible regional trends not easily detectable by DInSAR and to refer the P-SBAS measurements to an external geodetic datum. The results presented clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach that paves the way to the extensive use of the available ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT SAR data archives. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be particularly suitable to deal with the very large data flow provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation, thus permitting the extension of the DInSAR analyses at a nearly global scale. © 2017 The Authors","California; United States; Cloud computing; Data flow analysis; Deformation; Orbits; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Web services; D-inSAR; Differential SAR interferometry; Displacement components; ENVISAT; Mosaicking; Sentinel-1; Small baseline subsets; Surface deformation analysis; data processing; deformation; Envisat; geodetic datum; GPS; interferometry; methodology; parallel computing; pixel; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Time series analysis","Cloud computing; DInSAR; ENVISAT; Mosaicking; P-SBAS; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020117996"

In this study, we analyzed multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for wetland classification at 4 pilot sites across NL. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) using a segmentation method based on optical data (RapidEye image in this study), and well-adjusted to SAR images, was first compared to pixel-based classification. Next, multi-date object-based wetland maps using the Random Forest classifier were compared to single-date classification. Finally, ratio and textural features were evaluated for wetland classification. The OBIA method demonstrated superior results, and the multi-date classification performed better than single-date classification with accuracies ranging from 75% to 95%. The multi-date results showed that the images acquired in August are the most appropriate for classifying wetlands, while the October images are of less value. Also, covariance matrix is a valuable feature set for wetland mapping. Moreover, ratio and textural features slightly increase the overall accuracy when the initial overall accuracy is relatively low. It can be concluded that multi-date SAR classification, with the proposed segmentation method, shows great potential for mapping wetlands and can be applied throughout the province. © 2017, Copyright © CASI.","Covariance matrix; Decision trees; Image segmentation; Mapping; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Object-based classifications; Overall accuracies; Pixel based classifications; Random forest classifier; Segmentation methods; Textural feature; Wetland classification; Classification (of information)","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85025172652"

They play a pivotal role in purifying water, controlling natural hazards, and conserving soil and water. Remote Sensing (RS) is a cost-effective and timely tool which has been long applied for wetland mapping/ monitoring. Furthermore, since the advent of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) sensors, they have been employed extensively in wetland classification. Due to their day-and-night, all-weather capabilities, their penetration depth, and their sensitivity to moisture, SAR sensors are valuable tools for wetland mapping and monitoring. Currently, there are several active sensors available which differ in terms of their wavelength, revisit time, and accessibility. Therefore, it is important to learn what sensor is more appropriate for wetland classification. This study is a comparison between various available sensors including ALOS PALSAR, ALOS-2, TerraSAR-x, and Sentinel-1 in terms of their potential for wetland mapping. The classification was carried out in both single temporal and multi temporal cases. Random Forest classifier was applied for the object-based mapping of the study area. The result of this study demonstrated that some freely available images including Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR can yield comparable accuracies to that of RADARSAT-2 when combined with optical imagery. It is hoped that the result of this research can be applied in future operational wetland studies for better monitoring of these valuable natural assets. © 2017; The Imaging and Geospatial Information Society.

The accurate identification result helps to improve the land subsidence inversion precision. Various methods for pointwise target detection have been proposed during the past two decades from different respective. The methods can be divided into some main categories according to the criteria for coherence point selection, such as amplitude dispersion index DA, signalto-Clutter ratio and phase stability. The DA method performs a time series analysis on amplitude instead of phase, and reflects the stability of series amplitude. The advantage of coherence point selection by phase stability can identify some special objects with a stable phase, which further increases the density of the stable pointwise target points, but ignores the highly scattering reflection characteristics of the coherent point. The existing methods take insufficient account of the overall features of stable pointwise targets. For ensuring stable scattering mechanism and temporal stability of pointwise target, an improved method with subaperture correlation was proposed in this paper. First, the subaperture correlation properties IHP of SAR images were obtained by spectral decomposition. Then the stability of targets is evaluated based on series two-aperture spectral coherence, by which the coherence points with high scattering could be identified and detect as PSC1. The DA threshold is utilized as the second criterion, which means any pixel in PSC1 with amplitude dispersion less than 0.4 can be determined as PSC2 Then phase stability analysis was carried out to screen out the true stable points from PSC2 with the Characteristics of high scattering mechanism and temporal stability. The experiments of stable pointwise target detection were performed using 33 high resolution SAR images collected by the TerraSAR X-band radar sensor covering Beijing. The detection results demonstrated that the improved method can detect more accurate and reliable pointwise targets than those identified by traditional methodsTo further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, the small subset INSAR technique based on the proposed coherence point detection method was adopted to retrieve the ground deformation by 40 scenes dataset acquired from 2003 to 2009 in Beijing. The vertical surface displacement rates during this period was validated by the leveling observations, with RMSE=1.36 mm/a, indicating two types of subsidence matched very well. The maximum subsidence rate of Beijing in investigated area has reached -92.25 mm/a, with an obvious uneven spatial distribution. Subaperture correlation is sensitivity to the high scattering body and can ensure stable scattering mechanism and temporal stability of pointwise target. Both coherence point detection results and the primary surface deformation proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. The deformation result during 2003-2009 has undergone severe land subsidence with high spatial aggregation characteristic, and the regional subsidence and the groundwater exploitation reveal good corresponding relationship, the more exploitation, the higher deformation rate. © 2016, Science Press.

However, the current methods care little about changes over multi-temporal SAR images, which result in unstable output features. The unstable property is a latent factor to affect the accuracy of SAR image registration. To overcome this problem, we propose a new method to detect stable features by intersecting Coherent Scatters (CS) and SAR-FAST corners. Thus the stable features are not only corners but also located at the time-invariant area.

Statistics on the areas planted with rice or production of paddy rice are fundamental to agriculture-related decisions or policy-making. Asia-Rice Crop Estimation & Monitoring (Asia-RiCE) aims to develop rice-related information, such as paddy field maps, rice growing conditions, yield, and production, using remote sensing tools and disseminate the same at the local and global scales. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the identification of rice-planted areas by using multi-temporal SAR images; a software named INternational Asian Harvest mOnitoring system for Rice (INAHOR) was developed to manipulate the proposed algorithm. The INAHOR uses the imagery observed both at the time of planting of rice and grown-up stages. In this study, two thresholds needed for the INAHOR were optimized based on the detailed land cover data collected through a field survey. Rice-planted areas across the study area in Japan were identified by the INAHOR using the RADARSAT-2 Wide Fine beam mode data. The classification results of RADARSAT-2 VV and VH polarizations were compared. The data with VH polarization showed a higher total accuracy of 83 % with −20.5 dB and 3.0 dB for the minimum and range thresholds, respectively. The INAHOR is currently being used with the RADARSAT-2, ALOS, and ALOS-2 SAR data in the Southeast Asian countries to assess the robustness of the thresholds and classification accuracies under the framework of Asia-RiCE. © 2015, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering and Springer Japan.","Japan; Crops; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Asia-RiCE; Classification accuracy; Classification results; GEOGLAM; INAHOR; Multi-temporal SAR images; Paddy fields; Remote sensing tools; accuracy assessment; ALOS; crop production; land cover; mapping method; paddy field; polarization; RADARSAT; remote sensing; rice; software; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Synthetic aperture radar","Asia-RiCE; GEOGLAM; INAHOR; Paddy field; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947903500"

In this letter, considering the main processes of degradation and the freeze-thaw cycle, a temporal decorrelation model including both the long-term and seasonal coherence factors is proposed. Multitemporal L-band PALSAR, C-band ASAR, and X-band TerraSAR were collected to validate the model's applicability. Coherence matrices of several typical features were estimated for the parameter inversion. Root-mean-square errors ranging from 0.048 to 0.152 showed good fitting results between the model predictions and the estimated interferometric coherences.

SAR and optical parameters were derived from time-series of seven quad-pol RADARSAT-2 and four Landsat-8 images which were acquired on the Berambadi catchment, South India, during the monsoon crop season at the growth stages of turmeric crop. To select the best parameter to discriminate turmeric crops, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied on all the time-series parameters and the most discriminant ones were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique. Results show that in absence of optical images, polarimetric parameters derived from SAR time-series can be used for the turmeric area estimates and that the combined use of SAR and optical parameters can improve the classification accuracy to identify turmeric.","Catchments; Crops; Food products; Geometrical optics; Groundwater; Land use; Optical variables control; Plants (botany); Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Rain; Regression analysis; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Water resources; Analysis of covariances; Classification accuracy; High spatial resolution; Irrigated cropland; Leaf Area Index; Polarimetric parameters; Support vector machine techniques; Water resources management; Time series analysis","Irrigated cropland; Leaf area index (LAI); Optical time-series; Polarimetric parameters; SAR time-series; Support vector machine (SVM)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988517378"

A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is the ideal information source for performing change detection since it is independent of atmospheric and sunlight conditions. Existing SAR image change detection methods usually generate a difference image (DI) first and use clustering methods to classify the pixels of DI into changed class and unchanged class. Some useful information may get lost in the DI generation process. This paper proposed an SAR image change detection method based on neighborhood-based ratio (NR) and extreme learning machine (ELM). NR operator is utilized for obtaining some interested pixels that have high probability of being changed or unchanged. Then, image patches centered at these pixels are generated, and ELM is employed to train a model by using these patches. Finally, pixels in both original SAR images are classified by the pretrained ELM model. The preclassification result and the ELM classification result are combined to form the final change map. The experimental results obtained on three real SAR image datasets and one simulated dataset show that the proposed method is robust to speckle noise and is effective to detect change information among multitemporal SAR images. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Pixels; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Urban growth; Change detection; Classification results; Extreme learning machine; Hierarchical fuzzy; Information sources; Multi-temporal SAR images; neighborhood-based ratio; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Radar imaging","change detection; extreme learning machine; hierarchical fuzzy c-means clustering; neighborhood-based ratio; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002424644"

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for the change detection from multitemporal SAR images that does not require any speckle filtering. This method is based on: i) generating a multiresolution set of the single-channel log ratio image using stationary wavelet transform (SWT); ii) applying the T-point algorithm for all the images of the multiresolution sets; and iii) fusing the obtained images at the optimum reliable scale to generate the change map.

To investigate this relationship, we first analyzed surface subsidence. This paper presents the results of a case study of surface subsidence in Beijing from 1 August 2007 to 29 September 2010. The Multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (multi-temporal InSAR) technique, which can simultaneously detect point-like stable reflectors (PSs) and distributed scatterers (DSs), was used to retrieve the subsidence magnitude and distribution in Beijing using 18 ENVISAT ASAR images. The multi-temporal InSAR-derived subsidence was verified by leveling at an accuracy better than 5 mm/year. Based on the verified multi-temporal InSAR results, a prominent uneven subsidence was identified in Beijing. Specifically, most of the subsidence velocities in the downtown area were within 10 mm/year, and the largest subsidence was detected in Tongzhou, with velocities exceeding 140 mm/year. Furthermore, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data were used to derive the groundwater change series and trend. By comparison with the multi-temporal InSAR-derived subsidence results, the long-term decreasing trend between groundwater changes and surface subsidence showed a relatively high consistency, and a significant impact of groundwater changes on the surface subsidence was identified. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the subsidence funnel was partially consistent with that of groundwater depression, i.e., the former possessed a wider range than the latter. Finally, the relationship between surface subsidence and groundwater changes was determined. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Climate change; Groundwater; Synthetic aperture radar; Beijing; Distributed scatterers; GRACE; Gravity recovery and climate experiment datum; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Subsidence velocity; Surface subsidence; Subsidence","Beijing; GRACE; Groundwater; Multi-temporal InSAR; Surface subsidence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987749005"

However, this region is also tectonically active and is home to several regional strike-slip faults, including the north-south striking left-lateral Chaman Fault System. Several large earthquakes have occurred recently in this area, including one deadly Mw 6.4 earthquake that struck on 28 October 2008. This study integrated Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) results with GPS, gravity, seismic reflection profiles, and earthquake centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) data to identify the impact of tectonic and anthropogenic processes on subsidence and earthquake patterns in this region. To detect and map the spatial-temporal features of the processes that led to the surface deformation, this study used two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series, i.e., 15 Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) images acquired by an Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) from 2006-2011 and 40 Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images spanning 2003-2010. A Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) technique was used to investigate surface deformation. Five seismic lines totaling ~60 km, acquired in 2003, were used to map the blind thrust faults beneath a Quaternary alluvium layer. The median filtered SBAS-InSAR average velocity profile supports groundwater withdrawal as the dominant source of subsidence, with some contribution from tectonic subsidence in the Quetta Valley.

The effect of the cyclone Phailin and the post-incessant rains during second fortnight of October 2013 on coastal Odisha was studied in terms of rice area flooded, submerged and damaged. Multi-temporal SAR data were analysed to obtain the rice mask, and from this rice mask, the flood affected rice area was determined. Taluka-wise and district-wise crop loss proportion was estimated, and the overall production loss has been estimated. SAR data aided in delineation of flooded regions, while AWiFS NDVI data of subsequent dates showed both continued inundation and crop vigour status post-flood time period. The ground truth indicated that a major portion of the inundated region was not rice but was typha grasses and harvested rice field which should not be accounted as damage to rice crop. The damage on crop yield was difficult to assess; however, the inundation of the crop at panicle initiation and flowering would have impact on grain filling (results in chaffiness) and was considered as completely damaged. Most of the current inundated rice regions fall in this category. It was estimated that a total of 0.167 million hectares and 0.37 million tons of rice crop was lost in the cyclone and floods.

Elevation positions of scatterers are determined with Capon estimation, which is characterized by higher side-lobs reduction. An adapted form of multi-looking is proposed for extraction of targets contribution from reconstructed reflectivity functions and for estimation of reflectivity power textures. An algorithm for detection of dominant and secondary PSs will be conducted based on the derived reflectivity estimates, trying to preserve the advantages of Capon filtering used for reflectivity reconstruction. © 2017 IEEE.","","Capon filtering; Multi-looking; Non-linear Least Squares; Persistent Scatterers; SAR Tomography; TerraSAR-X","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041860495"

Information on its temporal changes is very important for crop monitoring and yield estimation which in turn helps for food security and decision making. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is highly suitable for monitoring rice crop, especially in tropical and subtropical areas, where pervasive cloud cover during the rainy seasons prevents the use of optical data. The SAR observations are sensitive to growth stages, leaf area index (LAI), biomass, crop height, soil moisture, and inundation frequency and duration. This makes SAR predominantly useful for mapping rice extent and monitoring rice growth. However, monitoring the rice dynamics requires an intensive multi-temporal data. Dense time series Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data at high spatial resolution offers new opportunities for monitoring agriculture. However, in operational level, several practical problems arise in agricultural monitoring using Sentinel-1 data. It requires processing and management of a large amount of satellite imagery that consequently leads to a ‘Big Data’ problem. In this present work, this problem is overcome with the Google Earth Engine which offers a cloud computing platform to access and seamlessly process a large amount of available satellite imagery. In this present research, time series Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath images are utilized to monitor rice crops across Bardhaman district of West Bengal, India. Time series phenological analysis of the Sentinel-1 data is then performed to assess rice information across the test site. The results indicate a low backscatter during transplanting stage due to the inundation. As rice crop grows from tillering to heading, the backscatter response increases proportionally with the increase in biomass. After ripening and near harvesting stage, a decline in backscatter is observed. The results show strong ability of Sentinel-1 data to assess and monitor rice crop for better decision making. © 2017 ACRS.

The statistical classifiers used in these data fusion approaches are also transformed by integrating the contextual information from neighboring pixels, to improve the accuracy of a fuzzy-logic-based fusion scheme. A decision level fusion approach was developed by Gokaraju et. al, 2012, which combines statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Here, each data sample is integrated through separate classifiers such as empirical methods and support vector machines (SVMs) and then used a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to fuse the decisions for a unified consensus decision. The data fusion approach consists of either pixel-level or feature-level data fusion in combination with machine learning techniques for classification. The intermediate results of the disaster management studies, such as levee land-slide and tornado debris assessment using data fusion techniques, are presented in this paper. For levee landslide studies, we used the multi-temporal datasets of air-borne synthetic aperture radar sensor (UAVSAR). For Tornado disaster studies, we used multi-source and multi-temporal datasets of both synthetic aperture radar sensor (RADARSAT-2) and multispectral sensor (RapiEye) datasets.

In this work, a dataset of 34 TerraSAR-X StripMap images (October 2013-October 2014) has been processed by two PSI techniques - Coherent Pixel Technique-Temporal Sublook Coherence (CPT-TSC) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) - in order to study the evolution of a slow-moving landslide which occurred on February 23, 2012 in the Papanice hamlet (Crotone municipality, southern Italy) and induced by a significant rainfall event (185 mm in three days). The mass movement caused structural damage (buildings' collapse), and destruction of utility lines (gas, water and electricity) and roads. The results showed analogous displacement rates (30-40 mm/yr along the Line of Sight - LOS-of the satellite) with respect to the pre-failure phase (2008-2010) analyzed in previous works. Both approaches allowed detect the landslide-affected area, however the higher density of targets identified by means of CPT-TSC enabled to analyze in detail the slope behavior in order to design possible mitigation interventions. For this aim, a slope stability analysis has been carried out, considering the comparison between groundwater oscillations and time-series of displacement. Hence, the crucial role of the interaction between rainfall and groundwater level has been inferred for the landslide triggering.

MEDRF is a discriminative model fused by two generative models, named as the bias model and the correction model, based on maximum entropy (ME) principle. In MEDRF model, we construct the bias model and the correction model on labeled samples and unlabeled samples, respectively, based on Markov random fields (MRF) to capture the multitemporal image information. Then, we deduce two constraints from the two generative models, and thus fuse the bias model and the correction model to derive MEDRF model according to ME principle subjected to the two constraints. In this way, the proposed MEDRF takes full advantages of the image information from the labeled samples and the unlabeled samples, especially including the spatial-contextual information, to provide an appropriate class boundary. In the experiment, we analyze the influence of the number of labeled samples to the performance of MEDRF model in semisupervised change detection to illustrate that MEDRF can achieve appropriate detection results even using a small number of labeled samples, and the experimental results on real SAR data demonstrate MEDRF model is able to achieve improvement in change detection over several methods proposed recently. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Algorithms; Entropy; Markov processes; Maximum principle; Signal detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection algorithms; Contextual information; Correction models; Discriminative models; Discriminative random fields; Markov Random Fields; Maximum entropy principle; Multi-temporal image; algorithm; image analysis; information; maximum entropy analysis; numerical model; supervised learning; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Labeled and unlabeled information fusion; maximum entropy (ME) principle; MEDRF model; SAR image change detection; semisupervised classifier","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945908559"

Largearea landslides occurred and seriously threatened the lives of people and giant pandas. In this paper, we report the development of an enhanced multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MTInSAR) methodology to monitor potential post-seismic landslides by analyzing coherent scatterers (CS) and distributed scatterers (DS) points extracted from multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR data in an integrated manner. Through the integration of phase optimization and mitigation of the orbit and topography-related phase errors, surface deformations in the study area were derived: the rates in the line of sight (LOS) direction ranged from -7 to 1.5 cm/a. Dozens of potential landslides, distributed mainly along the Minjiang River, Longmenshan Fault, and in other the high-altitude areas were detected. These findings matched the distribution of previous landslides. InSAR-derived results demonstrated that some previous landslides were still active; many unstable slopes have developed, and there are significant probabilities of future massive failures. The impact of landslides on the giant panda habitat, however ranged from low to moderate, would continue to be a concern for conservationists for some time in the future. © 2015 by the authors.","Earthquakes; Ecosystems; Landslides; Distributed scatterer; Giant panda; Giant panda habitats; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Landslides monitoring; MTInSAR; PALSAR; Sichuan; Synthetic aperture radar","Distributed scatters; Giant panda; Landslide; MTInSAR; PALSAR; Sichuan","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937934101"

Limitations of optical data associatedwith non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet. A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments. The refinement rules are here explained by means of a detailed signature analysis of the SAR backscatter in such environments. The accuracy of the SAR-WBIwas 80%when compared against 2078 manually interpreted footprints with a size of 150 × 150 m2. Omission errors were primarily observed along coast- and shorelines whereas commission errors were associated with (i) ephemeral water bodies, (ii) seasonally inundated areas, and (iii) an incorrect choice of the local refinement. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Backscattering; Errors; Photomapping; Surface measurement; Systematic errors; C-bands; ENVISAT ASAR; Land cover; SAR; Waterbodies; algorithm; backscatter; Envisat; ephemeral lake; error analysis; global change; land cover; map generalization; observational method; spectral analysis; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; Synthetic aperture radar","Backscatter; C-band; Envisat ASAR; Land cover; SAR; Water body","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946542137"

Here, an alternative approach is presented to combine the overlapping segments of SAR images acquired at adjacent tracks and generate accurate and high spatiotemporal resolution map of the surface deformation field. To this end, a new approach is developed to unify the datums. Effects due to the difference in look angle between two overlapping tracks and atmospheric delay are estimated and removed using Kalman and wavelet-based filters. This approach is first tested at Hawaii Island, where tracks 200 and 429 of Envisat C-band satellite overlap over the Kilauea south flank. The obtained time series improves the temporal sampling rate by a factor of two and comparison with GPS time series demonstrates that the presented method accurately measures the nonlinear deformation field. The advantages of this method are further demonstrated by combining SAR data sets acquired by Envisat C-band and ALOS L-band satellites over the San Francisco Bay Area, California. The validation test shows that the seamless combination of C-band and L-band time series accurately measures the surface deformation at higher resolution.

Nowadays, several satellite missions are available providing interferometric SAR data at different wavelengths, spatial resolutions, and revisit time. A new interesting opportunity is provided by Sentinel-1 mission, which has a spatial resolution comparable to previous ESA C-band missions, and revisit times reduced to up to 6 days. It is envisioned that, by offering regular, global-scale coverage, improved temporal resolution and freely available imagery, Sentinel-1 will guarantee an increasing use of MTI for ground displacement investigations. According to these different SAR space-borne missions, the present work discusses current and future opportunities of MTI applications to ground instability monitoring. Issues related to coherent target detection and mean velocity precision will be addressed through a simple theoretical model assuming backscattering mechanisms related to point scatterers.

The four satellites were launched within June 2007 and November 2010 and currently the constellation is fully operational. Main mission objective is the provision of data, products and services relevant to the: 1. environmental monitoring, surveillance, risk and emergency management applications of institutional entities; 2. environmental resources management, rapid mapping, maritime management, multi-temporal acquisition for agriculture monitoring, earth topographic mapping, ship detection, interferometry, landslides monitoring, law enforcement, informative/science applications of other institutional, scientific and commercial entities; 3. monitoring, security and intelligence applications of Defense entities. To achieve this goal, COSMO-SkyMed system supports different imaging modes whit different characteristic. COSMO-SkyMed mission has been pioneering the operational use of a spacecraft constellation of SAR sensors for Earth Observation and it is still demonstrating day by day the operational advantages coming from the constellation providing data and services to Defense and Civilian (scientific and commercial) Users. Among the institutional users there are international partners, national and international Administrations, Agencies, Research Centers, etc.. A evidence of the Italian leading role in the Earth Observation sector is represented by the number of the on-going international cooperations and agreements with: European Space Agency (ESA), Japan (ASI-JAXA cooperation), France (ASI-CNES agreement), Argentina (ASI-CONAE cooperation), Canada (joint Announcement of Opportunity ASI-CSA), USA (ASI-JPL projects). ASI manages either a number of owner projects such as Open Call , PMI, Announcement of Opportunity, etc. or several projects based on signi-cant national and international cooperations. In the international context, a significant example of cooperation is represented by the strong support provided by ASI to ESA (European Space Agency). After the end of operational life of the ENVISAT satellite, ESA requested support both to ASI and DLR (German Aerospace Center - Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) in order to complete the projects in the framework of Dragon 3 Programme. Starting from August 2013, ASI provided and it is still providing for free an amount of about 1000 COSMO-SkyMed scenes per year, as institutional support. In the national framework a number of agreements for the COSMO-SkyMed products exploitation are ongoing or are under definition or have been concluded. An example of ASI National institutional projects is MAP ITALY: based on specific needs of the Italian Premiership - Department of Civil Protection and on direct input by ASI Presidency, COSMO-SkyMed system activated a full interferometric mapping service of the whole National territory based on every-16 days Stripmap Himage acquisitions. Furthermore ASI is developing COSMO-SkyMed Seconda Generazione with aim to assure the X-band data continuity at least for the next decade, improving performance and functionalities of COSMO-SkyMed.

Previous analyses of surface deformation data suggested an exponential decay of the pressure in the mud source but did not constrain the location, geometry, and evolution of the possible source(s) of the erupting mud and fluids. To map the surface deformation, we employ multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar and analyze a well-populated L-band data set acquired by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) between May 2006 and April 2011. We then apply a time-dependent inverse modeling scheme. Volume changes occur in two regions beneath Lusi, at 0.3-2.0km and 3.5-4.75km depth. The cumulative volume change within the shallow source is ∼2-3 times larger than that of the deep source. The observation and model suggest that a shallow source plays a key role by supplying the erupting mud, but that additional fluids do ascend from depths >4km on eruptive timescales.

Unsustainable practices of urbanization bring major implications for land and environment, and cause a dramatic increase of urban vulnerability to natural hazards. In Istanbul megacity, disaster risk reduction represents a challenging issue for urban managers. In this paper, we show the relevance of the space-borne Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) technique as a tool for supporting risk management, and thus contributing to achieve the urban sustainability. To this aim, we use a dataset of high resolution SAR images collected by the TerraSAR-X satellite that have been processed through the advanced (multi-temporal) Small BAseline Subset (SBAS)-DInSAR technique, thus producing spatially-dense deformation velocity maps and associated time-series. Results allow to depict an up-to-date picture of surface deformations occurring in Istanbul, and thus to identify urban areas subject to potential risk. The joint analysis of remotely sensed measurements and ancillary data (geological and urban development information) provides an opportunity for city planners and land professionals to discuss on the mutual relationship between urban development policies and natural/man-made hazards. © 2015 by the authors.","Deformation; Hazards; Interferometry; Planning; Risk management; Risks; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban growth; Urban planning; Differential SAR interferometry; Istanbul; Small baseline subsets; Turkey; Urbanization; Space-based radar","Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR); Hazard; Istanbul; Risk; Small BAseline Subset (SBAS); Turkey; urban deformations; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979293945"

The focus of the presented study is two-fold: 1) to evaluate the applicability of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery for multiresolution segmentation, and 2) to identify suitable Scale Parameters through different weighing of different homogeneity criteria, mainly colour variance. Multiresolution segmentation was used for segmentation of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X imagery, and the ESP (Estimation of Scale Parameter) tool was used to identify suitable Scale Parameters for image segmentation. The validation of the segmentation results was performed using very high resolution WorldView-2 imagery and a reference map, which was created by an ecological expert. The results of multiresolution segmentation revealed that in the context of object-based image analysis the TerraSAR-X images are applicable for generating optimal image objects. Furthermore, ESP tool can be used as an indicator for estimation of Scale Parameter for multiresolution segmentation of TerraSAR-X imagery. Additionally, for more reliable results, this study suggests that the homogeneity criterion of colour, in a variance based segmentation algorithm, needs to be set to high values. Setting the shape/colour criteria to 0.005/0.995 or 0.00/1 led to the best results and to the creation of adequate image objects.","Data mining; Image analysis; Parameter estimation; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Scales (weighing instruments); Synthetic aperture radar; Multiresolution segmentation; Object based image analysis; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Scale parameter; Segmentation algorithms; Segmentation results; TerraSAR-X; Very high resolution; Image segmentation","Estimation of scale parameter (ESP); Multiresolution segmentation; Object based image analysis (OBIA); TerraSAR-X","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974533917"

In the central part of the Eastern Desert of Egypt, Wadi Matula is a dry stream course much like those in the rest of the Sahara. It covers an area of about 7,500 km2. Radarsat-1 images, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data revealed paleodrainage systems and fault/fracture zones. Its trends display cross-cutting relationships. Interrupted surface runoff connections are inferred from block movements, tectonic capture processes, diverted valleys, and paleodrainage. The movements of the blocks led to newly formed drainage and caused disturbances in drainage orientations, topography, fractures, and stream density. Paleodrainage and the more recent drainage lines are superposed on weakness zones of major fractures and faults. These zones facilitated the hydrologic processes that caused erosion and downcutting. The intersection points of paleochannel courses, fracture/fault systems, and active streams must have increased the possibilities of groundwater accumulations. Accordingly, several exploration wells are suggested, which they represent the best abstraction sites of groundwater potentials. These predicted sites are consistent with the high potential zone of the groundwater prospect map. Thick fluvial deposits support that past pluvial events recharged the underlying aquifers. It is concluded that locations of paleodrainage, fractures/faults, and stream intersections are the best sites for groundwater resources; thus, radar images are powerful tools for mapping multi-temporal near-surface features in arid regions. © 2014, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","","GIS; Groundwater; Radar data; Tectonics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939886196"

We applied the Random Forests algorithm to classify dual-pol SAR images and polarimetric descriptors derived from two full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 C-band images acquired during the low and high water seasons of Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain, lower Amazon, Brazil. We used the Kappa index of agreement (κ), Allocation Disagreement (AD) and Quantity Disagreement (QD), and Producer's and User's accuracy measurements to assess the classification results. Our results showed that single-season full-polarimetric C-band data can yield more accurate classifications than single-season dual-pol C-band SAR imagery and similar accuracies to dual-season dual-pol C-band SAR classifications. Still, dual-season PolSAR achieved the highest accuracies, showing that seasonality is paramount for obtaining high accuracies in wetland land cover classification, regardless of SAR image type. On average, single-season classifications of low-water periods were less accurate than high-water classifications, likely due to plant phenology and flooding conditions. Classifications using model-based polarimetric decompositions (such as Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi and van Zyl) produced the highest accuracies (κ greater than 0.8; AD ranging from 7.5% to 2.5%; QD ranging from 15% to 12%), while eigenvector-based decompositions such as Touzi and Cloude-Pottier had the worst accuracies (κ ranging from 0.5 to 0.7; AD greater than 10%; QD smaller than 10%). Vegetation types with dense canopies (Shrubs, Floodable Forests and Emergent Macrophytes), whose classification is challenging using C-band, were accurately classified using dual-season full-polarimetric SAR data, with Producer's and User's accuracies between 80% and 90%.

In the proposed method, we estimate spatially and temporally high resolution of PW, and calculate atmospheric delay at each pixel with estimated PW.

First, initial building height estimates are extracted from WorldView-2 stereo images and multitemporal SAR images. These initial results are then combined using a novel object-based fusion approach, in which the heights of points for the same building footprint are retrieved and integrated. Experiments on the Mong Kok area of Hong Kong showed that the proposed approach using both data sets outperforms the use of either stereo images or SAR images alone.

The small surface deformations on such PS points are estimated. PSI particularly works well in monitoring human settlements because regular substructures of man-made objects give rise to large number of PS points. If such structures and/or substructures substantially alter or even vanish due to big change like construction, their PS points are discarded without additional explorations during standard PSI procedure. Such rejected points are called big change (BC) points. On the other hand, incoherent change detection (ICD) relies on local comparison of multi-temporal images (e.g. image difference, image ratio) to highlight scene modifications of larger size rather than detail level. However, image noise inevitably degrades ICD accuracy. We propose a change detection approach based on PSI to synergize benefits of PSI and ICD. PS points are extracted by PSI procedure. A local change index is introduced to quantify probability of a big change for each point. We propose an automatic thresholding method adopting change index to extract BC points along with a clue of the period they emerge. In the end, PS ad BC points are integrated into a change detection image. Our method is tested at a site located around north of Berlin main station where steady, demolished, and erected building substructures are successfully detected. The results are consistent with ground truth derived from time-series of aerial images provided by Google Earth. In addition, we apply our technique for traffic infrastructure, business district, and sports playground monitoring. © 2016 Copernicus GmbH.

This paper reports the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement results derived from 31 Envisat ASAR images acquired over Hang zhou from 2006 to 2010, with special focus on the seawall in the Qiantang Estuary. Multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) was used to extract deformation information from both Persistent Scatterers (PSs) and Distributed Scatterers (DSs), which provide dense measurement of the deformation of the seawall. Compared with the leveling measurement at 28 points, the mean error derived by InSAR is 0.436 mm, with the largest error of 5.016 mm, which confirms the millimeter-level precision and accuracy of the InSAR technique. A time series analysis was conducted based on these two datasets, and results showed that the subsidence of seawalls was spatially continuous and had a local negative unimodal pattern with distance. A linear tendency with minor local fluctuation was also observed in the time domain during a period of nearly seven years. ©, 2015, Science Press.

It stores water in winter and releases it in spring during the melting season. Monitoring snow cover and its variability is thus of great importance for a proactive management of water-resources. Of particular interest is the identification of snowmelt processes, which could significantly support water administration, flood prediction and prevention. In the past years, remote sensing has demonstrated to be an essential tool for providing accurate inputs to hydrological models concerning the spatial and temporal variability of snow. Even though the analysis of snow pack can be conducted in the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared spectrum, the presence of clouds during the melting season, which may be pervasive in some parts of the World (e.g., polar regions), renders impossible the regular acquisition of information needed for the operational purposes. Therefore, the use of the microwave sensors, which signal can penetrate the clouds, can be an asset for the detection of snow proprieties. In particular, the SAR images have demonstrated to be effective and robust measurements to identify the wet snow. Among the several methods presented in the literature, the best results in wet snow mapping have been achieved by the bi-temporal change detection approach proposed by Nagler and Rott [1], or its slight improvements presented afterwards (e.g., [2]). Nonetheless, with the introduction of the Sentinel-1 by ESA, which provides free-of-charge SAR images every 6 days over the same geographical area with a resolution of 20m, the scientists have the opportunity to better investigate and improve the state-of-the-art methods for wet snow detection. In this work, we propose a novel method based on a supervised learning approach able to exploit both the experience of the state-of-the-art algorithms and the high multi-temporal information provided by the Sentinel-1 data. In detail, this is done by training the proposed method with examples extracted by [1] and refine this information by deriving additional training for the complex cases where the state-of-the-art algorithm fails. In addition, the multi-temporal information is fully exploited by modelling it as a series of statistical moments. Indeed, with a proper time sampling, statistical moments can describe the shape of the probability density function (pdf) of the backscattering time series ([3-4]). Given the description of the shape of the multi-temporal VV and VH backscattering pdfs, it is not necessary to explicitly identify which time instants in the time series are to be assigned to the reference image as done in the bi-temporal approach. This information is implicit in the shape of the pdf and it is used in the training procedure for solving the wet snow detection problem based on the available training samples. The proposed approach is designed to work in an alpine environment and it is validated considering ground truth measurements provided by automatic weather stations that record snow depth and snow temperature over 10 sites deployed in the South Tyrol region in northern Italy. © 2016 SPIE..","Backscattering; Image processing; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Melting; Microwave sensors; Probability density function; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Sampling; Signal processing; Snow melting systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Water management; Water resources; Weather information services; Automatic weather stations; Natural water resources; Proactive management; Probability density function (pdf); Spatial and temporal variability; State-of-the-art algorithms; State-of-the-art methods; Supervised learning approaches; Snow","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011391976"

Deforestation and degradation of forests lead to carbon emissions, which should be prevented or minimized by protecting forests. Radar remote sensing has proven to be particularly useful to monitor forests especially in the tropics due to weather and daytime independence. Radar data from the TanDEM-X mission provide a potential opportunity to monitor large areas of tropical forests due to the multi-temporal global coverage and the high resolution. Tropical peat swamp forests are difficult to access and thus high effort to conduct field measurements is necessary. Therefore, aboveground biomass was estimated from a limited amount of in-situ measurements of relatively undisturbed peat swamp forest and a LiDAR based canopy height model to achieve a representative amount of biomass estimates for radar analysis. The LiDAR and field measurements resulted in an identical estimate of mean biomass and thus provided a reliable source to correlate with SAR (synthetic aperture radar) features from the TanDEM-X mission and ultimately up-scale the found relation to the entire study site. The relationship of interferometric coherence of the bistatic TanDEM-X data showed a moderate to high correlation with the biomass (R2=0.5) and RMSE of 53t/ha corresponding to a biomass range from 183 to 495t/ha. Thus, it could be used to indicate forest degradation areas, which are characterized by larger opening of the canopy cover and thus lower biomass. The results indicate that interferometric coherence is useful for quantification of aboveground biomass in tropical peat swamp forest. TanDEM-X coherence can at minimum serve as a stratification to assess spatial distribution of qualitative biomass classes in the context of REDD+ monitoring, reporting, and verification schemes and for the identification of forest degradation areas. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Specifically, we used TerraSAR-X (TSX, X-band, HH polarization) and Sentinel-1A (S1A, C-band, VV and VH polarizations) data from two cropping seasons: 2015 wet season (WS, June to October) and 2016 dry season (DS, October to February) in Central Luzon, Philippines. A total of 130 TSX and 80 S1A images were used to map rice areas in these two seasons. We used the image processing software MAPscape-RICE® to process SAR images and to generate the rice maps. The procedure involved three main steps: (1) basic processing, (2) rice area mapping, and (3) validation. In basic processing (step 1), original SAR data were converted to terrain-geocoded images (backscatter δo values). The multi-temporal SAR signature from step 1 were then analysed to set the appropriate thresholds following a rule-based rice detection algorithm (step 2). The rules for rice detection were based on a well-studied temporal signature of rice gathered from monitored sites and its relationship with SAR backscatter. Although the same procedure was followed, different thresholds were applied to the SAR data. Accuracies were compared using ground observations collected towards the end of each growing season (step 3). Based on 126 ground observations gathered in the study area in 2015 WS, the overall accuracies of the rice maps generated were 86% (kappa=0.71) for TSX, 80% (kappa=0.60) for S1A-VV, and 76% (kappa=0.52) for S1A-VH. In 2016 DS, the overall accuracies based on 132 ground observations were 86% for TSX, 82% for S1A-VV and 70% for S1A-VH. From this study, TSX consistently provided the highest accuracies and S1A-VH the lowest. S1A-VH may not be useful for mapping rice areas. S1A-VV, on the other hand, still provided high accuracies. Better thresholds will be explored to improve accuracies.","Backscattering; Image processing; Mapping; Polarization; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Detection algorithm; Ground observations; Image-processing software; Overall accuracies; Rice mapping; Sentinel-1; Temporal signatures; TerraSAR-X; Radar imaging","Radar; Rice mapping; Sentinel-1A; TerraSAR-X","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018951615"

The main goal of this paper is to investigate the new Staring Spotlight TerraSAR-X mode capabilities to monitor land degradation in Rosia Jiu opencast area taking into account the mining engineering standards and specifications. The second goal is to relate mining activities with spatio-temporal dynamics of land degradation by using differential Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (DInSAR). The experimental analysis was carried out on data acquired in the LAN-2277 scientific proposal framework during 2014-2015 period. A set of 25 very height resolution SAR data gathered in the VV polarisation mode with a resolution of 0.45 m x 0.16m and an incidence angle of 370 have been used in this study. Preliminary results showed that altered terrain topography with steep slopes and deep pits has led to the layover of radar signal. Initially, ambiguous results have been obtained due to the highly dynamic character of subsidence induced by activities which imply mass mining methods. By increasing the SAR data number, the land degradation assessment has been improved. Most of the interferometric pairs have low coherence therefore the product coherence threshold was set to 0.3. A coherent and non-coherent analysis is performed to delineate land cover changes and complement the deformation model. Thus, the environmental impact of mining activities is better studied. Moreover, the monitoring of changes in pit depths, heights of stock-piles and waste dumps and levels of tailing dumps provide additional information about production data.","Environmental impact assessments; Interferometry; Mining; Mining engineering; Radar; Remote sensing; Satellites; Standards; Synthetic aperture radar; Weather satellites; D-inSAR; Environment; Mining areas; Multi-temporal SAR; Staring Spotlight mode; Environmental impact","DInSAR analysis; Environment; Multi-temporal SAR data; Rosia Jiu mining area; TerraSAR-X staring spotlight mode","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979516738"

The rationale is to detect the so-called persistent scatterers, which are characterized by preserving their phase quality along the multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images available. Two criteria are mainly available for the estimation of pixels' phase quality, i.e., the coherence stability and the amplitude dispersion or permanent scatterers (PS) approach. The coherence stability method allows an accurate estimation of the phase statistics, even when a reduced number of SAR acquisitions is available. Unfortunately, it requires the multi-looking of data during the coherence estimation, leading to a spatial resolution loss in the final results. In contrast, the PS approach works at full-resolution, but it demands a larger number of SAR images to be reliable, typically more than 20. There is hence a clear limitation when a full-resolution PSI processing is to be carried out and the number of acquisitions available is small. In this context, a novel pixel selection method based on exploiting the spectral properties of point-like scatterers, referred to as temporal sublook coherence (TSC), has been recently proposed. This paper seeks to demonstrate the advantages of employing PSI techniques by means of TSC on both orbital and ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) data when the number of images available is small (10 images in the work presented). The displacement maps retrieved through the proposed technique are compared, in terms of pixel density and phase quality, with traditional criteria. Two X-band datasets composed of 10 sliding spotlight TerraSAR-X images and 10 GB-SAR images, respectively, over the landslide of El Forn de Canillo (Andorran Pyrenees), are employed for this study. For both datasets, the TSC technique has showed an excellent performance compared with traditional techniques, achieving up to a four-fold increase in the number of persistent scatters detected, compared with the coherence stability approach, and a similar density compared with the PS approach, but free of outliers. © 2014 by the authors.","Coherent scattering; Interferometry; Pixels; Radar; Stability criteria; Differential SAR interferometry; Ground-based sar; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Persistent scatterers; Spotlight; Temporal sublook coherence (TSC); Synthetic aperture radar","Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR); Ground-based SAR (GB-SAR); Persistent scatterer; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Spotlight; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR); Temporal sublook coherence (TSC)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920807217"

Fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) has the potential to identify the type of scattering mechanism changes induced by urban damage. In radar polarimetry, dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism in urban areas is primarily induced by the ground-wall structures. Thereby, within an urban patch, the reduction of the dominant double-bounce scattering mechanism reflects the urban damage level in terms of destroyed ground-wall structures, which is the basis of this study. Based on our previous study, the proposed polarimetric index is further investigated. A rapid urban damage mapping technique including mainly two steps of urban area extraction and damage level index estimation is proposed. The 3.11 East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami is adopted as the study case using multi-temporal ALOS/PALSAR PolSAR data.

Among several innovative space-based remote-sensing techniques, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multitemporal interferometry (MTI) hold the most promise, because of its capacities and strengths: (1) wide-area coverage (tens of thousands of square kilometers) combined with a high spatial resolution (up to 1. m for the new generation of radar sensors) and hence the possibility of conducting multiscale investigations with the same data sets (from regional to slope-specific); (2) systematic, high-frequency (from a few days to weeks) measurements over long periods (years); (3) a high precision of surface displacement measurements (millimeters-centimeters) only marginally affected by poor weather conditions; (4) cost effectiveness, especially in the case of long-term, large-area investigations (catchment to regional scale); and (5) integration of landslide monitoring (based on new satellite imagery) with retrospective studies (archived imagery) to investigate slope failure history or landslide reactivation/acceleration processes. We illustrate the potential of MTI and explain how it can be used to detect and monitor landslide motion by considering applications in areas with a broad range of geomorphic, climatic, and vegetation conditions. The chosen examples of local-to-catchment-scale MTI case studies focus on unstable hill slopes and landslides in the Apennines (Italy), the European Alps, and on the island of Haiti. The potential of MTI is further assessed by also considering the strengths and limitations of other innovative applications of remote sensing in landslide monitoring, which rely on several recent or emerging techniques: Corner Reflector SAR interferometry, which. exploits artificial targets installed on the ground and radar satellite imagery; ground-based InSAR; air- and ground-borne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR); and air/space-borne image matching. These applications, however, typically focus on single failed slopes and their use for regular, wide-area mapping of ground surface changes is at present economically prohibitive. We foresee that MTI will make landslide monitoring more effective and more affordable in more situations, and will become increasingly more important in cases where little or no conventional monitoring is feasible (e.g., remote locations and limited funds). We also expect that the role of prevention in slope hazard management can be enhanced by capitalizing more on the presently underexploited advantage of MTI, that is, its ability to regularly provide vast amounts of quantitative information on slope/ground stability conditions in large areas currently unaffected (or thought to be unaffected) by landslides, but where the terrain geomorphology and geology may indicate potential for future failures. Finally, we stress that high spatial and temporal resolution satellite remote sensing of ground deformations open new possibilities for landslide research and for more timely and detailed slope hazard assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Due to that crop acreage information is the important basis for making national food policy and economy plan, therefore, it is very important that conduct the study on crop identification. In view of the advantages of high temporal resolution, wide coverage and low cost, remote sensing has been used in a wide arrange of earth observation activities and thus provides a useful tool for crop recognition and planting acreage monitoring at a large scale. Since the 1980's, optical remote sensing has been widely used to identify various crops, however, optical images are not often available in the key growth period of crops, owing to the cloudy and rainy weather. Thus, it has a negative effect on the accuracy and timeliness of crop area monitoring. As a new high-technology with an advantage of all-weather, all-time, high resolution and wide coverage, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely applied in agricultural condition monitoring field and thus provides a strong complement and support for crop identification in data and technology aspect. As the updating and improvement of function parameters and performance index of radar sensors, it has been an important field of agriculture remote sensing that getting the information of crop sown acreage, growing condition and yield by SAR. In this paper, according to a mainline that the development progress of radar technology in the recent twenty years, the progress of studies and applications on crop discrimination by SAR is systematically summarized, and the conclusion includes 4 aspects: the first is early studies (from the late 1980's to 2002), are characterized by using single band, single polarization and multi-temporal SAR data for crop identification; The second is crop acreage monitoring based on multi-polarization, multiband SAR data, furthermore, the section can be divided into 2 subsections: one is crop recognition by multi-polarization SAR, the other is using multiple SAR sensors to crop classification; The third is studies on improving the accuracy and efficiency of crop identification by combining SAR with optical remote sensing; The last is the studies on crop classification algorithm using SAR data. According to the summary of previous studies, the problems existing in the crop identification by SAR can be analyzed as follows: the first is that crop type identified by SAR are still single; the second is that the accuracies of crop identification are not high yet; the last is that mechanism studies on classification algorithm are lack. Furthermore, the development trends are presented in this study. Dry-land crop discrimination using SAR images under a complex crop planting structure, improving the accuracy and timeliness of crop identification by optimizing the operational parameters (e.g. polarization, frequency and incidence angle) of SAR system and combining with optical remote sensing, developing the mechanism-based algorithm of crop classification will be 3 contents urgently need to be studied in the future. © 2015 IEEE.","Agriculture; Algorithms; Condition monitoring; Geometrical optics; Parameter estimation; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Agricultural conditions; Classification algorithm; Crop identification; High temporal resolution; Multi-polarization; Multiband; Operational parameters; Optical remote sensing; Crops","classification algorithm; crop identification; multi-polarization; multiband; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960425618"

The empirical and semi-empirical model-based soil moisture inversion approach developed in the past are either sensor or region specific, vegetation type specific or have limited validity range, and have limited scope to explain physical scattering processes. Hence, there is need for more robust, physical polarimetric radar backscatter model-based retrieval methods, which are sensor & location independent and have wide range of validity over soil properties. In the present study, Integral Equation Model (IEM) and Vector Radiative Transfer (VRT) model were used to simulate averaged backscatter coefficients in various soil moisture ( dry, moist and wet soil), soil roughness (smooth to very rough) and crop conditions (low to high vegetation water contents) over selected regions of Gujarat state of India and the results were compared with multi-temporal Radar Imaging Satellite-1 (RISAT-1) C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in HH and HV polarizations, in sync with on field measured soil and crop conditions.

Identification and characterization of vegetation formations is generally conducted at a fine scale using ecological ground surveys, which are limited to small areas. While optical remotely sensed imagery is limited to cloud-free periods, SAR time-series are used more extensively for wetland mapping and characterization using the relationship between distribution of vegetation formations and flood duration. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number and key dates of SAR images to be classified to map wetland vegetation formations at a 1:10,000 scale. A series of eight dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images (HH/VV) was acquired in 2013 during dry and wet seasons in temperate climate conditions. One polarimetric parameter was extracted first, the Shannon entropy, which varies with wetland flooding status and vegetation roughness. Classification runs of all the possible combinations of SAR images using different k (number of images) subsets were performed to determine the best combinations of the Shannon entropy images to identify wetland vegetation formations. The classification runs were performed using Support Vector Machine techniques and were then analyzed using the McNemar test to investigate significant differences in the accuracy of all classification runs based on the different image subsets. The results highlight the relevant periods (i.e. late winter, spring and beginning of summer) for mapping vegetation formations, in accordance with ecological studies. They also indicate that a relationship can be established between vegetation formations and hydrodynamic processes with a short time-series of satellite images (i.e. 5 dates). This study introduces a new approach for herbaceous wetland monitoring using SAR polarimetric imagery. This approach estimates the number and key dates required for wetland management (e.g. restoration) and biodiversity studies using remote sensing data. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

A sequence of ALOS PALSAR and TerraSAR-X images acquired between January 2007 and April 2008 captured the wetlands in three successive phases: dry, wet and transitional. Visual observation of multi-temporal and multi-frequency SAR backscatter data confirmed the capacity of SAR to respond to changes in surface water, soil moisture and biomass. Longer wavelength L-band SAR provides a tool for discriminating wetlands, mapping surface water and detecting below-canopy inundation. Shorter wavelength X-band SAR provides a tool for detecting flushes in growth of vegetation in response to higher soil moisture from flooding. PALSAR data demonstrated a high capacity for discrimination of different wetland classes, while TerraSAR-X data was less suited to discriminating between cover types. The integration of X- and L-band data revealed the extent of floodplain inundation and presence of aquatic vegetation in ponded areas. Given a stable, well-calibrated time-series of SAR data, change analysis provides a mechanism for understanding the hydrological and/or ecological change in an area. In the longer term, it is envisioned that radar will provide a valuable tool within an operational system for monitoring the impact of environmental flows in NSW inland wetlands. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","","ALOS PALSAR; Environmental flows; Inundation; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939890200"

Firstly, the difference image between two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the same area taken at two different times is obtained using the standard log-ratio operator. Secondly, a preprocessing step of anisotropic diffusion is applied to the difference image. Thirdly, Gaussian Mixture Model is used for segmentation of the difference image in which the parameters are estimated using Expectation algorithm. The standard GMM considers each pixel as independent and hence the segmentation is sensitive to speckle noise present in the SAR images. To incorporate the spatial information in segmentation, anisotropic preprocessing is done and also the posterior probability computed in the M step is weighted with the mean filter. The proposed method is tested on four sets of multi-temporal images. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in obtaining higher change detection accuracies compared to the related methods. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","","Expectation maximization; Gaussian mixture model; SAR image change detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930146210"

This method starts with transforming input data into the higher dimensional space using kernel functions and then clustering them in the feature space. Feature space, due to its inherent properties, has the ability to take in account the nonlinear and complex nature of polarimetric data. Several SAR polarimetric features extracted using target decomposition algorithms. Features from Cloude-Pottier, Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi algorithms used as inputs for the clustering.

Nevertheless, major uncertainty exists about the way in which alluvial forms respond to this process. In this study, morphological and lithostratigraphic data have been combined with advanced differential interferometry (A-DInSAR) to detect changes in alluvial landform elevations and to verify the existence of a differential subsidence pattern influenced by active sedimentary dynamics. For this purpose, the middle reach of the Segura River valley (Vega Media of the Segura River), in southeast Spain, was chosen as the study area. The Vega Media of the Segura River is an alluvial area affected by subsidence processes in close conjunction with depositional conditions, ground-water withdrawals and faults. A high scale mapping of the main younger sedimentary units was carried out by combining multi-temporal aerial photographs, high-resolution digital elevation models derived from LIDAR data, global navigation satellite system data and fieldwork. In addition, lithostratigraphic descriptions were obtained from geotechnical drilling and trenching. Finally, ground surface displacements, measured using A-DInSAR for the periods 1995-2005 and 2004-2008, allowed the determination of elevation rates and ground deformation associated with the different alluvial units. The results from this analysis revealed four typical deformational behaviours: non-deformational units (cemented alluvial fans and upper fluvial terraces); slightly deformable units (lower terraces and old abandoned meanders); moderately deformable units (lateral accretion zones and abandoned meanders before channelisation in 1981); and highly deformable areas (recently active meanders associated with artificial cutoffs by channelisation, non-active floodplains and spilling zones). © 2016 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Segura River; Spain; aerial photograph; alluvial deposit; deformation mechanism; digital elevation model; fluvial geomorphology; geomorphological response; lidar; lithostratigraphy; radar interferometry; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar","A-DInSAR; Alluvial sediments; Land subsidence; Lithostratigraphy; Morphological units; Spain; Vega media of the segura river","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959419557"

Reliable and regular information on the area under rice production is the basis of policy decisions related to imports, exports and prices which directly affect food security. Recent and planned launches of SAR sensors coupled with automated processing can provide sustainable solutions to the challenges on mapping and monitoring rice systems. High resolution (3m) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries were used to map and monitor rice growing areas in selected three sites in TamilNadu, India to determine rice cropping extent, track rice growth and estimate yields. A simple, robust, rule-based classification for mapping rice area with multi-temporal, X-band, HH polarized SAR imagery from COSMO Skymed and TerraSAR X and site specific parameters were used. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated on a very large dataset involving 30 images across 3 footprints obtained during 2013-14. A total of 318 in-season site visits were conducted across 60 monitoring locations for rice classification and 432 field observations were made for accuracy assessment. Rice area and Start of Season (SoS) maps were generated with classification accuracies ranging from 87-92 per cent. Using ORYZA2000, a weather driven process based crop growth simulation model; yield estimates were made with the inclusion of rice crop parameters derived from the remote sensing products viz., seasonal rice area, SoS and backscatter time series.

In this paper, we present a method to enhance PSInSAR using polarimetric optimization method on multi-temporal polarimetric SAR data. The optimization process has been implemented to minimize the Amplitude dispersion Index (ADI) of pixels in SAR images over the time based on the best scattering mechanism. We evaluated the method on a dataset including 17 dual polarization SAR data (HH/VV) acquired by TerraSAR-X data from July 2013 to January 2014 over Tehran plain, Iran. The area has been affected by high rate (> 20 cm/yr.) of surface subsidence due to groundwater overexploitation. The effectiveness of the method is compared for both agricultural and urban regions affected by land subsidence. Furthermore single pole and optimized polarization results are compared together and with external observations from GPS measurements. The results reveal that using optimum scattering mechanism decreases the ADI values in urban and non-urban regions and increase the PS Candidate pixels (PSC) about three times and subsequently improves the PS density about 50% more than using single channel datasets.","Dispersions; Groundwater; Pixels; Polarization; Remote sensing; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Amplitude dispersion; Dual-polarization SAR; Groundwater overexploitation; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Persistent scatterers; Polarimetric optimization; Polarimetric SAR data; PS-InSAR; Polarimeters","Amplitude dispersion index (ADI); Persistent scatterer candidate; Polarimetric optimization; PSInSAR","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974604652"

We present a novel pixel-based Multi-sensor Time-series correlation and Fusion approach (MulTiFuse) that exploits the full observation density of optical and SAR time series. We model the relationship of two overlapping univariate time series using an optimized weighted correlation. The resulting optimized regression model is used to predict and fuse two time series. Using the MulTiFuse approach we fused Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter time series. We subsequently used the fused time series in a multi-sensor change detection framework to detect deforestation between 01/2008 - 09/2010 at a managed forest plantation in the tropics (Pinus caribea; 2859ha). 3-monthly reference data covering the entire study area was used to validate and assess spatial and temporal accuracy. We tested the impact of persistent cloud cover by increasing the per-pixel missing data percentage of the NDVI time series stepwise from ~53% (~6 observations/year) up to 95% (~0.5 observation/year) while fusing with a consistent PALSAR time series of ~2 observations/year. A significant linear correlation was found between the Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band SAR time series observables for logged forest. The multi-temporal filtered PALSAR HVHH backscatter ratio time series (HVHHmt) was most strongly correlated with the NDVI time series. While for Landsat-only the spatial and temporal accuracy of detected deforestation decreased significantly with increasing missing data, the accuracies for the fused NDVI-PALSAR case remained high and were observed to be above the NDVI- and PALSAR-only cases for all missing data percentages. For the fused NDVI-HVHHmt time series the overall accuracy was 95.5% with a 1.59month mean time lag of detected changes.

Moreover, ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence have yet to be used together to delineate GSV. Due to the observation strategy and the high acquisition success rate over Eurasia, a large amount of high quality ALOS PALSAR L-band data is available over Siberia. Consequently, this paper investigates the capability of ALOS PALSAR backscatter and InSAR coherence for the estimation of GSV in Central Siberia, Russia. The potential of backscatter and coherence are directly compared using the same inventory data. Altogether, 87 PALSAR images are used and eleven forest inventory sites are investigated. Based on this large dataset it was observed that InSAR coherence acquired in frozen conditions offers the highest potential for GSV estimation. The saturation level for single coherence images was on average 230m3/ha, with an average R2 between coherence and GSV of 0.58. PALSAR backscatter acquired in unfrozen conditions could also estimate GSV; however, the saturation levels (75-100m3/ha) and the average R2 (0.42-0.48) were lower. HV backscatter offered only a slightly greater potential than HH backscatter.A simple inversion approach aiming at the delineation of forest GSV maps based on the multitemporal SAR data was developed and applied to five forest inventory sites. This approach combines HV backscatter data acquired in unfrozen conditions and InSAR coherence data acquired in frozen conditions. In general, the produced maps feature a corrected relative RMSEcorr of <30% which was similar to the accuracy of the forest inventory data.

For this purpose, fourteen Envisat ASAR acquisitions from July 2004 to December 2006 were calibrated and registered. We applied a temporal filter and spatial averaging to the backscatter intensity to reduce the noise. Furthermore, we used the concept that the changes between different backscatter intensity observations can show changes on the target dielectric properties. In order to detect changes due to geometrical characteristics of land cover types, we created coherence maps using twenty-seven interferometric pairs with proper spatial and temporal baselines. In all calculations, layover and shadow effects, as well as the sea, were masked by using information from the digital elevation model of the area. The observed changes in the coherence values were analyzed with respect to different decorrelation factors that can contribute to the loss of coherence. Our results present the different backscatter values for several land cover types (farmland, olive groves, forests, etc.). In addition, some land cover types such as olive groves show variations of backscatter signal due to the density and height of trees. Furthermore, olive groves show good coherence in interferograms with short time intervals. All interferometric pairs have low coherence in farmland because of the rapid growth of plants. Finally, the maps of backscatter temporal changes and coherence changes were superimposed and compared to auxiliary data such as multi-temporal optical satellite imagery (i.e. Landsat/ETM, Terra/Aqua MODIS) and thematic land cover maps (Corinne 2000). We found that changes are mostly due to plant growth and man-made activity.

An additional challenge to optical sensors is the high cloud cover and unpredictable weather conditions. Longwave microwave data, with its low sensitivity to clouds addresses some of these problems, but many space borne studies are still limited by low quality structural reference data. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) derived canopy cover and height metrics can improve aboveground biomass (AGB) prediction at both plot and landscape level. To date, few studies have explored the strength of TLS for vegetation structural mapping, and particularly few focusing on savannas. In this study, we evaluate the potential of high resolution TLS-derived canopy cover and height metrics to estimate plot-level aboveground biomass, and to extrapolate to a landscape-wide biomass estimation using multi-temporal L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) within a 9 km2 area savanna in Kruger National Park (KNP). We inventoried 42 field plots in the wet season and computed AGB for each plot using site-specific allometry. Canopy cover, canopy height, and their product were regressed with plot-level AGB over the TLS-footprint, while SAR backscatter was used to model dry season biomass for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 for the study area. The results from model validation showed a significant linear relationship between TLS-derived predictors with field biomass, p < 0.05 and adjusted R2 ranging between 0.56 for SAR to 0.93 for the TLS-derived canopy cover and height. Log-transformed AGB yielded lower errors with TLS metrics compared with non-transformed AGB. An assessment of the backscatter based on root mean square error (RMSE) showed better AGB prediction with cross-polarized (RMSE = 6.6 t/ha) as opposed to co-polarized data (RMSE = 6.7 t/ha), attributed to volume scattering of woody vegetation along river valleys and streams. The AGB change analysis showed 32 ha (3.5%) of the 900 ha experienced AGB loses above an average of 5 t/ha per annum, which can mainly be attributed to the falling of trees by mega herbivores such as elephants. The study concludes that SAR data, especially L-band SAR, can be used in the detection of small changes in savanna vegetation over time. © 2016 by the authors.","Biomass; Forest Canopy; Remote Sensing; Kruger National Park; South Africa; Elephantidae; Backscattering; Biology; Biomass; Laser applications; Mapping; Mean square error; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Seebeck effect; Synthetic aperture radar; Thallium; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Above-ground woody biomass; Change analysis; Heterogeneous distributions; L-band SAR; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Optical remote sensing data; Terrestrial laser scanners; aboveground biomass; ALOS; assessment method; PALSAR; remote sensing; satellite data; savanna; vegetation mapping; Surveying instruments","Aboveground biomass; Change analysis; L-band SAR; TLS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007330511"

Its information is also essential for many applications, such as agricultural drought monitoring, crop status monitoring and crop yield prediction. Sentinel-1 of the European Space Agency (ESA) is composed of 2 satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, which share the same orbital plane with a 180° orbital phasing difference. The Sentinel-1 mission can provide C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a global revisit time of just 6 days and high spatial resolution of about tens of meters, thus showing a strong potential for global soil moisture monitoring at high/moderate spatial resolutions. The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data with a short repeating cycle in soil moisture estimation over agricultural fields. In order to retrieve soil moisture, an algorithm based on the change detection technique was utilized. This algorithm (referred to as alpha approximation approach) relies on the assumptions that the contributions of vegetation and surface roughness to the radar backscattered signal are multiplicative. Therefore, the effects of vegetation and surface roughness on radar backscattering coefficients can be decoupled from the effects of soil moisture changes by rationing multi-temporal like-polarized (HH and VV) intensities between two close acquisition dates. The ratio is expected to track changes in soil moisture only since the changes of surface roughness, canopy structure and vegetation biomass take place at longer temporal scales than soil moisture changes. The alpha approximation approach was firstly evaluated by comparing with data sets simulated by a theoretical radiative transfer (RT) scattering model. It was found that the alpha approximation approach was overall in good agreement with the RT scattering model without introducing significant errors for bare surface and low vegetation area, which confirmed that the alpha approximation approach was a simple and effective way to reduce the influences of vegetation and surface roughness. Furthermore, under the assumption of alpha approximation, the ratio of 2 consecutive backscatter measurements could be approximately represented as the squared ratio of corresponding Bragg scattering coefficients. For Sentinel-1 SAR data with only one like-polarized channel (i.e. VV), N SAR acquisitions would result in N - 1 linear equations in N unknown Bragg scattering coefficients. To solve this underdetermined system of equations, a bounded linear least-squares optimization was applied. Once the unknown Bragg scattering coefficients were retrieved, the relative dielectric constant could be analytically derived with the soil moisture being estimated by the inversion of microwave dielectric model. The alpha approximation approach was then applied to 4 consecutive Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over Huailai experiment field. Soil moisture maps were successfully obtained for each date. The results were validated using ground measurements on one acquisition date, with root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.06 cm3/cm3 and mean bias value of 0.01 cm3/cm3. The results demonstrated the overall good performance of the alpha approximation approach. These results imply that multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data show great potential in achieving high resolution and accurate soil moisture retrievals over agricultural fields. © 2016, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This approach jointly exploits the robust Gabor wavelet representation and the advanced cascade clustering. First, a log-ratio image is generated from the multitemporal images. Then, to integrate contextual information in the feature extraction process, Gabor wavelets are employed to yield the representation of the log-ratio image at multiple scales and orientations, whose maximum magnitude over all orientations in each scale is concatenated to form the Gabor feature vector. Next, a cascade clustering algorithm is designed in this discriminative feature space by successively combining the first-level fuzzy c-means clustering with the second-level nearest neighbor rule.

This human- and partially nature-induced ground deformation has gradually threatened the stability of urban infrastructure and caused the loss of wetland habitat along the Gulf of Mexico. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can measure ground motions in high spatial resolution over large coverage. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial and temporal variations in surface deformation around the HG region using a Multi-Temporal InSAR (MTI) technique and to assess the role of fluid withdrawal (groundwater withdrawal and hydrocarbon extraction), salt tectonics, and fault activity in land surface deformation. MTI-derived land surface deformation measurements are then compared to GPS and extensometer observations, geologic and hydrologic data, and information about hydrocarbon extraction to address the causes of the observed deformation. The MTI measurements based on ERS-1/2 datasets have mapped regional subsidence up to 53. mm/yr in the northwestern HG as well as a slight uplift at 20. mm/yr in the southeastern HG from 1993 to 2000. InSAR measurements obtained from Envisat and ALOS data reveal subsidence rate of up to 30. mm/yr over the northwestern HG between 2004 and 2011. Our results indicate that the pattern of ground deformation was nearly concentric around locations of intense groundwater withdrawal and the spatial extent of the subsiding area has been shrinking and migrating toward the northeast after 2000. We have resolved localized ground subsidence cones over hydrocarbon exploration fields, which were likely caused by reservoir compaction. We have differentiated ground surface deformation over salt domes, which was due to ongoing differential movement of individual salt spines. We have identified 5-40. mm/yr differential subsidence across a number of faults in the region. These faults functioned as water barriers disrupting the integrity of ground water flow and aggravating localized surface displacements. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Atlantic Ocean; Galveston; Gulf of Mexico; Houston; Texas; United States; Aquifers; Deformation; Domes; Economic geology; Extraction; Faulting; Flow of water; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrocarbons; Oil fields; Salt deposits; Salt tectonics; Structural geology; Subsidence; Surface measurement; Ground surface deformation; Houston; Hydrocarbon exploration; InSAR; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Salt domes; Spatial and temporal variation; aquifer; deformation; ERS; faulting; GPS; ground motion; groundwater abstraction; habitat loss; hydrocarbon exploration; interferometry; mapping method; oil field; salt dome; salt tectonics; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; stability analysis; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; uplift; wetland; Synthetic aperture radar","Aquifer; Fault; Houston; InSAR; Multi-temporal InSAR; Oil field; Salt dome; Subsidence","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940652002"

For this, the effects of different combinations of vineyard organisations on multi-Temporal high and very high spatial resolution SAR and optical data have been analysed. The study area is located in Mendoza (Argentina). All the ground data were acquired during an experimental campaign performed in 2014-2015 over 153 vineyards (around 400ha). The data of the perennial practices were recorded over each of the 153 vineyards. The schedule of the annual practices were also provided over the all site. The grapevine phenological cycle was finally monitored on 14 fields through GLAI (Green Leaf Area index) estimation using hemispherical images and grapevine canopy height measurements. The satellite images dataset is composed of 6 Dual-Pol TerraSAR-X images, 5 Pleiades images, and 6 Landsat-8 images. After calibrating the images, backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters were extracted from Terrasar-X images (entropy and alpha angle) and the NDVI from optical images. The analysis of the temporal signatures regarding perennial practices revealed a strong impact of the inter-row spacing management. Ranges of values of backscattering coefficients differ with the type of management but their temporal variation seems to be linked to soil moisture changes. Depending on the roughness of the inter-row spacing the alpha angle evolution is linked to grapevine growth in the case of a chemically weeded inter-row spacing. But it remains at high values when the inter-row spacing is ploughed or grassed. In those cases, the entropy increases along the growth cycle. The vegetation indexes series are increasing with the grapevine growth depending on canopy width and soil management. Thus this work highlighted the variability of the SAR and optical signals due to heterogeneities in vineyard organisation and management. © 2016 SPIE.","Agriculture; Agronomy; Backscattering; Ecology; Ecosystems; Entropy; Geometrical optics; Hydrology; Optical sensors; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Experimental campaign; Grapevine; Polarimetric parameters; Temporal signatures; Very high spatial resolutions; Viticultural landscapes; Viticultural practices; Space-based radar","Grapevine; Optical sensors; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Temporal signatures; Viticultural practices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011019594"

The presence or absence of water in reed marshes has a significant impact on the whole ecosystem and remains a key indicator to identify the effective area of a wetland and help estimate the degree of degeneration. Past studies have demonstrated the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to map water-level changes for flooded reeds. However, the identification of the different hydrological states of reed marshes is often poorly understood. The analysis given in this paper shows that L-band interferometric coherence is very sensitive to the water surface conditions beneath reed marshes and so it can be used as classifier. A method based on a statistical analysis of the coherence distributions for wet and dry reeds using InSAR pairs was, therefore, investigated in this study. The experimental results were validated by in-situ data and showed very good agreement. This is the first time that information about the water cover under herbaceous wetlands has been derived using interferometric coherence values. This method can also effectively and easily be applied to monitor the hydrological conditions beneath other herbaceous wetlands. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; Interferometry; Water levels; Wetlands; Effective area; Human activities; Hydrological condition; Interferometric coherence; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Water level changes; Wetland vegetation; climate change; estimation method; experimental study; human activity; hydrological modeling; image classification; in situ measurement; marsh; monitoring; PALSAR; radar interferometry; reedbed; statistical analysis; water level; wetland; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938330725"

However the SAR images suffer from speckle noise, the proposed method is able to map the changes without speckle filtering. To evaluate the performance of this method, two dates of SAR data acquired by Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic from an agriculture area are used.

Recent studies confirmed that the empirical AGB models generated from the L-band radar backscatter can provide favourable estimation results, especially if the data has dual-polarization configuration. Using dual polarimetry SAR data the backscatter signal is more sensitive to forest biomass and forest structure because of tree trunk scattering, thus showing better discriminations of different forest successional stages. These SAR approaches, however, need to be further studied for the application in tropical peatlands ecosystem We aims at estimating forest carbon stocks and stand biophysical properties using combination of multi-temporal and multi-polarizations (quad-polarimetric) L-band SAR data and focuses on tropical peat swamp forest over Kampar Peninsula at Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia which is one of the most peat abundant region in the country. Applying radar backscattering (Sigma nought) to model the biomass we found that co-polarizations (HH and VV) band are more sensitive than cross-polarization channels (HV and VH). Individual HH polarization channel from April 2010 explained > 86% of AGB. Whereas VV polarization showed strong correlation coefficients with LAI, tree height, tree diameter and basal area. Surprisingly, polarimetric anisotropy feature from April 2007 SAR data show relatively high correlations with almost all forest biophysical parameters. Polarimetric anisotropy, which explains the ratio between the second and the first dominant scattering mechanism from a target has reduced at some extent the randomness of scattering mechanism, thus improve the predictability of this particular feature in estimating the forest properties. These results may be influenced by local seasonal variations of the forest as well as moisture, but available quad-pol SAR data were unable to show these patterns, since all the SAR data were acquired during the rainy season. The results of multi-regression analysis in predicting above ground biomass shows that ALOS PALSAR data acquired in 2010 has outperformed other time series data. This is probably due to the fact that land cover change in the area from 2007-2009 was highly dynamic, converting natural forests into rubber and Acacia plantations, thus SAR data of 2010 which was acquired in between of two field campaigns has provided significant results (F = 40.7, P < 0.005). In general, we found that polarimetric features have improved the models performance in estimating AGB. Surprising results come from single HH polarization band from April 2010 that has a strong correlation with AGB (r = 0.863). Also, HH polarization band of 2009 SAR image resulted in a moderate correlation with AGB (r = 0.440).","Anisotropy; Backscattering; Biomass; Carbon; Peat; Polarimeters; Polarization; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Rubber plantations; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Tropics; Wetlands; ALOS PALSAR; Biophysical parameters; Biophysical properties; Forest carbons; Forest successional stages; Multi-regression analysis; Polarimetric features; Polarization channels; Forestry","ALOS Palsar; Forest carbon biomass; Polarimetric features; SAR","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930411016"

The observation of multitemporal RGB compositions combining key dates of the different points of crops growth make possible to differentiate this land cover and also to observe fluctuations inside the class itself. This fluctuations present a pattern that correspond to the crop field structure, which suggests that more information can be obtained. The shrubs are difficult to detect from the intensity images, but once the observation is combined with coherence images the detection is possible. However, the coherence image must be generated from pairs of images with a temporal interval lower than three months, independently from the year of registration of each image due to the general decrease of coherence when larger intervals are used. The analysis allowed to observe the potential of this data to perfect distinguish urban, crops and shrubs.

After generating the difference image from the multitemporal images, we take each pixel as an antigen and build an immune model to deal with the antigens. By continuously stimulating the immune model, the antigens are classified into two groups, changed and unchanged. Firstly, the proposed method incorporates the local information in order to restrain the impact of speckle noise. Secondly, the proposed method simulates the immune response process in a fuzzy way to get an accurate result by retaining more image details. We introduce a fuzzy membership of the antigen and then update the antibodies and memory cells according to the membership. Compared with the clustering algorithms we have proposed in our previous works, the new method inherits immunological properties from immune systems and is robust to speckle noise due to the use of local information as well as fuzzy strategy. Experiments on real synthetic aperture radar images show that the proposed method performs well on several kinds of difference images and engenders more robust result than the other compared methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The improvements of satellite Earth observation data and methods over the last two decades, have provided a way to measure crustal movements with good accuracy and spatial coverage. In particular, multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data sets and SAR interferometric techniques have demonstrated the capacity to obtain information on the dynamics of the deformation occurring during the various phases of the seismic cycle. In the last few years a number of papers have reported the occurrence of crustal deformation transients in the inter-seismic and post-seismic periods, and have speculated on their significance in the earthquake preparation processes. The foreseen steady flow of high quality SAR data provided by new satellites as Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 is going to provide new pieces of evidence of these elusive phenomena, stimulating further observational and analytical research.

The objective is to study satellite data COSMO - SkyMed: X band and Radarsat-2: C band land use / land cover in coastal areas of Chanthaburi province. The important advantage of SAR imagery is that it is independent of the impact of climate factors, e.g., rain, haze, and cloud. As a result, the SAR imagery can be acquired from all seasons; therefore, it is suitable for tracking land use and land cover changes. Additionally, the potential capability of SAR sensor is to provide the backscattering data and these data can be performed to classify land use/land cover. However, the backscattering characteristics depend on the wavelength, direction of the radiated electromagnetic field, surface roughness, and moisture content. Cosmo-SkyMed (X-band, HH polarization) and Radarsat-2 (C band, HH, HV polarization) were used in this study. Those multi-temporal satellite images were acquired in May, August, and November 2013. The study area is in Chanthaburi province, Thailand. Land use in this area are paddy fields, cassava, rubber Trees, shrimp farms, mangrove, forest, orchard, buildings, forest, and water. The result of this study exhibited that the backscattering from buildings showed very high values in all wavelength and direction, where as the back scattering of water and shrimp farms were very low, which appears black on images because such surfaces are smooth forest, orchard and rubber Trees represented similar backscattering levels due to the characteristics of sparse vegetation canopy and paddy fields are medium roughness. The backscattering gray scale in this study area demonstrated different values from different materials according to the wavelength and direction of the radiated electromagnetic. This study found that surface roughness and moisture content are also the major factors of different backscattering values. If surfaces are rough, the brightness value will be white, such as roof and concrete road. Other important factors are moisture, wind, and incident angle. In addition, the result indicated that the major land use/land cover of this area, included paddy fields, shrimp farms, orchard, rubber trees, and cassava, respectively. Land uses/land cover within 15 km. of coastline in Chanthaburi province were also illustrated in this study.

Each sensor provides unique data that is transformed to information from the scene. We are presenting here a software tool called ASIF (Automated System for image fusion) which automatically combines each sensor's data into one synergistic combination of imagery (a fused image). With ASIF the user can quickly generate a single image containing the fused data instead of investigating several images, providing a new way of observing convenient information at a region of interest. ASIF, as an integrating tool of EO (Electro-Optical) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images provides fused information from the images. It performs optimal pre-processing algorithms for overcoming the difficulties in combining different contexts. Every optimized process was evolved after an extensive research on a diverse group of EO-SAR datasets. The fusion optimization is oriented for visual interpretation enhancement based on: surface, objects and infrastructures. ASIF involves state of the art image and signal processing steps that estimate the required processing of inputs in an adaptive manner, oriented for optimal results for visual human perception and analysis. These handle automatically all required geometric and radiometric pre-processing stages. The fusion modes are determined by the input EO-SAR images that are available over the requested fegion of interest. Input data may be: panchromatic EO, RGB only EO, multi-spectral EO, multi- polarized SAR, multi-frequency and multi-Temporal SAR data. At each resulting fusion product we reveal the latent added value of its member input images, in order to get resolution improvement, data certainty, objects detection and verification, change detection, completion of details and so on. ASIF system allows a new interesting interpretation product that resolves open questions that rise from the surface and provides us a comprehensive view of it.

The developed algorithm is based on the Cumulative Density Function (CDF) transformation of multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 backscatter coefficient (BC) to obtain relative SM values, and then converts relative SM values into absolute SM values using soil information. The algorithm is tested in a semi-arid tropical region in South India using 30 satellite images of RADARSAT-2, SMOS L2 SM products, and 1262 SM field measurements in 50 plots spanning over 4 years. The validation with the field data showed the ability of the developed algorithm to retrieve SM with RMSE ranging from 0.02 to 0.06m3/m3 for the majority of plots. Comparison with the SMOS SM showed a good temporal behaviour with RMSE of approximately 0.05 m3/m3 and a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.9. The developed model is compared and found to be better than the change detection and delta index model. The approach does not require calibration of any parameter to obtain relative SM and hence can easily be extended to any region having time series of SAR data available. © 2015 by the authors.","Algorithms; Moisture; Soil moisture; Soil surveys; Soils; Tropical engineering; CDF; Multi-temporal; Radarsat-2; SAR; SMOS; Synthetic aperture radar","CDF; Multi-temporal; RADARSAT-2; SAR; SMOS; Soil moisture","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84933574073"

Our analysis is based on seven radar images acquired at a 36° incidence angle in the HH polarization, over a semi-arid site in Tunisia (North Africa). The soil moisture estimations are based on an empirical change detection approach using TerraSAR-X data and ground auxiliary thetaprobe network measurements. Two assumptions were tested: (1) roughness variations during the three-month radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. The results reveal a small improvement in the estimation of soil moisture when a correction for temporal variations in roughness is introduced. By considering the estimated temporal dynamics of soil moisture, a methodology is proposed for the retrieval of clay and sand content (expressed as percentages) in soil. Two empirical relationships were established between the mean moisture values retrieved from the seven acquired radar images and the two soil texture components over 36 test fields. Validation of the proposed approach was carried out over a second set of 34 fields, showing that highly accurate clay estimations can be achieved.

Three steps are applied to build the algorithm: (1) the backscattering coefficients are collected in eight acquisitions at different growth periods. Meanwhile, the ground-truth data are measured, such as rice biomass, leafarea index, and canopy height and related ecophysiological canopy variables. Moreover, three scenes of advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) AP images covering the study area are acquired. (2) The inversion models are built based on a semi-empirical rice water-cloudy model with the data measured in field. The rice backscattering coefficients of HH and VV polarizations are the input parameters. (3) By processing the ASAR images, the backscattering coefficients are extracted and input to the inversion model, and then the rice biomass maps are outputted at three different periods' images. By comparing the rice biomass measured with the inverse values from the scattering data and SAR images, it shows that the inversion values are considerably consistent with the true measured values. The inversion results show that the multitemporal SAR images at the C-band can be used to monitor the growth of rice by using the semi-empirical inversion model. © Author(s) 2015.","Backscattering; Biomass; Ecology; Meteorological instruments; Radar measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced synthetic aperture radars; Backscattering coefficients; Multi-temporal SAR images; Radar backscattering; Rice backscattering coefficients; Scatterometers; Simultaneous observation; Water cloud models; Radar imaging","advanced synthetic aperture radar; backscattering coefficients; rice biomass; scatterometer system; water-cloud model","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929377499"

The aim of an SHM system is to provide insights into possible induced damage or any inherent signals of deformation affecting the structure in terms of detection, localization, assessment, and prediction. During the last decade there has been a growing interest in using several remote sensing techniques, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), for SHM. Constellations of SAR satellites with short repeat time acquisitions permit detailed surveys temporal resolution and millimetric sensitivity to deformation that are at the scales relevant to monitoring large structures. The all-weather multi-temporal characteristics of SAR make its products suitable for SHM systems, especially in areas where in situ measurements are not feasible or not cost effective. To illustrate this capability, we present results from COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X SAR observations applied to the remote sensing of engineered structures. We show how by using multiple-geometry SAR-based products which exploit both phase and amplitude of the SAR signal we can address the main objectives of an SHM system including detection and localization. We highlight that, when external data such as rain or temperature records are available or simple elastic models can be assumed, the SAR-based SHM capability can also provide an interpretation in terms of assessment and prediction. We highlight examples of the potential for such imaging capabilities to enable advances in SHM from space, focusing on dams and cultural heritage areas. © 2016 SPIE.","Automation; Cost effectiveness; Damage detection; Dams; Deformation; Image analysis; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space optics; Space-based radar; Structural analysis; Surveys; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; archeology; Cosmo skymed; Detection and localization; Engineered structures; Imaging capabilities; Remote sensing techniques; Structural health monitoring (SHM); TerraSAR-X; Structural health monitoring","archeology; COSMO-SkyMed; dam; SAR; Structural health monitoring; TerraSAR-X?; time-series analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010842189"

The approach is based on the exploitation of X-band TanDEM-X interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. Large-scale mosaics of radar backscatter and volume decorrelation, derived from the interferometric coherence, are used as input data set for applying a classification algorithm based on the c-means fuzzy clustering. The unique data set provided by TanDEM-X is particularly suitable for this analysis due to the single-pass bistatic acquisition mode which does not suffer from temporal decorrelation. The located snow facies can then be related to the well known dry snow, upper and lower percolation, and wet snow/ablation zones. The obtained results have been verified with external snow melt data and independent multi-Temporal TanDEM-X data. The proper location of the different facies finally allows to estimate the X-band penetration depth into the ice sheet from the TanDEM-X volume decorrelation mosaics. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.","Classification (of information); Glaciers; Ice; Interferometry; Radar; Snow; Solvents; Acquisition modes; Classification algorithm; Greenland Ice Sheet; Interferometric coherence; Interferometric radars; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Temporal decorrelation; Volume decorrelation; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000933233"

Because of the preferred rectangular and regular structure of man-made objects, PSI works particularly well for monitoring of settlements. Usually, in PSI it is assumed that except for surface motion the scene is steady. In case this is not given, corresponding PS candidates are discarded during PSI processing. On the other hand, pixel-based change detection relying on local comparison of multi-temporal images typically highlights scene modifications of larger size rather than detail level. In this paper, we propose a method to combine these two types of change detection approaches. First, we introduce a local change-index based on PSI, which basically looks for PS candidates that remain stable over a certain period of time, but then break down suddenly. In addition, for the remaining PS candidates we apply common PSI processing which yields attributes like velocity in line-of-sight. In order to consider context, we apply now spatial filtering according to the derived attributes and morphology to exclude outliers and extract connect components of similar regions at the same time. We demonstrate our approach for test site Berlin, Germany, where, firstly, deformation-velocities on man-made structures are estimated and, secondly, some construction-sites are correctly recognized.","Deformation; Information science; Interferometry; Photogrammetry; Signal detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Deformation velocity; Man-made structures; Multi-temporal image; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Persistent scatterers; Surface deformation; Urban monitoring; Remote sensing","Change detection; Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI); Urban monitoring","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959361072"

In this domain, synthetic aperture radars (SAR) represent a powerful tool. Carrying their own illumination, they are able to operate independently of sunlight and in nearly all weather conditions, allowing continuous monitoring. At dry conditions, SAR measurements are sensitive to both surface and sub-surface features of glaciers and ice sheets, especially at long-wavelengths (e.g. L- and P-band). This qualifies SAR for the retrieval of a number of glaciological parameters, including glacier facies extent, snow and firn grain size, accumulation rate. In particular, polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) represents an extension of conventional SAR which exploits the polarization diversity of electromagnetic waves to gain sensitivity to different scattering mechanisms as well as to geometrical and dielectric properties of the illuminated objects. Nevertheless, such potential remains largely underexploited as a satisfactory physical interpretation of SAR backscattering from glaciers and ice sheets is still lacking. For instance, the relative contribution of surface and subsurface features as well as its dependence on frequency, imaging geometry and glacier zone is still not understood. The primary objective of this thesis is to develop and invert an electromagnetic scattering model able to relate PolSAR measurables to physical quantities of glacier subsurface. Both amplitude and phase information contained in the complex backscattered signal at different polarizations are jointly taken into account. A novel three-component polarimetric scattering model is presented to describe the total backscattering as the sum of volume, surface and a newly-developed anisotropic propagation component. The latter is shown to be able to interpret polarimetric phase differences with the presence of anisotropic firn and to provide estimates of physical properties of such medium (e.g. thickness, density and degree of anisotropy). The knowledge of this kind of information would help to improve glacier facies classification and to characterize their subsurface properties. The availability of multi-temporal SAR data would allow monitoring variations of such parameters over time, which is extremely valuable for supporting mass balance estimation. Furthermore, a detailed characterization of glacier subsurface would have implication on the estimation of penetration depth which biases interferometric SAR (InSAR) and radar altimetry products. The proposed model is used to perform a polarimetric decomposition of L- and P-band PolSAR data acquired by the DLR's E-SAR sensor over the Austfonna ice cap, Svalbard, during the SVALEX 2005 and ICESAR 2007 campaigns. The focus of the investigation is on the estimation of the thickness of the firn layer and its dependency on frequency and test site. Temporal variations over the 2005-2007 period are also assessed. Validation is carried out by comparing inversion results with ground penetrating radar and stratigraphic measurements.","Anisotropic media; Anisotropy; Backscattering; Classification (of information); Dielectric properties; Electromagnetic wave polarization; Electromagnetic wave scattering; Electromagnetic waves; Frequency estimation; Geological surveys; Glaciers; Ground penetrating radar systems; Ice; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar; Radar measurement; Remote sensing; Snow; Stratigraphy; Surface scattering; Synthetic apertures; Electromagnetic scattering; Ground Penetrating Radar; Mass-balance estimation; Physical interpretation; Polarimetric decomposition; Polarimetric phase difference; Polarimetric scattering; Satellite remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964780433"

However, quad-pol sensors have some limitations due to their complexity, increased data rate, and reduced coverage and revisit time. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the added value of quad-pol data in a multi-temporal crop classification framework based on SAR imagery. With this aim, three RADARSAT-2 scenes were acquired between May and June 2010. Once we analyzed the separability and the descriptive analysis of the features, an object-based supervised classification was performed using the Random Forests classification algorithm. Classification results obtained with dual-pol (VV-VH) data as input were compared to those using quad-pol data in different polarization bases (linear H-V, circular, and linear 45°), and also to configurations where several polarimetric features (Pauli and Cloude-Pottier decomposition features and co-pol coherence and phase difference) were added. Dual-pol data obtained satisfactory results, equal to those obtained with quad-pol data (in H-V basis) in terms of overall accuracy (0.79) and Kappa values (0.69). Quad-pol data in circular and linear 45° bases resulted in lower accuracies. The inclusion of polarimetric features, particularly co-pol coherence and phase difference, resulted in enhanced classification accuracies with an overall accuracy of 0.86 and Kappa of 0.79 in the best case, when all the polarimetric features were added. Improvements were also observed in the identification of some particular crops, but major crops like cereals, rapeseed, and sunflower already achieved a satisfactory accuracy with the VV-VH dual-pol configuration and obtained only minor improvements. Therefore, it can be concluded that C-band VV-VH dual-pol data is almost ready to be used operationally for crop mapping as long as at least three acquisitions in dates reflecting key growth stages representing typical phenology differences of the present crops are available. In the near future, issues regarding the classification of crops with small field sizes and heterogeneous cover (i.e., fallow and grasslands) need to be tackled to make this application fully operational. © 2016 by the authors.","Crops; Decision trees; Mapping; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Crop classification; Polarimetric features; Radarsat-2; Random forests; Separability; Classification (of information)","Crop classification; Polarimetric features; RADARSAT-2; Random Forests; Separability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971667970"

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data present several favourable characteristics for flood mapping, such as their relative insensitivity to the meteorological conditions during acquisitions, thanks to the use of microwaves as sensing radiation, as well as the possibility of acquiring imagery independently of solar illumination, thanks to the active nature of the radar sensors. The Italian COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR constellation is particularly useful in this respect, because it allows image sequences of flooding events to be built up with short revisit times. The acquisition of several images before, during and after the event often allow a reconstruction of the flooding dynamics. Moreover, they help in interpreting the backscatter signatures of different land cover types, reducing uncertainties about the actual presence of water, which can be seriously misleading, especially over agricultural areas [1, 2]. Finally, when acquisitions are made from the same geometry, with short repeat intervals, SAR interferometry (InSAR) observables, such as the coherence or the differential InSAR phase can be exploited as additional information layers. The favorable characteristics of these next-generation sensors have been exploited by a number of researchers worldwide [3, 4, 5] to improve performances of flood mapping approaches. Recently, our group [6, 2] has used high-resolution CSK radar images for flood mapping exploiting both the intensity and the interferometric coherence, with promising results. Nevertheless, additional information can be used to improve flood detection. In case of flooding, distance from the river, terrain elevation, hydrologic information or some combination of these data can add useful information that leads to a better performance in flood detection. © 2015 IEEE.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962617569"

One of the limitations of using InSAR techniques, including TomoSAR, is that they only measure deformation along the radar Line-of-Sight (LOS). In order to enhance the understanding of deformation, a decomposition of the observed LOS displacement into the 3D deformation vector in the local coordinate system is desired.

In recent years, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been widely applied to this end, especially thanks to the prompt evolution of multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) algorithms. In this paper, temporarily-coherent point InSAR (TCPInSAR), a recently-developed MTInSAR technique, is employed to investigate the slow-moving landslides in Oso, U.S., with 13 ALOS/PALSAR images. Compared to other MTInSAR techniques, TCPInSAR can work well with a small amount of data and is immune to unwrapping errors. Furthermore, the severe orbital ramps emanated from the inaccurate determination of the ALOS satellite's state vector can be jointly estimated by TCPInSAR, resulting in an exhaustive separation between the orbital errors and displacement signals. The TCPInSAR-derived deformation map indicates that the riverside slopes adjacent to the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River, where the 2014 mudslide occurred, were active during 2007 and 2011. Besides, Coal Mountain has been found to be experiencing slow-moving landslides with clear boundaries and considerable magnitudes. The Deer Creek River is also threatened by a potential landslide dam due to the creeps detected in a nearby slope. The slope instability information revealed in this study is helpful to deal with the landslide hazards in Oso. © 2014 by the authors.","Deformation; Errors; Hazards; Infiltration; Interferometry; Landslides; Orbits; Radar; ALOS PALSAR; Coherent points; Deformation monitoring; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Oso; Synthetic aperture radar","ALOS PALSAR; Deformation monitoring; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); Landslides; Oso; Temporarily-coherent point InSAR (TCPInSAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920863908"

In order to understand the scattering mechanism of lake ice, a scattering model is developed for lake ice that updates some assumptions adopted in previously developed models, including the roughness of the ice-water interface and the shape of vertically stacked centimeter-sized bubbles in the lake ice. We conclude the following: First, with a incidence angle range near 24°, the backscattering intensities of C-band VV-polarized ENVISAT-ASAR data exhibit a strong dependence on time, which is related to the processes of ice growth and decay on the QTP. Some unique backscattering characteristics of lake ice in this high-altitude region, as compared to those for high-latitude regions, are also discussed and documented in the paper. Secondly, the timing of lake ice-on in fall and ice-off in spring for this region can be identified in radar images by using a threshold of -12. dB for the backscatter intensity of the surrounding alpine meadow. Finally, the results of applying the scattering model indicate that surface scattering from the ice-water interface and volume scattering from gas bubbles embedded in the lake ice are the dominant scattering mechanisms for C-band VV polarized SAR and that the roughness of the ice-water interface and also bubble size are the most sensitive factors. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Satellite based InSAR provides a means for monitoring infrastructure that may be both remote and spatially extensive. However, permafrost poses challenges for InSAR monitoring due to the complex temporal deformation patterns caused by both seasonal active layer fluctuations and long-term changes in permafrost thickness. These dynamics suggest a need for increasing the temporal resolution of multi-temporal InSAR methods. To address this issue we have developed a method that combines and jointly processes two or more same side geometry InSAR stacks to provide a high-temporal resolution estimate of surface deformation. The method allows for combining stacks from more than a single SAR sensor and for a combination of frequency bands. Data for this work have been collected and analysed for an area near the community of Umiujaq, Quebec in Northern Canada and include scenes from RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed. Multiple stack based surface deformation estimates are compared for several cases including results from the three sensors individually and for all sensors combined. The test cases show substantially similar surface deformation results which correlate well with surficial geology. The best spatial coverage of coherent targets was achieved when data from all sensors were combined. The proposed multiple stack method is demonstrated to improve the estimation of surface deformation in permafrost affected areas and shows potential for deriving InSAR based permafrost classification maps to aid in the monitoring of Northern infrastructure.","Climate change; Deformation; Monitoring; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Deformation monitoring; Deformation pattern; High temporal resolution; Infrastructure monitoring; InSAR; Surface deformation; Temporal resolution; Transportation infrastructures; Synthetic aperture radar","Deformation monitoring; Infrastructure monitoring; InSAR; Permafrost","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930404904"

In this paper, we present a method to estimate coherence for DInSAR stack by exploiting the multi-temporal phase statistics. The key point of the proposed solution relies on the capability of averaging each pixel with its statistical homogeneous neighborhood, thus allowing a more accurate coherence estimation.

The processing of ENVISAT satellite images for oil spill detection included the following stages: filtering of images for noise reduction and imagery enhancement, preliminary segmentation for detection of dark features, interactive visual interpretation for the discrimination among other oil spill look-alikes, computation of oil spill frequency, and approximation of oil leak sources. The analysis showed that the appearance of the oil slicks in the radar imagery significantly depends on the Caspian Sea wind speed. The best wind speed conditions for the detection of oil spill were determined to be 2.5–14 m/s. The hot spot areas of detected oil spill frequencies for 2009–2010 were the following: 2–25 (4,658.83 sq. km.), 26–45 (302.83 sq. km.), 46–75 (77.95 sq. km.). The most critical oil leak sources were observed around the Oil Rocks Settlement. The exponential regression analysis between wind speeds and oil slick areas in 2009 with R2 equal to 0.61 showed that larger oil spill areas were observed with lower wind speeds.

Inaccurate estimation of the covariance matrix is considered to be the most important source of error in such applications. Previous studies, namely, DeSpecKS and its variants, have demonstrated their advantages in improving the estimation accuracy for distributed targets by means of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs). However, these methods may be unreliable for small sample sizes and sensitive to data stacks showing large time spacing due to the variability of the temporal sample. Moreover, these methods are computationally intensive. In this paper, a new algorithm named fast SHP selection (FaSHPS) is proposed to solve both problems. FaSHPS explores the confidence interval for each pixel by invoking the central limit theorem and then selects SHPs using this interval. Based on identified SHPs, two estimators with respect to the despeckling and the bias mitigation of the sample coherence are proposed to refine the elements of the InSAR covariance matrix. A series of qualitative and quantitative evaluations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Covariance matrix estimation; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Pixel selection; covariance analysis; error analysis; estimation method; speckle; statistical analysis; synthetic aperture radar; Covariance matrix","Covariance matrix; Fast statistically homogeneous pixel selection (FaSHPS); Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84907468096"

A synergistic approach to deforestation mapping was adopted using SAR backscattering anomalies, the neighbouring forest constraint and DEM-derived slopes based on the three following characteristics: (1) backscattering is reduced in regions suspected to have undergone deforestation; (2) open regions without neighbouring forests were identified for removal; and (3) false-alarms linked to water bodies are mitigated using the shape threshold of flat-slope objects. Our results show that deforestation in the Amazon River estuary continues to be a serious problem, particularly along the rivers, streams or roads, which are more susceptible to anthropogenic activities than other areas. Up to 2006, the deforested portion accounts for 4.6 per cent (3,096,000 pixels) of the entire study site of approximately 458,000 square kilometers (67,320,000 pixels). However, this figure, validated by Landsat ETM images, may have overestimated deforestation to some extent. Nevertheless, multi-temporal analysis using SAR systems, as done in this study, have a clear potential for surveillance of deforestation in the Amazon, particularly in light of the frequent cloud cover typical of the area and the limitations of deforestation monitoring by means of optical satellite imagery.","Amazon River; Backscattering; Deforestation; Estuaries; Forestry; Geodetic satellites; Mapping; Pixels; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Synthetic aperture radar; Anthropogenic activity; Change detection; False alarms; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal analysis; Operational capabilities; Optical satellite imagery; Spaceborne synthetic aperture radars; biomonitoring; cloud cover; deforestation; digital elevation model; Envisat; estuary; Landsat; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; threshold; vegetation mapping; Space-based radar","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977269971"

Firstly, we analyzed statistically the relationships between X-band SAR (TerraSAR-X) backscattering signals function of soil moisture and different roughness parameters (the root mean square height Hrms, the Zs parameter and the Zg parameter) at HH polarization and for an incidence angle about 36°, over a semi-Arid site in Tunisia (North Africa). Results have shown a high sensitivity of real radar data to the two soil parameters: roughness and moisture. A linear relationship is obtained between volumetric soil moisture and radar signal. A logarithmic correlation is observed between backscattering coefficient and all roughness parameters. The highest dynamic sensitivity is obtained with Zg parameter. Then, we proposed to retrieve of both soil moisture and texture using these multi-Temporal X-band SAR images. Our approach is based on the change detection method and combines the seven radar images with different continuous thetaprobe measurements. To estimate soil moisture from X-band SAR data, we analyzed statistically the sensitivity between radar measurements and ground soil moisture derived from permanent thetaprobe stations. Our approaches are applied over bare soil class identified from an optical image SPOT/HRV acquired in the same period of measurements. Results have shown linear relationship for the radar signals as a function of volumetric soil moisture with high sensitivity about 0.21 dB/vol%. For estimation of change in soil moisture, we considered two options: (1) roughness variations during the three-month radar acquisition campaigns were not accounted for; (2) a simple correction for temporal variations in roughness was included. The results reveal a small improvement in the estimation of soil moisture when a correction for temporal variations in roughness is introduced. Finally, by considering the estimated temporal dynamics of soil moisture, a methodology is proposed for the retrieval of clay and sand content (expressed as percentages) in soil. Two empirical relationships were established between the mean moisture values retrieved from the seven acquired radar images and the two soil texture components over 36 test fields. Validation of the proposed approach was carried out over a second set of 34 fields, showing that highly accurate clay estimations can be achieved. © 2015 SPIE.","Agriculture; Backscattering; Ecology; Ecosystems; Geometrical optics; Hydrology; Image acquisition; Image texture; Moisture; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Radar measurement; Radar stations; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Soils; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Backscattering coefficients; Backscattering signals; Clay content; Empirical relationships; Experimental campaign; Soil roughness; TerraSAR-X; Volumetric soil moistures; Soil surveys","clay content; radar; soil moisture; soil roughness; TerraSAR-X; texture","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961794957"

Reported results show that the adaptive change detection technique show performance close to the corresponding non adaptive ones and that the joint use of non-coheren and coherent approaches can sensibly improve the performance with respect to those achievable by the singl technique. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.","Radar; Radar imaging; Adaptive change detection; Correlation characteristics; Multi-temporal SAR; Priori knowledge; SAR Images; Scene change; Synthetic aperture radar","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000949435"

Mansa Devi hill near Haridwar city has encountered with such potential hazard for several years due to the instability of the slopes. Therefore, preparedness both on regional and site-specific basis at spatial level in the form of surface movements is extremely important to diminish the damage of human life and settlements. Though the surface movement measurement through field-based technique is always very accurate, this technique is time-consuming and unfeasible over a widely affected region. Therefore, areal and satellite remote sensing is gaining importance in landslide investigation due to its wide coverage. In recent years, synthetic aperture radar has already proven its potential for mapping ground deformation due to earthquake, landslide, volcano, etc. Therefore, in this study, an attempt has been made to identify the potential landslide-affected region in Mansa Devi area using one multi-temporal SAR technique and intensity tracking technique. Intensity tracking technique has identified significant mass movement in the landslide-affected region where the other conventional multi-temporal technique, SBAS, fails. An error analysis has been carried out in order to demonstrate the applicability of intensity tracking technique. This study demonstrated that intensity tracking can be considered as an alternative to conventional interferometry for the estimation of land surface displacement when latter is limited by loss of coherence due to rapid and incoherent surface movement and/or large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Haridwar; India; Uttarakhand; Mansa; data acquisition; deformation mechanism; earthquake mechanism; error analysis; hazard assessment; interferometry; landslide; remote sensing; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; tracking","Intensity tracking; Landslide; SAR interferometry (InSAR); Small baseline subset (SBAS); Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947025063"

Crop monitoring at a fine scale represents an important stake from an environmental point of view as it provides essential information to combine increase of production and sustainable management of agricultural landscapes. The aim of this paper is to compare the potential of optical and SAR parameters (backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters) for crop parameters estimation. Satellite (Formosat-2, Spot-4/5 and Radarsat-2) and ground data were acquired during the MCM'10 experiment conducted by the CESBIO laboratory in 2010. A vegetation index was derived from the optical images: the NDVI and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters were computed from Radarsat-2 images. Results of this study show the high interest of using SAR parameters (backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters) for crop parameters estimation during the whole vegetation cycle instead of using optical vegetation index. Polarimetric parameters do not improve wheat parameters estimation (e.g. backscattering coefficient δ° VV corresponds to the best parameter for wheat height estimation (r2 = 0.60)) but show their high potential for rapeseed height and dry biomass monitoring (i.e. Shannon Entropy polarimetry (SEp; r2 = 0.70) and Radar Vegetation Index (RVI; r2 = 0.80) respectively). © 2015 SPIE.","Agriculture; Backscattering; Biomass; Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Geometrical optics; Hydrology; Oilseeds; Polarimeters; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Sustainable development; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; Crop height; Dry biomass; Formosat-2; Leaf Area Index; NDVI; Radarsat-2; rapeseed; Spot; Temporal signatures; Wheat; Parameter estimation","crop height; dry biomass; Formosat-2; Leaf Area Index (LAI); NDVI; Radarsat-2; rapeseed; Spot; synthetic aperture radar (SAR); temporal signatures; Wheat","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961774569"

In the remote sensing literature, multitemporal image analysis mainly deals with the detection of changes and land-cover transitions. Thus the paper presents and analyses the most relevant literature contributions on these topics. From the perspective of change detection and detection of land-cover transitions, multitemporal image analysis techniques can be divided into two main groups: i) those based on the fusion of the multitemporal information at feature level, and ii) those based on the fusion of the multitemporal information at decision level. The former mainly exploit multitemporal image comparison techniques, which aim at highlighting the presence/absence of changes by generating change indices. These indices are then analyzed by unsupervised algorithms for extracting the change information. The latter rely mainly on classification and include both supervised and semi/partially-supervised/unsupervised methods. The paper focuses the attention on both standard (and largely used) methods and techniques proposed in the recent literature. The analysis is conducted by considering images acquired by optical and SAR systems at medium, high and very high spatial resolution. © 2013 IEEE.","Image fusion; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Change detection; Detection of changes; Multi-temporal image; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Multitemporal image analysis; Presence/absence; Unsupervised algorithms; Very high spatial resolutions; comparative study; data assimilation; data interpretation; image analysis; land cover; literature review; remote sensing; spatial resolution; supervised classification; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; unsupervised classification; Image analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943795616"

The subsidence varies in many ways depends on the radius of location from the mud flow center point and the geological structure. One of the most efficient technologies to monitor this multi temporal phenomenon is using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as an applicative Spatial Geodesy. This study used 4 (four) times series L-Band ALOS PALSAR from 2008 to 2011 Fine Beam Single data (February 2008, January 2009 and February 2010 and January 2011) which then processed by the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) method to obtain the deformation vector at a radius of 1.5 km from the center of mudflow. The result showed that there was a significant subsidence which annually occurred on southern and western area of Sidoarjo mud flow. The deformation vector that occurred in the year 2008-2011 was up to 20 cm/year or 0.05 cm/day. For verification purpose, we also compared the result obtained from the SAR detection with the data measured by Global Position System (GPS) and some deformation monitoring results obtained from another researchs.

The strength of this technique lies in its abilities of all-weather, day and night data acquisition, high measurement accuracy and wide spatial scale. Although vast successful applications have been achieved, conventional InSAR technique possesses several limitations (e.g. decorrelation, phase unwrapping error and atmospheric artefacts), which, in turn, have motivated the development of advanced multi-temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) analysis techniques. Fusion of MTInSAR imagery of the same area has led to a marked improvement in the reliability and accuracy of derived products (e.g. deformation) and has also been important for gleaning dynamic signals of deformation over a wide range of temporal scales. This paper is intended to introduce the development of MTInSAR and provide a practical guidance to the users of the technique.

Yet, the loss of carbon due to forest disturbance and the gain from post-disturbance recovery have not been sufficiently assessed.

A set of backscattering intensity features and polarimetric features, derived by target decomposition techniques, was extracted from 5 consecutive Radarsat-2 images. The temporal evolutions of these features of lodging wheat fields were investigated as a function of DAS (day after sowing) during the entire growing season. The temporal behavior was compared between typical lodging fields and normal fields in different growing stages. It was found that polarimetric feature from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was very sensitive to wheat lodging. Then a method called polarimetric index, availing the sensitivity of polarimetry to the structure, was put forward to monitor wheat lodging. The method was validated by two sets of in situ data collected in Shangkuli Farmland area, Inner Mongolia, China, at heading and ripe stages of spring wheat. Almost all the lodging fields were successfully distinguished from normal fields. Furthermore, the result revealed that the polarimetric index can reflect the intrinsic feature of lodging wheat with good anti-inference ability such as wheat growth difference.

Firstly, we accurately extract river courses from each single-temporal SAR image. To address this issue, we propose strategies based on contourlet transform for speckle noise reduction, marker extraction from river courses at the best decomposition scale, marker-based watershed segmentation and region merging. Then, we filter out the false targets which are similar to the river courses from the segmentation results. Finally, through directly comparing the difference among river courses in multi-temporal images based on registration results, we achieve the final detection of river course changes. In the experiments, we use multi-temporal high-resolution SAR images from different sensors, compare and analyze the experimental results with other methods, which confirms the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Ground motion studies using DInSAR require both the availability of good quality input data and rigorous approaches to exploit the retrieved Time Series (TS) at their full potential. In this work we present a methodology for DInSAR TS analysis, with particular focus on landslides and subsidence phenomena. The proposed methodology consists of three main steps: (1) pre-processing, i.e., assessment of a SAR Dataset Quality Index (SDQI) (2) post-processing, i.e., application of empirical/stochastic methods to improve the TS quality, and (3) trend analysis, i.e., comparative implementation of methodologies for automatic TS analysis. Tests were carried out on TS datasets retrieved from processing of SAR imagery acquired by different radar sensors (i.e., ERS-1/2 SAR, RADARSAT-1, ENVISAT ASAR, ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed) using advanced DInSAR techniques (i.e., SqueeSAR™, PSInSAR™, SPN and SBAS). The obtained values of SDQI are discussed against the technical parameters of each data stack (e.g., radar band, number of SAR scenes, temporal coverage, revisiting time), the retrieved coverage of the DInSAR results, and the constraints related to the characterization of the investigated geological processes. Empirical and stochastic approaches were used to demonstrate how the quality of the TS can be improved after the SAR processing, and examples are discussed to mitigate phase unwrapping errors, and remove regional trends, noise and anomalies. Performance assessment of recently developed methods of trend analysis (i.e., PS-Time, Deviation Index and velocity TS) was conducted on two selected study areas in Northern Italy affected by land subsidence and landslides. Results show that the automatic detection of motion trends enhances the interpretation of DInSAR data, since it provides an objective picture of the deformation behaviour recorded through TS and therefore contributes to the understanding of the on-going geological processes. © 2015, Springer Basel.","Italy; Geology; Harmonic analysis; Interferometry; Landslides; Quality control; Radar; Radar imaging; Stochastic systems; Subsidence; Synthetic aperture radar; Deformation behaviour; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Performance assessment; Persistent scatterers; Quality assessment; SAR interferometry; Small baseline subsets; User-oriented methodology; data interpretation; ground motion; landslide; radar imagery; satellite data; stochasticity; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Time series analysis","landslides; Persistent scatterers; quality assessment; SAR interferometry; small baseline subset; subsidence; time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944675403"

However, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has suffered dramatic ground subsidence during last two to three decades, mainly due to long-term groundwater withdrawal. Although, annual spirit leveling has been conducted routinely in some parts of Beijing and Tianjin, and InSAR technique has also been used to monitor ground subsidence in some local areas of the region, there is a lack of a complete survey of ground subsidence over the whole region. In this paper, we report a research on mapping ground subsidence in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region over a long time span from 1992 to 2014. Three SAR datasets from four satellites are used: ERS-1/2 SAR images from 1992 to 2000, ENVISAT ASAR images from 2003 to 2010, and RADARSAT-2 images from 2012 to 2014. An improved multi-temporal InSAR method, namely ""Multiple-master Coherent Target Small-Baseline InSAR"" (MCTSB-InSAR), has been developed to process the datasets. A unique feature of MCTSB-InSAR is the adjustment process useful for wide area monitoring which provides an integrated solution for both calibration of InSAR-derived deformation and the harmonization of the deformation estimates from overlapping SAR frames. Three maps of the subsidence rate corresponding to the three periods over the wide Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region are generated, with respective accuracy of 8.7 mm/year (1992-2000), 4.7 mm/year (2003-2010), and 5.4 mm/year (2012-2014) validated by more than 120 leveling measurements. The spatial-temporal characteristics of the development of ground subsidence in Beijing and Tianjin are analyzed. This research represents a first-ever effort on mapping ground subsidence over very large area and over long time span in China. The result is of significance to serve the decision-making on ground subsidence mitigation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. © 2016 by the authors.","Decision making; Deformation; Geodetic satellites; Groundwater; Mapping; Radar imaging; Regional planning; Synthetic aperture radar; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Groundwater withdrawal; Integrated solutions; Interferometric SAR; Regional development; Spatial-temporal characteristics; Tianjin; Wide area monitoring; Subsidence","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; Ground subsidence; Multi-temporal Interferometric SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983780578"

First, images were filtered using the Enhanced Frost Filter in order to reduce the effect of speckle noise. Fuzzy Clustering Means (FCM) and k-means algorithms were used for unsupervised segmentation, and both results were fused using PCA. Subsequently, a Boolean image was created from the change information using a thresholding algorithm. Finally, the area of changes in the scene was calculated with spatial resolution information from the images. For the experiment phase, synthetic images were first created with varying levels of speckle noise, making it possible to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results showed an overall accuracy of approximately 99% and a kappa index of 0.76 for images whose Equivalent Number of Looks (ENL) equals 0.7. This shows that the proposed method is efficient in detecting changes in SAR images with an ENL greater than or equal to 0.7. Finally, two SAR images were tested, one before and one after a flood that covered an area of the Magdalena River in Colombia called Plato-Magdalena.

Recent advances in multi-temporal spaceborne SAR interferometry, especially with a persistent scatters interferometry (PSI) approach, has made this a robust remote sensing technique for measuring large-scale ground subsidence with millimetric accuracy. This work has presented an advanced PSI analysis, to provide an unprecedented spatial extent and continuous temporal coverage of the subsidence in Ho Chi Minh City from 2006 to 2010. The study shows that subsidence is most severe in the Holocene silt loam areas along the Sai Gon River and in the southwest of the city. The groundwater extraction resulting from urbanization and urban growth is mainly responsible for the subsidence. Subsidence in turn leads to more flooding and water nuisance. The correlation between the reference leveling velocity and the estimated PSI result is R2 = 0.88, and the root mean square error is 4.3 (mm/year), confirming their good agreement. From 2006 to 2010, the estimation of the average subsidence rate is -8.0 mm/year, with the maximum value up to -70 mm/year. After four years, in regions along Sai Gon River and in the southwest of the city, the land has sunk up to -12 cm. If not addressed, subsidence leads to the increase of inundation, both in frequency and spatial extent. Finally, regarding climate change, the effects of subsidence should be considered as appreciably greater than those resulting from rising sea level. It is essential to consider these two factors, because the city is inhabited by more than 7.5 million people, where subsidence directly impacts urban structures and infrastructure. © 2015 by the authors.","Climate change; Extraction; Floods; Groundwater; Interferometry; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Sea level; Silt; Synthetic aperture radar; Urban growth; Alos palsar datum; Groundwater extraction; Multi-temporal; Radar interferometry; Remote sensing techniques; Root mean square errors; Temporal coverage; Urbanization; Subsidence","Ground subsidence; Ho Chi Minh City; Multi-temporal InSAR; PS/DS processing; Sea level rising; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937833691"

Particularly in terms of climate change, the importance of wetlands increases for flora, fauna, human population, agriculture, livestock and fishery. Hence, access to open water is a key factor. Long-term monitoring of water dynamics is of great importance, especially with regard to the spatio-temporal extend of wetlands and drylands. It can predict future trends and facilitate the development of adequate management strategies. Lake Tabalak, a Ramsar wetland of international importance, is one of the most significant ponds in Niger and a refuge for waterbirds. Nevertheless, human population growth increased the pressure on this ecosystem, which is now degrading for all uses. The main objective of the study is a long-term monitoring of the Lake Tabalak's water dynamics to delineate permanent and seasonal water bodies, using weather- and daytime-independent multi-sensor and multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data available for the study area. Data of the following sensors from 1993 until 2016 are used: Sentinel-1A, TerraSAR-X, ALOS PALSAR-1/2, Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-1/2, and ERS-1/2. All SAR data are processed with the Multi-SAR-System, unifying the different characteristics of all above mentioned sensors in terms of geometric, radiometric and polarimetric resolution to a consistent format. The polarimetric representation in Kennaugh elements allows fusing single-polarized data acquired by older sensors with multi-polarized data acquired by current sensors. The TANH-normalization guarantees a consistent and therefore comparable description in a closed data range in terms of radiometry. The geometric aspect is solved by projecting all images to an earth-fixed coordinate system correcting the brightness by the help of the incidence angle. The elevation model used in the geocoding step is the novel global model produced by the TanDEM-X satellite mission. The advantage of the Multi-SAR-System is that it comprises ortho-rectification, radiometric enhancement, normalization and Kennaugh decomposition, independent from sensors, modes, polarizations or acquisition date of SAR data. In addition, optical satellite data can be included as well, to fill gaps where SAR data are missing due to the special normalization scheme. This kind of pre-processing is exclusively implemented at the Earth Observation Center of the German Aerospace Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Therefore, the dynamic change of the open water of the Lake Tabalak could be classified over dry and rainy seasons and years, using different SAR data. The study provides a unique database and contributes to a better understanding of wetland systems in the Sahel region influenced by human pressure and climate change.","Agriculture; Climate change; Dynamics; Geodetic satellites; Lakes; Polarimeters; Population statistics; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Geo coding; Kennaugh; Long term monitoring; Sahel region; Water dynamics; Space-based radar","Geocoding; Kennaugh; Long-term monitoring; Sahel region; SAR; Water dynamics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979642553"

There exists a large number of different methods that have been proposed to address this issue. However, due to the fact that several kinds of changes with diverse characteristics can arise in SAR images, there is no consensus on their performances because most methods have been evaluated using different data sets, probably facing several kinds of changes, but without an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of SAR image changes. Therefore, two important problems arise. The first is what kind of change each approach can detect. The second is how much they can detect a kind of change. Although the importance to model any kind of changes has been realized, there is no principled methodology to carry out the analysis due to the difficulty in modeling various kinds of changes. In this paper, we propose a benchmark methodology to reach this goal by simulating selected kinds of changes in addition to using real data with changes. Six kinds of SAR changes for eight typical image categories are simulated, i.e., reflectivity changes, first-order, second-order, and higher order statistical changes, linear and nonlinear changes. Based on this methodology for change simulation, a comprehensive evaluation of information similarity measures is carried out. An explicit conclusion we have drawn from the evaluation is that the various methods behave very differently for all kinds of changes. We hope that this study will promote the advancement of this topic. © 2015 IEEE.","Signal detection; Synthetic aperture radar; Benchmark evaluation; Comprehensive evaluation; Earth observations; Information similarity; Multi-temporal SAR images; Reflectivity changes; Similarity measure; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; benchmarking; EOS; image analysis; simulation; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Change detection; change simulation; information similarity measure; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945365524"

The Cband inSAR data is of ERS 1/2 tandem pairs with one day interval for spring of 1996 and L-band PolinSAR data of ALOS-PALSAR-2 for spring of 2015 is used in glacier velocity estimation. Glacier classification is done using multi-temporal C-and L-band SAR data and also with single date full polarization and hybrid polarization data. In first part, a mean displacement of 9 cm day-1 was recorded using SAR interferometric technique using ERS 1/2 tandem data of 25-26 March 1996. Previous studies using optical data based methods has shown that Gangotri glacier moves with an average displacement of 4 cm and 6 cm day-1. As present results using ERS 1/2 data were obtained for one day interval, i.e., 25th March 05:00pm to 26th March 05:00 pm, 1996, variation in displacement may be due to presence of snow or wet snow melting over the glacier, since during this time snow melt season is in progress in Gangotri glacier area. Similarly the results of glacier velocity derived using ALOSPALSAR-2 during 22 March-19 April 2015 shows the mean velocity of 5.4 to 7.4 cm day-1 during 28 day time interval for full glacier and main trunk glacier respectively. This L-band data is already corrected for Faraday's rotation effects by JAXA, and tropospheric correction are also being applied to refine the results. These results are significant as it is after gap of 20 years that DInSAR methods has given glacier velocity for fast moving Himalayan glacier.

In order to understand the dynamics of savanna ecosystems, information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation over large areas is needed. In this study we sought to assess multi-temporal ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter to map woody cover in southern African savannas. The SAR data were acquired from the JAXA archive, covering various modes and seasons between 2007 and 2010. We used high resolution airborne LiDAR data as reference data to interpret SAR parameters (including backscatter intensities and polarimetric decomposition components), to develop SAR-based models as well as to validate SAR-based woody cover maps. The LiDAR survey was carried out in April 2008 with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO, http://cao.ciw.edu). The highest correlations to the reference data were obtained from SAR backscatters of the dry season, followed by the wet season, and the end of the wet season. The volume components from polarimetric decompositions (Freeman-Durden, Van Zyl) were calculated for the end of wet season, and showed similar correlations to the LiDAR data, when compared to cross-polarized backscatters (HV). We observed increased correlation between the SAR and LiDAR datasets with an increase in the spatial scale at which datasets were integrated, with an optimum value at 50m. We modeled woody cover using three scenarios: (1) a single date scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on a single SAR image), (2) a multi-seasonal scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR images from the same year and different seasons, based on key phonological difference), and (3) a multi-annual scenario (i.e., woody cover map based on SAR data from different years). Predicted SAR-based woody cover map based on Fine Beam Dual Polarization dry season SAR backscatters of all years yielded the best performance with an R2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 7.88%. However, single dry season SAR backscatter achieved only a slightly lower accuracy (R2=0.66, RMSE=8.45%) as multi-annual SAR data, suggesting that a single SAR scene from the dry season can also be used for woody cover mapping. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the number of samples on the model prediction performance and showed the benefits of a larger spatially explicit LiDAR dataset compared to much smaller number of samples as they can be collected in the field. Collectively, our results demonstrate that L-band backscatter shows promising sensitivity for the purposes of mapping woody cover in southern African savannas, particularly during the dry season leaf-off conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Southern Africa; Backscattering; Carbon; Drought; Ecology; Ecosystems; Mapping; Observatories; Optical radar; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Vegetation; ALOS PALSAR; Carnegie airborne observatories; L-band; Savanna; Seasonality; Woody cover; accuracy assessment; ALOS; assessment method; backscatter; carbon cycle; ecological modeling; energy flux; lidar; mapping method; PALSAR; prediction; resolution; satellite data; satellite imagery; savanna; seasonal variation; seasonality; spatial distribution; synthetic aperture radar; vegetation cover; woody plant; Radar imaging","ALOS PALSAR; Backscatter; Carnegie Airborne Observatory; L-band; LiDAR; Savanna; Seasonality; Woody cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934939265"

Being capable of delineating not only the areas with or without snow cover but also status changes among no-snow, wet snow, and dry snow, we have developed a critical means to assess the water resource in alpine areas. © 2015 by the authors.","Geometrical optics; Interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar; Water resources; Change detection; Interferometric SAR; Multi-temporal; Snow covers; Temporal coherence; Snow","Change detection; Interferometric SAR InSAR; Multitemporal coherence data; Snow cover and status change; Temporal-coherence component","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942546621"

Traditionally, the Demons, Combined Registration and Segmentation (CRS) approach, Markov Random Field (MRF) and Mutual Information (MI) based approaches offers more computational complexity, minimum edge preservation measure (QAB/F) during image registration process. To maximize the quality of edge preservation measure and MI with minimum computational time, this paper proposes hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-Affine Transformation (AT) technique for an image registration. An enhanced registration process and the cloud removal technique are proposed for quality improvement of an image. Initially, Gaussian filtering in the preprocessing stage removes the noises present in an image. The proposed PSO extracts the matching points between the reference image and target image in the multi-temporal image dataset. Then, the AT on extracted matching points provides the specific feature points from main features. Finally, the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) classification forms the cluster of specific feature points. The extracted feature points from PSO-AT maximize the quality of edge preservation and MI with efficient cloud removal. The comparative analysis with the traditional methods of Control Point -Least Square (CP-LS), Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) on the parameters of QAB/F and MI shows the effectiveness of proposed PSO-AT.","","Affine transformation (AT); Combined registration segmentation (CRS); Control point-least square (CP-LS); Edge detection; Image registration; Markov random field (MRF); Multi-temporal image (MTI); Multi-temporal image processing (MTIP); Mutual information (MI); Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Relevance vector machine (RVM); Remote sensing (RS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959236169"

Due to the regular revisit periods of SAR platforms and the decorrelation of SAR images, the estimation of ground deformation retrieved from a particular SAR dataset may be of low resolution in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To enhance the spatial and temporal sampling rates in ground deformation estimation, a multiplatform SAR dataset combination strategy is proposed, based on the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MTInSAR) technique and the Same Name target point Pairs (SNPs) combination approach. The combination strategy has been tested and applied in the Cangzhou area, which has suffered from ground subsidence due mainly to groundwater extraction. The derived results show that the deformation monitoring sampling rates can be improved in the space and time dimensions when compared to the results obtained from a single-platform SAR dataset, which makes the multiplatform SAR dataset combination strategy useful for uneven (spatially variable) and nonlinear (temporally variable) deformation detection. Moreover, the results derived from the combination strategy tend to be more reliable and have fewer noise points. © 2016, Copyright © Crown copyright.","Groundwater; Synthetic aperture radar; Combination approaches; Combination strategies; Deformation detection; Deformation monitoring; Ground deformations; Groundwater extraction; Temporal dimensions; Vertical component; Deformation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975253330"

Changes in the Earth's surface can result from a wide range of phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, variations in ground water levels, and changes in wetland water levels. Time series analysis is applied to interferometric phase measurements, which wrap around when the observed motion is larger than one-half of the radar wavelength. Thus, the spatio-temporal ""unwrapping"" of phase observations is necessary to obtain physically meaningful results. Several different algorithms have been developed for time series analysis of InSAR data to solve for this ambiguity. These algorithms may employ different models for time series analysis, but they all generate a first-order deformation rate, which can be compared to each other. However, there is no single algorithm that can provide optimal results in all cases. Since time series analyses of InSAR data are used in a variety of applications with different characteristics, each algorithm possesses inherently unique strengths and weaknesses.

It is essential to monitor this subsidence, which has potential hazards and risks. Time series InSAR (TS-InSAR), such as small baselines subset (SBAS), is a powerful tool that can monitor ground deformation with high accuracy and at high spatial resolution over a long time interval. However, the high computational complexity may exceed computer memory limit when high-spatial resolution SAR (such as TerraSAR-X, TSX) images are used. In this article, the multi-look approach is introduced to the SBAS tool from StaMPS/MTI (Stanford method for persistent scatter/multi-temporal InSAR) in order to balance the spatial resolution and subsidence information in detection. The looks used for multi-looking are first fixed in terms of the accuracy of deformation and the density of coherent points. Then, the recent subsidence in Tianjin is extracted using multi-looking SBAS based on 48 TSX images acquired from 2009 to 2013. The results are validated by levelling measurements with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.7 mm year–1, which demonstrates that SBAS analysis can effectively monitor deformation based on multi-looking TSX acquisitions in the area under investigation. Besides, the results also show that Tianjin has been suffering from subsidence during this period, and there were two separate large subsidence basins located in this study area with more than 500 mm cumulative subsidence. Moreover, the subsidence rate increased after December 2010 in Tianjin. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","China; Tianjin; Deformation; Groundwater; Image resolution; Mean square error; Satellites; Computer memory; Ground deformations; High spatial resolution; Potential hazards; Root mean square errors; Spatial resolution; Subsidence basins; Tianjin , China; hazard assessment; remote sensing; spatial resolution; subsidence; synthetic aperture radar; TerraSAR-X; Subsidence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947967642"

The Sicily region is extensively affected by hydrogeological hazards since several landslides regularly involved local areas across time. In particular, intense and catastrophic landslide phenomena have recently occurred in the San Fratello area; the last event took place in February 2010, causing large economic damage. Thus, the need for an accurate ground motions and impacts mapping and monitoring turns out to be significantly effective, in order to better identify active unstable areas and to help proper risk-mitigation measures planning. The combined use of historical and recent C-band satellites and current X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar sensors of a new generation permits spatially and temporally detection of landslide-induced motions on a local scale and to properly provide a complete multi-temporal evaluation of their effects on the area of interest. PSI ground motion rates are cross-compared with local failures and damage of involved buildings, recently recognized by in situ observations.

A-DInSAR analyses have been performed with two different approaches: a standard Persistent Scatterers (PS) analysis with linear models to estimate PS velocity over the whole area and local scale analyses on some specific sub-areas with a no-model approach, more appropriate for non-linear deformation detection. . © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Antennas; Deformation; Landslides; Synthetic aperture radar; Deformation process; Differential interferometric sar; Feasibility analysis; Insar; Landslide mapping; Landslide-prone areas; Nonlinear deformations; Persistent scatterers; Slope protection","Insar; Landslide; Landslide Mapping; Persistent Scatterers","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944596583"

To calculate the phase velocity, two methods are considered. The first is based on the different positions of IW images acquired by Environmental Satellite-advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) and Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in a very short time interval, and the second method uses the images of several packets of IWs associated with semidiurnal tidal period in either a single ASAR or MODIS image. The former is termed as the multitemporal images (MTI) method, and the latter is referred to as the tidal period images (TPI) method. The results show that the wave velocities estimated by the MTI method have strong correlation with those derived from a depth-dependent IW propagation theory, while those by the TPI method have moderate correlation. Both the methods can be used to estimate the IW phase velocity but with reduced accuracy by the TPI method. The main reason of this reduced accuracy is the long tidal period during which the characteristics of IWs change as they propagate over long distance in the water of variable currents and/or bottom topography. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Phase velocity; Radiometers; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Velocity; Advanced synthetic aperture radars; Environmental satellites; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-temporal image; Multiple satellites; Propagation theory; Semi-diurnal tidal period; Short time intervals; bottom topography; MODIS; phase velocity; satellite data; satellite imagery; shallow water; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; topography; water depth; wave velocity; Space-based radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930455581"

Over the past two decades, interferometric SAR (InSAR) has been demonstrated as the optimal remote sensing technique to estimate surface deformation with high spatial coverage and vertical accuracy over traditional surveying methods. In this paper, the outcome of advanced differential InSAR processing to detect and analyze ground surface behavior due to man-made interactions are presented. An improvement was achieved in the temporal resolution and accuracy using a unique combination of both C-band and L-band SAR satellite acquisitions with different temporal and spatial baselines. The two alternate DInSAR methodologies were applied on the northeastern part of the Surat Basin, Australia for an area without long-term ground-based geodetic observations. The regions undergoing downward motion are located above coal seam gas (CSG) mining sites with rates up to 28 mm/year. Three scenarios were identified: (1) extensive groundwater extraction from shallow aquifers due to CSG mining, (2) CSG mining without direct impact on groundwater resources and (3) patchy uplift over an industrial forest adjacent to a CSG mining district. Contrary to a previous study conducted in this region using the PSInSAR™ technique which reported stability of the area with insignificant surface deformation, this study shows that there are considerable deformation signals consistent with resource extraction. Consequently, it is shown that the SBAS approach is superior to PSInSAR™ for deformation monitoring with focusing on naturally distributed scatterers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Australia; Surat Basin; Aquifers; Coal deposits; Deformation; Extraction; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series analysis; Australia; InSAR; SBAS; Surat Basin; Surface deformation; accuracy assessment; coal seam; data acquisition; deformation mechanism; extraction method; geodetic network; groundwater abstraction; human activity; mining industry; remote sensing; satellite data; surface structure; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; Groundwater resources","Australia; InSAR; SBAS; Surat Basin; Surface deformation; Time series analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957948121"

The Leizhou site (20°52'N, 110°05'E) is located in Guangdong Province in southern China and is dominated by rice paddies. There was a lack of optical data acquisitions during certain years. There are two rice growth seasons per year. Multitemporal Radarsat-2 products were acquired in the early rice growth season of 2014. First, multi-Temporal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters based on H/A/Alpha and Yamaguchi polarimetric decomposition theories were extracted and analyzed to distinguish between rice paddies and other typical land cover types, which could help select the optimal rice growth stage and image characteristics for early season classification. Second, an object-oriented technique was applied to time series backscattering coefficient images (HH, HV, VH, VV), H/A/Alpha images (Entropy, Anistropy and Alpha) and Yamaguchi images (volume, double-bounce, surface and helix). Based on the segmentation images, the supervised Bayes, KNN, SVM and Decision tree classifier were used to identify rice. The results indicated that in flat area, 1) Backscatter images and Yamaguchi images were better than H/A/Alpha images in the rice identification application, and 2) At the early rice growth season, the 0430-Yamaguchi image combined with the objectoriented decision tree algorithm were capable of delivering highly accurate maps of rice (0.9236), while the 0524-backscatter image combined with the object-oriented decision tree algorithm could acquire the highest classification accuracy (0.9278) at the end of the rice growth season.

One challenging problem in this area is the registration of low-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In general, extracting feature points from such images is difficult due to the coarse observation and the severe speckle. The use of area similarity for image registration is another important branch to solve the problem. A similarity measure based on a conditional density function (cdf) is proposed. The cdf is specially tailored for SAR images, where the speckle is generally assumed as multiplicative gamma noise with unit mean. Additionally, a two-step procedure is devised for the registration of intro-model SAR images to improve the computational efficiency. First, the two images are roughly aligned considering only the translational difference. Then small blocks from the two images are accurately aligned and the center point of each block is treated as a control point, which is finally used to obtain the precise affine transformation between the two images. Five SAR image datasets are tested in the experiment part, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Computational efficiency; Efficiency; Image enhancement; Image registration; Speckle; Synthetic aperture radar; Affine transformations; Conditional density function; Extracting features; Low resolution; Multi-temporal; Similarity measure; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Two-step procedure; Radar imaging","conditional density function; image registration; low-resolution; similarity measure; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955445094"

Multi-temporal COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR data collected from ascending and descending orbits were processed for the time period encompassing the unrest behavior.

Based on multi-temporal InSAR processing, we have mapped the ground surface deformation before, during, and after the 2010 eruption. During the 3 years before the 2010 eruption, the volcano inflated at an average rate ∼1.7 cm/yr with marked higher rate of 6.6 cm/year during the 6 months prior to the 2010 eruption. The inflation is constrained to the top of the volcano. Since the 2010 eruption to Jan. 2011, the volcano has subsided for about 3 cm. The observed inflation and deflation are modeled with a Mogi and Prolate spheroid source. The source of inflation is located about 0.3-1.3 km below sea level directly underneath the crater. On the other hand, deflation source is modeled about 0.6-1.0 km depth with coeruption period. The average volumetric change was about from -2.7×10-5 to 1.9×10-6 km3/yr during the deformation event. Modified Laharz model compare to Landsat-7 ETM+ image through supervised classification method. We interpret the inflation was due to magma accumulation at a shallow reservoir beneath Sinabung.

The presence or absence of water in reed marshes has a significant impact on the whole ecosystem and remains a key indicator to identify the effective area of a wetland and help estimate the degree of degeneration. Past studies have demonstrated the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to map water-level changes for flooded reeds. However, the identification of the different hydrological states of reed marshes is often poorly understood. The analysis given in this paper shows that L-band interferometric coherence is very sensitive to the water surface conditions beneath reed marshes and so can be used as classifier. A method based on a statistical analysis of the coherence distributions for wet and dry reeds using InSAR pairs was, therefore, investigated in this study. The experimental results were validated by in-situ data and showed very good agreement. This is the first time that information about the water cover under herbaceous wetlands has been derived using interferometric coherence values. This method can also effectively and easily be applied to monitor the hydrological conditions beneath other herbaceous wetlands.","Climate change; Coherent light; Data fusion; Interferometry; Probability density function; Radar; Water levels; Wetlands; Human activities; Hydrological condition; Interferometric coherence; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Multi-temporal; Probability density function (pdf); Water level changes; Wetland vegetation; Synthetic aperture radar","Coherence; Herbaceous wetlands; Hydrological conditions; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); Probability density function (PDF); Wet reeds extraction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975055672"

Nevertheless, the archaeological detection capability of this technology has so far not been fully assessed. This paper is a pioneering effort to assess the potential of satellite SAR X-band data in the detection of archaeological marks. We focus on the results obtained from a collaborative contribution jointly carried out by archaeologists and remote sensing experts in order to test the use of COSMO-SkyMed data in different contexts and environmental conditions. The methodological approaches we adopted are based on two different feature-enhancement procedures: (i) multi-temporal analysis performed to reduce noise and highlight archaeological marks; (ii) single-date analysis to assess the ability of the single SAR scene to detect archaeological features like with optical remote sensing. Results from multi-temporal data analysis, conducted using 40 scenes from COSMO-SkyMed X-band Stripmap data (27 February to 17 October 2013), enable us to detect unknown archaeological crop, soil, and shadow marks representing Luoyang city, dating from the Eastern-Han to Northern-Wei Dynasties. Single-date analyses were conducted using COSMO-SkyMed Spotlight scenes acquired for Sabratha (Libya) and Metapontum (southern Italy). These case studies were selected because they are characterized by diverse superficial conditions (desert and Mediterranean area) and archaeological marks (crop, soil and shadow).

Different from the conventional approach the proposed method estimates the VDRs by multi-temporal interferometric SAR processing (i.e., temporarily coherent point InSAR, TCPInSAR) and the localized least square (LS) solution, through which the horizontal displacement rates (HDRs) can be also derived as the by-product. The three types of displacement rates in the radar line of sight (LOS) are first estimated by TCPInSAR with use of the ascending/descending CSK and descending TSX data. Both the VDRs and HDRs are then estimated by a localized LS method on the basis of the three types of LOS displacement rates derived by TCPInSAR. For comparison purposes, the VDRs for the single-platform SAR data are also obtained through dividing the LOS displacement rates by the cosine of the radar incidence angle. The analysis with the aid of GPS data shows the horizontal motion due to the geological settings in Shanghai cannot be ignored, and the VDRs derived from the single-platform data are not accurate and reliable without taking into account the horizontal motion. The experimental results indicate the TCPInSAR-LS method can be used to efficiently improve the accuracy in the VDRs by integrating the multi-platform SAR data and considering both horizontal and vertical motion, thus overcoming the disadvantages in the conventional approach. The improved VDRs in Shanghai range between -22.8 and 9.6 mm/year, while the relative east-west motion rates range between -7.2 and 6.2 mm/year, and the relative north-south motion is subtle and can be ignored. Analysis of the improved VDRs shows that a slightly uplifting area of about 70 km2 appears in the west downtown of Shanghai, and a subsiding bowl appears in the Hongkou District of Shanghai. The validation indicates that the uplifting trend can be ascribed to the measures conducted by the Shanghai municipal government, i.e., decreasing the groundwater pumping volume and increasing the groundwater recharge volume. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Global positioning system; Groundwater; Image processing; Least squares approximations; Radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Horizontal displacements; LS solutions; SAR Images; TCPInSAR; Vertical displacements; Radar imaging","Horizontal displacement rates; Localized LS solution; Multi-platform sar images; TCPInSAR; Vertical displacement rates","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939439494"

With the use of time series images and estimations such as Coherence along with amplitude information can reveal changes more effectively using SAR data. Coherence is a measure of phase correlation, defined as the correlation coefficient. The amplitude of the single look complex (SLC) data is what is generally known as the SAR image. Similarly, the amplitude of the coherence will be referred to as coherence image. SAR images include information about the intensity and phase of the backscattered signal from a target. These two measurements maybe used in different ways, such as detection of deformation based on phase or land cover classification and change detection by utilizing the intensity. For this study two disaster scenarios, first a flood effect in the Gall district of Sri Lanka and secondly a tsunami and earthquake effect in Tohoku region, Japan is considered for the change detection. Single polarization (HH), of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) phased array type L-band SAR (PALSAR) imagery was used in this study. Level 1.1 SLC image pair was co-registered and stacked together with half a pixel precision then the coherence estimation process was completed. Then to obtain multi temporal coherence map the composite image was taken with pre disaster as red image post disaster as green and coherence as blue Coherence value less than 0.4 was taken to distinguish the change. Then coherence image and the multi temporal coherence map were analyzed to detect changes. ACD (Amplitude Change Detection) which is the incoherent method, compares the backscatter of two images acquired using the same imaging parameters. It is sensitive to significant changes that strongly influence the backscatter of an area where the amplitude change less than -3 taken as the change. CCD (Coherence Change Detection) exploits the coherence of two SAR images acquired at different times using the same imaging parameters. According to the derived results and the visual analyze using Landsat 8 NDVI image and Google Earth historical images as reference. Finally it reveals that CCD can be used to detect subtle changes occurring between the two observation dates that would remain undetected by incoherent change detection techniques.","Backscattering; Disasters; Image acquisition; Image analysis; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Amplitude; Change detection; Correlation coefficient; Intensity; Land cover classification; Observation satellites; Single-look complex datum; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging","Amplitude; Change detection; Disaster; Intensity; SAR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018356893"

However, due to the limitations of the lifetime and revisit cycle, a single satellite platform cannot provide sufficient data sources for estimating and analyzing the long-time deformation monitoring (e.g. spanning 5 to 10 years). In order to extend the time span of deformation monitoring, this paper proposes the model-constrained small baseline subset (MC-SBAS) method by using the multi-platform SAR images. This method can integrate the SAR datasets from different satellites and improve the efficiency of deformation monitoring. The validation is performed by taking the Southern California as the study area and using 10 ERS SAR images (acquired between 2002 and 2005) and 20 EnviSat ASAR images (acquired between 2004 and 2008). In this validation, the spatiotemporal deformation information with the extending time span of 6.5 years in the study area is extracted by the MC-SBAS method, thus extending the time span of deformation tracking to 6.5 years. The quality of deformation results derived from both MC-SBAS and the conventional SBAS method is assessed and compared by using the ground truth data obtained from the 6 GPS tracking stations. The validation result shows that the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the MC-SBAS and GPS results is 8.7 mm, which is less than the RMSE between the SBAS and GPS results (11.7 mm). In addition, the continuity and accuracy in the deformation time series derived from MC-SBAS are improved remarkably. © 2016, Surveying and Mapping Press.

The augmented information lying in the additional polarimetric channels represents a possibility for better discriminate different classes of changes in change detection (CD) applications. This work aims at proposing a framework for CD in multi-temporal multi-polarization SAR data. The framework includes both a tool for an effective visual representation of the change information and a method for extracting the multiple-change information. Both components are designed to effectively handle the multi-dimensionality of polarimetric data. In the novel representation, multi-temporal intensity SAR data are employed to compute a polarimetric log-ratio. The multitemporal information of the polarimetric log-ratio image is represented in a multi-dimensional features space, where changes are highlighted in terms of magnitude and direction. This representation is employed to design a novel unsupervised multi-class CD approach. This approach considers a sequential two-step analysis of the magnitude and the direction information for separating non-changed and changed samples. The proposed approach has been validated on a pair of Sentinel-1 data acquired before and after the flood in Tamil-Nadu in 2015.

Multi-temporal image analysis of high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery of the Southern Carpathian Mountains, Romania revealed the small dynamic nature and a slow geomorphologic evolution of rock glaciers over a 46-yr period of record (1968-2014). Nine rock glaciers located in glacial cirques and troughs within the central area of Retezat Mountain were included in this study. Overall, the estimated displacement rates are extremely low (i.e., a few cm/year) compared with other active rock glaciers from all over the world. Despite their relative attenuated activity, it appears that Judele, Valea Rea, and Pietrele are still active rock glaciers, but in an evident disequilibrium/imbalance with the actual climate. These findings document the lowest altitude and easternmost active rock glaciers at this latitude from Europe. Quantitative investigations were concentrated on Pietrele rock glacier, subject of recent field campaigns. Optical data analysis indicated a slight acceleration of the horizontal velocities at the surface of Pietrele rock glacier in recent years. This acceleration appears to be caused by an increase in the temperature of permafrost, resulting from an evident warming of external air temperature. Radar data analysis suggested seasonal variability of surface motion, with higher deformation in autumn, whereas in early summer or spring the deformation is negligible. Overall, the results obtained with cross-correlation analysis, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence analysis, and Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) multitemporal interferometry, are consistent, displaying similar deformation patterns with the highest creep rates located in the southern and western portions of the glacier. These findings are supported by thermal and geophysical measurements, which suggest the probable presence of permafrost within these areas. The observed displacements were interpreted as permafrost creep, and their very low velocity rates suggest the deforming frozen layers are very thin. These results provide (i) baseline information and decadal-scale trends and a (ii) strategy for future monitoring of the health and integrity of the rock glacier environment in the Carpathian Mountains. © 2016.","Carpathians; Hunedoara; Retezat National Park; Romania; Creep; Data handling; Deformation; Image analysis; Information analysis; Interferometry; Landforms; Optical resolving power; Permafrost; Radar; Rocks; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Carpathian Mountains; COSI-Corr; Cross correlations; InSAR; Multitemporal image analysis; National parks; Rock glaciers; SBAS; geomorphology; glacier dynamics; image analysis; periglacial environment; permafrost; rock glacier; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Carpathian Mountains; COSI-Corr; Cross-correlation; InSAR; InSAR coherence; Multi-temporal image analysis; Retezat National Park; Rock glaciers; SBAS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958260378"

This variability in acquisition geometry, radiometry, and last but not least polarimetry raises the need for a consistent SAR image description incorporating all available sensors and acquisition modes. This paper therefore introduces the framework of the Kennaugh elements to comparably represent all kinds of multi-scale, multi-temporal, multi-polarized, multi-frequency, and hence, multi-sensor data in a consistent mathematical framework. Furthermore, a novel noise model is introduced that estimates the significance and thus the (polarimetric) information content of the Kennaugh elements. This facilitates an advanced filtering approach, called multi-scale multi-looking, which is shown to improve the radiometric accuracy while preserving the geometric resolution of SAR images. The proposed methodology is finally demonstrated using sample applications that include TerraSAR-X (X-band), Envisat-ASAR, RADARSAT-2 (C-band) and ALOS-PALSAR (L-band) data as well as the combination of all three frequencies. Thus the suitability of the Kennaugh element framework for practical use in proved for advanced SAR remote sensing. © 2015 The Authors.","Applications; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radar; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Change detection; Combination; Imagery; Multi frequency; Multi sensor; Multi-temporal; Multiresolution; SAR; data set; image analysis; image resolution; imagery; numerical model; polarization; sensor; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Application; Change detection; Combination; Imagery; Multifrequency; Multiresolution; Multisensor; Multitemporal; Polarization; Radar; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922706623"

TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images of five test areas along the German North Sea coast acquired between 2008 and 2013 form the basis for the present investigation and are used to demonstrate that pairs of SAR images, if combined through basic algebraic operations, can already provide useful indicators for morphological changes and for bivalve (oyster and mussel) beds. Depending on the type of sediment, but also on the water level and on environmental conditions (wind speed) exposed sediments may show up on SAR imagery as areas of enhanced, or reduced, radar backscattering. The (multi-temporal) analysis of series of such images allows for the detection of mussel beds, and our results show evidence that also single-acquisition, multi-polarization SAR imagery can be used for that purpose.","Algebra; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Molluscs; Polarization; Remote sensing; Sediments; Shellfish; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Water levels; Wind; Algebraic operations; Environmental conditions; High resolution synthetic aperture radar; Intertidal flat; Morphological changes; Oysters bivalve beds; Radar backscattering; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Radar imaging","Intertidal flats; Oysters bivalve beds; Polarization; Shellfish; Synthetic aperture radar","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930385604"

Information about the spatial and temporal dynamics of the characteristics of urban areas is therefore needed to support sustainable urban development. Time series earth observation data obtained using radar satellites have provided effective data sources for monitoring urban areas. This chapter first describes the development of synthetic aperture radar as well as its important role in the detection and monitoring of urban areas. Then, the fundamental principle of time series radar data in monitoring urban areas is introduced and discussed. Next, to demonstrate the capacity of time series SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery for monitoring urban areas using ENVISAT/ASAR (Environmental Satellite/Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) time series radar data, Beijing city in China was selected as a test site. Beijing has all of the typical problems of a megacity such as resource, environment and population problems arising from rapid urban expansion during recent decades. A C5.0 rulesets classifier and the Multi Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MTInSAR) method were used to map the urban expansion and the millimeter level urban subsidence, respectively and the results were validated via high resolution WorldView optical datasets and leveling benchmark measurement, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy of the time series radar data for monitoring urban areas. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal characteristic of urban expansion and urban subsidence of Beijing city were analyzed. Finally, the mechanisms or driving factors for urban expansion and subsidence are addressed based on economic development, population growth and the impacts of recent Beijing government policy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980043462"
