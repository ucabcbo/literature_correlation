However, we should not forget that the potential spatial resolution that radar can achieve could be much better, more precisely, in the order of sub-wavelength. Such radar operating °mode is called radar tomography, which exploits the spatial diversity, instead of large waveform bandwidth, to achieve super high spatial resolution. Although the theory of radar tomography had been developed for decades, very few experimental validations were reported in public literatures. In this paper, the investigations on radar tomographic imaging are conducted and validated with the measurements in microwave anechoic chamber.

Otherwise, they will be merged together and appear as a single stationary target in the SAR imaging. The scenario of close targets is modelled as a multipath problem and the corresponding time-delays are estimated using the super-resolution MUSIC algorithm.

Using the essential defects of the deceptive-jamming theory, the information acquisition ability of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system in a complicated electromagnetic environment is effectively improved with limited degrees of freedom in spatial and time domains. Geometric and signal models of SAR imaging and deceptive jamming are established and the different characteristics between them are analyzed according to their working mechanisms. Upon extracting their characteristic differences via different imaging processes and enhancing them based on statistical information, the degree of separation between the true and false targets is increased. Therefore, identification on the deceptive jamming is realized. Moreover, an approach for the dynamic synthetic aperture is used to formulate an optimization problem for the reconstruction of true and false targets. By solving such a problem, the true and false targets are separately reconstructed with super-resolution, achieving the goal of deceptive-jamming suppression.

Recently, deep unfolding techniques have provided a good combination of physical model-based algorithms and the ability of neural networks to learn from data. In this vein, iterative CS-based algorithms can usually be un-rolled as neural networks with only 10 to 20 layers. When trained, it shows great computational efficiency for further TomoSAR processing. However, the learning architecture of neural networks built in this approach tends to result in error propagation and information loss, thus degrading the performance.

Selecting the optimal imaging time interval to shorten the coherent processing interval (CPI) can reduce the complexity of motion errors, but the imaging resolution is affected as well, i.e., the motion error complexity and imaging resolution are constrained by each other. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging framework for complex maneuvering ship targets to achieve the integration of super-resolution (SR) ISAR imaging and fine motion compensation (ISRFMC) under high sea state. With regard to the complex maneuvering motion of ship targets, we analyze the motion errors caused by the time-variant rotational velocity and imaging projection plane (IPP) on the echo signals, respectively, and a fine phase error model is established to uniformly represent the dual time-variant characteristic (DTVC) of complex maneuvering ship targets. Moreover, a deformed Akaike information criterion (DAIC) is developed to realize the adaptive selection of the phase error model with the image sharpness as the objective function. Underpinned by the Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) theory, the SR ISAR imaging can be realized by solving a sparsity-driven optimization problem via a modified quasi-Newton solver. Particularly, the fine phase errors are constructed as the model errors of image reconstruction, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is utilized to solve the maximum image sharpness optimization problem in order to perform the joint fine motion compensation and azimuth scaling (JFMCAS). ISRFMC or the integration of SR ISAR imaging and fine motion compensation can be achieved through alternate iteration, so as to obtain well-focused and scaled high-resolution ISAR images of complex maneuvering ship targets under high sea state. Extensive experiments based on both simulated and real data verify that the proposed algorithm is capable of addressing the conflict between imaging resolution and motion error complexity under high sea state. © 2022 IEEE.","Errors; Image reconstruction; Integration; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Iterative methods; Motion compensation; Optical resolving power; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Complex maneuvering ship target; Complexity theory; Fine motion compensation; High sea state; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Marine vehicles; Sea state; Ship targets; Signal processing algorithms; Super resolution imaging; disturbance; image resolution; imaging method; integrated approach; ship design; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Complex maneuvering ship targets; fine motion compensation; high sea state; inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR); super-resolution (SR) imaging","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124106861"

However, since the early 2010s, there have been efforts to apply ICT to various fields such as aerospace, life science, energy, and automobiles. Recently, artificial intelligence and big data technologies have also been applied in the aerospace field, among others. In the field of aerospace, earth observation attracts the most interest. One reason earth observation attracts such interest is that the availability of a satellite constellation allows more frequent observations of objects of interest. Another reason is the improvement of technologies that can process massive satellite images such as data cubes for urban change detection, disaster monitoring, and traffic analysis. When performing earth observation using satellite images, it is necessary to process a large amount of satellite information in real-time and analyze satellite images with artificial intelligence. Such research is continuing in various ways. The field of interest in this study is the processing technology for storing and retrieving large volumes of satellite images.

Generally, the Rayleigh resolution of the elevation direction is unacceptable due to the length limitation of linear array. The super-resolution imaging algorithms within the compressive sensing (CS) framework have been extensively studied because of the essential spatial sparsity in the elevation direction. However, the super-resolution performance of the existing sparse reconstruction algorithms will deteriorate dramatically in the case of lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) level or a few antenna elements. To overcome this problem, a new super-resolution imaging structure based on CS and deep neural network (DNN) for MIMO array SAR is proposed in this article. In this new algorithm, the spatial filtering based on CS is first proposed to reserve the signals only impinging from the prespecified space subregions. Thereafter, a group of parallel end-to-end DNN regression models are designed for mapping the potential sparse recovery mathematical model and further locating the true scatterers in the elevation direction. Finally, extensive simulations and airborne MIMO array SAR experiments are investigated to validate that the proposed method can realize the state-of-the-art super-resolution imaging against other existing related methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Antennas; Compressed sensing; Logistic regression; MIMO radar; MIMO systems; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Compressive sensing; Extensive simulations; Regression model; Sparse reconstruction; Spatial filterings; State of the art; Super resolution; Super resolution imaging; algorithm; artificial neural network; elevation; image resolution; radar imagery; remote sensing; signal-to-noise ratio; synthetic aperture radar; three-dimensional modeling; Deep neural networks","3-D imaging; Compressive sensing (CS); deep neural network (DNN); multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO); super-resolution; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087544345"

The precision of the application degrades with the presence of inherent speckle and poor resolution of images from the SAR image acquisition devices. Thus, the objective of the proposed method is to develop a technique to enhance the resolution while despeckling the inherent noise, simultaneously, since the conventional super resolution methods have failed to do the same. Moreover, the works from the literature that super resolve SAR images have also neglected the signal-dependent noise model. The work proposed in this paper significantly reduces the speckle and super resolves the SAR image using an Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter framework that best models the non-linearity of the system. The technique has been assessed quantitatively and qualitatively on synthetic images as well as on real SAR images. The performance evaluation based on peak signal-to-noise-ratio, structural similarity index measure, feature similarity index measure, edge preservation factor, and equivalent number of looks values throw light on the superiority of the proposed method over the standard and other recent techniques.

Many of the published cross-range scaling algorithms are based on the fast Fourier transformation (FFT). However, the FFT technique is resolution limited, so that the FFT-based algorithms will fail in the rotation velocity (RV) estimation of the slow rotation target. In this paper, we propose an accurate cross-range scaling algorithm based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. We first select some range bins with the mono-component linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal model. Then, we dechirp the signal of each selected range bin into the form of sinusoidal signal, and utilize the super-resolution MUSIC technique to accurately estimate the frequency. After processing all the range bins, a linear relationship related to the RV can be obtained. Eventually, the ISAR image can be scaled. The proposal can precisely estimate the small RV of the slow rotation target with low computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposal can also be used in the case of cross-range scaling for the sparse aperture data.

Due to the limitation of phase ambiguity and small Doppler gradient in forward-looking region, synthetic aperture radar and Doppler beam sharpening cannot work for forward-looking imaging, while real aperture radar (RAR) has arbitrary imaging geometry. Nevertheless, restricted by the antenna aperture, azimuth resolution of RAR is coarse, super-resolution technology is required to improve its azimuth resolution. Exploiting the sparse prior information of the target, the super-resolution problem can be transformed into an $L_1$ norm minimization problem mathematically. Iterative reweighted algorithm can effectively solve the $L_1$ norm minimization problem by replacing $L_1$ norm with reweighted $L_2$ norm and computing the weight in each iteration. However, it suffers from a large computational load due to the repeated multiplications and inversions of large matrices. In this article, a fast azimuth super-resolution imaging method of RAR based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) with linear sketching (LS) was proposed to achieve fast super-resolution imaging of RAR. The LS theory is employed to compress echo matrix and antenna measurement matrix into much smaller matrices via multiplying them by an embedded matrix. Then, the IRLS solver was utilized to address the reconstructed objective function. Much of the expensive computation can then be performed on the smaller matrices, thereby accelerating the algorithm. Simulations and experimental data prove that the proposed algorithm can offer a time complexity reduction without loss of imaging performance.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Iterative methods; Least squares approximations; Matrix algebra; Optical resolving power; Radar antennas; Synthetic aperture radar; Antenna measurement; Computational loads; Imaging performance; Iterative reweighted least square; L1-norm minimizations; Objective functions; Real aperture radar; Super resolution imaging; algorithm; complexity; computer simulation; experimental study; geometry; image analysis; image resolution; least squares method; numerical model; performance assessment; remote sensing; Radar imaging","Iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS); linear sketching (LS); real aperture radar (RAR); super-resolution imaging","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101751755"

Nevertheless, bistatic forward-looking imaging is seriously limited by the motion of the transmitter and receiver, resulting in a restrained resolution. In this work, the method for vortex missile-borne bistatic synthetic aperture radar (BSAR) is proposed, which combines the orbital angular momentum (OAM) beam with the traditional missile-borne BSAR technique to obtain a larger Doppler bandwidth. Higher azimuth resolution is achieved by compensating large spatial range cell migration (RCM) and serious range-azimuth coupling. Firstly, the imaging scene of vortex missile-borne BSAR and the OAM-based echo model are established and deduced. Secondly, the preprocessing method for amplitude compensation is proposed with the design of the transmitted OAM beam, which improves the uncorrelation between different pulse echoes. Then, the improved range Doppler (RD) algorithm with azimuth compensation factor is proposed for vortex missile-borne BSAR to obtain the super-resolution two-dimensional (2D) reconstruction for the target. Simulation results show that compared with conventional missile-borne BSAR, the proposed vortex missile-borne BSAR possessing the extending Doppler bandwidth can obtain superior azimuth resolution performance with the identical synthetic aperture length situation. Furthermore, this work will contribute to the application for OAM-carrying in the field of radar forward-looking imaging and the development for high-resolution missile-borne BSAR imaging technology.

In this paper, the dynamic synthetic aperture (DSA) scheme is used to extract the difference between the true and false targets. A simultaneous deceptive jamming suppression and target reconstruction method is proposed for a single channel SAR system to guarantee remote sensing ability. The system model is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem with an unknown parametric dictionary to be estimated. An iterative re-weighted method is employed to jointly handle the dictionary parameter learning and target reconstruction problem in an majorization-minimization framework, where a surrogate function majorizing the Gaussian entropy in the objective function is introduced to circumvent its non-convexity. After dictionary parameter learning, the grid mismatching problem in a fixed grid based method is avoided. Therefore, the proposed method can reap a super resolution result. Besides, a simple yet effective DSA section scheme is developed for the SAR data excerpting, in which only two DSAs are required.

For a super-resolution ISAR image for a complex perfect electric conducting (PEC) computer-Aided design (CAD) model, parameter estimation methods should be applied to M \times N scattered far-field data over M frequencies and N angles, which is conventionally obtained by using the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) technique. Therefore, N-Time ray tracing processes are required for N angles, and M \times N-Time field calculations are required for M frequencies. In this paper, to reduce the computation time for M \times N-Time field calculations, we introduce a fast scattered far-field prediction method for a super-resolution ISAR image of a complex PEC CAD model using the SBR technique. This method consists of two main ideas. First, under the small-Angle approximation, we derive a DFT-based ISAR image formula in closed form, which allows the rapid acquisition of DFT-based ISAR image through just a one-Time ray tracing process at the center frequency and angle. In addition, the scattered far-field data are also obtained by inverse discrete Fourier transforming the DFT-based ISAR image without N ray tracing processes and M \times N field calculations. Second, a field truncation method is employed to suppress errors in the scattered far-field data caused by the proposed closed-form formula. Further, by applying a parameter estimation method to the scattered far-field data, a super-resolution ISAR image is obtained quickly. Simulation results for complex PEC CAD models are in good agreement with the results for the conventional method, while the computation times are tremendously reduced. © 2013 IEEE.","Computer aided design; Design for testability; Discrete Fourier transforms; Electric conductance; Frequency estimation; Image processing; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Metadata; Optical resolving power; Radar target recognition; Ray tracing; Far field calculations; Inverse synthetic aperture radar images; One-shot inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging; Scattering center extraction; Shooting and bouncing ray  technique; Shooting and bouncing rays; Super-resolution inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging; Superresolution; Synthetic aperture radar imaging; Inverse problems","Far-field calculation; one-shot ISAR imaging; scattering center extraction; shooting and bouncing ray~(SBR) technique; super-resolution ISAR imaging","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124769797"

To resolve this issue, a multiresolution fusion discrimination (MRFD) algorithm is proposed to discriminate the reconstructed feature maps after each upsampling. First, a multiresolution discrimination process discriminates the authenticity of each upsampled feature map separately, which reduces the image distortion imposed during two consecutive upsampling processes. Besides, multiresolution feature fusion further preserves the consistent high-frequency texture structures. Finally, a multiscale dense network extracts image features in different scales, with multiscale dense block's dense connections improving parameter utilization.

In order to enhance the imaging performance for maneuvering targets, this paper offers a solution to develop the vortex inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) technique based on OAM beams design. Firstly, by the space geometry of radar and maneuvering targets, the vortex echo signal model is derived, and the characteristics are analyzed as well. Secondly, pre-processing approach is developed for initial phase compensation by the design of the transmitted OAM beams. Thirdly, the imaging method, based on fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) and Doppler centroid tracking (DCT), is proposed to achieve high-precision range compression and motion compensation to accomplish the range alignment while removing the phases caused by residual azimuth displacements. Finally, after the slow-time pulse compression, the time-invariant Doppler shift is generated, and the well-focused ISAR image can be obtained. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vortex ISAR imaging can achieve a higher azimuth resolution than the conventional planar EM ISAR paradigm with the same synthetic aperture length. This discovery provides an approach for OAM-based microwave imaging in a rather efficient manner, which has no harsh requirements for complicated and heavily computational post-processing. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Angular momentum; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Doppler effect; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Motion compensation; Motion tracking; Radar signal processing; Vortex flow; Doppler centroid tracking; Fractional Fourier transforms; Inverse synthetic aperture radars (ISAR); Maneuvering targets; Orbital angular momentum; Performance analysis; Rotational degrees of freedom; Synthetic aperture length; Radar imaging","ISAR imaging; Maneuvering targets; Orbital angular momentum; Vortex electromagnetic wave; Vortex ISAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113154101"

Compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms are generally considered as the state-of-the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra computational burdens, because of the sparse reconstruction, which cannot be solved analytically, and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative solvers. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving TomoSAR inversion approach, boldsymbol {gamma } -Net, to tackle this challenge. boldsymbol {gamma } -Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height estimate from a well-trained boldsymbol {gamma } -Net approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) while improving the computational efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically, boldsymbol {gamma } -Net reaches more than 90% detection rate in moderate super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6 dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the second-order CS-based method by a fair margin.

We propose a classification training model based on a Wasserstein GAN with a gradient penalty (U-WGAN-GP) framework, wherein a U-Net with an excellent jump connection structure is used as a generator, and a VGG-Net with high robustness is used as a discriminator, to support the reliable classification of HR/LR ISAR image pairs for the enhancement of ISAR image resolution. The WGAN-GP provides a shortcut for the gradient propagation of network parameters during the training stage through the stable encoder and decoder structure of U-Net. It inherits the echo intensity variation and position distribution characteristics of the scattering points between hypersonic objects in LR images and effectively transplants them into the generated super-resolution ISAR images, and it establishes end-to-end mapping between the HR/LR ISAR images. Moreover, the VGG-Net ensures that the generated super-resolution images are stable, controllable, and undistorted. In addition, the WGAN-GP structure combines the content and adversarial losses, optimizes the generator loss function, and uses the GP method to provide a stable and continuous training process. Finally, a traditional VGG-16 network classifier is added at the end of the training model. The proposed model is applied to an HR/LR image pair dataset of hypersonic objects.

Constrained by imaging principles, conventional high-resolution radar imaging techniques such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Doppler beam sharpening (DBS) are incapable of AFLR imaging. The real aperture radar (RAR) can obtain AFLR images using a scanning antenna, but suffers from coarse cross-range resolution. Recently, there has been much attention paid to the iterative adaptive approach (IAA), which draws from the benefits of RAR imaging and provides improved cross-range resolution. However, earlier work on the IAA imposed a convolution model on the received azimuth echo, neglecting the effect of the Doppler phase. This model mismatch degrades the imaging performance for moving platforms. To settle this problem, this paper first establishes a Doppler-convolution model of AFLR imaging, where both Doppler phase and antenna convolution effects are considered, allowing more accurate reconstruction when applying the IAA to formulate a super-resolution image. Then, a data-depended approach for Doppler centroid estimation is proposed to circumvent the problem of low estimation precision using platform motion parameters delivered by navigational devices mounted on the radar platform. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed implementation of the IAA based on the Doppler-convolution model and Doppler centroid estimation can overcome the deficiencies of the SAR and DBS techniques in the forward-looking imaging direction, and present a noticeably superior performance as compared with conventional AFLR imaging methods. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Air navigation; Convolution; Doppler effect; Imaging techniques; Iterative methods; Optical resolving power; Radar antennas; Scanning antennas; Synthetic aperture radar; Cross-range resolution; Doppler beam sharpening; Doppler centroid estimation; Forward looking; Forward looking radars; Iterative adaptive approaches (IAA); Super resolution; Super resolution imaging; antenna; computer simulation; Doppler radar; estimation method; image resolution; numerical model; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Doppler centroid estimation; forward-looking; iterative adaptive approach; super-resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070533404"

Due to the longer revisit time of homologous spaceborne satellites, only an average velocity can be determined. For longer time intervals, velocities due to short-duration events such as storms are lost. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different sources make it easy to construct image sequences with short time intervals. However, the resolution and noise level between non-homologous SAR image pairs often differ greatly. When there is a relatively large resolution difference between image pairs, the areal features between image pairs are very different, which increases the difficulty of feature registration. In this paper, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to solve the problem of resolution difference between image pairs for sea ice drift. This method can significantly improve the quality of feature registration of image pairs from different SAR sensors.

Therefore, it becomes difficult to make use of the high-resolution SAR data, and even high costs have been paid for the resolution. In this article, a novel structure-guaranteed SAR (SG-SAR) imaging algorithm is proposed by utilizing the morphology metric for the cluster feature of the scatterers of the scenes/targets of interest. By introducing structural priors in terms of morphology norm, the intended structure features can be highlighted via convex regularization. More specifically, to accommodate complicated scenarios or targets, the structure element (SE) in the morphology regularizer is designed to be spatially variant under structure tensor representation. Different from conventional convex optimizations, the proposed SG-SAR algorithm is solved under the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs), which is flexible to incorporate with the super-resolution imagery. In such cases, both sparse and structural features can be simultaneously enhanced, even with limited measurements and in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Superior convergence and robustness can be guaranteed. Moreover, a grouping mask scheme is used to accommodate the complex-valued SAR data. Finally, both simulated and measured SAR data are applied for the validation. Comparisons with the conventions are performed in terms of phase transition analysis, so as to verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Clustering algorithms; Convex optimization; Functions; Morphology; Radar imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Alternating direction method of multiplier; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Bayes method; Convex functions; Morphology regularization; Proximity operator; Radar data; Radar polarimetry; Regularisation; Structure-guaranteed synthetic aperture radar; convergence; phase transition; scattering; selection; shrinkage; synthetic aperture radar; Image resolution","Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs); morphology regularization (MR); proximity operator; structure-guaranteed synthetic aperture radar (SG-SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136028494"

However, recently developed ISAR image enhancement methods based on neural networks are only effective in the same scenarios where the training data was generated. Additionally, all these method adopted the mean-squared error as the loss function, causing the reconstructed ISAR image to lose high-frequency information and fail to capture appropriate details. To address these limitations, a single ISAR image enhancement framework based on a modified super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) is proposed in this paper. The ISAR image enhancement processing framework were improved to minimize the influence of the fixed imaging model. A combined loss function, composed of the structural similarity (SSIM) loss and the L1 loss functions, was adopted in the proposed framework to retain the high-frequency information and the luminance information of the ISAR image, while improving the resolution. Through quantitative analysis of experimental results by using different quality evaluation indicators, it demonstrated that compared with extant methods, the proposed framework provides reconstructed ISAR images with higher resolution and definition over a range of different scenarios.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The convergence of the overall cost function optimization is ensured through careful selection of model parameters within a forward-backward (FB) algorithm.

MMW radar has clear superiority in many aspects, such as excellent range resolution, adaptability to various environments and low cost. However, its fatal weakness is the poor angular resolution which is very important in automotive radar applications. This shortcoming can be overcome by using a physically large aperture. However, achieving moderate angular resolution requires an array that is too large to be practically integrated into a vehicle. In this paper, a high resolution direction of arrival (DOA) approach is proposed by utilizing the relative motion between radar and targets, and a very large virtual aperture can be created by combining the signal vectors from multiple consecutive coherent processing intervals (CPIs). It should be pointed out that, the proposed approach is applicable for both stationary and moving targets even without motion data of vehicles. Therefore, it is completely different from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The effectiveness is verified by both simulation results and the measurement data.

Due to the length limitations of synthetic aperture and antenna array, the super-resolution algorithms within the framework of 2D compressive sensing (CS) have been conceived to reconstruct the azimuth-cross-track plane image because of its spatial sparsity. Since the desired scatterers are presupposed to be distributed over a series of fixed grid points, the location accuracy of the existing 2D CS algorithms is relatively low. To overcome this problem, a fast 2D gridless recovery (GLR) algorithm for the 2D imaging signal model established in the real domain is proposed in this study. First, two different forms of 2D real-valued signal models with uniform or random sampling on the azimuth-cross-track plane are reconstructed by means of unitary transformation. Further, the real-domain based 2D sparse signal gridless reconstruction approach is derived. Finally, extensive simulation results validate that the proposed 2D real-valued GLR approach can approximately improve the computational efficiency by a factor of ten in terms of CPU time when compared with that of the 2D GLR algorithm in the complex domain.  © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","Antenna arrays; Compressed sensing; Computational efficiency; Image processing; MIMO radar; MIMO systems; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Complex domains; Compressive sensing; Extensive simulations; Location accuracy; Random sampling; Recovery algorithms; Super resolution algorithms; Unitary transformations; Signal reconstruction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091934819"

Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has been applied to TomoSAR imaging with the use of very-high-resolution (VHR) SAR images delivered by modern SAR systems, such as TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. Compared with the traditional Fourier transform and spectrum estimation methods, using sparse information for TomoSAR imaging can obtain super-resolution power and robustness and is only minorly impacted by the sidelobe effect. However, due to the tight control of SAR satel-lite orbit, the number of acquisitions is usually too low to form a synthetic aperture in the elevation direction, and the baseline distribution of acquisitions is also uneven. In addition, artificial outliers may easily be generated in later TomoSAR processing, leading to a poor mapping product. Focusing on these problems, by synthesizing the opinions of various experts and scholarly works, this paper briefly reviews the research status of sparse TomoSAR imaging. Then, a joint sparse imaging algo-rithm, based on the building points of interest (POIs) and maximum likelihood estimation, is proposed to reduce the number of acquisitions required and reject the scatterer outliers. Moreover, we adopted the proposed novel workflow in the TerraSAR-X datasets in staring spotlight (ST) work mode. The experiments on simulation data and TerraSAR-X data stacks not only indicated the ef-fectiveness of the proposed approach, but also proved the great potential of producing a high-pre-cision dense point cloud from staring spotlight (ST) data. © 2021 by the authors.

Instead, improving the SAR spatial resolution requires large transmitted bandwidth and relatively long synthetic apertures that for regulatory and practical reasons are impossible to be met. This issue gets particularly relevant when dealing with Stripmap mode acquisitions and with relatively low carrier frequency sensors (where relatively large bandwidth signals are more difficult to be transmitted).

In a warfighting environment, good recognition performance is required even with a high depression angle. To address this issue, we combine the super-resolution method and the CNN.

However, the cross-track resolution is unacceptable due to the length limitation of the MIMO antenna array. The superresolution algorithms within the framework of compressive sensing (CS) have been introduced to recover the cross-track signal because of its inherent spatial sparsity. The existing sparse recovery algorithms for 3-D SAR are attempted to find the sparse solution in the complex domain directly, which requires a very high computational complexity. To overcome this problem, a new fast 3-D imaging algorithm based on real-valued sparse representation is proposed in this paper. In this new algorithm, unitary transformation can be employed to transform the sparse signal recovery model of uniform/nonuniform MIMO array SAR from the complex domain to the real domain. Thus, a real-valued reweighted ℓ2,1-norm minimization model is established. In addition, a modification of the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) is used to reconstruct the 3-D image for further improving the computational efficiency. Moreover, the theoretical analysis of computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is derived when compared with an existing complex domain algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations and MIMO array SAR real experimental results are illustrated to validate that the proposed algorithm can reduce the computational complexity significantly in terms of CPU time while still maintaining the inherent advantages of superresolution and robustness against the noise. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Antenna arrays; Codes (symbols); Compressed sensing; Computational complexity; Feedback control; Image enhancement; Iterative methods; MIMO radar; MIMO systems; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Recovery; Signal reconstruction; Synthetic aperture radar; Telecommunication repeaters; 1-norm minimizations; 3-D synthetic aperture radar (3-D SAR); Compressive sensing; Sparse representation; Super resolution; Unitary transformations; Computational efficiency","3-D synthetic aperture radar (3-D SAR); Compressive sensing (CS); computational complexity; multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO); real-valued sparse representation; reweighted l<sub>2</sub>,1-norm minimization; superresolution; unitary transformation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071941869"

In order to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), typical TomoSAR applications often require dozens of scenes of SAR images. However, limited by time and cost, the available SAR images are often only 3–5 scenes in practice, which makes the traditional TomoSAR technique unable to produce satisfactory SNR and elevation resolution. To tackle this problem, the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed to improve the TomoSAR 3D reconstruction by learning the prior information of building. Moreover, the number of tracks required can be reduced to three. Firstly, a TomoSAR 3D super-resolution dataset is constructed using high-quality data from the airborne array and low-quality data obtained from a small amount of tracks sampled from all observations. Then, the CGAN model is trained to estimate the corresponding high-quality result from the low-quality input. Airborne data experiments prove that the reconstruction results are improved in areas with and without overlap, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the network pretrained on the airborne dataset is directly used to process the spaceborne dataset without any tuning, and generates satisfactory results, proving the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The comparative experiment with nonlocal algorithm also shows that the proposed method has better height estimation and higher time efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

Aiming at the above problems, in this paper, a Dilated-Resnet CNN (DR-CNN) super-resolution model based on feature reuse, i.e., Feature Reuse Dilated-Resnet CNN (FRDR-CNN), is proposed and perceptual loss is introduced, which accurately realizes four times the semantic super-resolution of SAR images. To increase the receptive field, a DR-CNN structure is used to limit the serious loss of the feature map's resolution in the model, improving the sensitivity to tiny details. To maximize the utilization of features at different levels, the FRDR-CNN cascades the feature maps of different levels, which greatly improves the efficiency of the feature extraction module and further improves the super-resolution accuracy. With the introduction of the perceptual loss, this method has a superior performance in recovering image texture and edge information. Experimental results of the study show that the FRDR-CNN algorithm is more capable of providing small objects' super-resolution and more accurate in the visual reconstruction of contour details, compared with traditional algorithms and several popular CNN super-resolution algorithms.

However, the existing SAR super-resolution (SR) methods usually reconstruct the images by a determined degradation model and hardly consider multiplicative speckle noise, meanwhile, most SR models are trained with synthetic datasets in which the low-resolution (LR) images are down-sampled from their high-resolution (HR) counterparts. These constraints cause a serious domain gap between the synthetic and real SAR images. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an unsupervised blind SR method for SAR images by introducing SAR priors in a cycle-GAN framework. First, a learnable probabilistic degradation model combined with SAR noise priors was presented to satisfy various SAR images produced from different platforms. Then, a degradation model and a SR model in a unified cycle-GAN framework were trained simultaneously to learn the intrinsic relationship between HR–LR domains. The model was trained with real LR and HR SAR images instead of synthetic paired images to conquer the domain gap.

The motion errors arising from translational and rotational motion further aggravate the image defocusing. For the limited bandwidth and short aperture (LB-SA) signal, this letter proposes a novel 2-D joint super-resolution (2D-JSR) ISAR imaging with joint motion compensation and azimuth scaling (JMCAS) algorithm. In this technique, a 2D-JSR signal model is established, enabling the 2-D high-resolution ISAR image to be generated by solving a sparsity-driven optimization problem with a modified quasi-Newton solver. In addition, a new JMCAS algorithm is developed to enhance the focusing performance of image. Not only can this algorithm jointly correct the range shift and phase error caused by translational motion, it can also complete the azimuth scaling and range spatial-variant phase error (RSVPE) compensation simultaneously.

Moreover, synthetic aperture radar images are characterized by much more important information than that introduced by optical images. The single image super-resolution is considered a challenging process, especially for synthetic aperture radar images which are usually degraded by high level of speckle noise. Due to the success of convolutional neural networks in many super-resolution optical image applications, a proposed regression layer-based framework is exploited for synthetic aperture radar image enhancement. The proposed regression layer is used during the learning phase to drive the back-propagation error based on the structure similarity index loss function. The structure similarity index is a quality assessment based on comparing the structural information. Consequently, the proposed loss function compares the statistical values of the network output images with that of the optimal target images. Moreover, the proposed framework introduces the concept of adjusting the proportions of the structure similarity index components (luminance, contrast and structure) according to their impacts, by changing their exponents. In addition to that, the proposed layer modifies the statistical properties of the target images, in such a way that drives learning to enhance the resulting image structure and eliminate the speckle noise. This layer is useful for noise reduction and super-resolution applications, especially for those dedicated to synthetic aperture radar images. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Backpropagation; Convolution; Image denoising; Image enhancement; Multilayer neural networks; Noise abatement; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Regression analysis; Speckle; Convolution neural network; Image super resolutions; Optical image; Regression layer; Similarity indices; Single image super-resolution; Single images; Structure similarity; Superresolution; Synthetic aperture radar images; Synthetic aperture radar","Convolution neural network; Regression layer; Single image super-resolution; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125264077"

To improve the resolution and reduce the sidelobes in elevation, the HoloSAR imaging mode requires many passes in elevation, thus decreasing its feasibility. In this article, an imaging method based on iterative adaptive approach (IAA) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is proposed for the HoloSAR with limited elevation passes to achieve super-resolution reconstruction in elevation. For the elevation reconstruction in each range-azimuth cell, the proposed method first adopts the nonparametric IAA to retrieve the elevation profile with improved resolution and suppressed sidelobes. Then, to obtain sparse elevation estimates, the GLRT is used as a model order selection tool to automatically recognize the most likely number of scatterers and obtain the reflectivities of the detected scatterers inside one range-azimuth cell. The proposed method is a super-resolving method. It does not require averaging in range and azimuth, thus it can maintain the range-azimuth resolution. In addition, the proposed method is a user parameter-free method, so it does not need the fine-tuning of any hyperparameters.

However, high-resolution ISAR images require large bandwidth and large coherent integration angle, which is limited by the physical conditions of the imaging system. In this vein, super-resolution of ISAR images is of vital importance. However, there is a lack of datasets for polarimetric ISAR super-resolution. Focused on this issue, a real physical degradation polarimetric ISAR super-resolution dataset are constructed utilizing electromagnetic simulation data of different bandwidths and different imaging apertures. On this basis, a group residual attention network (GRAN) for polarimetric ISAR image super-resolution is constructed. The main contribution of this work falls into three parts. Firstly, a polarimetric ISAR dataset is constructed. Secondly, since the polarimetric ISAR data is complex with multiple channels, the input data is divided into four groups for convolution processing to excavate the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the complex data. Thirdly, a non-local attention module is added to the residual block to capture the long-range dependency and extract the channel relationship.

To reduce the angular ambiguity given by the sidelobes, it is necessary to increase the spatial information using several distributed antennas. However, this increases considerably the system complexity and cost. In this paper, we present a novel processing scheme that combines the principle of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to a MIMO system with widely separated antennas. Exploiting multiple consecutive observations, the spatial information increases and the sidelobes are considerably mitigated. The approach is particularly suitable for naval scenarios, where the low speed of the platform and the long pulse repetition interval make the MIMO processing more indicated than SAR. A simulative analysis considering realistic parameters for a maritime application reveal a sidelobe suppression enhancement as high as 14 dB. Moreover, specific tests show that an error of 10% in the estimation of the platform speed does not affect the overall detection performance. The proposed approach appears very promising since the SAR-like data fusion allows lowering the sidelobes while preserving the high cross-range resolution enabled by the coherent MIMO processing. © 2019 EuMA.","Antenna lobes; Data fusion; MIMO radar; MIMO systems; Multistatic radars; Radar antennas; Surveillance radar; Cross-range resolution; Detection performance; Distributed antennas; Multi-input multi-output radars; Multi-static; Naval surveillance; Side-lobe suppression; Super resolution; Synthetic aperture radar","MIMO-SAR radar; Multi-static radar; Naval surveillance radar; Super-resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076217514"

However, the POCS requires many low-resolution SAR images of the same area to gain a better result, usually 10 to 20 images.

Urban tomography focuses on the separation of the overlaid targets within one azimuth-range resolution cell, and on the reconstruction of their reflectivity profiles. In this work, we build on the existing methods of compressive sensing (CS) and generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), and develop a multiple scatterers detection method named CS-GLRT to automatically recognize the number of scatterers superimposed within a single pixel as well as to reconstruct the backscattered reflectivity profiles of the detected scatterers. The proposed CS-GLRT adopts a two-step strategy. In the first step, an L1-norm minimization is carried out to give a robust estimation of the candidate positions pixel by pixel with super-resolution. In the second step, a multiple hypothesis test is implemented in the GLRT to achieve model order selection, where the mapping matrix is constrained within the afore-selected columns, namely, within the candidate positions, and the parameters are estimated by least square (LS) method. Numerical experiments on simulated data were carried out, and the presented results show its capability of separating the closely located scatterers with a quasi-constant false alarm rate (QCFAR), as well as of obtaining an estimation accuracy approaching the Cramer-Rao Low Bound (CRLB). Experiments on real data of Spotlight TerraSAR-X show that CS-GLRT allows detecting single scatterers with high density, distinguishing a considerable number of double scatterers, and even detecting triple scatterers. The estimated results agree well with the ground truth and help interpret the true structure of the complex or buildings studied in the SAR images. It should be noted that this method is especially suitable for urban areas with very dense infrastructure and man-made buildings, and for datasets with tightly-controlled baseline distribution. © 2019 by the authors.","Least squares approximations; Optical resolving power; Pixels; Reflection; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tomography; Compressive sensing; Constant false alarm rate; Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test; Generalized likelihood-ratio tests; Model-order selection; Multiple hypothesis tests; Sar tomography (SARTom); Super resolution; Compressed sensing","Compressive sensing (CS); Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT); SAR tomography (TomoSAR); Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071534410"

This article surveys our systematic explorations and innovative practices for tackling such problem. The key contributions include a new sparse radar imaging theory based on L1/2 regularization theory, a new sparse radar imaging model based on echo simulation operator, a new sparse radar imaging system evaluate approach based on 3D phase diagram. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging can be formulated as a L1/2 regularization problem, which optimizes a quadratic error term of radar imaging. The method can implement SAR imaging effectively at lower sampling rates than Nyquist rate and produce higher quality images with reduced sidelobes. Echo simulation operator is constructed to generate SAR raw data by means of inverse of matched filter-based imaging procedure, instead of the exact observation matrix. The echo simulation operator based model forms a new radar imaging method, which reduces the computational complexity and memory occupation to the same order as matched filter imaging algorithm, and hence, makes L1/2 regularization reconstruction of large-scale considered scene become possible. 3D phase diagram is employed to analyze and evaluate the performance of sparse radar imaging system. In 3D phase diagram, success rates of signal recovery can be derived from the statistics of relative errors between the ground truth and the recovered signals. The success rates for each combination of SNR, sparsity and sampling ratio are provided to form a three-dimensional phase diagram. The trend of success rates is presented accurately by taking advantage of 3D phase transition boundary. We design the sparse radar prototype and conduct a series of airborne experiments, which demonstrate the applicability and potentials of the sparse radar imaging. 3D phase diagram is used to evaluate the relationship between reconstruction performance and signal-to-noise ratio. The experimental results verity the effectiveness of the L1/2 regularization method and the feasibility of 3D phase diagram. The sparse radar imaging based on L1/2 regularization has promising application prospects. Firstly, it could be generalized to deal with 3D-SAR imaging, which achieves better flexibility for system design and super-resolution capability of height dimension for reconstruction property. Then, we review some of the most popular techniques to exploit sparsity, for recovering high-dimensional matrices and higher order tensors from compressive measurements, and further emphasize the broad application prospects of higher order compressive sensing in 3D-SAR imaging. © 2018, Science Press.

This technology achieves the separation of the target and the environment through the near-field 3-D high-resolution imaging. And then the far-field RCS of the target can be obtained through the near-field-to-far-field transformation, therefore the technology has near-field and outer-field measurement capabilities. For imaging-based RCS measurement, its imaging accuracy is correlated with RCS measurement accuracy. The imaging resolution of the measurement system limits the accuracy of the target imaging and the reconstruction of the target shape, which in turn affects the RCS accuracy. Therefore, imaging resolution is one of the limiting factors that affect the accuracy of imaging-based RCS measurement. The current super-resolution imaging method can exceed the resolution of traditional imaging and improve the accuracy of imaging-based RCS measurement. In this paper, A RCS measurement method based on compressed sensing 3-D super-resolution is discussed. This method applies the 3-D super-resolution imaging of compressed sensing to the RCS measurement based on linear array (SAR) 3-D imaging. According to the imaging model, an appropriate observation matrix is designed, and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is used to reconstruct the super-resolution 3-D image of the target. The image can improve the accuracy of reconstruction of the target's shape, and then improve the accuracy of RCS obtained.

However, traditional superresolution methods are achieved after batch data collection, which requires extensive operational complexity and storage space. To solve this problem for RAR, an online detect-before-reconstruct (DBR) framework is proposed in this article based on the sparse property of targets. First, along the range direction, each sample of the echo data is detected to reduce the computational complexity by reducing the dimension of the effective data. Second, along the azimuth direction, a data-adaptive online processing structure is proposed to reduce the storage requirement for the angular superresolution problem. Finally, within the online processing structure, a target data-adaptive updating strategy is proposed to reduce the number of iterations for each target grid. The online DBR-based framework can effectively reduce the operational complexity caused by the noise values of the echo data. Based on the proposed online processing structure, the storage requirement and the operational complexity of the angular superresolution for an RAR system can be greatly reduced without significant reconstruction performance loss.

Such feature extractors are not always available due to lack of training data, especially for hyperspectral sensors and other hyperdimensional images. Moreover models trained on easily available multispectral (RGB/RGB-NIR) images cannot be reused on such hyperdimensional images due to their irregular number of bands. While hyperdimensional images show large number of spectral bands, they generally show much less spatial complexity, thus reducing the requirement of large receptive fields of convolution filters. Recent works in the computer vision have shown that even untrained deep models can yield remarkable result in some tasks like super-resolution and surface reconstruction. This motivates us to make a bold proposition that untrained lightweight deep model, initialized with some weight initialization strategy, can be used to extract useful semantic features from bi-temporal hyperdimensional images. Based on this proposition, we design a novel change detection framework for hyperdimensional images by extracting bitemporal features using an untrained model and further comparing the extracted features using deep change vector analysis to distinguish changed pixels from the unchanged ones. We further use the deep change hypervectors to cluster the changed pixels into different semantic groups. We conduct experiments on four change detection datasets: three hyperspectral datasets and a hyperdimensional polarimetric synthetic aperture radar dataset.

Theory and Methods: In the presented technique, low flip angle unbalanced SSFP imaging is used to acquire a series of images at a low nominal resolution that are then combined in a super-resolution strategy analogous to non-linear structured illumination microscopy. This is demonstrated in principle via Bloch simulations and synthetic phantoms, and the performance is quantified in terms of point-spread function (PSF) and SNR for gray and white matter from field strengths of 0.35T to 9.4T. A k-space reconstruction approach is proposed to account for B0 effects. This was applied to reconstruct super-resolution images from a test object at 9.4T. Results: Artifact-free super-resolution images were produced after incorporating sufficient preparation time for the magnetization to approach the steady state. High-resolution images of a test object were obtained at 9.4T, in the presence of considerable B0 inhomogeneity. For gray matter, the highest achievable resolution ranges from 3% of the acquired voxel dimension at 0.35T, to 9% at 9.4T. For white matter, this corresponds to 3% and 10%, respectively. Compared to an equivalent segmented gradient echo acquisition at the optimal flip angle, with a fixed TR of 8 ms, gray matter has up to 34% of the SNR at 9.4T while using a ×10 smaller flip angle. For white matter, this corresponds to 29% with a ×11 smaller flip angle. Conclusion: This approach achieves high degrees of super-resolution enhancement with minimal RF power requirements. © 2020 The Authors.

The real video images degraded by the factors, such as electronic noise, oversaturated pixels, motion blur, and compression artifacts, often result in poor motion registration estimation, which makes the performance of the existing video super-resolution (VSR) algorithms lower than expected. It is hard to estimate the SNR of the low-quality real frames without any prior knowledge. To solve this problem, we made a connection between SAR hyperparameters and the SNR of real images. The relationship expression of them was given in this paper. Using the proposed method, well-registered low-quality real video frames can be selected to decrease the root mean squared error (RMSE) of motion estimation of video frames for VSR reconstruction improvement. The anomalous low-quality frame images whose SAR hyperparameters values are inconsistent with others will be considered for removal. Synthetic experiments were designed to illustrate how the SAR hyperparameters values vary with the variation of synthetic parameters. In order to better illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, real low-quality videos captured under different conditions were tested under VSR reconstruction experiments. The VSR reconstruction results show that the results obtained using SAR prior analysis have sharper edges and fewer ringing artifacts than the original results. It indicates that the proposed method is helpful to obtain better results of motion registration estimation for low-quality real video images. © 2013 IEEE.","Bayesian networks; Image reconstruction; Mean square error; Motion estimation; Optical resolving power; Quality control; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Bayesian methods; Compression artifacts; motion registration; Root mean squared errors; Simultaneous autoregressive; Synthetic experiments; Synthetic parameters; Video super-resolution; Signal to noise ratio","Bayesian methods; motion registration; signal-to-noise ratio; Simultaneous autoregressive; video super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082565877"

The latter allows achieving super resolution, along with ambiguity levels reduction, thanks to the use of parametric focusing methods, as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and statistical regularization techniques, like the maximum-likelihood-inspired adaptive robust iterative approach (MARIA). Nevertheless, in order to correctly suit the considered signal model, MUSIC and most regularization approaches require an appropriate setting of the involved parameters. In both cases, the accuracy of the retrieved solutions depends on the right selection of the assigned values. Thus, with the aim of dealing with such an issue, this article addresses several parameter selection strategies, adapted specifically to the TomoSAR scenario. Parametric techniques as MUSIC solve the TomoSAR problem in a different manner as the regularization methods do, hence, each approach demands different methodologies for the proper estimation of their parameters. Consequently, we refer to the Kullback-Leibler information criterion for the model order selection of parametric techniques as MUSIC, whereas we rather explore the Morozov's discrepancy principle, the L-Curve, the Stein's unbiased risk estimate, and the generalized cross-validation to choose the regularization parameters. After the incorporation of these criteria to MUSIC and MARIA, respectively, their capabilities are first analyzed through simulations, and later on, utilizing real data acquired from an urban area.  © 2020 IEEE.","Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Iterative methods; Maximum likelihood estimation; Risk perception; Direction of arrival estimation; Generalized cross validation; Kullback-Leibler information; Multiple signal classification; Regularization methods; Regularization parameters; Regularization technique; Unbiased risk estimates; data inversion; data set; maximum likelihood analysis; parameter estimation; synthetic aperture radar; tomography; Inverse problems","Generalized cross-validation; information criteria; L-Curve; maximum likelihood (ML); model order selection (MOS); synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and tomography (TomoSAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097926803"

Yet to enable super-resolution techniques like Super Spatially Variant Apodization (SSVA), precise knowledge of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging parameters is required. Such parameters include the pixel, ground range and azimuth resolution which may be missing or tedious to parse. Moreover, these parameters are dependent on terrain relief and the effective target beam-width which may be absent in practical scenarios involving real targets. The inability to calculate sampling parameters would degrade side-lobe levels and image quality in super-resolution processing. To tackle this, we design a novel deep learning network that leverages a bi-linear sampling layer and a total variation loss that is able to directly estimate the required sampling factor without supervision. Our network is able to learn and carry out optimal side-lobe cancellation with no prior knowledge of the system or target imaging parameters. In doing so, we make it possible to carry out super-resolution on SAR images with no a-prior expert knowledge and outperform traditional algorithms in presence of imperfect expert knowledge.

But the availability or appropriateness of the sparse representation of the target scene and the relatively low computational efficiency of image reconstruction algorithms limit the performance and application of the CS based ISAR imaging methods. Recently, the deep neural network (DNN) based under-sampled or incomplete signal reconstruction method achieve remarkable performance. DNN can extract the abstract feature representation from input data with the hidden layers and nonlinear activation layer. However, the existing DNNs are real domain models, and cannot be directly used in complex data processing. A complex value DNN (CV-DNN) with multistage decomposition ability is constructed by cascading different types of complex value network layers. Then, the CV-DNN is used for ISAR imaging. The CV-DNN architecture can extract and exploit the sparse feature of the target image extremely well by multi-layer nonlinear processing. The experimental results show that the proposed CV-DNN based ISAR imaging method can provide better shape reconstruction of target than state-of-the-art CS reconstruction algorithms and improve the imaging efficiency obviously. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of NUAA.

Naturally, we name the proposed technique as the ""coprime TomoSAR"". The coprime acquisition mode requires fewer acquisitions than the uniform one for obtaining the same baseline aperture. To further improve tomographic resolution and to reject ambiguity problem induced by sparsely sampling of the coprime acquisition mode, we perform the tomographic reconstruction using the root-multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC) algorithm. More important is that the Root-MUSIC algorithm can exploit the difference co-baseline in the tomographic reconstruction process. The exploition of the difference co-baseline ensures that the coprime TomoSAR provides comparable tomographic performance to the uniform TomoSAR when the two TomoSAR have the same baseline aperture length.

In the real imaging system, however, the gridding error should be considered because the biased scatterers lead to the mismatch of the measurement matrix and affect the imaging performance. The 1-D mismatch in cross-track direction has been solved by atomic norm minimization and off-grid sparse Bayesian inference. With the development of the super-resolution methods, the 2-D super-resolution in both azimuth and cross-track direction is realized by the 2-D compressed sensing (CS) algorithms. To solve the 2-D mismatch problem, a novel 2-D mismatch compensation method for DLLA 3-D SAR is proposed. Instead of converting the 2-D matrix signals to the 1-D vectors, the proposed method directly processes the 2-D mismatch with 2-D joint model. Furthermore, the 2-D joint model with 2-D mismatch is simplified as a normal sparse linear model, which is suitable for most of the CS reconstruction algorithms. It can not only provide better reconstruction performance but also reduce the memory cost and computation load. Finally, the simulation experiments are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.  © 2020 IEEE.","Bayesian networks; Compressed sensing; Inference engines; Matrix algebra; Optical resolving power; Synthetic aperture radar; Computation loads; Imaging performance; Measurement matrix; Mismatch compensation; Mismatch problems; Reconstruction algorithms; Super resolution; Superresolution methods; algorithm; imaging method; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Array synthetic aperture radar (SAR); compressed sensing (CS); measurement matrix mismatch; super-resolution; three-dimensional (3-D) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097940771"

First, the imaging characteristics of multi-angle spotlight SAR are analyzed in the super-resolution imaging process. Second, the azimuth spectrum offset between echo signals at different angles is obtained.

Traditional TomoSAR requires a large number of observation orbits however, it is hard to meet the requirement of massive orbits. While on the one hand, this is due to funding constraints, on the other hand, because the target scene is changing over time and each observation orbit consumes lots of time, the number of orbits can be fewer as required within a narrow time window. When the number of observation orbits is insufficient, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSR), and resolution of 3D reconstruction results will decline severely, which seriously limits the practical application of TomoSAR. In order to solve this problem, we propose to use a deep learning network to improve the resolution and SNR of 3D reconstruction results under the condition of very few observation orbits by learning the prior distribution of targets. We use all available orbits to reconstruct a high resolution target, while only very few (around 3) orbits to reconstruct a low resolution input. The low-res and high-res 3D voxel-grid pairs are used to train a 3D super-resolution (SR) CNN (convolutional neural network) model, just like ordinary 2D image SR tasks. Experiments on the Civilian Vehicle Radar dataset show that the proposed deep learning algorithm can effectively improve the reconstruction both in quality and in quantity. In addition, the model also shows good generalization performance for targets not shown in the training set. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the covariance matrix matching criterion, the backscatter power of forests signal and noise will be jointly solved adaptively. Through a few iterations, the exact positions of the closely spaced phase centers can be obtained to simplify the characterization of the vertical structure of the forests.

According to the difference between the jamming spectrum and the real echo spectrum, a method for suppressing the mismatch jamming of SAR FM slope based on matched filtering in the frequency domain is proposed. Based on the accurate measurement of the slope of jamming FM, the sparse super-resolution estimation of the jamming position is carried out to obtain a more accurate phase of jamming delay by utilizing the sparsity of the jamming signal and the characteristics of low Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR). Then, the spectrum of the interference signal is reconstructed by the obtained slope of interference frequency modulation and phase delay. Based on this, the orthogonal matched filter is designed to suppress the interference signal in the frequency domain and reconstruct the undistorted scene image. Finally, computer simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Frequency domain analysis; Frequency modulation; Jamming; Matched filters; Signal interference; Accurate measurement; Computer simulation experiment; Frequency domains; Interference frequency; Interference signal; Orthogonal matched filters; Signal-to-interference ratio; Super resolution estimation; Synthetic aperture radar","Anti-jamming; FM slope mismatch jamming; Orthogonal matched filtering; Sparse","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091439720"

Due to the sparsity of the elevation signal, compressive sensing (CS) methods have been introduced for tomographic reconstruction. However, the limited irregular acquisitions and the dense sampling grids of the elevation cannot guarantee the sufficiently sparse reconstruction in the presence of noise. By constructing a complete set of atoms, the gridless sparse methods can directly recover the sparse signals in the continuous frequency space. In this article, we propose the atomic-norm minimization or the gridless CS approach for tomographic SAR inversion and compare it with the L1-norm-based optimization.

There may be insufficient pulses or may introduce migration through range cells (MTRC) during the coherent processing interval (CPI) when we use the conventional range Doppler (RD) ISAR technique. With compressed sensing (CS) technique, we can achieve the high-resolution ISAR imaging of a target with limited number of pulses. Sparse representation based method can achieve the super resolution ISAR imaging of a target with a short CPI, during which the target rotates only a small angle and the range migration of the scatterers is small. However, traditional CS-based ISAR imaging method generally faced with the problem of basis mismatch, which may degrade the ISAR image. To achieve the high resolution ISAR imaging of fast rotating targets, this paper proposed a pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning method for multiple measurement vectors, i.e. the PC-MSBL algorithm. A multi-channel pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior is proposed to model the pattern dependencies among neighboring range cells and correct the MTRC problem. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to infer the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the hyperparameters.

In this technique, the number of scatterers is sequentially decided by the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) pixel by pixel, after iteratively estimating the parameters. It is a good tradeoff of the aforeproposed methods of sup-GLRT and fast-sup-GLRT on accuracy and efficiency. Simulated comparisons showed that iterative-SGLRT outperformed fast-sup-GLRT on the performances of detection probability and accuracy without substantial computation time increase, and compared with sup-GLRT, its performance loss could be negligible with computational burden greatly reduced. In addition, both iterative-SGLRT and sup-GLRT have been applied to the TerraSAR-X data set over Shenzhen city. The 3-D reconstruction of the test site and the separation of the overlaid scatterers have been achieved. In addition, verification using light detection and radar (LiDAR) indicated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of $ {0.1\rho _{s}}$ for both methods of the height estimated.

First, by analyzing the independent relationship between beam scanning and radar signal propagation, the radar echo signal is decomposed into two-dimensional convolution relationship along the distance direction and the azimuth direction. Then, according to the low-resolution characteristics of the scanning radar and the distribution of target position, the scene and the echo signal are mapped into a unified coordinate system.

However, annual 25 m spatial resolution forest maps during 2011–2014 are missing because of the gap in operation between ALOS and ALOS-2, preventing the construction of a continuous, fine resolution time-series dataset on the world's forests. In contrast, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images were available globally since 2000. This research developed a novel method to produce annual 25 m forest maps during 2007–2016 by fusing the fine spatial resolution, but asynchronous PALSAR/PALSAR-2 with coarse spatial resolution, but synchronous MODIS NDVI data, thus, filling the four-year gap in the ALOS and ALOS-2 time-series, as well as enhancing the existing mapping activity. The method was developed concentrating on two key objectives: 1) producing more accurate 25 m forest maps by integrating PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data during 2007–2010 and 2015–2016; 2) reconstructing annual 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images during 2011–2014. Specifically, a decision tree classification was developed for forest mapping based on both the PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data, and a new spatial-temporal super-resolution mapping was proposed to reconstruct the 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images. Three study sites including Paraguay, the USA and Russia were chosen, as they represent the world's three main forest types: tropical forest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and boreal conifer forest, respectively. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach produced the most accurate continuous time-series of fine spatial resolution forest maps both visually and quantitatively. For the forest maps during 2007–2010 and 2015–2016, the results had greater overall accuracy values (>98%) than those of the original JAXA forest product. For the reconstructed 25 m forest maps during 2011–2014, the increases in classifications accuracy relative to three benchmark methods were statistically significant, and the overall accuracy values of the three study sites were almost universally >92%. The proposed approach, therefore, has great potential to support the production of annual 25 m forest maps by fusing PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI during 2007–2016. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Paraguay; Russian Federation; United States; Coniferophyta; Continuous time systems; Decision trees; Forestry; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Optical resolving power; Radiometers; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Down-scaling; Forest mapping; Modis ndvi; Spatial temporals; Super-resolution mappings; ALOS; coniferous forest; downscaling; forest cover; MODIS; NDVI; PALSAR; polarization; spatial resolution; vegetation mapping; Mapping","ALOS PALSAR; ALOS-2 PALSAR-2; Downscaling; Forest mapping; MODIS NDVI; Spatial-temporal; Super-resolution mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061162266"

An Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) super-resolution imaging method based on Bayesian Statistical Machine Learning is proposed. The sparse prior characteristics of UAV with respect to the air-background is utilized by introducing a heavy-tailed Laplacian prior probability distribution, and a Bayesian posterior inference model is derived based on the Gaussian distribution assumption of observation system noise. In view of the non-conjugation of prior distribution, a hierarchical Bayesian model is introduced. Finally, the variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm is applied, and the posterior probability density function of the target is solved analytically. Meanwhile, the imaging defocus caused by the non-systematic translational error of the target is corrected, cooperatively. Compared with traditional methods, this method can effectively solve the problem of low imaging signal-to-noise ratio caused by the small RCS of UAV target and low imaging resolution caused by the short coherent accumulation time. The experimental results of simulation and radar data prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","Aircraft detection; Bayesian networks; Image segmentation; Inverse problems; Maximum principle; Probability density function; Probability distributions; Radar cross section; Radar imaging; Signal to noise ratio; Tracking radar; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Hierarchical Bayesian modeling; Inverse synthetic aperture radars (ISAR); Observation systems; Posterior probability; Sparse Bayesian learning; Statistical machine learning; Super resolution imaging; Variational bayesian; Inverse synthetic aperture radar","Bayesian Learning; compressed sensing; inverse synthetic aperture radar; machine learning; unmanned aerial vehicle","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083484895"

In this paper, since the V style modulation(V-FM) signal can mitigate the ambiguity apparent in range and velocity, the dual-channel, two-dimension, compressed-sensing (2D-CS) algorithm is proposed for Bistatic ISAR (Bi-ISAR) imaging, which directly deals with the 2D signal model for image reconstruction based on solving a nonconvex optimization problem. The coupled 2D super-resolution model of the target’s echoes is firstly established; then, the 2D-SL0 algorithm is applied in each channel with different dictionaries, and the final image is obtained by synthesizing the two channels. Experiments are used to test the robustness of the Bi-ISAR imaging framework with the two-dimensional CS method. The results show that the framework is capable accurately reconstructing the Bi-ISAR image within the conditions of low SNR and low measured data. © 2018 by the authors.

The multi-dimensional extension (along the time) also enables the monitoring of possible scatterer displacements. A key aspect of TomoSAR is the identification, in the presence of noise, of multiple persistent scatterers interfering within the same 2-D (azimuth range plane) pixel. To this aim, the use of multi-look has been shown to provide tangible improvements in the detection of single and double interfering persistent scatterers at the expense of a minor spatial resolution loss. Depending on the system acquisition characteristics, this operation may require also the detection of multiple scatterers interfering at distances lower than the Rayleigh resolution (super-resolution). In this work we further investigated the use of multi-look in TomoSAR for the detection of multiple scatterers located also below the Rayleigh resolution. A solution relying on the Capon filtering was first analyzed, due to its improved capabilities in the separation of the responses of multiple scatterers and sidelobe suppression. Moreover, in the framework of the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), the single-look support based detection strategy recently proposed in the literature was extended to the multi-look case.

As fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices become increasingly affordable and available, high-resolution SAR imaging is feasible for end-user applications and non-laboratory environments. Emerging applications, such as freehand imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging, and automotive SAR, face several unique challenges for high-resolution imaging. First, recovering a SAR image requires knowledge of the array positions throughout the scan. While recent work has introduced camera-based positioning systems capable of adequately estimating the position, recovering the algorithm efficiently is a requirement to enable edge and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Efficient algorithms for near-field SAR have been developed; however, they suffer from image defocusing under position estimation error and can only produce medium-fidelity images. In this paper, we introduce a mobile-friend vision transformer (ViT) architecture to perform SAR image super-resolution and artifact mitigation under array position errors. The proposed algorithm, Mobile-SRViT, is the first to employ a ViT approach for SAR image enhancement and is validated through simulation and empirical studies.  © 2022 IEEE.","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Drones; Image enhancement; Internet of things; Millimeter waves; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; 5g; Array perturbation; Drone millimeter-wave imaging; Millimeter-wave imaging; Millimetre-wave imaging; Near fields; Synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar images; Synthetic aperture radar","5G; array perturbation; drone mmWave imaging; mmWave imaging; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138470045"

The lower resolution limits the application, so it is necessary to use super-resolution technology to improve the spatial resolution. In this paper, in response to the low spatial resolution of PolSAR images, a PolSAR super-resolution framework is proposed to improve the spatial resolution by the use of a residual convolutional neural network. Within this framework, deconvolution is used to up-sample the PolSAR images, PReLU is added to maintain the numerical properties. A complex structure block is also designed to accommodate the PolSAR data structure. In addition, prior information on the low-resolution image itself is used to reduce the artifacts. The proposed method shows a superior performance when compared to the traditional methods in both the quantitative evaluation and visual assessment. The proposed method improved the spatial resolution significantly, especially in terms of detail information retention, and it improves the mean PSNR by more than 12% when compared to the traditional methods.

In general, the elevation resolution is proportional to the length of the elevation aperture. However, as the elevation aperture increases, the geometric consistency of the image will undesirably deteriorate and hence fails the image coregistration approach required by the traditional super-resolution tomographic imaging. In this paper, a new super-resolution tomographic imaging method is proposed to overcome the inconsistency problem caused by the large elevation aperture. The core strategy is to get rid of two-dimensional image coregistration by applying a three-dimensional (3D) back projection like imaging manner: the 3D space is firstly divided into a 3D imaging grid, each of which is individually imaged via compressive sensing for super-resolution.

This paper proposes a fast, super-resolution imaging method employing continuous compressive sensing for sparse-aperture ISAR. First, the received echo in each range bin is characterised as a linear combination of multiple frequencies shown in a continuous atomic set, established into an atomic norm minimisation (ANM) mode. Second, to improve the resolution and reduce the computational burden significantly, a locally convergent iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which iteratively performs ANM with a sound reweighting strategy, is implemented. Then, the low-rank Toeplitz covariance matrix, which contains the information of the target, is obtained. Subsequently, the Vandermonde decomposition of the Toeplitz covariance matrix is performed to acquire the locations and intensities of the scattering points. Finally, the super-resolution result is generated by depicting the estimated scatterers in the image. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposal is highly effective in recovering the super-resolution image and shows better performance than state-of-the-art methods. © 2021 The Authors.

Recent research extends convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures from the optical to the electromagnetic domain to achieve super resolution on images generated from radar signaling. Specifically, near-field synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, a method for generating high-resolution images by scanning a radar across space to create a synthetic aperture, is of interest due to its high-fidelity spatial sensing capability, low cost devices, and large application space. Since SAR imaging requires large aperture sizes to achieve high resolution, super-resolution algorithms are valuable for many applications. Freehand smartphone SAR, an emerging sensing modality, requires irregular SAR apertures in the near-field and computation on mobile devices. Achieving efficient high-resolution SAR images from irregularly sampled data collected by freehand motion of a smartphone is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture to achieve SAR image super-resolution for mobile applications by employing state-of-the-art SAR processing and deep learning techniques. The proposed algorithm is verified via simulation and an empirical study.

To overcome the sparse aperture problem of a photonics-based ISAR, azimuth super-resolution imaging is demonstrated in this paper, in which the sparse representation method is applied to implement sparse azimuth data extrapolation or fusion. In the experiment, the photonics-based radar has a bandwidth of 8 GHz, and ISAR echoes from a full observation aperture are selected to imitate the short-aperture detection and sparse aperture detection, respectively.

However, the current sparse-TSVD method encounters large computation cost, resulting in a slow algorithm speed. In this work, a fast sparse-TSVD super-resolution imaging method of real aperture radar is proposed. First, the proposed method is based on the results of TSVD, using the truncated unitary matrix and diagonal matrix to reconstruct the signal convolution model. The dimension of the reconstructed antenna measurement matrix reduces from $N \times N$ to $k \times N$ , and the dimension of the reconstructed echo matrix reduces from $N \times 1$ to $k \times 1$ , where $N$ is azimuth sampling points and $k$ is truncation parameter, $N \gg k$. Much of the expensive matrix- multiplication computation can then be performed on the smaller matrices, thereby accelerating the algorithm. Second, an objective function is established as the ${l_{1}}$ constraint based on the regularization strategy. Lastly, this article employs iterative reweighted least square (IRLS) method to solve the objective function, and the dimension of the reversed matrix is lessened from $N \times N$ to $k \times k$ , speeding up the algorithm further. The simulation and real data verify that the proposed algorithm not only improves the azimuth resolution in low SNR condition but also increases computational efficiency compared with the sparse-TSVD method.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Computational efficiency; Iterative methods; Least squares approximations; Optical resolving power; Radar; Radar antennas; Radar imaging; Singular value decomposition; Iterative reweighted least square; Low signal-to-noise ratio; MAtrix multiplication; Regularization strategies; Super resolution imaging; Superresolution methods; Truncated singular value decomposition; Truncation parameter; image resolution; imaging method; numerical model; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; Signal to noise ratio","Real aperture radar (RAR); sparse-truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD); super-resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103363033"

We mainly focus on the ISAR imaging of a fast rotating target. In that case, the samples in the cross-range dimension are insufficient, which is the undersampling case. Compressed sensing-based ISAR imaging methods are generally faced with the problem of basis mismatch, which may degrade the ISAR image.

Most of existing image data compression frameworks are lossy or designed for spectral images. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless compression encoding framework for SAR remote sensing images. In the proposed framework, an outline of the image and the high-frequency components are separated and processed separately to increase the relativity of adjacent pixels. So the accuracy of prediction is improved, which makes the data compression more effective. The outline image is down-sampled to reduce data size, and the nonlocally centralized sparse representation-based super-resolution method is used to predict pixel values using the information in nonlocal similar regions. The proposed framework is evaluated with the ground range detected and PauliRGB images captured by SAR satellites.

More recently, the concept of forming inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images while the antenna is scanning, called circular scan ISAR in this paper, has drawn attention. Circular scan ISAR enables a large coverage area, sequential imaging of multiple targets, and the formation of an image sequence of a target. However, the rapid antenna scanning results in a short accumulation time of the target and reduces the Doppler resolution of the system. This paper analyzes the limit values of the Doppler resolution improvement ratio when super-resolution imaging is performed using only the compressed sensing method by relating the limit values to the restricted isometry constant (RIC) value of the sensing matrices. The limit values are found to be relatively small when the sparsity degree of the sparse signal is relatively large. Therefore, the super-resolution imaging of ships for circular scan ISAR is carried out by extrapolating data in the azimuth direction first and then reconstructing the data via compressed sensing to obtain low side-lobe levels. Finally, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detection is performed on the matrix composed of calculated sparse coefficients to improve the signal-to-clutter noise ratio (SCNR). The simulation and real-data processing results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the presented algorithm. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Antenna lobes; Compressed sensing; Data handling; Extrapolation; Image resolution; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Matrix algebra; Object detection; Optical resolving power; Scanning; Scanning antennas; Ships; Circular scan ISAR mode; Data extrapolation; ISAR Imaging; Ship imaging; Super resolution imaging; Radar imaging","Circular scan ISAR mode; compressed sensing; data extrapolation; ISAR imaging; ship imaging; super-resolution imaging","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069779387"

First, an external example learning-based super-resolution method is applied on the original images to generate higher resolution versions. Then, an optical flow approach is applied on the higher resolution images, identifying sparse correspondences and interpolating them to extract a dense motion vector field with continuous values and subpixel accuracies. Our proposed approach is successfully evaluated on passive microwave, optical, and Synthetic Aperture Radar data, proving appropriate for multi-sensor applications and different spatial resolutions. The approach estimates motion with similar or higher accuracy than the original data, while increasing the spatial resolution of up to eight times. In addition, the adopted optical flow component outperforms a state-of-the-art pattern matching method. Overall, the proposed approach results in accurate motion vectors with unprecedented spatial resolutions of up to 1.5 km for passive microwave data covering the entire Arctic and 20 m for radar data, and proves promising for numerous scientific and operational applications. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Along this line, undeniable improvements in SAR tomography (TomoSAR) detection framework of multiple permanent scatterers (PSs) have been observed by the use of a multi-looking operation that is the necessity for data’s covariance matrix estimation. This paper attempts to further analyze the impact of a robust multi-looking operation in TomoSAR PS detection framework and assess the challenging issues that exist in the estimation of the covariance matrix of large stack data obtained from long interferometric time series acquisition. The analyses evaluate the performance of non-local covariance matrix estimation approaches in PS detection framework using the super-resolution multi-looked Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT). Experimental results of multi-looking impact assessment are provided using two datasets acquired by COSMO-SkyMED (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) over Tehran, Iran, and Toulouse, France, respectively.

Therefore, as an important acoustic sensor, the sonar has been widely used in underwater topographical surveying, underwater search and rescue, ship navigation, etc. The sonar image also faces challenge of low-resolution due to its imaging mechanism, like ultrasonic image and synthetic aperture radar image. In this paper, we propose a deeper super-resolution generative adversarial network (DGP-SRGAN) with gradient penalty. It can be used to produce the sonar image with high-resolution. The main contribution of our method is that the gradient penalty is added to the loss function for a more stable and faster training network. The deep of the generator network is doubled from the original 16 layers to 32 layers to make the network more expressive, achieving its better performance. The loss function of the discriminator network increases the gradient penalty term. It can insure a faster network converge and then reach a stable state in less time. Thus the proposed network model achieves a better super-resolution reconstruction effect. The experimental results show that DGP-SRGAN can control the output of super-resolution images well based on input conditions.

One implementation of super-resolution SAR is that radar works in the spotlight mode. In the case with highly squinted angle and acceleration, the azimuth space variance and the coupling between range and azimuth will become serious in super-resolution imaging. Thus, an azimuth frequency nonlinear chirp scaling algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Based on the acceleration model, the accurate 2-D spectrum is performed by adopting the method of series reversion. The space-variance of missile-borne SAR in curved flight path is analyzed and an azimuth polynomial phase filter is constructed to make the coefficients of the perturbation function has sufficient flexibility to eliminate the spatial-variant couple terms between range and azimuth. In addition, the gradient operation is used to expand the space-variant coefficients of azimuth modulation term, and the perturbation function is applied to eliminate the space-variant in azimuth direction. The proposed focusing method can process the missile-borne SAR data obtained in spotlight mode in highly squinted angle with high efficiency. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed imaging approach.

It overcomes disadvantages of traditional side or squint synthetic aperture radar (SAR) which is dependent on specific relative motion between the radar and target scene. A new microwave forward-looking correlated 3-D imaging method based on random radiation field combined with sparse reconstruction is proposed in this article. Firstly, phased array radar (PAR) is adopted to form different and random antenna patterns. Then, combined with the compressed sensing (CS) theory, the target image can be recovered with very few samples which can break through Rayleigh resolution limitation. Furthermore, the proposed method can achieve resolution at least 5.5 times higher than real aperture imaging. To raise computation efficiency of sparse reconstruction, an improved quasi-Newton iteration method based on graphics processing unit (GPU) platform is developed. Meanwhile, a GPU-based (NVIDIA Tesla K40c) accelerated computing method can significantly reduce the processing time compared with the time given by a personal computer (PC).

Then, in the second step, by searching in the reduced search space, which is finely gridded, the accurate location of the targets is found. For estimating the actual number of targets, a model order selection scheme is used in two cases of known and unknown noise variance. Also, by analytical investigation of the probability of detection for the proposed method, the effect of the influential parameters on the detection ability is explicitly demonstrated.

Due to the inherent resolution limitations and the cost incurred for further development of sensor devices, image enhancements through image processing techniques have become more popular. However, in these techniques, the soft edges present in the images are not reconstructed completely, thereby marring the clarity of the generated image. This paper presents a method to restore more details in the image by adaptively adjusting the measurement noise covariance and process noise covariance into the intensity estimation framework for SAR image super-resolution. For this, an Adaptive Importance Sampling Unscented Kalman Filter (ISUKF) framework is implemented using the covariance matching technique.

To solve these problems, a super-resolution forward-looking imaging method for manoeuvering platforms is proposed. First, the range walk caused by forward-looking geometry and higher-order phase introduced by three-dimensional acceleration are eliminated by compensating a pre-processing function. Subsequently, according to beam steering-based geometry and linear regression model, the over-complete dictionary matrix is optimised to more accurately describe the complicated forward-looking geometry with curved trajectory.

However, the spectrum of FFT has high sidelobes and wide main lobes and the resolution of RD is limited by the radar parameters so that the RD method cannot generate super-resolution images especially with sparse aperture (SA) data. A super-resolution SA inverse synthetic aperture radar (SA-ISAR) imaging algorithm via the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) technique is proposed in this paper. The proposal uses the MUSIC algorithm to estimate the location and employs the least-squares technique to calculate the intensity of each scatterer.

The resolution of the proposal depends less on the radar parameters, and it can be further improved by using a smaller search step.

However, they face three challenges. First, this kind of method is mainly based on the point scattering model and not suitable for characterizing the line-segment-scattering and surface-scattering features of distributed targets. Second, the hyperparameters in these methods are hard to tune to optimal values. Third, due to a large amount of calculation, these methods are difficult to apply in practice. In this article, to solve these problems, we introduce the line-segment-scatterers (LSSs) and rectangular-plate-scatterers (RPSs) in SAR echo model to develop the SAR hybrid echo model and propose two SAR parametric SR image reconstruction methods based on solving a CS problem, where three penalties are utilized to exploit the sparsity of the point scatterers, LSSs, and RPSs, respectively. At the core of the first method is a direct solver called multicomponent alternating direction method of multipliers (MC-ADMM) solver that solves the CS problem quickly and iteratively based on closed derivative expressions. In contrast, the second method maps the MC-ADMM solver into a deep unfolded neural network, i.e., the parametric SR imaging network (PSRI-Net), which is faster, and the parameters can be automatically set to the optimum. Since all the parameters of the MC-ADMM solver are learned discriminatively through end-to-end training in PSRI-Net. Extensive simulation and practical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; Deep neural networks; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Surface scattering; Synthetic aperture radar; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Compressive sensing; Distributed target; Extensive simulations; Image reconstruction methods; Rectangular plates; Super resolution; Super-resolution image reconstruction; artificial neural network; parameterization; reconstruction; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Deep neural network (DNN); line-segment-scatterer (LSS); multicomponent alternating direction method of multipliers (MC-ADMM); parametric super-resolution (SR) imaging network (PSRI-Net); rectangular-plate-scatterer (RPS); SR image reconstruction; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100454678"

Because the spatial resolution of the target response in the satellite SAR image is a main factor that has a large effect on target analysis performances, the improvement of the spatial resolution of target response is required to enhance the target analysis capability. However, the spatial resolution is already determined in the satellite SAR system design process. To solve the above problem, the super-resolution techniques that have been applied to radar images can be utilized. However, the application of the super-resolution techniques to the target response in the satellite SAR image is not simple due to the following reasons. First, the target’s motion induces severe blurring of the target response, which impedes the successful improvement of spatial resolution. Next, the zero-region in the frequency spectrum of the target image containing the target response also hinders the generation of the super-resolved image. To successfully improve spatial resolution of the satellite SAR image, the super-resolution techniques should be combined with proper preprocessing steps that can cope with the above two issues. In this paper, the whole super-resolution procedure for target responses in KOMPSAT-5 images is described. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the description of the whole super-resolution procedure for target responses is the first ever attempt in the area of satellite SAR. First, a target image containing the target response is extracted from a large-scale KOMPSAT-5 image. Subsequently, the target image is transformed to be appropriate for the utilization of super-resolution techniques by proper preprocessing steps, considering the direction of super resolution and the motion of the target. Then, some super-resolution techniques are utilized to improve the spatial resolutions and qualities of the target images. The super-resolution performances of the proposed scheme are validated using various target images for point static, extended static, and extended moving targets. The novelties of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) the practical design of whole super-resolution processing for real satellite SAR images; (2) the performance evaluation of super-resolution techniques on real satellite SAR images. The results show that the proposed scheme can led to noticeable improvements of spatial resolution of the target images for various types of targets with reliable computation times. In addition, the proposed scheme also enhanced PSLR, ISLR, and IC, leading to clearer scattering information of the principal scatterers. Consequently, the proposed method can assist in extracting more precise and meaningful information for targets represented in KOMPSAT-5 images, which means great potential for target recognition. © 2022 by the authors.","Motion; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Radar imaging; Radar target recognition; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; KOMPSAT-5; Resolution techniques; SAR Images; SAR remote sensing; Satellite SAR; Spatial resolution; Superresolution; Target analysis; Target images; Target response; motion; Synthetic aperture radar","KOMPSAT-5; SAR remote sensing; satellite SAR; super-resolution; target response","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139811315"

Beyond safety, tire wear affects performance and is an important metric that decides tire replacement, one of the biggest maintenance expense of the global trucking industry. We believe that it is important to measure and monitor tire wear in all automobiles. Current approach to measure tire wear is manual and extremely tedious. Embedding sensor electronics in tires to measure tire wear is challenging, given the inhospitable temperature, pressure and dynamics of the tire. Further, off-tire sensors placed in the well such as laser range-finders are vulnerable to road debris that may settle in tire grooves. This paper presents Osprey, the first on-automobile, mmWave sensing system that can measure accurate tire wear continuously and is robust to road debris. Osprey's key innovation is to leverage existing, high volume, automobile mmWave RADAR, place it in the tire well of automobiles and observe reflections of the RADAR's signal from the tire surface and grooves to measure tire wear, even in the presence of debris. We achieve this through a super-resolution Inverse Synthetic Aperture RADAR algorithm that exploits the natural rotation of the tire and improves range resolution to sub-mm. We show how our system can eliminate debris by attaching specialized metallic structures in the grooves that behave as spatial codes and offer a unique signature, when coupled with the rotation of the tire. In addition to tire wear sensing, we demonstrate the ability to detect and locate unsafe, metallic foreign objects such as nails lodged in the tire. We evaluate Osprey on commercial tires mounted on mechanical, tire-rotation rig and passenger car. We test Osprey at different speeds, in the presence of different types of debris, different levels of debris, on different terrains, and different levels of automobile vibration. We achieve a median absolute tire wear error of 0.68 mm across all our experiments. Osprey also locates foreign objects lodged in the tire with an error of 1.7 cm and detects metallic foreign objects with an accuracy of 92%.  © 2020 ACM.","Accident prevention; Accidents; Automobiles; Debris; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Millimeter waves; Object detection; Range finders; Roads and streets; Trucks; Wear of materials; Different terrains; Laser range finders; Maintenance expense; Metallic structures; Range resolution; Sensor electronics; Super resolution; Trucking industry; Tires","77 GHz; Automotive; Debris; FMCW; Foreign object; Free of electronics; Inverse synthetic aperture RADAR imaging; Millimeter wave; Orthogonal codes; RADAR; Spatial coding; Super resolution; Tire wear; Tread depth; Wireless sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088114507"

This technique is devoted to reducing the required number of acquisitions in the practical application where the number of flight passes is usually restricted due to cost consideration and temporal decoherence. This letter extends the tomographic reconstruction of the coprime TomoSAR to the atomic norm minimization (ANM) framework to pursue super-resolution. A compact ANM approach is proposed in this letter for the tomographic reconstruction of coprime TomoSAR in the presence of multiple looks data. Compared with the conventional ANM approach, the proposed approach compresses the dimension of the ANM model to a smaller size by two operations. One operation is that the equivalent covariance matrix is constructed to be conformed with the covariance matrix of the real acquisition data. The other operation is adopting the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique to reduce the look dimension of acquisition data. As a result, the compact approach reduces the computation complexity without performance loss. It is confirmed by simulation experiments.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Atoms; Covariance matrix; Image reconstruction; Synthetic aperture radar; Tomography; Atomic norm minimization; Coprime; Coprime array; Covariance matrices; Efficient reconstruction; Minimisation; Singular value decomposition; Tomographic reconstruction; Tomographic synthetic aperture radar; Tomographic synthetic aperture radars; algorithm; image analysis; reconstruction; satellite imagery; synthetic aperture radar; Singular value decomposition","Atomic norm minimization (ANM); coprime array; singular value decomposition (SVD); tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123382918"

They are computationally expensive since they cannot be solved analytically. An emerging technique known as deep unrolling provided a good combination of the descriptive ability of neural networks, explainable, and computational efficiency for BPDN. Many unrolled neural networks for BPDN, e.g., learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and its variants, employ shrinkage functions to prune elements with small magnitude. Through experiments on synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR), we discover the shrinkage step leads to unavoidable information loss in the dynamics of networks and degrades the performance of the model. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with novel sparse minimal gated units (SMGUs) to solve the information loss issue. The proposed RNN architecture with SMGUs benefits from incorporating historical information into optimization and, thus, effectively preserves full information in the final output. Taking TomoSAR inversion as an example, extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm in terms of super-resolution power and generalization ability. It achieved 10%-20% higher double-scatterer detection rate and is less sensitive to phase and amplitude ratio difference between scatterers.

However, due to the interference of speckle noise, the texture details of the SAR images become relatively blurred. The fine texture details can be reconstructed by increasing the resolution of the SAR images. Generative adversarial networks achieve high performance in image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction, but the existing generative adversarial networks only pay attention to the discrimination of HR images without that of the low-resolution (LR) images. If the reconstructed HR image is sufficiently realistic, the LR image obtained from downsampled super-resolved images should also be the same as the original LR image. To take advantage of the LR image, an SAR image SR reconstruction algorithm based on cross-resolution discrimination (CRD) using teacher-student network is proposed. First, the teacher discriminator network (TD-Net) discriminates the HR images, which enriches the reconstructed HR images with more high-frequency texture details. Second, the student discriminator network (SD-Net) discriminates the LR images, which enables the reconstructed HR images to be accurately downsampled to the original LR image. Finally, the TD-Net guides the training of the SD-Net by transmitting distillation knowledge to the SD-Net, which further improves the discriminative performance of the SD-Net. Experiments on the SAR image dataset demonstrate that the performance of the proposed CRD algorithm is better than other algorithms when both the objective evaluations and subjective effects are considered. © 2021 SPIE and IS&T.","Distillation; Image reconstruction; Military applications; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Textures; Cross-resolution discrimination; High resolution synthetic aperture radar images; High-resolution images; Image super-resolution reconstruction; Knowledge distillation; Low resolution images; Performance; Superresolution; Synthetic aperture radar images; Teachers'; Generative adversarial networks","cross-resolution discrimination; generative adversarial network; knowledge distillation; super-resolution; synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118798396"

The most important focusing part of such an objective is a combination of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a spherical annular reflector (SAR). In the considered version, the proposed objective has the numerical aperture of NA = 0.95, the working distance of 1 mm and the size of a sub-wavelength focused spot of 105 nm (FWHM). However, such performance was found to require a high quality of optical components, as well as severe mechanical tolerances and a high precision of their alignment. The problem of a precision alignment of the optical components is additionally complicated by the fact that the wavelength of 266 nm is not visible and it is therefore not possible to use conventional alignment methods. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use an auxiliary brightening laser with a visible doubled wavelength equal to 532 nm. A dichroic mirror is used to combine the visible and invisible laser beams. In order to apply the proposed method, it is required to optimize the diffraction structure of the DOE for the simultaneous operation in the second order of diffraction at 266 nm and in the first order at 532 nm. An example of the optimized binary-phase structure of a two-wavelength DOE is given alongside with the optical response of this structure at the visible and invisible wavelengths. Also presented are the results of a computer simulation of the main aberrations of the focusing system under the displacement of its components. It is shown that the required accuracy of assembly can be achieved by the use of only a few of alignment methods at the visible wavelength. © 2018 SPIE.","Alignment; Diffraction; Diffractive optical elements; Laser beams; Laser mirrors; Optical design; Optical systems; Phase structure; Synthetic aperture radar; Diffraction structures; Diffractive structures; High numerical aperture objective; High numerical apertures; Mechanical tolerances; Multi-order diffraction; Simultaneous operation; Super resolution; Fits and tolerances","binary-phase diffractive structures; Diffraction; high-numerical-aperture objective lenses; Multi-Order diffraction gratings; superresolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057153094"

A more efficient method is to obtain comprehensive information to guide the SAR image reconstruction. Indeed, the co-registered High-Resolution (HR) optical image has been successfully applied to enhance the quality of SAR image due to its discriminative characteristics. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Optical-Guided Super-Resolution Network (OGSRN) for SAR image with large scale factors. Specifically, our proposed OGSRN consists of two sub-nets: a SAR image Super-Resolution U-Net (SRUN) and a SAR-to-Optical Residual Translation Network (SORTN). The whole process during training includes two stages. In stage-1, the SR SAR images are reconstructed by the SRUN. And an Enhanced Residual Attention Module (ERAM), which is comprised of the Channel Attention (CA) and Spatial Attention (SA) mechanisms, is constructed to boost the representation ability of the network. In stage-2, the output of the stage-1 and its corresponding HR SAR images are translated to optical images by the SORTN, respectively. And then the differences between SR images and HR images are computed in the optical space to obtain feedback information that can reduce the space of possible SR solution. After that, we can use the optimized SRUN to directly produce HR SAR image from Low-Resolution (LR) SAR image in the testing phase. The experimental results show that under the guidance of optical image, our OGSRN can achieve excellent performance in both quantitative assessment metrics and visual quality. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Convolutional neural networks; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Optical resolving power; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Attention mechanisms; Convolutional nerual network; Image super resolutions; Large-scales; Nerual networks; Optical image; Optical-; SAR Images; Scale Factor; Superresolution; Convolution","Attention mechanisms; Convolutional Nerual Networks (CNNs); Optical image; SAR image; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122232007"

These issues are especially severe when SAR measurement is contaminated with impulsive noise. To tackle the problem, in this paper, we propose a robust polarimetric SAR imaging method with attributed scattering priors in the framework of compressive sensing. In this scheme, the overcomplete dictionary is formed by taking advantage of the physically relevant attributed scattering center (ASC) model, which is capable to represent the electromagnetic behaviors of man-made assemblies. By using the robust data-fitting model and employing the joint sparsity of multiple polarization measurements, the problem of estimating ASC attributes can be converted into robust group sparse recovery via ℓ1-ℓ2,1 optimization. To solve this formulation efficiently, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers framework via exploiting the proximity operator of complex ℓ1 norm and ℓ2 norm functions for complex-valued SAR images. Finally, the super-resolution SAR image is achieved via spectrum extrapolation based on the estimated ASC attributes. The proposed technique can enhance the SAR image features arising from the non-ideal scattering components of the target and gain robust performance to impulsive noise. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; Frequency estimation; Frequency multiplying circuits; Image enhancement; Imaging techniques; Impulse noise; Polarimeters; Synthetic aperture radar; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Compressive sensing; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Electromagnetic behavior; Multiple polarizations; Over-complete dictionaries; Scattering centers; Spectrum extrapolation; Radar imaging","alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); attributed scattering center (ASC) model; compressive sensing (CS); impulsive noise; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066849434"

In this paper we consider soft extrapolation of entire functions of finite order and type (containing the class of bandlimited functions as a special case), multiplied by a super-exponentially decaying window (such as a Gaussian). We consider a weighted least-squares polynomial approximation with judiciously chosen number of terms and a number of samples which scales linearly with the degree of approximation. It is shown that this simple procedure provides stable recovery with an extrapolation factor which scales logarithmically with the perturbation level and is inversely proportional to the characteristic lengthscale of the function. The pointwise extrapolation error exhibits a Hölder-type continuity with an exponent derived from weighted potential theory, which changes from 1 near the available samples, to 0 when the extrapolation distance reaches the characteristic smoothness length scale of the function. The algorithm is asymptotically minimax, in the sense that there is essentially no better algorithm yielding meaningfully lower error over the same smoothness class. When viewed in the dual domain, soft extrapolation of an entire function of order 1 and finite exponential type corresponds to the problem of (stable) simultaneous de-convolution and super-resolution for objects of small space/time extent. Our results then show that the amount of achievable super-resolution is inversely proportional to the object size, and therefore can be significant for small objects. These results can be considered as a first step towards analyzing the much more realistic 'multiband' model of a sparse combination of compactly-supported 'approximate spikes', which appears in applications such as synthetic aperture radar, seismic imaging and direction of arrival estimation, and for which only limited special cases are well-understood. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Additive noise; Deconvolution; Least squares approximations; Optical resolving power; Polynomial approximation; Recovery; Scales (weighing instruments); Synthetic aperture radar; Analytic continuation; Band-limited functions; Compactly supported; Degree of approximation; Direction of arrival estimation; Entire functions; Optimal recovery; Weighted least squares; Extrapolation","analytic continuation; bandlimited functions; deconvolution; entire functions; extrapolation; optimal recovery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058503426"

Under the constraints of the beam coverage area per second and the accumulated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the value of azimuth resolution is minimized. In addition, to improve the resolution of the image, the split Bregman algorithm is also introduced. This algorithm solves the problem that the azimuth resolution is still lower than the traditional ISAR after the antenna rotation speed is optimized.

Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained much attention in signal processing, and it can automatically extract features to realise an image super-resolution reconstruction. As a popular CNN-based network, U-net can work with less training samples. Hence, the authors are interested in exploiting and modifying the U-net to enhance the P-band ISAR imaging. In this study, in light of the analysis of the effect of the ionospheric total electron content on the ground-based P-band radar echo signal, a novel ISAR imaging method is proposed for the ionospheric effect correction based on the modified U-net and polar formatting algorithm (PFA). The PFA is performed for the phase error coarse compensation. Then, the phase error fine compensation is exploited by the trained U-net.

However, there is a blind zone of forward-looking imaging for conventional Doppler beam sharpening and synthetic aperture radar. Scanning radar can be utilized to obtain a real beam image of a forward-looking area and implement target detection, while its azimuth resolution is poor due to the limitation of antenna size. Besides, during the processing procedure, imaging and target detection are usually regarded as two independent parts, which means that the imaging result will directly affect the detection performance. In this article, an integrated algorithm of super-resolution imaging and target detection for forward-looking scanning radar is proposed. In this algorithm, first of all, low-rank and sparse constraints as regularization norms are incorporated into the forward-looking scanning radar imaging and the objective function is established. Subsequently, the convex theory is utilized to solve the objective function and transform the problem of simultaneous super-resolution imaging and target detection into an optimization problem. Lastly, the super-resolution imaging and the target detection results are obtained simultaneously by solving the optimization problem using the alternating direction method of multipliers.

The method starts from the conversion of the specific land surface radar backscattering into the land surface dielectric permittivity in each polarization band separately. Said conversion is founded on a well-known integral equation model of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering. Transition from raw radar data to dielectric permittivity forms a common unified image field in each polarization band. Due to the SAR platform’s own movement, these fields are affected by some subpixel shift to each other. So, the opportunity to apply the superresolution technique over all permittivity fields at once is enabled with considering ones’ subpixel shift. Dual-image iterative superresolution based on Gaussian regularization was used. A standalone software module for statistical estimation of inter-images subpixel shift was developed earlier and applied in current research. A noticeable spatial resolution enhancement of the land surface dielectric permittivity field was achieved.

In this article, we pioneered the construction of the low-level feature to discriminate the ships and complemented the super-resolution (SR) denoising techniques in the network modules, termed low-level feature guided network (LFG-Net), for precise ship instance segmentation in SAR images. LFG-Net consists of the low-level feature concerned pyramid (LFCP), the high-resolution feature interaction module (HR-FIM), and the compression recovery segmentation branch (CRSB). LFCP extends the vanilla feature pyramid network (FPN) with the P1 layer and complements SR techniques to capture the regional and texture information at the image level for small object segmentation. HR-FIM interacts with the bounding box region of interest (RoI) feature and mask RoI feature at the instance level with HR techniques to enhance the mask RoI feature. CRSB aims at recovering the HR mask predictions to improve the ship segmentation performance. Comprehensive experiments on high-resolution SAR images dataset (HRSID), polygon segmentation SAR ship detection dataset (PSeg-SSDD), and AirSARShip indicate that LFG-Net∗ achieves 11.7%, 6.3%, and 12.7% AP increments compared with the Mask R-CNN baseline, respectively. Besides, it receives 9.5%, 4.9%, and 7.3% AP increments compared with the state-of-the-art method, which bridges the gap of instance segmentation precision in SAR images.

The most commonly used 30 m resolution shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) is usually required to be resampled due to its relatively low resolution (LR) comparing to the high resolution (HR) SAR images. Although the WorldDEM with a 12 m resolution achieves global coverage, it is not available freely. Consequently, it is useful to evaluate the practicability of the super-resolution (SR) from LR SRTM DEMs to HR WorldDEM ones, which has not been investigated. Most existing DEM SR models are trained with synthetic datasets in which the LR DEMs are downsampled from their HR counterparts. However, these models become less effective when applied to real-world scenarios due to the domain gap between the synthetic and real LR DEMs. In this article, we constructed a real-world DEM SR dataset, where the LR and HR DEMs were collected from SRTM and WorldDEM, respectively. An enhanced SR generative adversarial network model was adapted to train on the dataset. Considering that the real LR-HR pairs may suffer from misalignment, we introduced the perceptual loss for better optimizing the model. Moreover, a logarithmic normalization was proposed to compress the wide elevation range and adjust the uneven distribution. We also pretrained the model using natural images since collecting sufficient HR DEMs is costly. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near 0.69 dB improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, our method is also validated to improve the topographic phase simulation by 23.42% of MSE.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Optical resolving power; Signal to noise ratio; Space-based radar; Surveying; Tracking radar; Adversarial networks; Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR); Digital elevation model; Global coverage; Peak signal to noise ratio; Real-world scenario; Super resolution; Synthetic datasets; computer simulation; digital elevation model; image resolution; machine learning; radar imagery; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; synthetic aperture radar; topography; Synthetic aperture radar","Deep learning; digital elevation model; generative adversarial network; InSAR topographic phase simulation; super resolution (SR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113241559"

In particular by transforming them into a 3-D, 4-D, and in general Multi-Dimensional SAR image. The resolution in the higher dimensions, for instance in elevation and time, depends on the size of the elevation aperture and on the temporal separation which will be spanned by the different repeat paths. However, for more recent space-borne SAR systems which has sub-meter range resolution, like COSMO-Skymed or TerraSAR-X, the orbital tracks are tightly controlled so that they show only a small variation. According to this, the tomographic resolution in elevation is an order of magnitude lower than in range or azimuth. This is normally not a problem as only the strongest reflector is of interest. However, for urban scenes or man made objects one can expect that each azimuth-range cell consists of a few point-like scatterers in the elevation direction. To resolve these scatterers super-resolution algorithms are required to improve the performance of tomographic tools. Due to the present of only a few scatterers we can use compressive sensing (CS) techniques for reconstructing the elevation for tomographic images. This paper presents an adapted CS method for 4-D tomographic SAR and compares it with classical matched filter. Super-resolution properties of the proposed CS is proven by results obtained from simulations and from real TerraSAR-X data. © 2015 IEEE.","Matched filters; Optical resolving power; Radar; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal reconstruction; Sonar; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Tomography; Classical matched filters; Compressive sensing; D-inSAR; High range resolution; Sar tomography (SARTom); Super resolution; Super resolution algorithms; Tomographic resolution; Compressed sensing","Compressive Sensing (CS); Differential SAR Tomography; DInSAR; SAR Tomography; Super-Resolution; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962856902"

For inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR), the image of an interesting target is generally constructed by limited strong scattering centers, representing strong spatial sparsity. Such prior sparsity intrinsically paves a way to improved ISAR imaging performance. In this paper, we develop a super-resolution algorithm for forming ISAR images from limited observations. When the amplitude of the target scattered field follows an identical Laplace probability distribution, the approach converts super-resolution imaging into sparsity-driven optimization in the Bayesian statistics sense. We show that improved performance is achievable by taking advantage of the meaningful spatial structure of the scattered field. Further, we use the nonidentical Laplace distribution with small scale on strong signal components and large scale on noise to discriminate strong scattering centers from noise. A maximum likelihood estimator combined with a bandwidth extrapolation technique is also developed to estimate the scale parameters. Real measured data processing indicates the proposal can reconstruct the high-resolution image though only limited pulses even with low SNR, which shows advantages over current super-resolution imaging methods. © 2016, The Author(s).","Compressed sensing; Data handling; Image reconstruction; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Laplace transforms; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Optical resolving power; Probability distributions; Radar; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Bayesian; Compressive sensing; Inverse synthetic aperture radars (ISAR); Laplace distributions; Non-identical distribution; Super resolution; Radar imaging","Bayesian; Compressive sensing (CS); Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR); Laplace distribution; Nonidentical distribution; Statistical compressive sensing; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979057713"

Thus, the conventional range Doppler (RD) ISAR technique does not work properly. By exploiting two-dimensional (2D) sparsity of the target scene, 2D sparse matrix recovery algorithms are applied to achieve super-resolution within a short CPI, during which the Doppler shifts nearly remains constant. Sequential order one negative exponential (SOONE) function is used to measure the sparsity of a 2D signal. A 2D gradient projection (GP) method is developed to solve the SOONE function and thus the 2D-GP-SOONE algorithm is proposed. The algorithm can solve the sparse recovery of 2D signals directly. Then the 2D-GP-SOONE algorithm is used for the dynamic ISAR imaging of maneuvering targets. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method has a lower computational complexity and can achieve the fast recovering of a sparse matrix. Moreover, the proposed method has a better performance in ISAR imaging of maneuvering targets. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Doppler effect; Image processing; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Matrix algebra; Radar; Recovery; Synthetic aperture radar; Gradient projections; Inverse synthetic aperture radars (ISAR); Maneuvering targets; Negative exponential; Sparse matrices; Radar imaging","Gradient projection (GP) method; Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR); Maneuvering targets; Sequential order one negative exponential (SOONE) function; Sparse matrix recovery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85003467562"

The fully polarized signal model is established, based on which the super-resolution dictionary is formed. By exploiting the joint sparsity between polarimetric channel signals, the fully polarized super-resolution imaging problem can be mathematically converted into a L2,1 norm optimization question. The optimization problem can be solved via fast optimization algorithm. Comparing with the single-polarization imaging, the jointly multi-polarization imaging performs better on super-resolution and noise suppression by utilizing joint sparsity.

In this scenario, inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging techniques have been widely studied since they allow to obtain high-resolution images of moving targets by means of Fourier-based imaging methods [11,53]. In particular, the transmission of large bandwidth signals and the coherent integration of the received echoes from different aspect angles are the key aspects to obtain images with fine resolution both in range and cross-range. By the way, in some cases, the transmitted bandwidth and/or the coherent processing time (CPI) might be not enough for the desired resolution. In addition, system malfunctioning, transmission disruption, or data compression may be the causes of missing samples, both in the frequency and/or in the slow-time domain. In such cases, conventional Fourier-based imaging methods, such as the range-Doppler (RD) method, suffer from coarse resolution and distortions [11]. To enhance the results obtained via RD methods, different super-resolution (SR) techniques have been studied in the literature, such as apodization 106techniques [14,15] and bandwidth extrapolation (BWE) techniques [56]. The main disadvantages of such SR methods are that their performance is very sensitive to noise and clutter and that these methods generally computationally expensive. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Automatic target recognition; Bandwidth; Compressed sensing; Inverse problems; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Time domain analysis; Coherent integration; Coherent processing; Compressive sensing; Fourier-based imaging; High resolution image; Research communities; Target Classification; Transmitted bandwidth; Inverse synthetic aperture radar","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053311357"

First, the 3D scattered field data tensor is converted into a set of 2D matrix by stacking slices of the 3D data along one specific dimension. Then, 2D U-ESPRIT is applied to extract isolated scatterers from each slice. Combined with least-square method, complex scattering amplitudes are also estimated. Finally, 3D reconstructed scattering centres model with specific locations and complex scattering amplitudes is obtained, which can characterise the target to a great extent. The reverse process, reconstruction of the 3D ISAR image, can be readily done in real time by means of the extracted scattering centres.

By transforming classical 2-D SAR imaging into higher dimensional (space-time) imaging, it offers the possibility to reconstruct the 3-D/4-D scattering distribution and to detect point clouds for reconstructing single buildings and infrastructures and for the monitoring of their long term deformation. The resolution provided by classical SAR tomographic methods may show limitations in the detection of point clouds. To improve the performance of the tomographic tools super-resolution Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithms have been recently proposed.

Considering the characteristics of the ship target and the 3-D InISAR system, the bistatic configuration is designed to avoid the imaging failure in special situations caused by the low velocity of the ship target. The specificity of the 3-D InISAR imaging technique makes the adoption of the optimal imaging time selection method based on the estimation of the Doppler center, which can help to select the imaging time when the cross-range resolution reaches maximum, effective and simple enough for the 3-D reconstruction of the ship target. Besides, the translational and angular motion compensations in such situations are explained clearly. Due to the shortness of the selected echoes caused by motion complexity of the ship target, the sparse Bayes learning method, which has a lot of advantages compared with other similar methods, is adopted to realize the super-resolution imaging for the purpose of separating the superposed scatterers and its superiority in reducing the computation load of the 3-D InISAR imaging system is demonstrated explicitly. Finally, the distortion of the reconstructed coordinate for the ship target caused by the bistatic configuration is corrected by the simplified coordinate transformation and the relationship between the coordinates of the ship target and the reconstructed 3-D model is explained in detail.

Moreover, it is generally difficult to interpret because of the superposition of several contributions in a single SAR pixel. In this paper, a novel technique for the extraction of building layovers is first presented. It makes use of the geocoding stage embedded in the InSAR processor. It is shown that building layovers create a regular pattern in the mapping counter, a map describing the number of occurrences of a SAR pixel in the elevation model. Its exploitation yields a generation of a layover map without the use of external supports. The integration in the processor with a limited additional computational load and the capability to isolate layover signatures are additional benefits. Layover patches are then individually analyzed toward a better understanding of the complex urban signal return. A spectral estimation framework is employed to assess the slopes superimposed in the patches. Fringe-frequency estimation is involved.

K-means singular value decomposition (K-SVD) has shown great potential in SAR image de-noising. However, the traditional K-SVD is sensitive to the position and phase of the characteristics in the image, and the de-noised image by K-SVD has lost some detailed information of the original image. In this paper, we present one new SAR image de-noising method based on shift invariant K-SVD and guided filter. The whole method consists of two steps. The first deals mainly with the noisy image with shift invariant K-SVD and obtaining the initial de-noised image. In the second step, we do the guided filtering for the initial de-noised image. Finally, we can recover the final de-noised image. Experimental results show that our method not only has better visual effects and objective evaluation, but can also save more detailed information such as image edge and texture when de-noising SAR images. The presented shift invariant K-SVD can be widely used in image processing, such as image fusion, edge detection and super-resolution reconstruction. © 2017 by the author.","Bandpass filters; Edge detection; Image denoising; Image fusion; Image processing; Singular value decomposition; Synthetic aperture radar; Guided filtering; Guided filters; Objective evaluation; Original images; SAR Images; Shift invariance; Shift invariant; Super resolution reconstruction; Radar imaging","Guided filter; Image de-noising; K-SVD; SAR image; Shift invariance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038207185"

However, it is computationally expensive and sensitive to noise. To overcome these two drawbacks, the authors propose the coupled Nesterov linearised Bregman iteration algorithm based on two-dimensional (2D) real-valued dictionaries (CNLBI-TRD) for ISAR imaging. First, the ISAR echoes are taken as a 2D joint SR model in the range frequency-azimuth Doppler domain. Then the 2D complex-valued dictionaries are converted into real-valued ones through unitary transformations. The computational complexity is thus decreased by a factor of at least four. Finally, the CNLBI algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the 2D SR model directly. It combines the Nesterov's accelerated gradient method with the condition number optimisation of sensing matrices. An adaptive-adjustment strategy of the soft threshold parameter is presented. Thus the total iteration numbers can be greatly reduced. The simulation results and real data experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed imaging algorithm. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.","Gradient methods; Inverse problems; Inverse synthetic aperture radar; Iterative methods; Number theory; Optical resolving power; Optimization; Signal to noise ratio; Synthetic aperture radar; Adaptive adjustment; Condition numbers; Imaging algorithm; Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging; Low signal-to-noise ratio; Sparse representation; Two Dimensional (2 D); Unitary transformations; Radar imaging","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029557231"

This method uses the principle of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging and the idea of direct localization for reference. The observing time is divided into fast time and slow time in sampling. TDOA is required in the fast time domain, and FDOA is estimated in the slow time domain. Cross correlation of frequency domain is operated first between the sampling signals of two stations, and range cell migration of signals is then eliminated by reference function and general Keystone transform. The joint TDOA and FDOA are finally estimated by applying 2-D Fourier transform and mapping the position of sources. The results of simulation show that the precision of location is close to Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB) when SNR is high, and the proposed method can be still used for location in low SNR.

Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) provides scene reflectivity estimation of vegetation along elevation coordinates. Due to the advantages of superresolution imaging and a small number of measurements, compressive sensing (CS) inversion techniques for SAR tomography were successfully developed and applied. This paper addresses the 3-D imaging of forested areas based on the framework of CS using fully polarimetric (FP) multibaseline SAR interferometric (MB-InSAR) tomography at P-band. A new CS-based FP MB-InSAR tomography method is proposed: a sum of Kronecker product (SKP) decomposition-based CS FP MB-InSAR tomography method (FP-SKPCS TomoSAR method). The method, based on an assumption that the reflectivity signal of a single scattering mechanism (SM) is more sparse than that of a composite of SMs, recovers the reflectivity profile of different SMs by using the CS technique. This method not only allows superresolution imaging with a low number of acquisitions but also can estimate the polarimetric SM of the vertical structure of forested areas. The effectiveness of these novel techniques for polarimetric SAR tomography is demonstrated using FP P-band airborne data sets acquired by the ONERA SETHI airborne system over a test site in Paracou, French Guiana, and the results of the vertical structure of forested areas derived by the method are verified by in situ test data. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","French Guiana; Paracou; Compressed sensing; Ecology; Forestry; Optical resolving power; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Reflection; Signal reconstruction; Tomography; Compressive sensing; Inversion techniques; Reflectivity profiles; Reflectivity signals; Sar tomography (SARTom); Super resolution imaging; Synthetic aperture radar tomographies; Vertical structures; airborne sensing; data set; forest ecosystem; image analysis; image resolution; numerical method; reflectivity; signal processing; synthetic aperture radar; tomography; wave scattering; Synthetic aperture radar","Compressive sensing (CS); polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR); SAR; SAR tomography; sum of Kronecker product (SKP) decomposition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947035261"

In this paper, we focus on sparse moving target imaging (MTIm) using a SAR sensor from sparse aperture (SA) data. For maneuvering targets, their strong motion tends to introduce migration through range cell (MTRC), which increases the difficulty of SA imaging. In this paper, a novel algorithm of moving target imaging is proposed to deal with both the MTRC and SA. In the scheme, a scaled Fourier dictionary is employed to represent the MTRC. A hierarchical model of statistics is used to encode the sparsity of image. Then, SA imaging is treated as a problem of sparse Bayesian learning, which is solved by expectation maximization (EM) method. The scaled Fourier dictionary is modified to resolve the velocity ambiguity. Finally, experimental analysis is performed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","","maneuvering targets; moving target imaging (MTIm); sparse Bayesian learning; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041828644"

However, the analysis presented is general, and extensions to other SAR types, scenes and other radar waveforms are straightforward. The atomic norm is formulated and employed as a penalizer for SAR denoising and reconstruction, as a convex problem. The target positions are readily estimated through the peaks of the dual polynomial. Furthermore, due to strong duality in our convex formulation, we show that the target positions are obtained from either the primal or dual problem solution.

Meanwhile, a theoretical verification for sparse representation in correlation domain was given and the singular value decomposition (SVD) was used twice to reduce the dimension of the model.

However, it cannot always derive the sparsest solution and often yields outliers in recovery. Consequently, it is usually difficult to extract true persistent scatterers straightforwardly in practice. To enhance the sparsity, we introduce iterative reweighted L1 minimization for sparse inversion. The weight factor is computed in each iteration, according to the previous tomographic magnitude to establish a more democratic penalization rule. Our simulation results indicate that the reweighted algorithm can achieve perfect recovery when noise is lower. Specifically, when the signal-to-noise ratio is equal to 5 dB, two reweighted iterations can improve the probability of true sparsity from 29.2% to 99.8% for single scatterers and from 0.2% to 95.4% for double scatterers. Due to the enhanced sparsity, we can directly identify scatterers without the need for further model selection. The method is validated using 44 TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X images. Single and double scatterers are detected in urban areas. Verification using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data indicates that we achieve submeter accuracy of the height estimates. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Iterative methods; Optical radar; Radar; Radar imaging; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Tomography; Light detection and ranging; Model Selection; Persistent scatterers; Sparse inversions; Super resolution; TerraSAR-X; Tomographic synthetic aperture radars; Urban areas; Synthetic aperture radar","Reweighted L<sub>1</sub> minimization; TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X; tomographic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging; urban areas","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84920998514"

Compared with the traditional two-dimensional imaging, it increases the elevation information. Traditional spectrum estimation methods can be used for SAR tomography, but the elevation resolution is lower. For the sparse scenes in the elevation direction, compressive sensing (CS) methods can be used to reconstruct the elevation information, and have the super-resolution capability. The iterative shrinkage-thresholding(IST) algorithm can be used for TomoSAR, but its convergence rate is slower. A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding (FIST) algorithm is introduced for TomoSAR, which will not only maintain the accuracy of the IST algorithm, but also has a faster convergence rate. The characteristics of the FIST algorithm are shown in multiple scatterers distinguish, single-scatter position estimation and other aspects through simulation experiments. Then, the TerraSAR-X actual data of Beijing region is used to analyze the imaging result of TomoSAR. The research result shows that the FIST algorithm has obvious advantages in the aspects of multiple scatterers distinguish and single-scatter position estimation.

To obtain super-resolution ISAR imaging at low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios, this paper puts forward a novel fast two-dimensional joint linearized Bregman iteration (2D-JLBI) algorithm based on compressive sensing theory. Firstly, the radar echoes are established as a two-dimensional joint sparse representation model in the range frequency-azimuth Doppler domain. Consequently, the original two-dimensional super resolution imaging problem is converted into a twodimensional jointly compressive reconstruction problem. Secondly, to avoid the reconstruction complexity from the vectorization of the echoes, the two-dimensional joint linearized Bregman iterative algorithm is proposed. Meanwhile, three strategies, namely the weighted residual iteration, estimation of the stagnation step, and optimizing the condition numbers of sensing matrices, are combined to improve the convergence speed. Both the ISAR imaging ability at low SNR and its speed are improved obviously. Finally, simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm can shorten the imaging time and have better noise robustness under the condition of sub-Nyquist sampling rate and low SNR. © 2016, Chinese Physical Society.

This poses serious challenges to onboard transmission and storage of satellites. Additionally, the traditional beamforming technique suffers degraded imaging capacities caused by the incoherence between the received signals of different channels. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper proposes an improved method for the focusing of multichannel SAR raw data based on the framework of compressed sensing (CS). Through adaptive measurement matrix construction for each subchannel, the proposed approach can take the misregistration information of all received signals into account, providing an accurate imagery recovery of sparse reflectivity.

Moreover, the inaccurate position measurement of illuminators, receivers and the target would cause phase errors in the target echo and the quality of the image would further subject to degradation. With the motivation to improve the performance of the MPRIS, an imaging algorithm based on the principle of tomographic imaging is presented. On account of the sparse distribution of the scatterer of the target, the compressed sensing algorithm is extended to the multistatic configuration to realize the super resolution image formation. In addition, an autofocusing technique based on the multistatic observation model is proposed.

However, when multiple moving targets with the close centres exist, the conventional algorithms may suffer from the performance degradation since the spectra resolution of FT may be limited by the time samples. To address this issue, a super-resolution motion parameter estimation algorithm is proposed in this study. First, Keystone transform is applied to correct the linear range walk. Then the range curvature is compensated by the matched function with respect to the platform velocity. After performing the compensation of linear range walk and range curvature, the energy of a ground moving target is focused on one range cell, and then a first-order discrete polynomial-phase transform is applied to transform the quadratic phase signal into a single tone. After applying the smoothing technique to construct the covariance matrix of full rank, the multiple signal classification algorithm is utilised to estimate the target cross- and along-track velocities, which can significantly improve the motion parameter resolution performance compared with the FFT-based algorithms.

Super-resolution parametric DOA estimation methods improve the vertical resolution and mitigate the effect of sidelobes. Nevertheless, these techniques have the main drawback related to the assumption that the scene is composed by a finite number of point-type backscattering sources. On the other hand, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) inspired non-parametric DOA estimation methods are better suited to cope with scenarios characterized by the presence of distributed scatterers. In this work, we propose to decompose the SARTom vertical distribution estimation problem into two paradigms: parametric DOA estimation for point-type scatterers and non-parametric recovery of the spatial spectrum pattern (SSP) of the spatially distributed scattering components.

In this letter, we propose a new approach for TomoSAR based on two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TWIST). TWIST uses a two-step strategy to speed up the L1-norm minimization procedure and can achieve an exceptionally fast convergence speed for TomoSAR. Experimental studies with simulated signals and a spotlight-mode TerraSAR-X data set were carried out to demonstrate the merits of the proposed TWIST approach in terms of robustness, fast convergence speed, and super-resolution capability. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; Iterative methods; Optical resolving power; Radar; Shrinkage; Signal reconstruction; Singular value decomposition; Tomography; Basis pursuit; Compressive sensing; L1-norm minimizations; Truncated singular value decomposition; Two-step iterative shrinkages; Synthetic aperture radar","Basis pursuit (BP); compressive sensing (CS); L1-norm minimization; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography; truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD); two-step iterative shrinkage/thresholding (TWIST)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027946617"

Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) provides scene reflectivity estimation of vegetation along elevation coordinates. Due to the advantages of super-resolution imaging and a small number of measurements, distribution compressive sensing (DCS) inversion techniques for polarimetric SAR tomography were successfully developed and applied. This paper addresses the 3-D imaging of forested areas based on the framework of DCS using fully polarimetric (FP) multibaseline SAR interferometric (MB-InSAR) tomography at the P-band. A new DCS-based FP TomoSAR method is proposed: a new wavelet-based distributed compressive sensing FP TomoSAR method (FP-WDCS TomoSAR method). The method takes advantage of the joint sparsity between polarimetric channel signals in the wavelet domain to jointly inverse the reflectivity profiles in each channel. The method not only allows high accuracy and super-resolution imaging with a low number of acquisitions, but can also obtain the polarization information of the vertical structure of forested areas. The effectiveness of the techniques for polarimetric SAR tomography is demonstrated using FP P-band airborne datasets acquired by the ONERA SETHI airborne system over a test site in Paracou, French Guiana. © 2015 The Authors.","Compressed sensing; Ecosystems; Forestry; Indium compounds; Inverse problems; Optical resolving power; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Reflection; Tomography; Compressive sensing; Inversion techniques; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Reflectivity profiles; Sparse representation; Super resolution imaging; Synthetic aperture radar tomographies; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Synthetic aperture radar","distributed compressive sensing; polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; sparse representations; synthetic aperture radar tomography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946866763"

Hence, superresolution reconstruction algorithms are desired. Since the signal to be reconstructed is sparse on the 2-D azimuth-cross-track plane, it is quite suitable to apply the compressive sensing theory to obtain the images. The existed imaging algorithms for downward-looking linear array 3-D SAR are based on 1-D compressive sensing, which could bring the couple effect between different directions. To solve this problem, a novel 3-D imaging algorithm based on 2-D compressive sensing is proposed in this paper. Instead of converting the sparse reconstruction of 2-D matrix signals to the sparse reconstruction of 1-D vectors, the proposed algorithm directly reconstructs the 2-D sparse signals on overcomplete dictionaries with separable atoms. It not only provides superresolution performance, but also reduces the storage of data acquisition and processing. Furthermore, a definition of joint sparse sampling strategy is given to reconstruct the measurement matrices for further improving the computational efficiency of the imaging algorithm. Moreover, in order to investigate the limits of the proposed algorithm, the theory analysis of Cram acute{e}r-Rao bound is derived and compared with the standard deviation. Finally, numerical simulations under the noise scenarios and the principle prototype experiment on real data are shown to demonstrate the validity and the limits of the proposed algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.","Algorithms; Compressed sensing; Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Matrix algebra; Optical resolving power; Signal reconstruction; Synthetic aperture radar; Compressive sensing; Imaging algorithm; Over-complete dictionaries; Prototype experiment; Sparse reconstruction; Standard deviation; Super-resolution reconstruction; Superresolution performance; algorithm; image analysis; radar imagery; reconstruction; spectral analysis; synthetic aperture radar; Radar imaging","Compressive sensing (CS); joint sparse sampling; superresolution; three-dimensional synthetic aperture radar (SAR); two-dimensional spectral estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992292411"

Hence, superresolution reconstruction algorithms are desired. Since the cross-track signal to be reconstructed is sparse in the object domain, compressive sensing algorithm has been used. However, the imaging processing on the 3-D scene brings large computational loads, which renders challenges in both data acquisition and processing. To cover this shortage, truncated singular value decomposition is utilized to reconstruct a reduced-redundancy spatial measurement matrix. The proposed algorithm provides advantages in terms of computational time while maintaining the quality of the scene reconstructions. Moreover, our results on uniform linear array are generally applicable to sparse nonuniform linear array.
