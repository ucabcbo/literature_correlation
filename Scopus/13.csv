RTS can significantly impact permafrost stability and generate substantial carbon emissions. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of RTS is a critical step to understanding and modelling greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost thaw. Mapping RTS using conventional Earth observation approaches is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature and often small scale of RTS in the Arctic. In this study, we trained deep neural network models to map RTS across several landscapes in Siberia and Canada. Convolutional neural networks were trained with 965 RTS features, where 509 were from the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas in Siberia, and 456 from six other pan-Arctic regions including Canada and Northeastern Siberia. We further tested the impact of negative data on the model performance. We used 4-m Maxar commercial imagery as the base map, 10-m NDVI derived from Sentinel-2 and 2-m elevation data from the ArcticDEM as model inputs and applied image augmentation techniques to enhance training. The best-performing model reached a validation Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.74 and a test IoU score of 0.71. Compared to past efforts to map RTS features, this represents one of the best-performing models and generalises well for mapping RTS in different permafrost regions, representing a critical step towards pan-Arctic deployment. The predicted RTS matched very well with the ground truth labels visually. We also tested how model performance varied across different regional contexts. The result shows an overall positive impact on the model performance when data from different regions were incorporated into the training. We propose this method as an effective, accurate and computationally undemanding approach for RTS mapping. © 2023 The Authors","Deep neural networks; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Image enhancement; Mapping; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Arctic; Critical steps; Deep learning; Modeling performance; Pan-Arctic; Remote-sensing; Retrogressive thaw slump; Semantic segmentation; SIBERIA; Thaw slump; Global warming","Arctic; Deep learning; Global warming; Remote sensing; Retrogressive thaw slumps; Semantic segmentation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147843218"

Leads regulate the heat, gas and moisture fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere and are areas of high ice growth rates during periods of freezing conditions. Here, an algorithm providing an automatic lead detection based on synthetic aperture radar images is described that can be applied to a wide range of Sentinel-1 scenes. By using both the HH and the HV channels instead of single co-polarised observations the algorithm is able to classify more leads correctly. The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision-recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification. The algorithm is able to produce a lead classification with more that 90% precision with 60% of all leads classified. The precision can be increased by the cost of the amount of leads detected.

In this study, we revisit the multi-year trends in ice flow by assessing more carefully the impact of seasonal fluctuation in velocity on the annual mean ice velocity. We find that, depending on the length and period used to measure displacement, seasonal fluctuations do have an impact on observed velocities on up to 15%, and can affect decadal trends. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this fluctuation is small enough to confirm the general slowdown observed during the 2000–2012 period. Between 2012 and 2019, we find significant re-acceleration of low-lying glaciers tongue but velocity trends elsewhere are generally insignificant and not spatially consistent. Finally, we propose a more selective approach to recovering velocity trends using satellite imagery that involves using only measurements where the image pair starting date is before summer, in order to have comparable measurements for every year, sampling a melt season and the following winter. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic; Greenland; Ice; Optical remote sensing; Feature-tracking; Green land; Ice velocity; Ice velocity trend; LandSat 7; Landsat 7–8; Optical remote sensing; Seasonal fluctuations; Sentinel-2; Southwest greenland; ice flow; Landsat; remote sensing; runoff; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; Satellite imagery","Feature-tracking; Ice velocity trends; Landsat 7–8; Optical remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Southwest Greenland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144296752"

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

Monitoring and tracking of permafrost disturbances is important as they impact surrounding landscapes, ecosystems and infrastructure. Remote sensing provides the means to detect, map, and quantify these changes homogeneously across large regions and time scales. Existing Landsat-based algorithms assess different types of disturbances with similar spatiotemporal requirements. However, Landsat-based analyses are restricted in northern high latitudes due to the long repeat interval and frequent clouds, in particular at Arctic coastal sites. We therefore propose to combine Landsat and Sentinel-2 data for enhanced data coverage and present a combined annual mosaic workflow, expanding currently available algorithms, such as LandTrendr, to achieve more reliable time series analysis. We exemplary test the workflow for twelve sites across the northern high latitudes in Siberia. We assessed the number of images and cloud-free pixels, the spatial mosaic coverage and the mosaic quality with spectral comparisons. The number of available images increased steadily from 1999 to 2019 but especially from 2016 onward with the addition of Sentinel-2 images. Consequently, we have an increased number of cloud-free pixels even under challenging environmental conditions, which then serve as the input to the mosaicking process. In a comparison of annual mosaics, the Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics always fully covered the study areas (99.9-100 %), while Landsat-only mosaics contained data-gaps in the same years, only reaching coverage percentages of 27.2 %, 58.1 %, and 69.7 % for Sobo Sise, East Taymyr, and Kurungnakh in 2017, respectively. The spectral comparison of Landsat image, Sentinel-2 image, and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic showed high correlation between the input images and mosaic bands (e.g., for Kurungnakh 0.91-0.97 between Landsat and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic and 0.92-0.98 between Sentinel-2 and Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaic) across all twelve study sites, testifying good quality mosaic results. Our results show that especially the results for northern, coastal areas was substantially improved with the Landsat+Sentinel-2 mosaics. By combining Landsat and Sentinel-2 data we accomplished to create reliably high spatial resolution input mosaics for time series analyses. Our approach allows to apply a high temporal continuous time series analysis to northern high latitude permafrost regions for the first time, overcoming substantial data gaps, and assess permafrost disturbance dynamics on an annual scale across large regions with algorithms such as LandTrendr by deriving the location, timing and progression of permafrost thaw disturbances. © 2020 by the authors.","Continuous time systems; Harmonic analysis; Permafrost; Pixels; Remote sensing; Thawing; Continuous-time; Coverage percentage; Environmental conditions; High Latitudes; High spatial resolution; Monitoring and tracking; Permafrost region; Permafrost thaws; Time series analysis","Data fusion; Disturbance tracking; Permafrost; Permafrost thaw; Time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089846172"

As is shown in the article the data of radiometers installed on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites allow monitoring of iceberg drifting in spring period in the above Arctic region. Thus, in March-April 2018, the total amount of icebergs detected near the archipelago was 4917. 4161 icebergs were in the landfast ice, 722 ones were drifting with the ice fields, and the other 32 were aground in ice fields. The average length of the icebergs was equal to 88 m; the largest of the recognized icebergs was located in the landfast ice near the ice shelf of the Matusevich fjord and it was 1240 m in length. The maximum speed of drift of the icebergs, as determined by the satellite data, was equal to 29.5 km/day. This was estimated for the situation when the speed of the near-water (surface) wind reached 20 m/s and larger. The purpose of the work was to study drifting of icebergs in order to define more exactly dynamics of the iceberg movement in this poorly known area of the Arctic. It is found that in a case of the consolidated ice cover the drift speed of ice fields with the icebergs involved depends on the driving wind force and direction. According to mean speeds of movement all icebergs were separated into three groups: the icebergs of the coastal zone with velocities smaller 1 km/day; the icebergs of the transition zone at speeds of 1.3 to 1.6 km/day; and the icebergs of the transit zone with speeds larger 2 km/day. The characteristics of the iceberg drifts obtained on the basis of daily satellite monitoring can be used in regional iceberg drift models to ensure safe economic activity on the Arctic shelf. Also, they can find application in engineering calculations in the design of infrastructure facilities on the shelf of the Arctic seas. © 2019 г.","","Arcticseas; Icebergdrift; Icebergs; SevernayaZemlya; Spacemonitoring; Visiblespectralrange","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091035208"

The calving fronts of many Greenland glaciers have been undergoing substantial variations, and a comprehensive front dataset is necessary for better understanding such frontal dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for an automated approach to identifying glaciological features such as calving fronts. In 2019, three deep-learning-based methods were applied to calving front delineation, but were restricted to a specific area or dataset. Here, we develop a more generalized method that can be applied to a major outlet glacier or remote sensing datasets that are not included in the training. We integrate seven remote sensing datasets into a single deep learning network. The core datasets include optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar images (Envisat, ALOS-1 TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) taken over Jakobshavn Isbræ, Kangerlussuaq, and Helheim, spanning from 2002 to 2019. We evaluate four neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabv3+ with ResNet, DRN, and MobileNet as the backbones) and three histogram modification strategies (e.g., histogram normalization, linear stretching, and no histogram modification). We find that the combination of histogram normalization and DRN-DeepLabv3+ has the lowest test error, at 86 m.

Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images from the 2015-16 to 2018-19 austral summers, we analyze the evolution of sea ice ponds that form adjacent to the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We find that each summer, meltwater flows from the ice shelf onto the sea ice and forms large (up to 9 km2) ponds. These ponds decrease the sea ice's albedo, thinning it. We suggest the added mass of runoff causes the ice to flex, potentially promoting sea-ice instability by the ice-shelf front. As surface melting on ice shelves increases, we suggest that ice-shelf surface hydrology will have a greater effect on sea-ice stability.

Increasing air temperatures drive permafrost thaw and an increase in coastal erosion and river discharge. This results in a greater input of sediment and organic matter into nearshore waters, impacting ecosystems by reducing light transmission through the water column and altering biogeochemistry. This potentially results in impacts on the subsistence economy of local people as well as the climate due to the transformation of suspended organic matter into greenhouse gases. Even though the impacts of increased suspended sediment concentrations and turbidity in the Arctic nearshore zone are well-studied, the mechanisms underpinning this increase are largely unknown. Wave energy and tides drive the level of turbidity in the temperate and tropical parts of the world, and this is generally assumed to also be the case in the Arctic. However, the tidal range is considerably lower in the Arctic, and processes related to the occurrence of permafrost have the potential to greatly contribute to nearshore turbidity. In this study, we use high-resolution satellite imagery alongside in situ and ERA5 reanalysis data of ocean and climate variables in order to identify the drivers of nearshore turbidity, along with its seasonality in the nearshore waters of Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk, in the western Canadian Arctic. Nearshore turbidity correlates well to wind direction, wind speed, significant wave height, and wave period. Nearshore turbidity is superiorly correlated to wind speed at the Beaufort Shelf compared to in situ measurements at Herschel Island Qikiqtaruk, showing that nearshore turbidity, albeit being of limited spatial extent, is influenced by large-scale weather and ocean phenomenons. We show that, in contrast to the temperate and tropical ocean, freshly eroded material is the predominant driver of nearshore turbidity in the Arctic, rather than resuspension, which is caused by the vulnerability of permafrost coasts to thermo-erosion. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet to date, spatial resolution limitations of commonly used satellite imagery have inhibited quantification of their hydrography. By merging newly available Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery with 2-m ArcticDEM digital elevation data, we created a continuous actively-flowing river network map of the Colville (Kuukpik) River Basin (∼36 000 km2) in Alaska, which includes small rivers as narrow as 10 m. We quantified the river hydrography (stream order and river width, length,surface area, velocity, slope, sinuosity, and catchment area) of the Colville river network in detail, revealing the dominant role of small rivers. Our results show that: (1) small rivers occupy >80% of total river length and surface area of the Colville river network and drain >90% of the catchment area; (2) including numerous small rivers increases the peak of hillslope-channel travel time distribution (TTD) by ∼4 times and shortens the mean hillslope-channel travel time by at least an order of magnitude compared to coarser-resolution river hydrography products; and (3) 87% of the Colville River Basin's carbon dioxide is emitted from small rivers. In sum, we show that small Arctic rivers greatly influence streamflow TTD and carbon cycle. These findings expand our understanding of Arctic river hydrography to a 10-m spatial resolution and raise prospects for tracking dynamic surface water processes with high-resolution satellite observations. © 2021 The Author(s).

We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m^{3}, collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks. The proposed OCN model achieved reduced mean absolute error compared to the GPR by 5.2%, C2RCC by 51.7%, OC3 by 22.6%, and spectral band ratios by 29%. Moreover, the proposed spatial window and depth-integrated match-up creation techniques improved the performance of the proposed OCN by 57%, GPR by 41.9%, OC3 by 5.3%, and spectral band ratio method by 24% in terms of RMSE compared to the conventional match-up selection approach.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Chlorophyll; Color; Geometrical optics; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Design and implements; Empirical techniques; Gaussian process regression; Multi spectral imager; Neural network model; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing of ocean; Spectral distribution; chlorophyll a; estimation method; machine learning; monitoring; ocean color; remote sensing; Sentinel; Image enhancement","Barents sea; Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) monitoring; ocean color (OC)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104634963"

We find that about 4.4% (~26,000 km2) of all glacier areas (excluding the Greenland ice sheet and Antarctica) are covered with debris, but that the distribution is heterogeneous. The largest debris-covered areas are located in high-mountain ranges, away from the poles. At a global scale, we find a negative scaling relationship between glacier size and percentage of debris.

The YK Delta contains extensive surface waters (∼33% cover) and significant quantities of organic carbon, much of which is stored in vulnerable permafrost. Inland aquatic ecosystems act as hot-spots for landscape CO2 and CH4 emissions and likely represent a significant component of the Arctic carbon balance, yet aquatic fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are also some of the most uncertain. We measured dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations (n = 364), in surface waters from different types of waterbodies during summers from 2016 to 2019. We used Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to classify landcover types and area burned in contributing watersheds. We develop a model using machine learning to assess how waterbody properties (size, shape, and landscape properties), environmental conditions (O2, temperature), and surface water chemistry (dissolved organic carbon composition, nutrient concentrations) help predict in situ observations of CH4 and CO2 concentrations across deltaic waterbodies. CO2 concentrations were negatively related to waterbody size and positively related to waterbody edge effects. CH4 concentrations were primarily related to organic matter quantity and composition. Waterbodies in burned watersheds appeared to be less carbon limited and had longer soil water residence times than in unburned watersheds. Our results illustrate the importance of small lakes for regional carbon emissions and demonstrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of greenhouse gasses in small waterbodies. © 2022.

We study how to train deep neural networks for improving the discrimination of ships and icebergs in multispectral satellite images. We also analyze synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images for comparison. The annotated datasets of ships and icebergs are collected from multispectral Sentinel-2 data and taken from the C-CORE dataset of Sentinel-1 SAR images. Convolutional Neural Networks with a range of hyperparameters are tested and optimized. Classification accuracies are considerably better for deep neural networks than for support vector machines. Deeper neural nets improve the accuracy per epoch but at the cost of longer processing time. Extending the datasets with semi-supervised data from Greenland improves the accuracy considerably whereas data augmentation by rotating and flipping the images has little effect. The resulting classification accuracies for ships and icebergs are 86% for the SAR data and 96% for the MSI data due to the better resolution and more multispectral bands. The size and quality of the datasets are essential for training the deep neural networks, and methods to improve them are discussed.

There would be valuable benefits from applying these techniques to the Arctic areas, where ground local studies are typically difficult to perform due to hardly accessible roads and lands. At the same time, however, the application of remote-sensing methods comes with its own set of challenges when it comes to the peculiar features of the Arctic: short growing periods, winter storms, wind, and frequent cloud and snow cover. In this study we perform a comparative analysis of three commonly used classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in combination with ground truth samples from regions all over Iceland, provided by Iceland’s Soil Conservation Service department.

It is challenging to match multitemporal synthetic aperture radar or optical images because the GrIS ice surface changes dramatically, particularly during melt seasons. Therefore, ice surface features used for image matching are required to remain persistent even if the other image characteristics change significantly. This letter proposes that supraglacial rivers can be used to match multitemporal images' tie points (TPs) and to measure the ice flow velocities. First, multitemporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images are used to detect supraglacial rivers by integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal channel information. Second, potential river TPs are created using GIS buffer and overlaying operations. Third, a nonrigid coherent point drift algorithm is used to match river TPs, and the spatial displacements among the corresponding matching river TPs are used to calculate the ice flow velocities. A typical outlet glacier of the northeast GrIS is selected as the study area and six multispectral Sentinel-2 images are used to calculate the summer and annual ice flow velocities during 2016-2018. The results show that the summer ice flow velocity is 640-665 m/a, 9%-14% higher than the annual ice flow velocity ( 581-588 m/a). The summer and annual ice flow velocities both decrease along the ice and river flow direction. The derived ice flow velocities are closely correlated with two state-of-the-art ice flow velocity products (R2 ≥ 0.981), indicating the high accuracy of the proposed method.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Geometrical optics; Glaciers; Ice; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Rivers; Synthetic aperture radar; Velocity; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice flow; Ice flow velocity; Ice loss; Ice surfaces; Mass loss; Remote-sensing; Supraglacial river; Tie points; flow velocity; ice flow; river basin; Flow velocity","Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS); Ice flow velocity; Ice loss; Remote sensing; Supraglacial river","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121780773"

However, current global hydrography data products generally include only rivers that are wider than 30 m, neglecting smaller waterways and thus limiting our understanding of surface water processes, especially in remote areas. We present a new automated methodology to map two Arctic actively-flowing river networks (Kotuy and Coleen Rivers, with study areas of ~12,000 km2 and 10,000 km2, respectively), including small rivers as narrow as 10 m from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery and high-resolution ArcticDEM digital elevation data. First, preliminary river network masks were generated by using Gabor filtering and path opening morphological operations on Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) images. Second, ArcticDEM data were employed to simulate surface flow paths, and the resultant drainage networks were used to create river areas of interest (AOI) and subsequently eliminate non-water features outside the river AOI. Third, gaps along remotely sensed small river channels were filled using the ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks, yielding continuous river networks with high spatial resolution. We compared the 10 m Sentinel-ArcticDEM merged River Network (SARN) with the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and four 30 m Landsat-derived hydrography data products (GSW, GRWL, FROM-GLC 2017, and G3WBM). We conclude: (1) SARNs have similar quality to the >1st order NHD (>70% of NHD streams appear in SARNs). (2) At a reach scale, SARNs include more small rivers with the drainage densities at least ~4.5 times larger than Landsat-derived hydrography data products. Similarly, coupling ArcticDEM data with 30 m Landsat satellite images increases resultant drainage densities approximately three-fold. (3) At a catchment scale, merging remotely sensed river networks with ArcticDEM-modeled drainage networks significantly improves river connectivity (defined as the longest connected river length) with at least a ten-fold increase over the other hydrography data products examined here. In sum, merging high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery with ArcticDEM data enable effective, continuous mapping of complex fluvial drainage patterns of Arctic rivers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Catchments; Drainage; Gabor filters; Mapping; Mathematical morphology; Merging; Navigation; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Small satellites; Arctic; ArcticDEM; LANDSAT; River network; Sentinel-2; Small rivers; catchment; digital elevation model; methodology; NDVI; remote sensing; river system; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; surface water; Rivers","Arctic; ArcticDEM; Landsat; River network mapping; Sentinel-2; Small rivers","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079904673"

To date, only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time. The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents, but the high variability of near-surface soil moisture during the snow-free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose. We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C-band SAR data acquired in winter (close to zero liquid water content). To test our hypothesis, we used C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44 cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 54 cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TC). Retrieval from C-band SAR shows similar performance, but C-VV is more suitable than C-HH to derive vegetation height (RMSEs of 48 and 56 cm respectively). An exponential relationship with in situ height was evident for all tested parameters (NDVI, TC, C-VV and C-HH) suggesting that the C-band SAR and multi-spectral approaches possess similar capabilities including tundra biomass retrieval. Errors might occur in specific settings as a result of high surface roughness, high photosynthetic activity in wetlands or high snow density. We therefore introduce a method for combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to address the ambiguities related to Arctic wetlands and barren rockfields. Snow-related deviations occur within tundra fire scars in permafrost areas in the case of C-VV use. The impact decreases with age of the fire scar, following permafrost and vegetation recovery. The evaluation of masked C-VV retrievals across different regions, tundra types and sources (in situ and circumpolar vegetation community classification from satellite data) suggests pan-Arctic applicability to map current conditions for heights up to 160 cm. The presented methodology will allow for new applications and provide advanced insight into changing environmental conditions in the Arctic. © 2019 The Authors","Arctic; Biomass; Climate change; Forestry; Permafrost; Radar; Snow; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Environmental conditions; Multispectral indices; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical; Photosynthetic activity; Shrubs; Tasseled cap wetness; Tundra; biomass; climate change; environmental conditions; feasibility study; NDVI; permafrost; satellite data; Sentinel; shrub; soil moisture; soil-vegetation interaction; synthetic aperture radar; tundra; vegetation type; Vegetation","Optical; Radar; Shrubs; Tundra; Vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076042309"

At the same time, climate change impacts are pronounced in the Arctic. Ground temperatures are, for example, increasing as well as coastal erosion. A consistent account of the current human footprint is needed in order to evaluate the impact on the environments as well as risk for infrastructure. Identification of roads and settlements with satellite data is challenging due to the size of single features and low density of clusters. Spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data are the main issues regarding their separation. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 and-2 missions recently provided good spatial coverage and at the same time comparably high pixel spacing starting with 10 m for modes available across the entire Arctic. The purpose of this study was to assess the capabilities of both, Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Sentinel-2 multispectral information for Arctic focused mapping. Settings differ across the Arctic (historic settlements versus industrial, locations on bedrock versus tundra landscapes) and reference data are scarce and inconsistent. The type of features and data scarcity demand specific classification approaches. The machine learning approaches Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation have been tested. Records for the Alaskan North Slope, Western Greenland, and Svalbard in addition to high-resolution satellite data have been used for validation and calibration. Deep learning is superior to GBM with respect to users accuracy. GBM therefore requires comprehensive postprocessing. SAR provides added value in case of GBM. VV is of benefit for road identification and HH for detection of buildings. Unfortunately, the Sentinel-1 acquisition strategy is varying across the Arctic. The majority is covered in VV+VH only. DL is of benefit for road and building detection but misses large proportions of other human-impacted areas, such as gravel pads which are typical for gas and oil fields. A combination of results from both GBM (Sentinel-1 and-2 combined) and DL (Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1 optional) is therefore suggested for circumpolar mapping. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptive boosting; Climate change; Deep learning; Mapping; Oil fields; Roads and streets; Satellites; Semantics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Acquisition strategies; Classification approach; High resolution satellite data; Impact on the environment; Industrial development; Machine learning approaches; Semantic segmentation; Spectral characteristics; Classification (of information)","Arctic; Infrastructure; Machine learning; Multi-spectral; SAR; Settlements","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089689584"

We use coincident high-resolution satellite imagery from WorldView-2 and Sentinel-2 over different sea ice topographies to show that smooth ponds are highly reflective and can saturate the ICESat-2 photon detection system. Rougher ponds have a more varied backscatter signal, and in some cases both the water and underlying ice surfaces are visible in photon height distributions.

Despite an exponential increase in the amount of data on plastic in the five existing ocean gyres, trends in the Arctic Ocean remain scarce, requiring innovative solutions to monitor the growing situation. The cost of ocean plastic pollution on land and in the ocean is estimated in the trillions impacting fisheries, marine mammals, businesses, and air quality, to name a few. Although satellites have evolved immensely, there continue to be difficulties with optical resolution, ocean surface penetration and underwater communication. For the Arctic, the geophysical characteristics and presence of sea ice and cloud formations add a degree of complexity for researchers to detect and track microplastic calling for innovative solutions. This interdisciplinary team project paper investigates the use of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-6, Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, high altitude balloons, and autonomous underwater vehicles to provide an integrated strategy for tracking marine plastic pollution while recognizing that it is necessary to also prevent plastics from entering the ocean in the first place. After replicating Biermann et al. study [1], a correlation was observed between the clustering of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Floating Debris Index allowing the potential to locate possible plastic debris accumulations in the Arctic Ocean faster than with the original study. Following our experiment, it was found that through the combined efforts of marine, air, and space technologies we can provide year-round monitoring of marine plastic pollution. The general cost of the operations was considered in tandem with an overview of the financial loss and societal burden of ocean plastic. Included in the paper are recommendations for future research to close identified knowledge gaps in marine plastic research and satellite technology.

The most prominent changes occur at northern latitudes such as our study area, which is Svalbard, located between 76°30′N and 80°50′N. A cloud-free time series of MODIS-NDVI data was processed. The dataset was interpolated to daily data during the 2000–2020 period with a 231.65 m pixel resolution. The onset of vegetation growth was mapped with a NDVI threshold method which corresponds well with a recent Sentinel-2 NDVI-based mapping of the onset of vegetation growth, which was in turn validated by a network of in-situ phenological data from time lapse cameras. The results show that the years 2000 and 2008 were extreme in terms of the late onset of vegetation growth. The year 2020 had the earliest onset of vegetation growth on Svalbard during the 21-year study. Each year since 2013 had an earlier or equally early timing in terms of the onset of the growth season compared with the 2000–2020 average.

The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016–2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km2 and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments. © 2022 by the authors.

Beavers are widely recognized as ecosystem engineers, but their effects on permafrost-dominated landscapes in the Arctic remain unclear. In this study, we document the occurrence, reconstruct the timing, and highlight the effects of beaver activity on a small creek valley confined by ice-rich permafrost on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska using multi-dimensional remote sensing analysis of satellite (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Planet CubeSat, and DigitalGlobe Inc./MAXAR) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) imagery. Beaver activity along the study reach of Swan Lake Creek appeared between 2006 and 2011 with the construction of three dams. Between 2011 and 2017, beaver dam numbers increased, with the peak occurring in 2017 (n = 9). Between 2017 and 2019, the number of dams decreased (n = 6), while the average length of the dams increased from 20 to 33 m. Between 4 and 20 August 2019, following a nine-day period of record rainfall (>125 mm), the well-established dam system failed, triggering the formation of a beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature. During the decade of beaver occupation between 2011 and 2021, the creek valley widened from 33 to 180 m (~450% increase) and the length of the stream channel network increased from ~0.6 km to more than 1.9 km (220% increase) as a result of beaver engineering and beaver-induced permafrost degradation. Comparing vegetation (NDVI) and snow (NDSI) derived indices from Sentinel-2 time-series data acquired between 2017 and 2021 for the beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature and a nearby unaffected control site, showed that peak growing season NDVI was lowered by 23% and that it extended the length of the snow-cover period by 19 days following the permafrost disturbance. Our analysis of multi-dimensional remote sensing data highlights several unique aspects of beaver engineering impacts on ice-rich permafrost landscapes. Our detailed reconstruction of the beaver-induced permafrost degradation event may also prove useful for identifying degradation of ice-rich permafrost in optical time-series datasets across regional scales. Future field-and remote sensing-based observations of this site, and others like it, will provide valuable information for the NSF-funded Arctic Beaver Observation Network (A-BON) and the third phase of the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Field Campaign. © 2021 by the authors.

Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions. © 2022 American Geophysical Union.

A strong relationship between in situ GPP derived from stable oxygen isotopes (δ18O) and space-based lake color from satellites (e.g. Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and CubeSats) and airborne imagery (AVIRIS-NG) demonstrates the potential power of this technique for improving spatial and temporal monitoring of lake GPP when coupled with additional field validation measurements across different systems. In shallow waters clear enough for sunlight to reach lake bottoms, both submerged vegetation (macrophytes and algae) and phytoplankton likely contribute to GPP. The stable isotopes and remotely sensed shallow lake color used here integrate both components. These results demonstrate the utility of lake color as a feasible means for mapping lake GPP from remote sensing. This novel methodology estimates GPP from remote sensing in shallow lakes by combining field measurements of oxygen isotopes with airborne, satellite and CubeSat imagery. This use of lake color for providing insight into ecological processes of shallow lakes is recommended, especially for remote arctic and boreal landscapes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Due to the different spectral properties of open water, melt pond and sea ice, the melt pond fraction (MPF) can be retrieved using a fully constrained least-squares algorithm, which shows a high accuracy with root mean square error ~0.06 based on the validation experiment using WorldView-2 image. In this study, the evolution of ponds on first-year and multiyear ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago was compared based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images. The relationships of pond coverage with air temperature and albedo were analysed. The results show that the pond coverage on first-year ice changed dramatically with seasonal maximum of 54%, whereas that on multiyear ice changed relatively flat with only 30% during the entire melting period. During the stage of pond formation, the ponds expanded rapidly when the temperature increased to over 0°C for three consecutive days. Sea-ice albedo shows a significantly negative correlation (R =-1) with the MPF in melt season and increases gradually with the refreezing of ponds and sea ice.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

One component of the Earth system where large uncertainties remain are Arctic and boreal freshwater lakes. With only short periods of open water due to annual ice cover, lake productivity in these regions is extremely sensitive to warming induced changes in ice cover. At the same time, productivity dynamics in these lakes vary enormously, even over short distances, making it difficult to understand these potential changes. A major impediment to an improved understanding of lake dynamics has been sparsely distributed field measurements, in large part due to the complexity and expense of conducting scientific research in remote northern latitudes. This project overcomes that hurdle by using a new set of ‘eyes in the sky’, the Planet Labs CubeSat fleet, to observe 35 lakes across 3 different arctic-boreal ecoregions in western North America. We extract time series of lake reflectance to identify ice-out and green-up across three years (2017–2019). We find that lakes with later ice-out have significantly faster green-ups. Our results also show ice-out varies latitudinally by 38 days from south to north, but only varies across years by ~9 days. In contrast, green-up varied between years by 22 days in addition to showing significant spatial variability. We compare PlanetScope to Sentinel-2 data and independently validate our ice-out estimates, finding an ice-out mean absolute difference (MAD) ~9 days. This study demonstrates the potential of using CubeSat imagery to monitor the timing and magnitude of ice-off and green-up at high spatiotemporal resolution. © 2021 by the authors.

CubeSat constellations, however, can provide global data at high spatial and temporal resolutions, albeit with reduced spectral information. This study provides a first assessment of using CubeSat data for river discharge estimation in both gauged and ungauged settings. Discharge was estimated for 11 Arctic rivers with sizes ranging from 16 to >1,000 m wide using the Bayesian at-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning algorithm (BAM). BAM-at-many-stations hydraulic geometry solves for hydraulic geometry parameters to estimate flow and requires only river widths as input. Widths were retrieved from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data sets and a CubeSat (the Planet company) data set, as well as their fusions. Results show satellite data fusion improves discharge estimation for both large (>100 m wide) and medium (40–100 m wide) rivers by increasing the number of days with a discharge estimation by a factor of 2–6 without reducing accuracy. Narrow rivers (<40 m wide) are too small for Landsat and Sentinel-2 data sets, and their discharge is also not well estimated using CubeSat data alone, likely because the four-band sensor cannot resolve water surfaces accurately enough. BAM technique outperforms space-based rating curves when gauge data are available, and its accuracy is acceptable when no gauge data are present (instead relying on global reanalysis for discharge priors). Ultimately, we conclude that the data fusion presented here is a viable approach toward improving discharge estimates in the Arctic, even in ungauged basins. © 2019. American Geophysical Union.

Numerous supraglacial streams flowing directly over the NW GrIS surface drain a large lobe of grounded ice at Inglefield Land, into the proglacial Minturn River and the Nares Strait. Owing to the absence of moulins and crevasses, this continuous supraglacial-proglacial drainage system regulates the evacuation of surface meltwater from the ice sheet to the ocean. We examine this Inglefield Land coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system during the 2016–2019 melt seasons (July to August), using 137 Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 visible/near-infrared satellite images. Two surface water metrics (supraglacial meltwater area fraction Am and proglacial river effective width We) are used to track spatio-temporal variations of surface meltwater moving through this drainage system. Satellite-derived Am and We are also compared with daily surface runoff simulations from the MAR v3.11 and MERRA-2 climate/SMB models, to estimate meltwater routing lag times and assess model performance. Satellite-derived Am and We are highly correlated (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01), indicating that the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system evacuates meltwater directly from the ice surface to the ocean with negligible subglacial storage or delays. Both remotely sensed metrics are positively correlated with modeled runoff, especially MAR (r2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for Am and We, vs. 0.66 and 0.64 for MERRA-2). Lagged MAR runoff (2 days, r2 = 0.87 and 0.82) match both metrics better than simultaneous MAR runoff and the optimal time lag for both metrics are 2 d. We conclude that 1) unlike the southwest GrIS, the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system at Inglefield Land routes surface meltwater runoff directly off the ice surface to the proglacial zone, with virtually no subglacial capture of runoff by moulins; 2) most of the ∼2 d transit time occurs on the ice surface rather than in the proglacial zone; and 3) multi-temporal satellite imaging facilitates holistic, source-to-sink tracking of NW GrIS meltwater from the ice surface to the global ocean. © 2021 The Author(s)","Arctic; Greenland; Inglefield Land; drainage network; glacial hydrology; ice sheet; Landsat; mass balance; meltwater; proglacial environment; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis","Greenland runoff; Proglacial river; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial river; Surface mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122512966"

While the availability of N to deciduous tundra plants in part relies on their internal reallocation of N from leaves to stems and roots during autumn senescence, the species-specific importance of reallocation timing and its community-wide implications on landscape- and regional-scales remains not well known. Here, we quantified leaf N contents and C:N ratios of four widespread shrub species in West Greenland from June through October and compared plot observations to landscape scale based on a new Sentinel-2-derived index. Our Sentinel-2 index captures overall N reallocation trends well across time and space at the plot level (R2 = 0.81, p < 0.001). Using this novel approach is therefore relevant for upscaling of current and future changes in plant C:N dynamics. Using satellite data, we estimate the leaf N mass reallocated during senescence equaled about 0.8 g N m−2 from leaves to stems and roots. We conclude that (1) in-situ data from the entire growing season is critical to quantify timing and contrasting strategies of N allocation at species level, (2) key species such as Salix glauca are capable of halving their leaf N content during senescence, (3) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite data is a strong candidate for quantifying these plant functional dynamics in space and time. Our study has implications for research on competition among Arctic plants, litter decomposition and consequently carbon accumulation in tundra soils from a climate change perspective. Further, it captures plant functional dynamics during critical parts of the growing season, including autumn senescence which is generally more complex than capturing spring greenup. Lastly, our new index has important implications for remotely mapping temporal and spatial variation in substrate quality for both wild and domesticated herbivores, as it is a first step towards a tool to assess the tundra vegetation and fodder quality for cold region animal husbandry. © 2021","Arctic; Greenland; West Greenland; Salix glauca; Animals; Climate change; Dynamics; Timing circuits; Vegetation; Arctic terrestrial ecosystems; Arctic tundra; Growing season; Landscape scale; N content; N cycles; Nitrogen dynamics; Satellite data; Tundra vegetation; Upscaling; carbon; climate change; cold region; growing season; nitrogen; remote sensing; satellite data; senescence; Sentinel; spatial variation; upscaling; Landforms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106893291"

We test in the current study whether we can map the spatial patterns of spider alpha and beta diversity using remotely-sensed surface reflectance and topography in a heterogeneous alpine environment in Central Norway. This proof-of-concept study may provide a tool for an assessment of arthropod communities in remote study areas. Data on arthropod species distribution and richness were collected through pitfall trapping and subjected to a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to extract the main species composition gradients. The DCA axis scores as indicators of species composition as well as trap species richness were regressed against a combined data set of surface reflectance as measured by the Sentinel-2 satellite and topographical parameters extracted from a digital elevation model. The models were subsequently applied to the spatial data set to achieve a pixel-wise prediction of both species richness and position in the DCA space. The spatial variation in the modelled DCA scores was used to draw conclusions regarding spider beta-diversity. The species composition was described with two DCA axes that were characterized by post hoc-defined indicator species, which showed a typical annidation in the arctic-alpine environment under study. The fits of the regression models for the DCA axes and species richness ranged from R2 = 0.25 up to R2 = 0.62. The resulting maps show strong gradients in alpha and beta diversity across the study area. Our results indicate that the diversity patterns of spiders can at least partially be explained by means of remotely sensed data.

Although long-record optical satellites, such as Landsat missions, provide sub-monthly observations at fairly fine spatial resolution, cloud contamination often poses a major challenge for producing temporally continuous time series. We here proposed a novel method to improve the temporal frequency of usable Landsat observations for mapping lakes and reservoirs, by effectively recovering inundation areas from contaminated images. This method automated three primary steps on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. It first leveraged multiple spectral indices to optimize water mapping from archival Landsat images acquired since 1992. Errors induced by minor contaminations were next corrected by the topology of isobaths extracted from nearly cloud-free images. The isobaths were then used to recover water areas under major contaminations through an efficient vector-based interpolation. We validated this method on 428 lakes/reservoirs worldwide that range from ~2 km2 to ~82,000 km2 with time-variable levels measured by satellite altimeters. The recovered water areas show a relative root-mean-squared error of 2.2%, and the errors for over 95% of the lakes/reservoirs below 6.0%. The produced area time series, combining those from cloud-free images and recovered from contaminated images, exhibit strong correlations with altimetry levels (Spearman's rho mostly ~0.8 or larger) and extended the hypsometric (area-level) ranges revealed by cloud-free images alone. The combined time series also improved the monthly coverage by an average of 43%, resulting in a bi-monthly water area record during the satellite altimetry era thus far (1992–2018). The robustness of this method was further verified under five challenging mapping scenarios, including fluvial lakes in humid basins, reservoirs with complex shape geometries, saline lakes with high mineral concentrations, lakes/reservoirs in mountainous regions, and pan-Arctic lakes with frequent snow/ice covers. Given such performance and a generic nature of this method, we foresee its potential applications to assisting water area recovery for other optical and SAR sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 and SWOT), and to estimating lake/reservoir storage variations in conjunction with altimetry sensors. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aneroid altimeters; Contamination; Continuous time systems; Errors; Floods; Image enhancement; Lake pollution; Lakes; Mean square error; Petroleum reservoirs; Photomapping; Recovery; Reservoirs (water); Satellites; Time series; Annual variations; Cloud based platforms; Contaminated images; High frequency time series; Lake sand reservoirs; LANDSAT; Long term change; Root mean squared errors; altimeter; annual variation; climate change; Landsat; long-term change; reservoir; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; satellite mission; satellite sensor; spatial resolution; surface water; synthetic aperture radar; time series; Surface water resources","Area time series; Contaminated images; Global surface water; Intra-annual variation; Lakes; Landsat; Long-term changes; Reservoirs","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069920213"

Due to the coarse spatial and temporal resolution of available satellite data, previous studies mainly focused on lake-scale investigations of melting/freezing, hindering the detection of subtle patterns within heterogeneous landscapes. To fill this knowledge gap, we developed a new approach for fine-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic lake ice-off phenology. Using the Scene Classification Layer data derived from dense Sentinel-2 time series images, we estimated the pixel-by-pixel ice break-up end date information by seeking the transition time point when the pixel is completely free of ice. Applying this approach on the Google Earth Engine platform, we mapped the spatial distribution of the break-up end date for 45,532 lakes across the entire Arctic (except for Greenland) for the year 2019. The evaluation results suggested that our estimations matched well with both in situ measurements and an existing lake ice phenology product. Based on the generated map, we estimated that the average break-up end time of Pan-Arctic lakes is 172 ± 13.4 (measured in day of year) for the year 2019. The mapped lake ice-off phenology exhibits a latitudinal gradient, with a linear slope of 1.02 days per degree from 55◦N onward. We also demonstrated the importance of lake and landscape characteristics in affecting spring lake ice melting. The proposed approach offers new possibilities for monitoring the seasonal Arctic lake ice freeze–thaw cycle, benefiting the ongoing efforts of combating and adapting to climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

Satellite imagery, in particular Sentinel-2 (S2), may enable large-scale monitoring of coastal areas in Greenland but its use is impacted by the optically complex environments and the scarcity of supporting data in the region. Additionally, the canopies of the dominant macrophyte species in Greenland do not extend to the sea surface, limiting the use of indices that exploit the reflection of near-infrared radiation by vegetation due to its absorption by seawater. Three hypotheses are tested: I) 10-m S2 imagery and commonly used detection methods can identify intertidal macrophytes that are exposed at low tide in an optically complex fjord system in Greenland impacted by marine and land terminating glaciers; II) detached and floating macrophytes accumulate in patches that are sufficiently large to be detected by 10-m S2 images; III) iceberg scour and/or turbid meltwater runoff shape the spatial distribution of intertidal macroalgae in fjord systems with marine-terminating glaciers. The NDVI produced the best results in optically complex fjord systems in Greenland. 12 km2 of exposed intertidal macrophytes were identified in the study area at low tide. Floating mats of macrophytes ranged in area from 400 m2 to 326,800 m2 and were most common at the mouth of the fjord. Icebergs and turbidity appear to play a role in structuring the distribution of intertidal macrophytes and the retreat of marine terminating glaciers could allow macrophytes cover to expand. The challenges and solutions presented here apply to most fjords in Greenland and, therefore, the methodology may be extended to produce a Greenland-wide estimate of intertidal macrophytes. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic Regions; Estuaries; Greenland; Satellite Imagery; Seawater; Arctic; Greenland; Ecosystems; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Infrared reflection; Optical remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Surface waters; Vegetation mapping; sea water; Blue carbon; Coastal area; Complex environments; Green land; Large-scale monitoring; Macro-algae; Macrophytes; Remote-sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index; macroalga; macrophyte; mapping; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; vegetation index; Arctic; estuary; Greenland; satellite imagery; Carbon","Blue carbon; Greenland; Macroalgae; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Vegetation index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145666007"

NASA's ICESat-2 laser altimeter brings a new capability: photons penetrate water and are reflected from both the water and the underlying ice; the difference provides a depth estimate. ICESat-2 sampled Amery Ice Shelf on January 2, 2019 and showed double returns from surface depressions, indicating meltwater. For four melt features, we compared depth estimates from eight algorithms: six based on ICESat-2 and two from coincident Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. All algorithms successfully identified surface water at the same locations. Algorithms based on ICESat-2 produced the most accurate depths; the image-based algorithms underestimated depths (by 30%–70%). This implies that ICESat-2 depths can be used to tune image-based algorithms, moving us closer to quantifying stored meltwater volumes across Antarctica and Greenland. © 2020.

It strongly modulates the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon balance. Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential snow variable that can be retrieved from multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, we evaluate fSCA retrievals from multiple sensors that are currently in polar orbit: the operational land imager (OLI) on-board Landsat 8, the multispectral instrument (MSI) on-board the Sentinel-2 satellites, and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Terra and Aqua. We consider several retrieval algorithms that fall into three classes: thresholding of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), regression on the NDSI, and spectral unmixing. We conduct the evaluation at a high-Arctic site in Svalbard, Norway, by comparing satellite retrieved fSCA to coincident high-resolution snow-cover maps obtained from a terrestrial automatic camera system. For the lower resolution MODIS retrievals, the regression-based retrievals outperformed the unmixing-based retrievals for all metrics but the bias. For the higher resolution sensors (OLI and MSI), retrievals based on NDSI thresholding overestimated the fSCA due to the mixed pixel problem whereas spectral unmixing retrievals provided the most reliable estimates across the board. We therefore encourage the operationalization of spectral unmixing retrievals of fSCA from both OLI and MSI. © 2019","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Orbits; Photography; Pixels; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Fractional snow covers; LANDSAT; Mixed pixel; MODIS; NDSI; Optical; Sentinel-2; Unmixing; aerial photography; Aqua (satellite); image resolution; Landsat thematic mapper; MODIS; satellite imagery; Sentinel; snow cover; Terra (satellite); Snow","Fractional snow-cover; Landsat 8; Mixed pixel; MODIS; NDSI; Optical; Photography; Sentinel-2; Unmixing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078130097"

The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as “standard” or as “test” quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as “standard” at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution. © 2021 The Author(s)","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Image acquisition; Infrared devices; Rock mechanics; Constellation; Cubesats; Global coverage; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observation; Overpass time; Planetscope; Revisit interval; Temporal availability; Three sensors; global change; ground control; histogram; image analysis; Landsat; near infrared; satellite constellation; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; temporal variation; Orbits","Cloud; Constellation; CubeSats; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observations; Overpass time; PlanetScope; Revisit interval","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109568001"

However, these hydrologic features remain poorly studied mainly because they are too narrow (typically <30 m) to be reliably delineated in conventional moderate-resolution satellite images (e.g., 30 m Landsat-8 imagery). This study demonstrates the utility of 10 m Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument images to map supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap, covering a total area of ∼10,000 km2. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 both capture overall supraglacial drainage patterns, but Sentinel-2 images are superior to Landsat-8 images for delineating narrow and continuous supraglacial rivers. Sentinel-2 mapping across the three study areas reveals a variety of supraglacial drainage patterns. In northwest Greenland near Inglefield Land, subparallel supraglacial rivers up to 55 km long drain meltwater directly off the ice sheet onto the proglacial zone. On the Devon and the Barnes ice caps, shorter supraglacial rivers (up to 15–30 km long) are commonly interrupted by moulins, which drain internally drained catchments on the ice surface to subglacial systems. We conclude that Sentinel-2 offers strong potential for investigating supraglacial meltwater drainage patterns and improving our understanding of the hydrological conditions of ice masses globally. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Barnes Ice Cap; Canada; Canada; Devon Ice Cap; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Nunavut; catchment; glacial hydrology; image analysis; Landsat; meltwater; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Greenland Ice Sheet; Landsat-8; River remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial River; Surface hydrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062844448"

In this study we use TanDEM-X-derived (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement; synthetic-aperture radar) digital elevation models to document an approximately 43-fold increase in thaw slumping and concomitant 28-fold increase in carbon mobilization on the northern Taymyr Peninsula from 2010 to 2021. The available observations allowed us to compare two time periods, from 2010/11 to 2016/17 and from 2017/18 to 2020/21, and contrast retrogressive thaw slump (RTS) activity between these periods. We find that all quantities describing RTS activity increased in the observed period. The total volumetric change per year increased from about 0.17×106 to 7.4×106 m3 yr-1, a 43-fold increase. The observed surge in RTS activity is mainly driven by the initiation of new RTS, indicated by the 17-fold increase in active RTS numbers from 82 to 1404 and the relatively low average volumetric change rate per RTS increase of 2.3. In annual Sentinel-2 imagery, the number of detected RTSs in a subregion increased 10-fold in 2020. This coincides with a severe heatwave that occurred in northern Siberia in 2020. The area-to-volume scaling of the RTSs varied only slightly over time, despite the 2020 heatwave, indicating a robustness of the relationship to such an event. To estimate the slump-mobilized organic carbon, we intersected the elevation changes with a soil organic carbon (SOC) map, with contrasting assumptions about the deep carbon pool and massive-ice content. We estimated that the SOC mobilization rate increases 28-fold. The normalization of the SOC mobilization rate to our study region yields values of 11 gCyr-1 m-2 with a confidence interval of 5 to 38 gCyr-1 m-2. A comparison to an independent estimate of the net ecosystem exchange of 4.1±13.0 gCyr-1 m-2 illustrates the importance of RTS activity to the carbon cycle. These results underscore that mass wasting is an important but commonly neglected component of the Arctic carbon cycle and particularly sensitive to extreme events.

However, the merging of data products from multisensors is often adversely affected by the difference in their spectral characteristics. In addition, the errors in the atmospheric correction (AC) methods further increase the inconsistencies in downstream products. This work proposes an improved spectral harmonization method for OLI and MSI-derived remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) products, which significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. We compared Rrs retrieved via state-of-the-art AC processors, i.e., Acolite, C2RCC, and Polymer, against ship-based in situ Rrs observations obtained from the Barents Sea waters, including a wide range of optical properties. Results suggest that the Acolite-derived Rrs has a minimum bias for our study area with median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) varying from 9% to 25% in the blue-green bands. To spectrally merge OLI and MSI, we develop and apply a new machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model to near-simultaneous OLI and MSI images acquired in the years from 2018 to 2020.

Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has long been used to map wetlands due to its sensitivity to surface inundation and ability to penetrate clouds, darkness, and certain vegetation canopies. Here, we track boreal wetland inundation by developing a two-step modified decision-tree algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) time-series data as inputs. This approach incorporates temporal as well as spatial characteristics of SAR backscatter and is evaluated for the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta (PAD), and Yukon Flats, Alaska (YF) from May 2017 to October 2019. Within these two boreal study areas, we map spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation classes of Open Water (OW), Floating Plants (FP), Emergent Plants (EP), and Flooded Vegetation (FV). Temporal variability, frequency, and maximum extents of transient wetland inundation are quantified. Retrieved inundation estimates are compared with in-situ field mapping obtained during the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a multi-temporal Landsat-derived surface water map. Over the 2017–2019 study period, we find that fractional inundation area ranged from 18.0% to 19.0% in the PAD, and from 10.7% to 12.1% in the YF. Transient wetland inundation covered ~595 km2 of the PAD, comprising ~9.1% of its landscape, and ~102 km2 of the YF, comprising ~3.6%. The implications of these findings for wetland function monitoring, and estimating landscape-scale methane emissions are discussed, together with limitations and uncertainties of our approach. We conclude that time series of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter, screened with Sentinel-2 MSI optical imagery and validated by field measurements, offer a valuable tool for tracking transient boreal wetland inundation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Lower-albedo snow and ice surfaces therefore warm more quickly. There is a major difference in the albedo of snow-covered versus bare-ice surfaces, but observations also show that there is substantial spatio-temporal variability of up to ~ 0.4 in bare-ice albedo. Variability in bare-ice albedo has been attributed to a number of processes including the accumulation of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) and the changing physical properties of the nearsurface ice. However, the combined impact of these processes upon albedo remains poorly constrained. Here we use field observations to show that pigmented glacier algae are ubiquitous and cause surface darkening both within and outside the south-west GrIS ""dark zone"" but that other factors including modification of the ice surface by algal bloom presence, surface topography and weathering crust state are also important in determining patterns of daily albedo variability. We further use observations from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to examine the scale gap in albedo between ground versus remotely sensed measurements made by Sentinel-2 (S-2) and MODIS. S-2 observations provide a highly conservative estimate of algal bloom presence because algal blooms occur in patches much smaller than the ground resolution of S-2 data. Nevertheless, the bare-ice albedo distribution at the scale of 20m×20m S-2 pixels is generally unimodal and unskewed. Conversely, bare-ice surfaces have a left-skewed albedo distribution at MODIS MOD10A1 scales. Thus, when MOD10A1 observations are used as input to energy balance modelling, meltwater production can be underestimated by ~ 2 %. Our study highlights that (1) the impact of the weathering crust state is of similar importance to the direct darkening role of light-absorbing impurities upon ice albedo and (2) there is a spatial-scale dependency in albedo measurement which reduces detection of real changes at coarser resolutions. © 2020 E.

This evaluation aims to confirm that the innovative design of the mission’s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) meets the expectations of intended users. In this study, we provide an overview of initial results obtained for three high-priority applications; flood mapping, sea ice analysis, and wetland classification. In our study, the focus is on results obtained using not only linear polarization, but also the adopted Compact Polarimetric (CP) architecture in RCM. Our study shows a promising level of agreement between RCM and RADARSAT-2 performance in flood mapping using dual-polarized HH-HV SAR data over Red River, Manitoba, suggesting smooth continuity between the two satellite missions for operational flood mapping. Visual analysis of coincident RCM CP and RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized HH-HV SAR imagery over the Resolute Passage, Canadian Central Arctic, highlighted an improved contrast between sea ice classes in dry ice winter conditions. A statistical analysis using selected sea ice samples confirmed the increased contrast between thin and both rough and deformed ice in CP SAR. This finding is expected to enhance Canadian Ice Service’s (CIS) operational visual analysis of sea ice in RCM SAR imagery for ice chart production. Object-oriented classification of a wetland area in Newfoundland and Labrador by fusion of RCM dual-polarized VV-VH data and Sentinel-2 optical imagery revealed promising classification results, with an overall accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.87.

High‑resolution satellite data were obtained in the visible spectral range from the non‑commercial satellites Sentinel‑2 (spatial resolution 10 m) and Landsat‑8 (spatial resolution 15 m). Data collec‑ tion was carried out under conditions when the natural illumination in the Arctic was sufficient (March–September) to make pictures in the visible spectral range. About 100 satellite images were analyzed for each year of the above period. The technique used for the iceberg detection is based on statistical criteria for finding the gradient zones in the analysis of two‑dimensional fields of satellite images. The generation of the iceberg from a particular glacier was verified by using a form template of the detected iceberg taking into consideration the following parameters of the object: the geometrical shape, dimensions, specific features of «picture» of the ice surface (presence and orienta‑ tion of cracks, peaks, and lakelets of melt water). The iceberg height was determined by its shadow on the image. The calculated total annual volume of icebergs from the outlet glaciers was estimated 1.52–1.9 km3. According to satel‑ lite data, the annual area reduction of the Northern Land outlet glaciers averaged 13 km2. The greatest contribution is made by 12 outlet glaciers located on the Komsomolets and the October Revolution islands. Of these, six are from the Academy of Sciences ice dome, four – the glaciers of the Matusevich Fjord, the Vavilov Glacier and the Rusanov dome glacier № 12. Icebergs of maximum height (30–40 m) are produced by glaciers of the North‑Eastern slope of the Academy of Sciences ice dome and glacier № 12 of the Rusanov dome. In general, according to satellite data of recent years, generation of icebergs from the outlet glaciers of the Northern Land shows a steady growth trend. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

Information on the amount and distribution of CCC helps to assess and report biodiversity indicators related to ecosystem processes and functional aspects. Therefore, measuring CCC continuously and globally from earth observation data is critical to monitor the status of the biosphere. However, generic and robust methods for regional and global mapping of CCC are not well defined. This study aimed at examining the spatiotemporal consistency and scalability of selected methods for CCC mapping across biomes. Four methods (i.e., radiative transfer models (RTMs) inversion using a look-up table (LUT), the biophysical processor approach integrated into the Sentinel application platform (SNAP toolbox), simple ratio vegetation index (SRVI), and partial least square regression (PLSR) were evaluated. Similarities and differences among CCC products generated by applying the four methods on actual Sentinel-2 data in four biomes (temperate forest, tropical forest, wetland, and Arctic tundra) were examined by computing statistical measures and spatiotemporal consistency pairwise comparisons. Pairwise comparison of CCC predictions by the selected methods demonstrated strong agreement. The highest correlation (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.4371 g/m2) was obtained between CCC predictions of PROSAIL inversion by LUT and SNAP toolbox approach in a wetland when a single Sentinel-2 image was used. However, when time-series data were used, it was PROSAIL inversion against SRVI (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.19) that showed greatest similarity to the single date predictions (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.17 g/m2) in this biome. Generally, the CCC products obtained using the SNAP toolbox approach resulted in a systematic over/under-estimation of CCC. RTMs inversion by LUT (INFORM and PROSAIL) resulted in a non-biased, spatiotemporally consistent prediction of CCC with a range closer to expectations. Therefore, the RTM inversion using LUT approaches particularly, INFORM for 'forest' and PROSAIL for 'short vegetation' ecosystems, are recommended for CCC mapping from Sentinel-2 data for worldwide mapping of CCC. Additional validation of the two RTMs with field data of CCC across biomes is required in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Forestry; Mapping; Radiative transfer; Table lookup; Vegetation; Wetlands; Biodiversity indicators; Canopy chlorophyll contents (CCC); Earth observation data; Partial least square regression; Radiative transfer model; Ratio vegetation indices; Spatio-temporal consistencies; Terrestrial ecosystems; Least squares approximations","Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC); INFORM; PLSR; PROSAIL; Sentinel-2; SNAP toolbox; SRVI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086475350"

These changes are most noticeable on small Arctic islands, once surrounded by thick ice fields but increasingly exposed to open water, thus making them of special interest. During the unique complex expedition ""Open Ocean: Archipelagoes of the Arctic. Severnaya Zemlya-2019"" on the Professor Molchanov research vessel in August-September 2019 full-scale field surveys of the islands and unmanned surveys from quadcopters were conducted. Subsequent surveys based on remote sensing data are intended to combine detailed field surveys with an overview coverage of these islands. Different nature of the islands requires applying different methods of studying their dynamics with remote sensing data. Changes in the islands' coastline are traced using a set of different time sources, i. e. the 1957 topographic map (1:200 000) and space images from Landsat 5, 7 satellites. The current situation is described according to cloud-free images from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellites. Multiple interferometric images of Sentinel-IB (IW - Interferometric Wide Swath) radar system processing level SLC - Single Look Complex for 2019 supported a study of the seasonal dynamics of the Vize Island surface. The multiyear dynamics of ice edge retreat was revealed for the Ushakov Island. The retreat rate analysis proved the accelerated decrease of the ice cap area since the 2010-s. We accessed the influence of changing climatic conditions on the coastline dynamics of the Vize and Ushakov islands with due account of the wind speed and direction and the air temperature. Uneven coastal erosion is characteristic of the Vize Island, and the areas with the highest rate of coastline retreat were identified, as well as new accumulative forms, e. g. bars. Multitemporal composites with coherence obtained from the radar data made it possible to characterize the seasonal dynamics of the state of the Vize island surface and its dependence on variable weather conditions. The results of research show an obvious response of the small islands' coastlines to the climate changes of the 20th - 21st centuries. © 2022 Moskovskij Universitet.

Here, we tested the correspondence among satellite- and drone-derived seasonal change in tundra greenness to identify optimal spatial scales for vegetation monitoring on Qikiqtaruk - Herschel Island in the Yukon Territory, Canada. We combined time-series of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from multispectral drone imagery and satellite data (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and MODIS) with ground-based observations for two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found high cross-season correspondence in plot mean greenness (drone-satellite Spearman's ρ 0.67-0.87) and pixel-by-pixel greenness (drone-satellite R 2 0.58-0.69) for eight one-hectare plots, with drones capturing lower NDVI values relative to the satellites. We identified a plateau in the spatial variation of tundra greenness at distances of around half a metre in the plots, suggesting that these grain sizes are optimal for monitoring such variation in the two most common vegetation types on the island. We further observed a notable loss of seasonal variation in the spatial heterogeneity of landscape greenness (46.2%-63.9%) when aggregating from ultra-fine-grain drone pixels (approx. 0.05 m) to the size of medium-grain satellite pixels (10-30 m). Finally, seasonal changes in drone-derived greenness were highly correlated with measurements of leaf-growth in the ground-validation plots (mean Spearman's ρ 0.70). These findings indicate that multispectral drone measurements can capture temporal plant growth dynamics across tundra landscapes. Overall, our results demonstrate that novel technologies such as drone platforms and compact multispectral sensors allow us to study ecological systems at previously inaccessible scales and fill gaps in our understanding of tundra ecosystem processes. Capturing fine-scale variation across tundra landscapes will improve predictions of the ecological impacts and climate feedbacks of environmental change in the Arctic.  © 2020 The Author(s).

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset.

These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area ~ 3 × 104 km2) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (~7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (~400 m) to high elevations (~1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32–45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84–96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800–1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400–800 m) elevation bands, and the 800–1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Climate models; Flow velocity; Glaciers; Ice; Lakes; Runoff; Area fraction; Flow regimes; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Rivers and lakes; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface meltwater; Surface runoffs; climate modeling; correlation; flow control; flow velocity; ice flow; ice sheet; melting; meltwater; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; temporal analysis; water depth; Rivers","Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface runoff","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111800258"

Results demonstrate the capability of both airborne and spaceborne data to provide large-scale reconnaissance mapping of geologic materials over vast arctic regions where field access is limited. The distributions of three ultramafic units (dunite, peridotite, pyroxenite) and one mafic unit (gabbro) are mapped based on analyzing specific visible and near-infrared and short-wave-infrared spectral features. The extent of peridotite and dunite units mapped using both approaches is consistent with geological map, whereas pyroxenite abundance maps show different patterns in their distribution as compared to the geological map. The results suggest that EnGeoMAP method has a better performance than ISMA method for mapping the dunite unit, whilst ISMA performs better for mapping peridotite and pyroxenite rocks. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

To optimize the exploration approach along with a cost-effective way, narrow down the target areas for a more detailed study for mineral exploration using suitable data selection and accurate data processing approaches are crucial. To establish optimum procedures by integrating space-borne remote sensing data with other earth sciences data (e.g., airborne magnetic and electromagnetic) for exploration of Iron Oxide Copper Gold (IOCG) mineralization is the objective of this study. Further, the project focus is to test the effectiveness of Copernicus Sentinel-2 data in mineral potential mapping from the high Arctic region. Thus, Inglefield Land from northwest Greenland has been chosen as a study area to evaluate the developed approach. The altered minerals, including irons and clays, were mapped utilizing Sentinel-2 data through band ratio and principal component analysis (PCA) methods. Lineaments of the study area were extracted from Sentinel-2 data using directional filters. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were used for classification and analysing the available data. Further, various thematic maps (e.g., geological, geophysical, geochemical) were prepared from the study area. Finally, a mineral prospectively map was generated by integrating the above mentioned information using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP).

For sea ice applications, successfully discriminating returns between sea ice and open water is key for accurately determining freeboard (the extension of sea ice above local sea level) and new information regarding the geometry of sea ice floes and leads. We take advantage of near-coincident optical imagery obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite over the Western Weddell Sea of the Southern Ocean in March 2019 and the Lincoln Sea of the Arctic Ocean in May 2019 to evaluate the surface classification scheme in the ICESat-2 ATL07 and ATL10 sea ice products. We find a high level of agreement between the ATL07 (specular) lead classification and visible leads in the S-2 imagery in these two coincident images across all six ICESat-2 beams, increasing our confidence in the freeboard products and deriving new estimates of the sea ice state. The S-2 overlays provide additional, albeit limited, evidence of the misclassification of dark leads due to clouds. Dark leads are no longer used to derive sea surface and thus freeboard as of the third release (r003) of the ICESat-2 sea ice products. We show estimates of lead fraction and more preliminary estimates of chord length (a proxy for floe size) using two metrics for classifying sea surface (lead) segments across both the Arctic and Southern Ocean for the first winter season of data collection. © 2021.

The manual methods traditionally used to monitor change in satellite imagery of marine-terminating outlet glaciers are time-consuming and can be subjective, especially where mélange exists at the terminus. Recent advances in deep learning applied to image processing have created a new frontier in the field of automated delineation of glacier calving fronts. However, there remains a paucity of research on the use of deep learning for pixel-level semantic image classification of outlet glacier environments. Here, we apply and test a two-phase deep learning approach based on a well-established convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated classification of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The novel workflow, termed CNN-Supervised Classification (CSC) is adapted to produce multi-class outputs for unseen test imagery of glacial environments containing marine-terminating outlet glaciers in Greenland. Different CNN input parameters and training techniques are tested, with overall F1 scores for resulting classifications reaching up to 94% for in-sample test data (Helheim Glacier) and 96% for out-of-sample test data (Jakobshavn Isbrae and Store Glacier), establishing a state of the art in classification of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland. Predicted calving fronts derived using optimal CSC input parameters have a mean deviation of 56.17m (5.6px) and median deviation of 24.7m (2.5px) from manually digitised fronts. This demonstrates the transferability and robustness of the deep learning workflow despite complex and seasonally variable imagery. Future research could focus on the integration of deep learning classification workflows with free cloud-based platforms, to efficiently classify imagery and produce datasets for a range of glacial applications without the need for substantial prior experience in coding or deep learning.  © Copyright: Authors 2021","Arctic; Greenland; Varanidae; glacier dynamics; image classification; machine learning; marine environment; numerical method","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118747930"

A range of application studies has been reviewed, including up-scaling of carbon fluxes and pools, permafrost feature mapping and transition monitoring. Early land cover mapping studies were driven by the demand to characterize wildlife habitats. Later, in the 1990s, up-scaling of in situ measurements became central to the discipline of land cover mapping on local to regional scales at several sites across the Arctic. This includes the Kuparuk basin in Alaska, the Usa basin and the Lena Delta in Russia. All of these multi-purpose land cover maps have been derived from Landsat data. High resolution maps (from optical satellite data) serve frequently as input for the characterization of periglacial features and also flux tower footprints in recent studies. The most used map to address circumpolar issues is the CAVM (Circum Arctic Vegetation Map) based on AVHRR (1 km) and has been manually derived. It provides the required thematic detail for many applications, but is confined to areas north of the treeline, and it is limited in spatial detail. A higher spatial resolution circumpolar land cover map with sufficient thematic content would be beneficial for a range of applications. Such a land cover classification should be compatible with existing global maps and applicable for multiple purposes. The thematic content of existing global maps has been assessed by comparison to the CAVM and regional maps. None of the maps provides the required thematic detail. Spatial resolution has been compared to used classes for local to regional applications. The required thematic detail increases with spatial resolution since coarser datasets are usually applied over larger areas covering more relevant landscape units. This is especially of concern when the entire Arctic is addressed. A spatial resolution around 30 m has been shown to be suitable for a range of applications. This implies that the current Landsat-8, as well as Sentinel-2 missions would be adequate as input data. Recent studies have exemplified the value of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in tundra regions. SAR missions may be therefore of added value for large-scale high latitude land cover mapping. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon; Classification (of information); Forestry; Image resolution; Mapping; Permafrost; Radar; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Application studies; High resolution maps; In-situ measurement; Land cover; Land cover classification; Optical; Optical satellites; Tundra; Space-based radar","Classification; Land cover; Optical; Radar; Tundra","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002929569"

Russia is a country where human-induced fires are widespread and form distinctive spring and summer burning cycles. However, spring fires are not well documented and it is unclear which land-cover types are associated with the spread of spring fires. Using Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery, a wall-to-wall spring burned area data set for 1 January to 15 May 2020 was created for Russia (excluding the Arctic) using a participatory crowdsourcing digitizing approach on an online platform developed specifically for this application. The 2020 spring fire product had a producer accuracy of 85% and user accuracy of 92%. Approximately 13.38 million ha, comprising 1.8% of the study area, were mapped as burned, with the majority of the 2020 spring burned areas in Siberia. Our spring-fire product revealed five times more burned area estimates compared to the burned area estimates from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD64 product. We also found high variability of burned area per active fire pixel across regions of Russia, when compared to MODIS and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite active fire data. Spring fires started to increase from the end of February and reached their maximum by the end of March through the middle of April. Spring fires were associated with arable lands and grasslands as land-cover types, except Siberia, where spring fires were most common in deciduous and needle-leaved forests, followed by arable lands. While spring fires were associated with croplands and grasslands, an estimate for Central Russia showed approximately 75% of spring fires occurred on abandoned agricultural lands. Our study demonstrated the suitability of optical Sentinel-2 imagery for spring fire mapping and the great utility of a participatory mapping approach for fast and accurate mapping as well as engagement of the community. © 2021 The Author(s).

With the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, and the low sensitivity to atmospheric influences of Sentinel-1, a considerable quantity of ice floes is identified using a mathematical morphology method. Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity of segmented ice floes. It is tolerant to perturbations and deficiencies of floe shapes, which enhances the density of retrieved sea ice motion vectors. The PHD algorithm can be applied to sequential images from different sensors, and was tested on two combined image mosaics consisting of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data acquired over the Fram Strait; the PHD algorithm successfully produced pairs of matched ice floes. The matching result has been verified using shape and surface texture similarity of the ice floes. Moreover, the present method can naturally be extended to the problem of multi-source sea ice image registration. © 2021 by the authors.

We cover retrieval methods, precision and accuracy requirements, inverse and mass balance methods for inferring emissions, source detection thresholds, and observing system completeness. We classify satellite instruments as area flux mappers and point source imagers, with complementary attributes. Area flux mappers are high-precision (<1ĝ€¯%) instruments with 0.1-10ĝ€¯km pixel size designed to quantify total methane emissions on regional to global scales. Point source imagers are fine-pixel (<60ĝ€¯m) instruments designed to quantify individual point sources by imaging of the plumes. Current area flux mappers include GOSAT (2009-present), which provides a high-quality record for interpretation of long-term methane trends, and TROPOMI (2018-present), which provides global continuous daily mapping to quantify emissions on regional scales. These instruments already provide a powerful resource to quantify national methane emissions in support of the Paris Agreement. Current point source imagers include the GHGSat constellation and several hyperspectral and multispectral land imaging sensors (PRISMA, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8/9, WorldView-3), with detection thresholds in the 100-10ĝ€¯000ĝ€¯kgĝ€¯h-1 range that enable monitoring of large point sources. Future area flux mappers, including MethaneSAT, GOSAT-GW, Sentinel-5, GeoCarb, and CO2M, will increase the capability to quantify emissions at high resolution, and the MERLIN lidar will improve observation of the Arctic. The averaging times required by area flux mappers to quantify regional emissions depend on pixel size, retrieval precision, observation density, fraction of successful retrievals, and return times in a way that varies with the spatial resolution desired. A similar interplay applies to point source imagers between detection threshold, spatial coverage, and return time, defining an observing system completeness. Expanding constellations of point source imagers including GHGSat and Carbon Mapper over the coming years will greatly improve observing system completeness for point sources through dense spatial coverage and frequent return times.  © Copyright: ","atmospheric chemistry; carbon emission; Landsat; methane; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135143831"

The fraction and distribution of melt ponds have considerable impacts on Arctic climate and ecosystem by reducing the albedo. There is an urgency to obtain improved accuracy and a wider coverage of melt pond fraction (MPF) data for studying these processes. MPF information has generally been acquired from optical imagery. Conventional MPF algorithms based on high-resolution optical sensors have treated melt ponds as features with constant reflectance; however, the spectral reflectance of ponds can vary greatly, even at a local scale. Here we use Sentinel-2 imagery to demonstrate those previous algorithms assuming fixed melt pond-reflectance greatly underestimate MPF. We propose a new algorithm (“LinearPolar”) based on the polar coordinate transformation that treats melt ponds as variable-reflectance features and calculates MPF across the vector between melt pond and bare ice axes. The angular coordinate θ of the polar coordinate system, which is only associated with pond fraction rather than reflectance, is used to determinate MPF. By comparing the new algorithm and previous methods with IceBridge optical imagery data, across a variety of Sentinel-2 images with melt ponds at various stages of development, we show that the RMSE value of the LinearPolar algorithm is about 30% lower than for the previous algorithms. Moreover, based on a sensitivity test, the new algorithm is also less sensitive to the subjective threshold for melt pond reflectance than previous algorithms. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Its main payload is a wide-view camera with a ground resolution of 74 m at the subsatellite point and a scanning width of 744 km. BNU-1 takes into account the balance between spatial resolution and revisit frequency, providing observations with finer spatial resolution than Terra/Aqua MODIS data and more frequent revisits than Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI. It is a valuable supplement for polar observations. Geolocation is an essential step in satellite image processing. This study aims to geolocate BNU-1 images; this includes two steps. For the first step, a geometric calibration model is applied to transform the image coordinates to geographic coordinates. The images calibrated by the geometric model are the Level1A (L1A) product. Due to the inaccuracy of satellite attitude and orbit parameters, the geometric calibration model also exhibits errors, resulting in geolocation errors in the BNU-1 L1A product. Then, a geometric correction method is applied as the second step to find the control points (CPs) extracted from the BNU-1 L1A product and the corresponding MODIS images. These CPs are used to estimate and correct geolocation errors. The BNU-1 L1A product corrected by the geometric correction method is processed to the Level1B (L1B) product. Although the geometric correction method based on CPs has been widely used to correct the geolocation errors of visible remote sensing images, it is difficult to extract enough CPs from polar images due to the high reflectance of snow and ice. In this study, the geometric correction employs an image division and an image enhancement method to extract more CPs from the BNU-1 L1A products. The results indicate that the number of CPs extracted by the division and image enhancements increases by about 30% to 182%. Twenty-eight images of Antarctica and fifteen images of Arctic regions were evaluated to assess the performance of the geometric correction. The average geolocation error was reduced from 10 km to ~300 m. In general, this study presents the geolocation method, which could serve as a reference for the geolocation of other visible remote sensing images for polar observations. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study we use digital elevation models generated from TanDEM-X observations to detect and derive volume and area change rates for RTSs on the Taymyr Peninsula.

To this end, satellite images provide an invaluable source of Earth observations to monitor land cover in areas that are otherwise difficult to access. With the continuous development of new satellites, it is important to optimize the existing maps for further monitoring of Arctic ecosystems. This study presents a scalable classification framework, producing novel 10 m resolution land cover maps for Kobbefjord, Disko, and Zackenberg in Greenland. Based on Sentinel-2, a digital elevation model, and Google Earth Engine (GEE), this framework classifies the areas into nine classes. A vegetation land cover classification for 2019 is achieved through a multi-temporal analysis based on 41 layers comprising phenology, spectral indices, and topographical features. Reference data (1164 field observations) were used to train a random forest classifier, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 91.8%. The red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data proved to be particularly well suited for mapping the fen vegetation class. The study presents land cover mapping in the three study areas with an unprecedented spatial resolution and can be extended via GEE for further ecological monitoring in Greenland. © 2021 by the authors.

This results in widespread permafrost-thaw disturbances, some unfolding slowly and over long periods, others occurring rapidly and abruptly. Despite optical remote sensing offering a variety of techniques to assess and monitor landscape changes, a persistent cloud cover decreases the amount of usable images considerably. However, combining data from multiple platforms promises to increase the number of images drastically. We therefore assess the comparability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery and the possibility to use both Landsat and Sentinel-2 images together in time series analyses, achieving a temporally-dense data coverage in Arctic-Boreal regions. We determined overlapping same-day acquisitions of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images for three representative study sites in Eastern Siberia. We then compared the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 pixel-pairs, downscaled to 60 m, of corresponding bands and derived the ordinary least squares regression for every band combination. The acquired coefficients were used for spectral bandpass adjustment between the two sensors. The spectral band comparisons showed an overall good fit between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images already. The ordinary least squares regression analyses underline the generally good spectral fit with intercept values between 0.0031 and 0.056 and slope values between 0.531 and 0.877. A spectral comparison after spectral bandpass adjustment of Sentinel-2 values to Landsat-8 shows a nearly perfect alignment between the same-day images. The spectral band adjustment succeeds in adjusting Sentinel-2 spectral values to Landsat-8 very well in Eastern Siberian Arctic-Boreal landscapes. After spectral adjustment, Landsat and Sentinel-2 data can be used to create temporally-dense time series and be applied to assess permafrost landscape changes in Eastern Siberia. Remaining differences between the sensors can be attributed to several factors including heterogeneous terrain, poor cloud and cloud shadow masking, and mixed pixels. © 2019 by the authors.","Correlation methods; Geomorphology; Optical correlation; Permafrost; Pixels; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; High Latitudes; Land-cover change; Optical data; Spectral adjustment; Surface reflectance; Time series analysis","Correlation; Land cover change; Northern high latitudes; Optical data; Permafrost; Permafrost disturbances; Spectral adjustment; Surface reflectance; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071535793"

The aim of this study is to assess the seasonal variations of the snow using a multi-sensor approach and to analyze the sensitivity of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter to vegetation growth and soil moisture in an arctic environment. A combined approach using time series data from active remote sensing sensors such as SAR and passive optical sensors is a known technique in snow monitoring, while there is little knowledge of the radar Cband’s response pattern to vegetation dynamics in the arctic. First, we created multi-sensor masks using the HV backscatter coefficients from Sentinel-1 and the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) time series from Sentinel-2, monitoring the snow dynamics in Adventdalen (Svalbard) for the season from 2017 to 2018. Second, radar sensitivity analysis was performed using the HV polarized channel responses to vegetation growth and soil moisture dynamics. (1) Our results showed that the C-band radar data are capable of monitoring the seasonal variability in timing of snow melting in Adventdalen, revealing an earlier start by approximately 20 days in 2018 compared to 2017. (2) From the sensitivity analyses, the HV channel showed a major response to the vegetation component in areas with drier graminoid dominated vegetation without water-saturated soil (R = 0.69). However, the temperature was strongly correlated with the HV channel (R = 0.74) during the years with delayed snow melting. Areas of frozen tundra with drier vegetation dominated by graminoids had delayed soil thawing processes and therefore this may limit the ability of the radar to follow the vegetation growth pattern and soil moisture. © 2022 by the authors.

Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), which is the NASA's latest altimeter satellite based on the green laser (532 nm), observes the global surface elevation. When compared to the CryoSat-2 altimetry satellite whose along-track resolution is 250 m, ICESat-2 is highly expected to provide much more detailed information about Arctic melt ponds thanks to its high alongtrack resolution of 70 cm. The basic products of ICESat-2 are the surface height and the number of reflected photons. To aggregate the neighboring information of a specific ICESat-2 photon, the segments of photons with 10 m length were used. The standard deviation of the height and the total number of photons were calculated for each segment. As the melt ponds have the smoother surface than the sea ice, the lower variation of the height over melt ponds can make the melt ponds distinguished from the sea ice. When the melt ponds were extracted, the number of photons per segment was used to classify the melt ponds covered with open-water and specular ice. As photons are much more absorbed in the water-covered melt ponds than the melt ponds with the specular ice, the number of photons per segment can distinguish the water- and ice-covered ponds. As a result, the suggested melt pond detection method was able to classify the sea ice, water-covered melt ponds, and ice-covered melt ponds. A qualitative analysis was conducted using the Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The suggested method successfully classified the water- and ice-covered ponds which were difficult to distinguish with Sentinel-2 optical images. Lastly, the pros and cons of the melt pond detection using satellite altimetry and optical images were discussed. © 2021 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.","","Altimetry; ICESat-2; Melt pond; Photon count; Photon height; Sea ice","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119160076"

They are globally important components of the biogeochemical carbon cycle and have potential feedback effects on climate. These northern waters are mostly small lakes and ponds, and although they may be mapped using very high-resolution satellites or aerial photography, these approaches are generally not suitable for monitoring purposes, due to the cost and limited availability of such images. In this study we evaluated the potential use of widely available high-resolution imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2) for the characterization of the spectral reflectance of thermokarst lakes and ponds. Specifically, we aimed to define the minimum lake area that could be reliably imaged, and to identify challenges and solutions for remote sensing of such waters in the future. The study was conducted in subarctic Canada, in the vicinity of Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik (Nunavik, Québec), an area in the sporadic permafrost zone with numerous thermokarst waterbodies that vary greatly in size. Ground truthing lake reflectance data were collected using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) fitted with a multispectral camera that collected images at 13 cm resolution. The results were compared with reflectance from Sentinel-2 images, and the effect of lake area on the reflectance response was assessed. Our results show that Sentinel-2 imagery was suitable for waterbodies larger than 350 m2 once their boundaries were defined, which in the two test sites would allow monitoring from 11% to 30% of the waterbodies and 73% to 85% of the total lake area. Challenges for remote sensing of small lakes include the confounding effects of water reflection (both direct radiation and diffuse), wind and shadow. Given the small threshold area and frequent revisit time, Sentinel-2 provides a valuable approach towards the continuous monitoring of waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes such as those found in thermokarst landscapes. UASs provide a complementary approach for ground truthing and boundary definition. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Permafrost; Ponding; Ponds; Radiation effects; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Small satellites; Continuous monitoring; High resolution imagery; Multi-spectral cameras; Sentinel-2; Spectral reflectances; Subarctic; Unmanned aerial systems; Very high resolution; Lakes","Lakes; Permafrost; Ponds; Reflectance; Satellite; Sentinel-2; Subarctic; Unmanned Aerial Systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065042534"

The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development.

All glaciers lost 80% or more of their surface snow cover during the studied ablation seasons. This bolsters the recently observed trend of local glacier thinning, even at higher altitudes. Snow ablation dynamics are highly dependent on the glaciers altitudes, their position relative to the prevailing wind direction and the exposure to insolation. The accumulation areas of the studied glaciers were delimited based on the overlap of the minimum extent of snow-covered areas in the four consecutive studied summer seasons. The high temporal and spatial resolutions of available images enabled a detailed description of the seasonal snow ablation dynamics. Moreover, an estimate of the average number of days with below threshold glacier snow cover was made. This study contributes to our understanding of recent processes and might further support the modelling of glacier melt and subsequent runoff.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The biome and regional characteristics, however, greatly constrain the design of the LSP algorithms. In the Arctic, such biome-specific characteristics include prolonged periods of snow cover, persistent cloud cover, and shortness of the growing season. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of Sentinel-2 for deriving high-resolution LSP maps of the Arctic. We extracted the timing of the start and end of season (SoS and EoS, respectively) for the years 2019 and 2020 with a simple implementation of the threshold method in Google Earth Engine (GEE). We found a high level of similarity between Sentinel-2 and PhenoCam metrics; the best results were observed with Sentinel-2 enhanced vegetation index (EVI) (root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) of 3.0 d and −0.3 d for the SoS, and 6.5 d and −3.8 d for the EoS, respectively), although other vegetation indices presented similar performances. The phenological maps of Sentinel-2 EVI compared well with the same maps extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in homogeneous landscapes (RMSE and ME of 9.2 d and 2.9 d for the SoS, and 6.4 and −0.9 d for the EoS, respectively). Unreliable LSP estimates were filtered and a quality flag indicator was activated when the Sentinel-2 time series presented a long period (>40 d) of missing data; discontinuities were lower in spring and early summer (9.2%) than in late summer and autumn (39.4%). The Sentinel-2 high-resolution LSP maps and the GEE phenological extraction method will support vegetation monitoring and contribute to improving the representation of Artic vegetation phenology in land surface models. © MDPI AG.

Here we map this surface stratigraphy along the northern margin of the ice sheet using mosaicked Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery from the end of the 2019 melt season and finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for smaller regions of interest. We trace three distinct transitions in apparent dust concentration and the top of a darker basal layer. The three dust transitions have been identified previously as representing late-Pleistocene climatic transitions, allowing us to develop a coarse margin chronostratigraphy for northern Greenland. Substantial folding of late-Pleistocene stratigraphy is observed but uncommon. The oldest conformal surface-exposed ice in northern Greenland is likely located adjacent to Warming Land and may be up to ~55 thousand years old. Basal ice is commonly exposed hundreds of metres from the ice margin and may indicate a widespread frozen basal thermal state. We conclude that the ice margin across northern Greenland offers multiple opportunities to recover paleoclimatically distinct ice relative to previously studied regions in southwestern Greenland.

Monitoring and mitigation efforts along remote Arctic rivers are possible but logistically complex. In recent years, Earth observation programs have emerged based on spaceborne sensors that record large parts of the Earth's surface at a regular interval and with fast downlink. Most optical satellites have a similar sun-synchronous orbit, and have thus an akin ground track. When different sun-synchronous missions are combined this results in near-simultaneous acquisitions, which make it possible to monitor fast displacements that occur at or near the Earth's surface over large scales. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a new monitoring system; one of observing river ice movement. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-satellite monitoring system by combining data from freely available medium- and coarse-resolution satellites, in this study that is Sentinel-2 and PROBA-V. Velocities of floating river ice during the spring of 2016 are estimated over a more than 700 km long reach of the Lena River in Russia. In order to achieve automatic velocity estimates at such scales, efficient and river-ice specific processing steps are included. Entropy filters are used to detect regions of high contrast and neglects open water or an intact ice cover, and also help the image matching. Post-processing is done through filtering on the general flow direction, stemming from a global river mask dataset. In all, this study shows the potential of extracting river ice movement from a combination of low and medium resolution satellite sensors in sun-synchronous orbit. © 2021 The Author(s)","Lena River; Russian Federation; Satellites; Varanidae; ice breakup; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice; Sentinel; spatial resolution","Mini-satellite; Multi-sensor; PROBA-V; River-ice movement monitoring; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120716404"

These attributes result in similar spectral characteristics between distinct vegetation communities. In this study we examine spectral variability at three phenological phases of leaf-out, maximum canopy, and senescence of ground-based spectroscopy, as well as a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) and simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, from five dominant low-Arctic tundra vegetation communities in the Toolik Lake Research Area, Alaska, in order to inform spectral differentiation and subsequent vegetation classification at both the ground and satellite scale. We used the InStability Index (ISI), a ratio of between endmember and within endmember variability, to determine the most discriminative phenophase and wavelength regions for identification of each vegetation community. Our results show that the senescent phase was the most discriminative phenophase for the identification of the majority of communities when using both ground-based and simulated EnMAP reflectance spectra. Maximum canopy was the most discriminative phenophase for the majority of simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance data. As with previous ground-based spectral characterization of Alaskan low-Arctic tundra, the blue, red, and red-edge parts of the spectrum were most discriminative for all three reflectance datasets. Differences in vegetation colour driven by pigment dynamics appear to be the optimal areas of the spectrum for differentiation using high spectral resolution field spectroscopy and simulated hyperspectral EnMAP and multispectral Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra. The phenological aspect of this study highlights the potential exploitation of more extreme colour differences in vegetation observed during senescence when hyperspectral data is available. The results provide insight into both the community and seasonal dynamics of spectral variability to better understand and interpret currently used broadband vegetation indices and also for improved spectral unmixing of hyperspectral aerial and satellite data which is useful for a wide range of applications from fine-scale monitoring of shifting vegetation composition to the identification of vegetation vigor. © 2017 by the authors.","Landforms; Photomapping; Reflection; Remote sensing; Spectral resolution; Vegetation mapping; Arctic tundra; Environmental analysis; Environmental mapping; Ground based; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Low-arctic; Phenophase; Reflectance spectrum; Tundra vegetation; Vegetation community; Antennas","hyperspectral remote sensing; low-Arctic; spectroscopy; tundra vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057262212"

Accurate SDB in the Arctic waters is more complex by weak light, cloud, mist, floating ice and so on than in middle or lower latitude clean waters. This paper performs SDB based on Support vector regression (SVR) from multi-spectral imagery of Sentinel-2 in shallow water (0-20 m) of Pomorskiy Proliv of Northern Russia, and corrects the estimated water depth with the interpolation of residuals. The results indicate that the highest accuracy of SDB based on SVR is achieved by employing radial basis function on the full feature inputs, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.5 m and the mean relative error of 44.9 %. After the residual interpolation correction, the overall MAE reduces to 2.0 m, and the root mean square errors decrease by at least 0.3 m among different depth ranges.

It is therefore of great importance to estimate the annual iceberg encounter frequencies to select robust concepts for offshore field development, to design offshore structures and possibly to plan ice management operations. These encounter frequencies are often estimated using numerical models. Regardless of the model, considerable uncertainties often exist in the input data of icebergs at the sources, i.e., the annual number of icebergs released at the source and their size characteristics. The aim of this work is to reduce these uncertainties by utilizing state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing data and a complementary numerical model of iceberg drift and deterioration. Iceberg length and width distributions derived using Sentinel-2 optical imagery are presented at the major iceberg sources in the Barents Sea, which are Franz Josef Land, the eastern side of Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya. Over 22,000 icebergs were manually identified, with the largest observed iceberg being approximately 1 km long, originating from Franz Josef Land. Furthermore, a methodology is proposed to estimate the annual number of icebergs released into the Barents Sea by comparing the model results against Copernicus iceberg density data derived from the satellite synthetic aperture radar system onboard Sentinel-1. The importance of satellite remote sensing data cannot be understated because it is undoubtedly the best way to calibrate and validate the results of numerical iceberg drift models.

Therefore, it is necessary to obtain more accurate information on melt ponds on Arctic sea ice by remote sensing. The present large-scale melt pond products, especially the melt pond fraction (MPF), still require verification, and using very high resolution optical satellite remote sensing data is a good way to verify the large-scale retrieval of MPF products. Unlike most MPF algorithms using very high resolution data, the LinearPolar algorithm using Sentinel-2 data considers the albedo of melt ponds unfixed. In this paper, by selecting the best band combination, we applied this algorithm to Landsat 8 (L8) data. Moreover, Sentinel-2 data, as well as support vector machine (SVM) and iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithms, are used as the comparison and verification data. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the LinearPolar algorithm for melt ponds is higher than that of previous algorithms. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient results achieved by using the LinearPolar algorithm with L8 and Sentinel-2A (S2), the SVM algo-rithm, and the ISODATA algorithm are 95.38% and 0.88, 94.73% and 0.86, and 92.40%and 0.80, respectively, which are much higher than those of principal component analysis (PCA) and Markus algorithms. The mean MPF (10.0%) obtained from 80 cases from L8 data based on the LinearPolar algorithm is much closer to Sentinel-2 (10.9%) than the Markus (5.0%) and PCA algorithms (4.2%), with a mean MPF difference of only 0.9%, and the correlation coefficients of the two MPFs are as high as 0.95. The overall relative error of the LinearPolar algorithm is 53.5% and 46.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is 30.9% and 27.4% lower than that of the Markus and PCA algorithms, respectively. In the cases with-out obvious melt ponds, the relative error is reduced more than that of those with obvious melt ponds because the LinearPolar algorithm can identify 100% of dark melt ponds and relatively small melt ponds, and the latter contributes more to the reduction in the relative error of MPF retrieval. With a wider range and longer time series, the MPF from Landsat data are more efficient than those from Sentinel-2 for verifying large-scale MPF products or obtaining long-term monitoring of a fixed area. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper highlighted the methodological problems that arise at using satellite images for research and mapping of underwater relief; the ways of their solution are offered. Consideration of the depth of penetration of sunlight into the water and analysis of the spectral brightness of underwater objects allow for the determination of the spectrum zone (red zone) optimal for interpreting sandy riverbanks and options for color synthesis. At a limited choice of cloudless images in the Arctic to have images obtained during the minimum water level, not only the imaging season (low-water period) but also interannual runoff fluctuations are taken into account. The water turbidity limits the possibility to interpret the underwater relief. Images obtained with minimal turbidity are selected, and in the case of spreading of turbid waters, multi-temporal images are compared to separate the image of volatile turbid waters from more stable bottom objects; color synthesis is applied at different times.

We selected the northwestern section of the Xiao Xing'an Mountains in China as the study area, located in the degradation zone on the southern margin of the permafrost region in Eurasia, and set up multiple study monitoring areas equipped with methane concentration sensors, air temperature sensors, pore water pressure sensors and soil temperature sensors for long-term monitoring of data changes using the high-density electrical method, ground penetrating radar and on-site drilling to survey the distribution of frozen soil and geological conditions in the study area, combined with remote sensing images of Sentinel-2 L1C and unmanned aerial vehicle photographs and three-dimensional image reconstruction, analysis of fire activities and related geological environmental factors. The results show that since 2004, the permafrost thickness of the marsh wetland in the study area has gradually reduced and the degradation rate obviously accelerated; the organic matter and methane hydrate (metastable methane hydrate and stable methane hydrate) stored in the permafrost under the marsh wetland are gradually entering the atmosphere in the form of methane gas. Methane emissions show seasonal changes, and the annual methane emissions can be divided into three main stages, including a high-concentration short-term emission stage (March to May), a higher-concentration long-term stable emission stage (June to August) and a higher-concentration short-term emission stage (September to November); there is a certain correlation between the change in atmospheric methane concentration and the change in atmospheric pressure and pore water pressure. From March to May every year (high-concentration short-term emission stage), with snow melting, the air humidity reaches an annual low value, and the surface methane concentration reaches an annual high value. The high concentration of methane gas entering the surface in this stage is expected to increase the risk of wildfire in the permafrost degradation area in two ways (increasing the regional air temperature and self-combustion), which may be an important factor that leads to a seasonal wildfire frequency difference in the permafrost zone of Northeast China and Southeast Siberia, with the peak in spring and autumn and the monthly maximum in spring. The increase in the frequency of wildfires is projected to further generate positive feedback on climate change by affecting soil microorganisms and soil structure. Southeastern Siberia and northeastern China, which are on the southern boundary of the permafrost region of Eurasia, need to be targeted to establish fire warning and management mechanisms to effectively reduce the risk of wildfires. © 2020, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097046631"

However, the benefits of applying these techniques would be especially valuable in arctic areas, where ground local information can be hard to obtain due to hardly accessible roads and lands.

Initially, the authors evaluate the accuracy of calculating the albedo values from satellite images based on the albedo ground-based measurements with a pyranometer in Moscow and Kirovsk. Statistical analysis has shown a high correlation between ground-based and satellite albedo measurements, which makes it possible to use quantitative albedo values in the spatiotemporal analysis of snow cover contamination. For three cities (Murmansk, Vorkuta, Norilsk) that differ in physical and geographical conditions and the type of industrial enterprises, the analysis of snow cover contamination for the period 2016-2020 was carried out. For Murmansk, the main pollutant is coal dust from the seaport, where coal is handled in an open way. In early 2020. the city authorities have completed the construction of a dust screen around the port terminals to reduce urban pollution. The analysis carried out in the work showed that the installed screen significantly reduced the area of pollution in the city of Murmansk. For terrain height more than 120 m, the albedo values correspond to the maximum values for the selected date, which indicates that coal dust spreads for territories located at altitudes of less than 100 m. It was not possible to identify long-term dynamics of albedo values for Vorkuta and Norilsk. Polluted snow cover is observed at a distance of up to 10 km from polluting enterprises. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

However, estimating the snow water equivalent (SWE) is challenging in remote-sensing applications already at medium spatial resolutions of 1 km. We present an ensemble-based data assimilation framework that estimates the peak subgrid SWE distribution (SSD) at the 1 km scale by assimilating fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) satellite retrievals in a simple snow model forced by downscaled reanalysis data. The basic idea is to relate the timing of the snow cover depletion (accessible from satellite products) to the peak SSD. Peak subgrid SWE is assumed to be lognormally distributed, which can be translated to a modeled time series of fSCA through the snow model. Assimilation of satellite-derived fSCA facilitates the estimation of the peak SSD, while taking into account uncertainties in both the model and the assimilated data sets. As an extension to previous studies, our method makes use of the novel (to snow data assimilation) ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ES-MDA) scheme combined with analytical Gaussian anamorphosis to assimilate time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 fSCA retrievals. The scheme is applied to Arctic sites near Ny-Ålesund (79°, Svalbard, Norway) where field measurements of fSCA and SWE distributions are available. The method is able to successfully recover accurate estimates of peak SSD on most of the occasions considered. Through the ES-MDA assimilation, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the fSCA, peak mean SWE and peak subgrid coefficient of variation is improved by around 75, 60 and 20%, respectively, when compared to the prior, yielding RMSEs of 0.01, 0.09 m water equivalent (w.e.) and 0.13, respectively. The ES-MDA either outperforms or at least nearly matches the performance of other ensemble-based batch smoother schemes with regards to various evaluation metrics. Given the modularity of the method, it could prove valuable for a range of satellite-era hydrometeorological reanalyses. © 2018 Author(s).","Arctic; Ny-Alesund; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; albedo; data assimilation; data set; Gaussian method; hydrometeorology; MODIS; mountain region; satellite data; snow cover; snow water equivalent; surface energy; thermal conductivity; time series analysis; water budget","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041176614"

Even though Alaska hosts 65% of U.S. wetlands, less than half of the wetlands in Alaska have been mapped by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) or other high-resolution wetlands protocols. The availability of time series satellite data and the development of machine learning algorithms have enabled the characterization of Arctic wetland inundation dynamics and vegetation types with limited ground data input. In this study, we built a semi-automatic process to generate sub-pixel water fraction (SWF) maps across the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska using random forest regression and 139 Sentinel-2 images taken in ice-free seasons from 2016 to 2019. With this, we characterized the seasonal dynamics of wetland inundation and explored their potential usage in determining NWI water regimes. The highest levels of surface water expression were detected in June, resulting from seasonal active layer thaw and snowmelt. Inundation was most variable in riverbeds, lake and pond margins, and depressional wetlands, where water levels fluctuate substantially between dry and wet seasons. NWI water regimes that indicate frequent inundation, such as permanently flooded wetlands, had high SWF values (SWF ≥ 90%), while those with infrequent inundation, such as temporarily flooded wetlands, had low SWF values (SWF < 10%). Vegetation types were also classified through the synergistic use of a vegetation index, water regimes, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, topographic data, and a random forest classifier. The random forest classification algorithms demonstrated good performance in classifying Arctic wetland vegetation types, with an overall accuracy of 0.87. Compared with NWI data produced in the 1980s, scrub-shrub wetlands appear to have increased from 91 to 258 km2 over the last three decades, which is the largest percentage change (182%) among all vegetation types. However, additional field data are needed to confirm this shift in vegetation type. This study demonstrates the potential of using time series satellite data and machine learning algorithms in characterizing inundation dynamics and vegetation types of Arctic wetlands. This approach could aid in the creation and maintenance of wetland inventories, including the NWI, in Arctic regions and enable an improved understanding of long-term wetland dynamics. © 2021 by the authors.

The corridors were created as a strategic framework to guide Federal investments in marine transportation in the Arctic. With new government investment, under the Oceans Protection Plan (OPP), the corridors initiative, known as the Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors, will continue to be developed. Since 2016, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been using the corridors as a key layer in a geographic information system (GIS) model known as the CHS Priority Planning Tool (CPPT). The CPPT helps CHS prioritize its survey and charting efforts in Canada’s key traffic areas. Even with these latest efforts, important gaps in the surveys still need to be filled in order to cover the Canadian waterways. To help further develop the safety to navigation and improve survey mission planning, CHS has also been exploring new technologies within remote sensing. Under the Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), CHS has been investigating the potential use of Earth observation (EO) data to identify potential hazards to navigation that are not currently charted on CHS products. Through visual interpretation of satellite imagery, and automatic detection using artificial intelligence (AI), CHS identified several potential hazards to navigation that had previously gone uncharted. As a result, five notices to mariners (NTMs) were issued and the corresponding updates were applied to the charts. In this study, two AI approaches are explored using deep learning and machine learning techniques: the convolution neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) classification. The study investigates the effectiveness of the two models in identifying shoals in Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results show that both CNN and RF models can detect shoals with accuracies ranging between 79 and 94% over two study sites; however, WorldView-2 images deliver results with higher accuracy and lower omission errors. The high processing times of using high-resolution imagery and training a deep learning model may not be necessary in order to quickly scan images for shoals; but training a CNN model with a large training set may lead to faster processing times without the need to train individual images. © 2020 by the authors.","","Artificial Intelligence; Canadian Arctic; Canadian Hydrographic Service; Convolutional Neural Network; Earth Observation; Machine Learning; Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors; Random Forest; Safety to Navigation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086264336"

Remote sensing of such lakes is complicated due to very low water leaving signals. There are extreme (black) lakes where the water reflectance values are negligible in almost entire visible part of spectrum (400-700 nm) due to the absorption by CDOM. In these lakes, the only water-leaving signal detectable by remote sensing sensors occurs as two peaks-near 710 nm and 810 nm. The first peak has been widely used in remote sensing of eutrophic waters for more than two decades. We show on the example of field radiometry data collected in Estonian and Swedish lakes that the height of the 810 nm peak can also be used in retrieving water constituents from remote sensing data. This is important especially in black lakes where the height of the 710 nm peak is still affected by CDOM. We have shown that the 810 nm peak can be used also in remote sensing of a wide variety of lakes. The 810 nm peak is caused by combined effect of slight decrease in absorption by water molecules and backscattering from particulate material in the water. Phytoplankton was the dominant particulate material in most of the studied lakes. Therefore, the height of the 810 peak was in good correlation with all proxies of phytoplankton biomass-chlorophyll-a (R2 = 0.77), total suspended matter (R2 = 0.70), and suspended particulate organic matter (R2 = 0.68). There was no correlation between the peak height and the suspended particulate inorganic matter. Satellite sensors with sufficient spatial and radiometric resolution for mapping lake water quality (Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) were launched recently. In order to test whether these satellites can capture the 810 nm peak we simulated the spectral performance of these two satellites from field radiometry data. Actual satellite imagery from a black lake was also used to study whether these sensors can detect the peak despite their band configuration. Sentinel 2 MSI has a nearly perfectly positioned band at 705 nm to characterize the 700-720 nm peak. We found that the MSI 783 nm band can be used to detect the 810 nm peak despite the location of this band is not in perfect to capture the peak.","Absorption spectroscopy; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Chlorophyll; Lakes; Molecules; Organic compounds; Phytoplankton; Radiometry; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Water absorption; Water quality; CDOM; Chlorophyll a; HyperSpectral; LANDSAT; Sentinel-2; Suspended matters; Remote sensing","CDOM; Chlorophyll-a; Hyperspectral; Lakes; Landsat 8; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Suspended matter","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974782909"

Delineation of glacier outlines was manually made to reduce uncertainties, especially for small glaciers. The database structure is compatible with the global and national glacier archives and includes the main glacial parameters. Additionally a classification of possible catastrophic phenomena of glacial genesis was developed: dynamically unstable glaciers, glacier lakes, icebergs, etc. The data base is available online (www.glacrus.ru). At present, there are 22 glacial systems in Russia with a total area of 54,518 km2. The largest glacial systems by area are located in the Arctic archipelagos: Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land. The glacial systems of the Caucasus, Kamchatka, and Altai are the largest by area in the continental part of Russia. The main group consists of 13 small glacial systems, the area of which does not exceed 100 km2. They are located in different glaciological zones: from the De Long Islands in the Arctic to the Eastern Sayan in southern Siberia. Since the compilation of the USSR glacier Inventory (1965-1982), the area of glaciers has decreased by 5,594 km2, or 9.3%. The area of polar glaciers has decreased in smaller degree than that of glaciers in mountainous regions. The results of our research confirm the trend of reducing the area of glaciers throughout the Russian territory. The magnitude and rate of changes depend on local climatic and orographic features. The exception is the glaciers of the volcanic regions of Kamchatka, the area of which has increased or remained unchanged. ? 2021 ?. © 2021 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

Satellite remote sensing data are considered to be a necessary supplement to the ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter circulation, especially for the ice-free periods in high-latitudes. In this study, we propose a remote sensing retrieval algorithm to obtain the chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) levels of the six largest Arctic rivers using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2018. These CDOM results are converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations using the strong relationship (R2 = 0.89) between the field measurements of these two water constituents. The temporal-spatial distributions of the DOC in the six largest Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions are depicted. The performance of the retrieval algorithm verifies the capacity of using Sentinel-2 data to monitor riverine DOC variations due to its improved spatial resolution, better band placement, and increased observation frequency. River discharge, watershed slopes, human activities, and land use/land cover change drove much of the variation in the satellite-derived DOC. The seasonality, geography, and scale would affect the correlation between DOC concentration and these influence factors. Our results could improve the ability to monitor DOC fluxes in Arctic rivers and advance our understanding of the Earth's carbon cycle. © 2019 by the authors.","Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Ice; Land use; Remote sensing; Rivers; Stream flow; Arctic rivers; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Dissolved organic carbon; Land use/land cover change; Observation frequencies; Satellite remote sensing data; Sentinel-2; Temporal spatial distribution; Organic carbon","Arctic rivers; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Dissolved organic carbon; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077899072"

Current land cover products tend to underestimate the extent of mountain shrublands dominated by Ericaceae (Vaccinium spp. (species) and Rhododendron ferrugineum). In addition, mountain shrubs are often confounded with grasslands. Here, we examined the potential of anthocyanin-responsive vegetation indices to provide more accurate maps of mountain shrublands in a mountain range located in the French Alps. We relied on the multi-spectral instrument onboard the Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites and the availability of red-edge bands to calculate a Normalized Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (NARI). We used this index to quantify the autumn accumulation of anthocyanin in canopies dominated by Vaccinium spp. and Rhododendron ferrugineum and compared the effectiveness of NARI to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a basis for shrubland mapping. Photointerpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery, intensive field campaigns, and floristic surveys provided complementary data to calibrate and evaluate model performance. The proposed NARI-based model performed better than the NDVI-based model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 against 0.58. Validation of shrub cover maps based on NARI resulted in a Kappa coeffcient of 0.67, which outperformed existing land cover products and resulted in a ten-fold increase in estimated area occupied by Ericaceae-dominated shrublands. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 red-edge band provides novel opportunities to detect seasonal anthocyanin accumulation in plant canopies and discuss the potential of our method to quantify long-term dynamics of shrublands in alpine and arctic contexts. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Anthocyanins; Biodiversity; Forestry; Mapping; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing; Landforms","Anthocyanin; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076564830"

In addition, a precise landscape map is required for knowledge-based territorial planning and management. In this article, we aimed to explore and enhanced methods to analyse and map the permafrost landscape in Orulgan Ridge. The Google Earth Engine cloud platform was used to generate vegetation cover maps based on multi-fusion classification of Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI time series data. Phenological features based on the monthly median values of time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) were used to recognize geobotanical units according to the hierarchical concept of permafrost landscapes by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, geomorphological variables of megarelief (mountains and river valleys) were identified using the GIS-based terrain analysis and landform classification of the ASTER GDEM scenes mosaic. The resulting environmental variables made it possible to categorize nine classes of mountain permafrost landscapes. The result obtained was compared with previous permafrost landscape maps, which revealed a significant difference in distribution and spatial structure of intrazonal valleys and mountain tundra landscapes. Analysis of the landscape structure revealed a significant distribution of classes of mountain Larix-sparse forests and tundra. Landscape diversity was described by six longitudinal and latitudinal landscape hypsometric profiles. River valleys allow boreal–taiga landscapes to move up to high-mountainous regions. The features of the landscape structure and diversity of the ridge are noted, which, along with the specific spatial organization of vegetation and relief, can be of key importance for environmental monitoring and the study of regional variability of climatic changes. © 2022 by the authors.","","Google Earth Engine; landscape mapping; landscape structure; Northeast Siberia; permafrost landscape; Support Vector Machine; terrain analysis; time-series image classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137575419"

Each summer, extensive supraglacial river networks develop on the DIC surface and route large volumes of meltwater from ice caps to the ocean. Mapping their extent and understanding their temporal evolution are important for validating runoff routing and melt volumes predicted by regional climate models (RCMs). We use 10 m Sentinel-2 images captured on 28 July and 10/11 August 2016 to map supraglacial rivers across the entire DIC (12,100 km2). Both dendritic and parallel supraglacial drainage patterns are found, with a total length of 44,941 km and a mean drainage density (Dd) of 3.71 km−1. As the melt season progresses, Dd increases and supraglacial rivers form at progressively higher elevations. There is a positive correlation between RCM-derived surface runoff and satellite-mapped Dd, suggesting that supraglacial drainage density is primarily controlled by surface runoff. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study inventoried and classified lakes on three of the Svalbard Islands (Spitsbergen, Barentsøya, and Edgeøya) using Sentinel-2 images. The Forel-Ule color index (FUI) was employed to measure the lake's color, and a new equation to calculate the concentration of suspended sediment using satellite images was developed and tested using measurements from coastal waters. These two measures, plus the normalized difference vegetation index for vegetation on the lakeshore, and the lakes' location were used for clustering and classification. More than 1000 natural lakes were found on the three Svalbard islands. Nearly 80 % of these were smaller than 0.01 km2 (1 ha), with the largest a few km2 in area. Lake distribution analysis identified six zones of increased lake density, five of which were located along the western coast of Spitsbergen. The FUI was thus demonstrated to be useful for the monitoring of Arctic lakes. The K-means clustering results and analysis of the spectral signatures divided the lakes into seven classes: clear water, moderately clear water, tundra, coastal tundra, meltwater, extreme meltwater, and supraglacial lakes. Meltwater and clear water lakes were the two most common types, accounting for about 80 % of the total lake area. © 2022 The Author","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; coastal water; color; lake; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; suspended sediment; vegetation","Arctic lakes; Forel-Ulle index; Lakes classification; Satellite monitoring; Svalbard","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134618719"

However, synthesized overviews of biomass patterns across circumpolar sites have been limited. Based on data from eight study sites in Europe, Siberia and Canada, we ask (1) how biomass is divided between plant functional types (PFTs) and (2) how well biomass patterns can be detected with widely available, moderate spatial resolution (3–10 m) satellite imagery and topographic data. We explain biomass patterns using random forest regressions with the predictors being spectral bands and indices calculated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery and topographic information calculated from ArcticDEM data. Our results indicate that there are notable differences in vegetation composition between northern landscapes with mosses, graminoids and deciduous shrubs being the most dominant PFTs. Remote sensing data detects biomass patterns, but regression performance varies between sites (explained variance 36–70%, normalized root mean square error 9–19%). There is also variability between sites whether Sentinel-2 or PlanetScope data is more suitable to detect biomass patterns and which the most important predictors are.

Within Arctic regions, in situ surveying presents risks to surveyors, is time consuming and costly. To better meet its mandate, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been investigating the potential of remote sensing to complement traditional charting techniques. Much of this work has focused on evaluating the effectiveness of empirical satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) techniques within the Canadian context. With greater knowledge of applying SDB techniques within Canadian waters, CHS is now interested in understanding how characteristics of optical sensors can impact SDB results. For example, how does the availability of different optical bands improve or hinder SDB estimates? What is the impact of spatial resolution on SDB accuracy? Do commercial satellites offer advantages over freely available data? Through application of a multiple band modelling technique to WorldView-2, Pleiades, PlanetScope, SPOT, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 imagery obtained over Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, this paper provides insight into these questions via comparisons with in situ survey data. Result highlights in the context of these questions include the following: Similarities between sensors: Overall linear error at 90% (LE90) results for each sensor ranged from 0.88 to 1.91 m relative to in situ depths, indicating consistency in the accuracy of SDB estimates from the examined satellites. Most estimates achieved Category of Zone of Confidence level C accuracy, the suggested minimum survey accuracy level for incorporating SDB information into navigational charts. SDB coverage: Between sensors, differences in the area of the sea floor that could be measured by SDB were apparent, as were differences in the ability of each sensor to properly represent spatial bathymetry characteristics. Sensor importance: Though relationships between SDB accuracy and sensor resolution were found, significant advantages or disadvantages for particular sensors were not identified, suggesting that other factors may play a more important role for SDB image selection (e.g., sea floor visibility, sediments, waves). Findings from this work will help inform SBD planning activities for hydrographic offices and SDB researchers alike. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

These trends are assumed to affect productivity in fjordic estuaries. However, the spatial extent and temporal variation of the freshwater-driven darkening of fjords remain unresolved. The present study illustrates the spatio-temporal variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Adventfjorden estuary, Svalbard, using in-situ field campaigns and ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) via high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. To compute SPM concentration (CSPMsat ), a semi-analytical algorithm was regionally calibrated using local in-situ data, which improved the accuracy of satellite-derived SPM concentration by ~20% (MRD). Analysis of SPM concentration for two consecutive years (2019, 2020) revealed strong seasonality of SPM in Adventfjorden. Highest estimated SPM concentrations and river plume extent (% of fjord with CSPMsat > 30 mg L−1 ) occurred during June, July, and August. Concurrently, we observed a strong relationship between river plume extent and average air temperature over the 24 h prior to the observation (R2 = 0.69). Considering predicted changes to environmental conditions in the Arctic region, this study highlights the importance of the rapidly changing environmental parameters and the significance of remote sensing in analysing fluxes in light attenuating particles, especially in the coastal Arctic Ocean. © 2022 by the authors.

While previous work focused on the Arctic, this is the first lead-width distribution for Antarctic sea ice. Previous studies suggest that the lead-width distribution follows a power law with a positive exponent; however their results for the power-law exponents are not all in agreement with each other. To detect leads we create a sea-ice surface-type classification based on 20 carefully selected cloud-free Sentinel-2 Level-1C products, which have a resolution of 10 m. The observed time period is from November 2016 until February 2018, covering only the months from November to April. We apply two different fitting methods to the measured lead widths. The first fitting method is a linear fit, while the second method is based on a maximum likelihood approach. Here, we use both methods for the same lead-width data set to observe differences in the calculated power-law exponent. To further investigate influences on the power-law exponent, we define two different thresholds: One for open-water-covered leads and one for open-water-covered and nilas-covered leads. The influence of the lead threshold on the exponent is larger for the linear fit than for the method based on the maximum likelihood approach. We show that the exponent of the lead-width distribution ranges between 1.110 and 1.413 depending on the applied fitting method and lead threshold. This exponent for the Weddell Sea sea ice is smaller than the previously observed exponents for the Arctic sea ice.  © 2021 Marek Muchow et al.","Antarctica; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Wadden Sea; detection method; ice cover; image resolution; sea ice; Sentinel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116313686"

The disaster was entirely unexpected since no previous records of large rock slope failures were known in the region, and it highlighted the need for better knowledge of potentially hazardous rock slopes in remote Arctic regions.</p> <p>The aim of the paper is to explore our ability to detect and locate unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic regions with difficult access. We test this by examining the case of the 17 June 2017 Karrat rock avalanche. The workflow we apply is based on a multidisciplinary analysis of freely available data comprising seismological records, Sentinel-1 spaceborne synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data, and Landsat and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery, ground-truthed with limited fieldwork. Using this workflow enables us to reconstruct a timeline of rock slope failures on the coastal slope here collectively termed the Karrat Landslide Complex.</p> <p>Our analyses show that at least three recent rock avalanches occurred in the Karrat Landslide Complex: Karrat 2009, Karrat 2016, and Karrat 2017. The latter is the source of the abovementioned tsunami, whereas the first two are described here in detail for the first time. All three are interpreted as having initiated as dip-slope failures. In addition to the recent rock avalanches, older rock avalanche deposits are observed, demonstrating older (Holocene) periods of activity. Furthermore, three larger unstable rock slopes that may pose a future hazard are described. A number of non-tectonic seismic events confined to the area are interpreted as recording rock slope failures. The structural setting of the Karrat Landslide Complex, namely dip slope, is probably the main conditioning factor for the past and present activity, and, based on the temporal distribution of events in the area, we speculate that the possible trigger for rock slope failures is permafrost degradation caused by climate warming.</p> <p>The results of the present work highlight the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach, based on freely available data, to studying unstable rock slopes in remote Arctic areas under difficult logistical field conditions and demonstrate the importance of identifying minor precursor events to identify areas of future hazard.  © Author(s) 2020.

Experiment shows that thermal images from MODIS is only useful in extracting lead area with coarse resolution, while the high-resolution SAR image could provide more information on sea ice type in lead. However, overlay of signals from different ice type largely reduces the overall accuracy from supervised classification of RadarSat-2 image. Therefore, decision tree is established to incorporate multisensory data. Characteristics of different ice types and leads is analyzed and utilized in decision tree to detect ice leads in different stages of development. Validation shows that overall accuracy of the result from decision tree is 14.8% higher than that from supervised classification. The sequential structure composed of various development stages of ice leads is confirmed in Sentinel-2 images.

Estimation of GSV at regional to global scales depends on the use of satellite remote sensing data, although accuracies are generally lower over the sparse boreal forest. This is especially true of boreal forest in Russia, for which knowledge of GSV is currently poor despite its global importance. Here we develop a new empirical method in which the primary remote sensing data source is a single summer Sentinel-2 MSI image, augmented by land-cover classification based on the same MSI image trained using MODIS-derived data. In our work the method is calibrated and validated using an extensive set of field measurements from two contrasting regions of the Russian arctic. Results show that GSV can be estimated with an RMS uncertainty of approximately 35–55%, comparable to other spaceborne estimates of low-GSV forest areas, with 70% spatial correspondence between our GSV maps and existing products derived from MODIS data. Our empirical approach requires somewhat laborious data collection when used for upscaling from field data, but could also be used to downscale global data. © 2021 by the authors.

Changes in the timing of phenological phases, such as the onset of growth (as observed by remote sensing), is a sensitive bio-indicator of climate change. In this paper, the study area was the central part of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, located between 77.28◦ N and 78.44◦ N. The goals of this study were: (1) to prepare, analyze and present a cloud-free time-series of daily Sentinel-2 NDVI datasets for the 2016 to 2019 seasons, and (2) to demonstrate the use of the dataset in mapping the onset of growth. Due to a short and intense period with greening-up and frequent cloud cover, all the cloud-free Sentinel-2 data were used. The onset of growth was then mapped by a NDVI threshold method, which showed significant correlation (r2 = 0.47, n = 38, p < 0.0001) with ground-based phenocam observation of the onset of growth in seven vegetation types. However, large bias was found between the Sentinel-2 NDVI-based mapped onset of growth and the phenocam-based onset of growth in a moss tundra, which indicates that the data in these vegetation types must be interpreted with care. In 2018, the onset of growth was about 10 days earlier compared to 2017. © 2021 by the authors.

The MultiSpectral Instrument on board the Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellites of the European Space Agency offers new possibilities for Arctic research; S-2A and S-2B provide 13 spectral bands between 443 and 2,202 nm and spatial resolutions between 10 and 60 m, which may enable the monitoring of large areas of Arctic sea ice. For an accurate retrieval of parameters such as surface albedo, the elimination of atmospheric influences in the data is essential. We therefore provide an evaluation of five currently available atmospheric correction processors for S-2 (ACOLITE, ATCOR, iCOR, Polymer, and Sen2Cor). We evaluate the results of the different processors using in situ spectral measurements of ice and snow and open water gathered north of Svalbard during RV Polarstern cruise PS106.1 in summer 2017. We used spectral shapes to assess performance for ice and snow surfaces. For open water, we additionally evaluated intensities. ACOLITE, ATCOR, and iCOR performed well over sea ice and Polymer generated the best results over open water. ATCOR, iCOR and Sen2Cor failed in the image-based retrieval of atmospheric parameters (aerosol optical thickness, water vapor). ACOLITE estimated AOT within the uncertainty range of AERONET measurements. Parameterization based on external data, therefore, was necessary to obtain reliable results. To illustrate consequences of processor selection on secondary products we computed average surface reflectance of six bands and normalized difference melt index (NDMI) on an image subset. Medians of average reflectance and NDMI range from 0.80–0.97 to 0.12–0.18 while medians for TOA are 0.75 and 0.06, respectively. © 2019 König, Hieronymi and Oppelt.","Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Reflection; Remote sensing; Snow; Space optics; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical thickness; Arctic; Atmospheric corrections; Atmospheric parameters; Multispectral instruments; Multispectral remote sensing; Normalized differences; Sentinel-2; atmospheric correction; remote sensing; sea ice; Sentinel; snow; Sea ice","Arctic; Atmospheric correction; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064226484"

Accordingly, communities throughout Nunavut are concerned with the potential impact of marine pollution events on the ecological integrity of sensitive Arctic environments, food security and traditional livelihoods. In an effort to address community concerns regarding the consequences of oil spills in Nunavut waters, the Enhanced Capacity for Oil Spill Detection for Situational Awareness (ECOSAR) project was executed between 2017-2020 to develop local capacity for oil spill detection, monitoring and response. The project emphasized community-based training of first responders, the exploitation of satellite reconnaissance for oil spill monitoring and assessment, and the development and implementation of a community-based spill response strategy. Technical research activities of ECOSAR were focused on improved detection of oil slicks using Sentinel-1 radar imagery, the characterization of slicks using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical imagery, and the development and implementation of satellite-based shoreline sensitivity mapping methodologies adapted for Nunavut. The characterization of slicks in Arctic using two satellites Sentinel-2 is promising since these satellites provide systematic coverage up to 82.8 degrees North every 5 days. Electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensors can be used for the detection of oil spills and extract information on the type and thickness of oil and petroleum products. The detection of oil slicks can be performed using optical satellites, only under sunny conditions without clouds and fog. The detection, characterization and mapping of oil on water using EO/IR sensors deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has a great potential for situational awareness in the Nunavut region. In order to understand the capabilities of EO/IR sensors, the initial project activities were focused on small-scale experiments involving a hyperspectral sensor. The spectral measurements were acquired using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer from Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc. Numerous small-scale tests provided spectral signatures of a variety of oil types, which had weathered for a period of four months. The paper presents brief results from initial multispectral observations as the future basis for the field studies. © 2021 Proceedings of the 43rd AMOP Technical Seminar on Environmental Contamination and Response.
