There is a disconnect between the measurement scales for CH4 fluxes, which can be measured with chambers at one-meter resolution and eddy covariance towers at 100-1000 m, whereas model estimates are typically made at the ~100 km scale. Therefore, it is critical to upscale site level measurements to the larger scale for model comparison. As vegetation has a critical role in explaining the variability of CH4 fluxes across the tundra landscape, we tested whether remotely-sensed maps of vegetation could be used to upscale fluxes to larger scales. The objectives of this study are to compare four different methods for mapping and two methods for upscaling plot-level CH4 emissions to the measurements from EC towers. We show that linear discriminant analysis (LDA) provides the most accurate representation of the tundra vegetation within the EC tower footprints (classification accuracies of between 65% and 88%). The upscaled CH4 emissions using the areal fraction of the vegetation communities showed a positive correlation (between 0.57 and 0.81) with EC tower measurements, irrespective of the mapping method. The area-weighted footprint model outperformed the simple area-weighted method, achieving a correlation of 0.88 when using the vegetation map produced with the LDA classifier. These results suggest that the high spatial heterogeneity of the tundra vegetation has a strong impact on the flux, and variation indicates the potential impact of environmental or climatic parameters on the fluxes. Nonetheless, assimilating remotely-sensed vegetation maps of tundra in a footprint model was successful in upscaling fluxes across scales. © 2017 by the author.","Discriminant analysis; Ecology; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Landforms; Mapping; Methane; Remote sensing; Towers; Alaska; Arctic; Methane fluxes; Multi-spectral imagery; Tundra; Upscaling; Vegetation community; Vegetation","Alaska; Arctic; Footprint modelling; Methane flux; Multispectral imagery; Tundra; Upscaling; Vegetation communities","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038207073"

Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) is an effective supplement to the ship-based echo sounder, especially for bathymetric measurement in the area that is difficult to reach. Accurate SDB in the Arctic waters is more complex by weak light, cloud, mist, floating ice and so on than in middle or lower latitude clean waters. This paper performs SDB based on Support vector regression (SVR) from multi-spectral imagery of Sentinel-2 in shallow water (0-20 m) of Pomorskiy Proliv of Northern Russia, and corrects the estimated water depth with the interpolation of residuals. The results indicate that the highest accuracy of SDB based on SVR is achieved by employing radial basis function on the full feature inputs, with the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.5 m and the mean relative error of 44.9 %. After the residual interpolation correction, the overall MAE reduces to 2.0 m, and the root mean square errors decrease by at least 0.3 m among different depth ranges. The approach provides technical support for obtaining a wide range and relatively high spatial resolution of bathymetric data in the Arctic region.  © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019.","","Arctic; residual interpolation; Satellite-derived bathymetry; support vector regression","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087173223"

However, most existing Arctic vegetation maps are at a coarse resolution and with a varying degree of detail and accuracy. Remote sensing-based approaches for mapping vegetation, while promising, are challenging in high latitude environments due to frequent cloud cover, polar darkness, and limited availability of high-resolution remote sensing datasets (e.g., ∼ 5 m). This study proposes a new remote sensing based multi-sensor data fusion approach for developing high-resolution maps of vegetation in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We focus detailed analysis and validation study around the Kougarok river, located in the central Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We seek to evaluate the integration of hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, radar, and terrain datasets using unsupervised and supervised classification techniques over a ∼343.72 km 2 area for generating vegetation classifications at a variety of resolutions (5 m and 12.5 m). We fist applied a quantitative goodness-of-fit method, called Mapcurves, that shows the degree of spatial concordance between the public coarse resolution maps and k-means clustering values and relabels the k values based on the best overlap. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for developing high resolution vegetation maps for our study region in Arctic. We compare two CNN approaches: (1) breaking up the images into small patches (e.g., 6 x 6) and predict the vegetation class for entire patch and (2) semantic segmentation and predict the vegetation class for every pixel. We also perform accuracy assessments of the developed data products and evaluate varying CNN architectures. The fusion of hyperspectral and optical datasets performed the best, with accuracy values increased from 0.64 to 0.96-0.97 when using a training map produced by unsupervised clustering and Mapcurves labeling for both CNN models. © 2017 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Convolution; Data fusion; Data mining; Ecology; Ecosystems; Fusion reactions; Image segmentation; Mapping; Neural networks; Plants (botany); Semantics; Sensor data fusion; Vegetation; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); High resolution remote sensing; Land atmosphere interaction; Multi sensor; Supervised classification; U.S. Department of Energy; Vegetation classification; Remote sensing","Fusion; Multi-Sensor; Remote Sensing; Vegetation Classificaiton","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044039720"

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios. A wide range of experiments has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed OCN for ocean color remote sensing in the subarctic region. The performance of the OCN is also presented spatially by computing chl-a maps in the Barents Sea. © 2020 IEEE.","Color; Geology; Geometrical optics; Spectroscopy; Support vector regression; Ecosystem structure; Environmental change; Gaussian process regression; Multi spectral imager; Ocean color remote sensing; Primary productivity; Reflectance spectrum; Spatial and temporal variation; Remote sensing","Barents Sea; chl-a Monitoring; Ocean Color","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102014381"

Principal goal of this campaign was to demonstrate the capabilities of SAR for security applications in arctic environments, as well as to investigate various advanced methods for extracting ice and snow parameters from SAR data. During this campaign, the ability of F-SAR to simultaneously record fully-polarimetric SAR data in several frequency bands was used for the first time on a large scale. Due to the significantly varying penetration depth of the different bands into ice and snow, it is of particular interest to understand and analyse what can be seen in each band and what are the dominating scattering processes.

Offshore zones, arctic areas, deserts, rainforests, rivers, agricultural land and cities are continuously monitored from space. There is no surface on Earth that goes unobserved by a remote sensing satellite. This transparency facilitates our modern life, offering seemingly inexhaustible opportunities. Yet, there are limits. Physical, technological and financial factors limit the development of sensors of ever-increasing accuracy. Trade-offs must be made. Optical imaging sensors compromise on either detailed spectral information, allowing for the discrimination of materials, or high spatial resolution, which elucidates the geometry of the scene. Multi-sensor data fusion mitigates these limitations. The idea is to combine complementary data of different spectral and spatial characteristics to construct products representative of an ""ideal"" synthetic sensor. This is an inherently ill-posed problem. The difficulty arises in maximizing both spatial and spectral resolutions, due to the number of degrees of freedom. This dissertation presents sophisticated solutions to two of the most demanding multi-sensor data fusion problems in remote sensing, namely pan-sharpening and the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral data. Two algorithms are thoroughly designed and tailored to the respective problems, i.e., Jointly Sparse Fusion of Images (J-SparseFI) for pan-sharpening and Jointly Sparse Fusion of Hyperspectral and Multispectral Imagery (J-SparseFI-HM) for the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral data. These severely ill-posed problems are handled by incorporating additional information, to reduce the inherent degrees of freedom and produce fusion products that better approximate the ground truth. The physical properties of the synthesized sensor are accounted for by a sensor observation model. Prior knowledge about image patches featuring sparse representations of suitable dictionaries is exploited to reduce the overall fusion problem to a large number of small, I1/2-regularized convex optimization problems. Prior information about the mutual correlation of adjacent multi- and hyperspectral channels is extensively used to robustify estimation accuracies. Both techniques leverage distributed compressive sensing theory, restricting the solution of an underdetermined system by considering a jointly sparse ensemble of signals. The J-SparseFI and J-SparseFI-HM algorithms are specifically tailored to their respective fusion problems. In J-SparseFI, a decision-based spectral and channel mutual correlation analysis is conducted to find suitable groups of multispectral channels and corresponding high-resolution source data for dictionary learning. J-SparseFI-HM incorporates a spatially adaptive Correlation-based HyperSpectral Grouping (CorHySpeG) concept and the data for dictionary learning is found via non-negative least squares regression. A novel alternating local-non-local-global optimization procedure is designed for J-SparseFI-HM, which enhances spatial consistency across individually processed patches and spectral consistency across group-wise processed hyperspectral channels. Highly parallel stand-alone software solutions are optimized for operation on the SuperMUC supercomputer of the Leibniz Supercomputing Center. Detailed parameter descriptions, sensitivity analyses and default setting recommendations are provided. The quality of the data fusion products is assessed and compared to the state-of-the-art in pan-sharpening and hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion, for a large variety of test scenarios and sensor combinations. This thesis comprehensively demonstrates that J-SparseFI and J-SparseFI-HM are new quality benchmarks for multiresolution multi-sensor data fusion.","Adaptive optics; Arid regions; Benchmarking; Convex optimization; Data fusion; Data handling; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Economic and social effects; Euler equations; Global optimization; Image fusion; Mechanics; Optimization; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Space optics; Supercomputers; Convex optimization problems; Hyperspectral Data; Joint sparse signals; Multi-spectral image fusions; Multisensor data fusion; Number of degrees of freedom; Resolution enhancement; Spectral and spatial characteristics; Sensor data fusion","Hyperspectral data processing; Joint sparse signal recovery; Multi-sensor data fusion; Remote sensing; Resolution enhancement; Signal processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037543692"

In general, very large bergs are tracked and predicted using models or satellite imagery. Small and medium bergs are detectable using conventional marine radar. As icebergs decay they shed bergy bits and growlers, which are much smaller and more difficult to detect. Their low profile above the water surface, in addition to occasional relatively high seas, makes them invisible to conventional marine radar. Visual inspection is the most common method used to detect bergy bits and growlers, but the effectiveness of visual inspections is reduced by operator fatigue and low light conditions. The potential hazard from bergy bits and growlers is further increased by short detection range (<1 km). As such, there is a need for robust and autonomous near-field detection of such smaller icebergs. This paper presents a review of iceberg detection technology and explores applications for infrared imagers in the field. Preliminary experiments are performed and recommendations are made for future work, including a proposed imager design which would be suited for near field ice detection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hazards; Ice; Imaging techniques; Infrared imaging; Microlenses; Oil field development; Petroleum prospecting; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Thermography (imaging); Ice detection; Low light conditions; Micro-lens arrays; Multispectral sensors; Oil and gas exploration; Optical imaging technology; Production operations; Sub-arctic; Marine radar","Ice detection; Infrared imaging; Micro-lens arrays; Multi-spectral sensors; Process safety in arctic and sub-arctic operations","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029856516"

C-band synthetic aperture radar and multi-spectral information (2016-2020) is exploited within a machine learning framework (gradient boosting machines and deep learning) and combined for retrieval with 10 m nominal resolution. In total, an area of 1243 km2 constitutes human-built infrastructure as of 2016-2020.

Availability of additional shipping routes, the presence of productive fishing grounds and innovative means for resource extraction have resulted in an increased human presence in the high Northern latitudes. Furthermore, the polar regions, and the Arctic in particular, are the fastest changing regions affected by climate change and play a leading role in the modelling of weather and climate change on global level. In spite of its important role, the Arctic and Nordic regions only receives limited satellite-based services. This can be partially explained by the challenging geometry experienced by typical GEO satellite missions, resulting in poor performance in the telecommunications, weather monitoring and navigation domains. This is a well-known problem for the Arctic and Nordic regions, which various spacefaring nations are looking to address. As part of its Arctic initiative, the European Space Agency (ESA) is currently considering potential synergetic missions aiming at providing telecommunications, navigation and weather monitoring services to the Arctic regions. One specific concept under investigation consists of a small two-spacecraft constellation, using a High Elliptical Orbit (HEO) at 63.4° inclination with a 16 hour orbital period as an effective method of providing around-the-clock coverage of the polar regions. For the weather and atmosphere monitoring part of the mission, a so-called Hosted Arctic Imager (HAI) concept is currently being investigated as part of ESA’s Polaris programme. HAI intends to fulfil the needs for providing weather and atmospheric services in the polar regions. These services consist of near-real-time observations of Atmospheric Motion Vectors of the Arctic and Nordic regions, similar to the measurements its Meteosat counterparts in GEO offer, such as SEVIRI on MSG and FCI on MTG, and several other data products derived from these missions for atmospheric monitoring. A number of studies have been performed under ESA contract investigating the feasibility, implementation scenarios and performance of the HAI.

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

Landscape-level maps of vegetation composition and trait distributions are required to expand spatially-limited plot studies, overcome sampling biases associated with the most accessible research areas, and create baselines from which to monitor environmental change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a low-cost method to generate high-resolution imagery and bridge the gap between fine-scale field studies and lower resolution satellite analyses. Here we used field spectroscopy data (400-2500 nm) and UAV multispectral imagery to test spectral methods of species identification and plant water and chemistry retrieval near Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Using the field spectroscopy data and Random Forest analysis, we were able to distinguish eight common High Arctic plant tundra species with 74% accuracy. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we were able to predict corresponding water, nitrogen, phosphorus and C:N values (r 2 = 0.61-0.88, RMSEmean = 12%-64%). We developed analogous models using UAV imagery (five bands: Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge and Near-Infrared) and scaled up the results across a 450 m long nutrient gradient located underneath a seabird colony. At the UAV level, we were able to map three plant functional groups (mosses, graminoids and dwarf shrubs) at 72% accuracy and generate maps of plant chemistry. Our maps show a clear marine-derived fertility gradient, mediated by geomorphology. We used the UAV results to explore two methods of upscaling plant water content to the wider landscape using Sentinel-2A imagery. Our results are pertinent for high resolution, low-cost mapping of the Arctic. © 2021 The Author(s).

Results demonstrate the capability of both airborne and spaceborne data to provide large-scale reconnaissance mapping of geologic materials over vast arctic regions where field access is limited. The distributions of three ultramafic units (dunite, peridotite, pyroxenite) and one mafic unit (gabbro) are mapped based on analyzing specific visible and near-infrared and short-wave-infrared spectral features. The extent of peridotite and dunite units mapped using both approaches is consistent with geological map, whereas pyroxenite abundance maps show different patterns in their distribution as compared to the geological map. The results suggest that EnGeoMAP method has a better performance than ISMA method for mapping the dunite unit, whilst ISMA performs better for mapping peridotite and pyroxenite rocks. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Limitations of optical data associatedwith non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet. A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments. The refinement rules are here explained by means of a detailed signature analysis of the SAR backscatter in such environments. The accuracy of the SAR-WBIwas 80%when compared against 2078 manually interpreted footprints with a size of 150 × 150 m2. Omission errors were primarily observed along coast- and shorelines whereas commission errors were associated with (i) ephemeral water bodies, (ii) seasonally inundated areas, and (iii) an incorrect choice of the local refinement. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Backscattering; Errors; Photomapping; Surface measurement; Systematic errors; C-bands; ENVISAT ASAR; Land cover; SAR; Waterbodies; algorithm; backscatter; Envisat; ephemeral lake; error analysis; global change; land cover; map generalization; observational method; spectral analysis; synthetic aperture radar; temporal variation; Synthetic aperture radar","Backscatter; C-band; Envisat ASAR; Land cover; SAR; Water body","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946542137"

Drained lake basins (DLBs) are often the most common landforms in lowland permafrost regions in the Arctic (50% to 75% of the landscape). However, detailed assessments of DLB distribution and abundance are limited. In this study, we present a novel and scalable remote sensing-based approach to identifying DLBs in lowland permafrost regions, using the North Slope of Alaska as a case study. We validated this first North Slope-wide DLB data product against several previously published sub-regional scale datasets and manually classified points. The study area covered >71,000 km2, including a >39,000 km2 area not previously covered in existing DLB datasets. Our approach used Landsat-8 multispectral imagery and ArcticDEM data to derive a pixel-by-pixel statistical assessment of likelihood of DLB occurrence in sub-regions with different permafrost and periglacial landscape conditions, as well as to quantify aerial coverage of DLBs on the North Slope of Alaska. The results were consistent with previously published regional DLB datasets (up to 87% agreement) and showed high agreement with manually classified random points (64.4–95.5% for DLB and 83.2– 95.4% for non-DLB areas). Validation of the remote sensing-based statistical approach on the North Slope of Alaska indicated that it may be possible to extend this methodology to conduct a comprehensive assessment of DLBs in pan-Arctic lowland permafrost regions. Better resolution of the spatial distribution of DLBs in lowland permafrost regions is important for quantitative studies on landscape diversity, wildlife habitat, permafrost, hydrology, geotechnical conditions, and high-lat-itude carbon cycling. © 2021 by the authors.

On northern Disko Island, previous exploration efforts have identified rare native iron occurrences and a high potential for Ni-Cu-Co-PGE-Au mineralization. However, Quaternary landslide activity has obliterated rock exposure in many places at lower elevations. To augment prospecting field work under these challenging conditions, we acquire high-resolution magnetic and multispectral remote sensing data using drones in the Qullissat area. From the data, we generate a detailed 3D model of a mineralized basalt unit, belonging to the Asuk Member of the Palaeocene Vaigat Formation. Different types of legacy data and newly acquired geo- and petrophysical as well as geochemical-mineralogical measurements form the basis of an integrated geological interpretation of the unoccupied aerial system (UAS) surveys. In this context, magnetic data aim to define the location and the shape of the buried magmatic body, and to estimate if its magnetic properties are indicative for mineralization. UAS-based multispectral orthomosaics are used to identify surficial iron staining, which serves as a proxy for outcropping sulfide mineralization. In addition, UAS-based digital surface models are created for geomorphological characterization of the landscape to accurately reveal landslide features. UAS-based magnetic data suggest that the targeted magmatic unit is characterized by a pattern of distinct positive and negative magnetic anomalies. We apply a 3D magnetization vector inversion (MVI) model to the UAS-based magnetic data to estimate the magnetic properties and shape of the magmatic body. By means of introducing constraints in the inversion, (1) UAS-based multispectral data and legacy drill cores are used to assign significant magnetic properties to areas that are associated with the mineralized Asuk Member, and (2) the Earth's magnetic and the palaeomagnetic field directions are used to evaluate the general magnetization direction in the magmatic units. Our results suggest that the geometry of the mineralized target can be estimated as a horizontal sheet of constant thickness, and that the magnetization of the unit has a strong remanent component formed during a period of Earth's magnetic field reversal. The magnetization values obtained in the MVI are in a similar range to the measured ones from a drillcore intersecting the targeted unit. Both the magnetics and topography confirm that parts of the target unit were displaced by landslides. We identified several fully detached and presumably rotated blocks in the obtained model. The model highlights magnetic anomalies that correspond to zones of mineralization and is used to identify outcrops for sampling. Our study demonstrates the potential and efficiency of using high-resolution UAS-based multi-sensor data to constrain the geometry of partially exposed geological units and assist exploration targeting in difficult or poorly exposed terrain. © 2022 Robert Jackisch et al.","Arctic; Disko Island; Greenland; 3D modeling; Antennas; Basalt; Deposits; Drones; Geomagnetism; Hematite; Iron; Landslides; Magnetic storage; Magnetic susceptibility; Magnetite; Magnetization; Magnetometers; Mineral exploration; Remote sensing; Sulfur compounds; Surveys; Topography; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Aerial systems; Green land; High resolution; Magnetic anomalies; Magnetic data; Magnetization vector; Mineralisation; Multi-spectral; airborne survey; data inversion; flood basalt; magnetic anomaly; magnetic survey; magnetization; mineral exploration; mineralization; ore deposit; remote sensing; source rock; spectral analysis; three-dimensional modeling; Mineralogy","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128717368"

The SDMSI requires a real-time embedded processor to fuse images and to create real-time depth maps for opportunistic uplink in sensor networks. Researchers at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University working with University of Alaska Anchorage at the Arctic Domain Awareness Center and the University of Colorado Boulder have built several versions of a low-cost drop-in-place SDMSI to test alternatives for power efficient image fusion. The SDMSI is intended for use in field applications including marine security, search and rescue operations and environmental surveys in the Arctic region. Based on Arctic marine sensor network mission goals, the team has designed the SDMSI to include features to rank images based on saliency and to provide on camera fusion and depth mapping. A major challenge has been the design of the camera computing system to operate within a 10 to 20 Watt power budget. This paper presents a power analysis of three options: 1) multi-core, 2) field programmable gate array with multi-core, and 3) graphics processing units with multi-core. For each test, power consumed for common fusion workloads has been measured at a range of frame rates and resolutions. Detailed analyses from our power efficiency comparison for workloads specific to stereo depth mapping and sensor fusion are summarized. Preliminary mission feasibility results from testing with off-the-shelf long-wave infrared and visible cameras in Alaska and Arizona are also summarized to demonstrate the value of the SDMSI for applications such as ice tracking, ocean color, soil moisture, animal and marine vessel detection and tracking.

Characterization of this variation is essential for understanding and modeling the functioning of the arctic tundra in global carbon cycling, as well as for evaluating the resolution requirements for remote sensing. Our objective was to quantify the seasonal development of the leaf-Area index (LAI) and its variation among plant communities in the arctic tundra near Tiksi, coastal Siberia, consisting of graminoid, dwarf shrub, moss, and lichen vegetation. We measured the LAI in the field and used two very-high-spatial resolution multispectral satellite images (QuickBird and WorldView-2), acquired at different phenological stages, to predict landscape-scale patterns. We used the empirical relationships between the plant community-specific LAI and degree-day accumulation (0 °C threshold) and quantified the relationship between the LAI and satellite NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Due to the temporal difference between the field data and satellite images, the LAI was approximated for the imagery dates, using the empirical model. LAI explained variation in the NDVI values well (R 2 adj. 0.42-0.92). Of the plant functional types, the graminoid LAI showed the largest seasonal amplitudes and was the main cause of the varying spatial patterns of the NDVI and the related LAI between the two images. Our results illustrate how the short growing season, rapid development of the LAI, yearly climatic variation, and timing of the satellite data should be accounted for in matching imagery and field verification data in the Arctic region. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia; Tiksi; Bryophyta; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Landforms; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Arctic; Biogeochemical property; Empirical relationships; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite image; Normalized difference vegetation index; Very high spatial resolutions; VHSR; arctic environment; carbon cycle; ground-based measurement; growing season; leaf area index; NDVI; phenology; plant community; QuickBird; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; spatial variation; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; tundra; vegetation dynamics; WorldView; Satellite imagery","Arctic; LAI; Multispectral; Vegetation; VHSR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030764299"

We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m^{3}, collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks. The proposed OCN model achieved reduced mean absolute error compared to the GPR by 5.2%, C2RCC by 51.7%, OC3 by 22.6%, and spectral band ratios by 29%. Moreover, the proposed spatial window and depth-integrated match-up creation techniques improved the performance of the proposed OCN by 57%, GPR by 41.9%, OC3 by 5.3%, and spectral band ratio method by 24% in terms of RMSE compared to the conventional match-up selection approach.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea; Chlorophyll; Color; Geometrical optics; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Design and implements; Empirical techniques; Gaussian process regression; Multi spectral imager; Neural network model; Optical remote sensing; Remote sensing of ocean; Spectral distribution; chlorophyll a; estimation method; machine learning; monitoring; ocean color; remote sensing; Sentinel; Image enhancement","Barents sea; Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) monitoring; ocean color (OC)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104634963"

The satellite multi-spectral data over Ganquan Island acquired by China GF-1 satellite on May 12, 2016 was converted to land surface reflection by radiometric correction with absolute calibration coefficient, geometric correction and atmospheric correction. And the Pearson correlation analysis of the single-band reflectance and dual-band reflectance ratios of 93 water depth measurements and their corresponding pixels in the study area were analyzed. The correlation analysis showed that the negative correlation of reflectance value with the single band (P <0.01), and the ratio of double band was significantly correlated with water depth (P <0.01). The Band2, Band3, Band2/Band1 and Band4/Band2, which have the highest correlations with the water depth, are selected to construct the single band model, double band model and band-ratio model, respectively. The parameters of the inversion model are obtained by the regression analysis. The results show that band ratio model of Band2/Band1 and Band4/Band2 fit the best of water depth inversion in the study area. Together with the in-situ observation of 30 stations in the study area, the RMSE, MAE and MRE methods are used to analyze the precision of the water depth inversion. The comprehensive accuracy of water depth inversion derived from the model on the selected band is 1.44m, which is better than that of traditional blue-green band, suggesting a more suitable remote sensing inversion in Ganquan Island area.

Within Arctic regions, in situ surveying presents risks to surveyors, is time consuming and costly. To better meet its mandate, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been investigating the potential of remote sensing to compliment traditional charting techniques. This paper focuses on an evaluation of sensors and techniques for operational Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) implementation. Analysis focused on Cambridge Bay, Nunavut using Pléiades, SPOT, WorldView and PlanetScope imagery. Multiple SDB techniques were applied to evaluate their agreement with in-situ bathymetric measurements: • An empirical logarithm band ratio approach. • A multiple band modeling technique. • A multi-dimensional Look-Up-Table approach. Through this analysis, CHS attempted to answer critical questions for operational SDB implementation: • Do specific optical sensors offer advantages for SDB? • Are there advantages/disadvantages with the application of SDB techniques within the examined environment? • Can multiple SDB techniques improve CHS's understanding of the confidence it can place in remotely sensed bathymetry estimates? Early results have achieved overall root mean square errors of 0.56 to 0.99 m relative to in situ survey depths for all sensors and techniques. These similarities suggest that CHS can be confident in the accuracies observed from various SDB approaches. Results do not indicate significant advantages or disadvantages of particular optical sensors, suggesting other factors contain greater importance for SDB image selection (e.g. sea floor visibility). While this analysis provides excellent information for operational empirical SDB implementation within Arctic environments, further work is required within other Canadian coastal regions to support national SDB application. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Bathymetry; Hydrographic surveys; Hydrophilicity; Mean square error; Optical sensors; Satellites; Sea ice; Table lookup; Canadian Arctic; Canadian hydrographic services; Empirical model; High resolution; Multi-spectral; Navigational Charting; Remote sensing","Canadian Arctic; Canadian Hydrographic Service; Empirical Models; High Resolution Optical; Multispectral; Navigational Charting; Remote Sensing; Satellite Derived Bathymetry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056476374"

The goals of these programs were to validate satellite-based nowcasting products, including snow amount, wind intensity, and cloud physical parameters (e.g., cloud cover), over northern latitudes with potential applications to Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. Ground-based in situ sensors and remote sensing platforms were used to measure microphysical properties of precipitation, clouds and fog, radiation, temperature, moisture and wind profiles. Multi-spectral infrared observations obtained from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-13 provided estimates of cloud top temperature and height, phase (water, ice), hydrometer size, extinction, optical depth, and horizontal wind patterns at 15 min intervals. In this work, a technique developed for identifying clouds capable of producing high snowfall rates and incorporating wind information from the satellite observations is described. The cloud top physical properties retrieved from operational satellite observations are validated using measurements obtained from the ground-based in situ and remote sensing platforms collected during two precipitation events: a blizzard heavy snow storm case and a moderate snow event.

We combined high-resolution multi-spectral remote sensing imagery from the World View-2 satellite with light detecting and ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital elevation models (DEM) to characterize the tundra landscape in and around the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO), a 3021-hectare research reserve located at the northern edge of the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain. Vegetation surveys were conducted during the growing season (June-August) of 2012 from 48 1 m × 1 m plots in the study region for estimating the percent cover of PFTs (i.e., sedges, grasses, forbs, shrubs, lichens and mosses). Statistical relationships were developed between spectral and topographic remote sensing characteristics and PFT fractions at the vegetation plots from field surveys. These derived relationships were employed to statistically upscale PFT fractions for our study region of 586 hectares at 0.25-m resolution around the sampling areas within the BEO, which was bounded by the LiDAR footprint. We employed an unsupervised clustering for stratification of this polygonal tundra landscape and used the clusters for segregating the field data for our upscaling algorithm over our study region, which was an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation. We describe two versions of PFT distribution maps upscaled by IDW from WorldView-2 imagery and LiDAR: (1) a version computed from a single image in the middle of the growing season; and (2) a version computed from multiple images through the growing season. This approach allowed us to quantify the value of phenology for improving PFT distribution estimates. We also evaluated the representativeness of the field surveys by measuring the Euclidean distance between every pixel. This guided the ground-truthing campaign in late July of 2014 for addressing uncertainty based on representativeness analysis by selecting 24 1 m × 1 m plots that were well and poorly represented. Ground-truthing indicated that including phenology had a better accuracy (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 9.94) than the single image upscaling (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 12.05) predicted from IDW.We also updated our upscaling approach to include the 24 ground-truthing plots, and a second ground-truthing campaign in late August of 2014 indicated a better accuracy for the phenology model (R2 = 0.61, RMSE = 13.78) than only using the original 48 plots for the phenology model (R2 = 0.23, RMSE = 17.49). We believe that the cluster-based IDW upscaling approach and the representativeness analysis offer new insights for upscaling high-resolution data in fragmented landscapes. This analysis and approach provides PFT maps needed to inform land surface models in Arctic ecosystems. © 2016 by the authors.","Biology; Forestry; Interpolation; Landforms; Observatories; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Surveying; Surveys; Tracking (position); Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Arctic; Clustering; Environmental observatories; Inverse distance weighted; Plant functional type; Statistical relationship; Unsupervised clustering; World views; Optical radar","Arctic; Clustering; Interpolation; Plant functional type; World View-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002943394"

Such instruments can be used shipboard or coupled with proven and available deployment platforms as AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles). With the right planning, large areas can be surveyed, and more extreme and difficult-to-reach environments can be studied. A prime example, and representing a certain navigational challenge, is the under ice in the Arctic/Antarctic or winter/polar environments or deep underwater survey. Among many marine biological substrates, numerous species of macroalgae can be found worldwide in shallow down to 70+ m (clear water) coastal habitats and are essential ecosystem service providers through the habitat they provide for other species, the potential food resource value, and carbon sink they represent. Similarly, corals also provide important ecosystem services through their structure and diversity, are found to harbor increased local diversity, and are equally valid targets as “keystone” species. Hence, we expand current underwater remote sensing methods to combine macroalgal and coral surveys via the development of a multispectral laser serial imager designed for classification via spectral response. By using multiple continuous wave laser wavelength sources to scan and illuminate recreated benthic environments composed of macroalgae and coral, we show how elastic (i.e., reflectance) and inelastic (i.e., fluorescence) spectral responses can potentially be used to differentiate algal color groups and certain coral genus. Experimentally, three laser diodes (450 nm, 490 nm, 520 nm) are sequentially used in conjunction with up to 5 emission filters (450 nm, 490 nm, 520 nm, 580 nm, 685 nm) to acquire images generated by laser line scan pattern via high-speed galvanometric mirrors. Placed directly adjacent to a large saltwater imaging tank fitted with optical viewports, the optical system records target substrate spectral response using a photomultiplier preceded by a filter and is synchronously digitized to the scan rate by a high sample rate Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Acquired images are normalized to correct for imager optical effects allowing for fluorescence intensity-based pixel segmentation via intensity thresholding. Overall, the multispectral laser serial imaging technique shows that the resulting high resolution data can be used for detection and classification of benthic substrates by their spectral response. These methods highlight a path towards eventual pixel-wise spectral response analysis for spectral differentiation. © 2022 by the authors.

Yet, previous methods have been limited by (1) the >10 m spatial resolution of public satellite imagery, (2) classification schemes that operate at the pixel level, and (3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the state-of-the-art by (1) using commercial satellite imagery with panchromatic and multispectral resolutions of ∼ 30 cm and ∼ 1.2 m, respectively, (2) developing multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral properties, and (3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery. This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird-2, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and 1–2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic; Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Earth (planet); Hydrology; Image classification; Image resolution; Learning systems; Open source software; Open systems; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Commercial satellites; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Learning models; Multi-spectral; Precision and recall; Remote-sensing; River classification; Sub meter; Training data; artificial neural network; GeoEye; hydrology; image classification; machine learning; remote sensing; river; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Remote sensing","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Hydrology; Remote sensing; Rivers","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138473621"

Current land cover products tend to underestimate the extent of mountain shrublands dominated by Ericaceae (Vaccinium spp. (species) and Rhododendron ferrugineum). In addition, mountain shrubs are often confounded with grasslands. Here, we examined the potential of anthocyanin-responsive vegetation indices to provide more accurate maps of mountain shrublands in a mountain range located in the French Alps. We relied on the multi-spectral instrument onboard the Sentinel-2A and 2B satellites and the availability of red-edge bands to calculate a Normalized Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (NARI). We used this index to quantify the autumn accumulation of anthocyanin in canopies dominated by Vaccinium spp. and Rhododendron ferrugineum and compared the effectiveness of NARI to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a basis for shrubland mapping. Photointerpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery, intensive field campaigns, and floristic surveys provided complementary data to calibrate and evaluate model performance. The proposed NARI-based model performed better than the NDVI-based model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 against 0.58. Validation of shrub cover maps based on NARI resulted in a Kappa coeffcient of 0.67, which outperformed existing land cover products and resulted in a ten-fold increase in estimated area occupied by Ericaceae-dominated shrublands. We conclude that the Sentinel-2 red-edge band provides novel opportunities to detect seasonal anthocyanin accumulation in plant canopies and discuss the potential of our method to quantify long-term dynamics of shrublands in alpine and arctic contexts. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Anthocyanins; Biodiversity; Forestry; Mapping; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing; Landforms","Anthocyanin; Dwarf shrubs; European Alps; Land cover mapping; NARI; Optical remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076564830"

This contrasts with the current availability of affordable and efficient snow monitoring methods. In this study, a novel approach is presented to determine spatial snow depth distribution in challenging alpine terrain that was tested during a field campaign performed in the Tarfala valley, Kebnekaise mountains, northern Sweden, in April 2019. The combination of a multispectral camera and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was used to derive three-dimensional (3D) snow surface models via Structure from Motion (SfM) with direct georeferencing. The main advantage over conventional photogrammetric surveys is the utilization of accurate Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning which enables direct georeferencing of the images, and therefore eliminates the need for ground control points. The proposed method is capable of producing high-resolution 3D snow-covered surface models (<7 cm/pixel) of alpine areas up to eight hectares in a fast, reliable and affordable way. The test sites’ average snow depth was 160 cm with an average standard deviation of 78 cm. The overall Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSE) of the snow depth range from 11.52 cm for data acquired in ideal surveying conditions to 41.03 cm in aggravated light and wind conditions. Results of this study suggest that the red components in the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., the red, red edge, and near-infrared (NIR) band, contain the majority of information used in photogrammetric processing. The experiments highlighted a significant influence of the multi-spectral imagery on the quality of the final snow depth estimation as well as a strong potential to reduce processing times and computational resources by limiting the dimensionality of the imagery through the application of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction. The proposed method is part of closing the scale gap between discrete point measurements and regional-scale remote sensing and complements large-scale remote sensing data and snow model output with an adequate validation source. © 2022 The Authors","Kebnekaise Massif; Norrbotten; Sweden; Tarfala Valley; Aerial photography; Antennas; Infrared devices; Landforms; Mean square error; Photogrammetry; Quality control; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Arctic environments; Cryosphere; Depth Estimation; Direct georeferencing; Multispectral imagery; Principal-component analysis; Quality prediction; Snow depths; Snow quality; Surface modeling; estimation method; model validation; photogrammetry; pixel; satellite imagery; snow cover; spectral analysis; unmanned vehicle; Principal component analysis","Cryosphere; Direct georeferencing; Photogrammetry; Principal component analysis; Snow depth; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124322283"

Under a warming climate, landscapes with highly ice‐rich Yedoma Ice Complex (IC) deposits are particularly vulnerable, and thermokarst lake area dynamics serve as an indicator for their response to climate change. We conducted lake change trend analysis for a 44,500 km2 region of the Kolyma Lowland using Landsat imagery in conjunction with TanDEM‐X digital elevation model and Quaternary Geology map data. We delineated yedoma–alas relief types with different yedoma fractions, serving as a base for geospatial analysis of lake area dynamics. We quantified lake changes over the 1999–2018 period using machine‐learning‐based classification of robust trends of multi‐spectral indices of Landsat data and object‐based long‐term lake detection. We analyzed the lake area dynamics sep-arately for 1999–2013 and 1999–2018 periods, including the most recent five years that were char-acterized by very high precipitation. Comparison of drained lake basin area with thermokarst lake extents reveal the overall limnicity decrease by 80% during the Holocene. Current climate warming and wetting in the region led to a lake area increase by 0.89% for the 1999–2013 period and an increase by 4.15% for the 1999–2018 period. We analyzed geomorphological factors impacting modern lake area changes for both periods such as lake size, elevation, and yedoma–alas relief type. We detected a lake area expansion trend in high yedoma fraction areas indicating ongoing Yedoma IC degradation by lake thermokarst. Our concept of differentiating yedoma–alas relief types helps to characterize landscape‐scale lake area changes and could potentially be applied for refined assessments of greenhouse gas emissions in Yedoma regions. Comprehensive geomor-phological inventories of Yedoma regions using geospatial data provide a better understanding of the extent of thermokarst processes during the Holocene and the pre‐conditioning of modern thermokarst lake area dynamics. © 2021 by the authors.

Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter-gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants. The methods described here could contribute to building better survey strategies and archaeological predictive models for elsewhere in the Brooks Range and Alaska. © 2015.","","Alaska; Archaeology; Arctic; Hunter-gatherers; Multi-spectral analysis; Prehistoric sites; Satellite imagery; Site prospection; Site reconnaissance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930960342"

To date, only indices from multispectral data have been used in these environments to address biomass and vegetation changes over time. The retrieval of vegetation height itself has not been attempted so far over larger areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) holds promise for canopy modeling over large extents, but the high variability of near-surface soil moisture during the snow-free season is a major challenge for application of SAR in tundra for such a purpose. We hypothesized that tundra vegetation height can be derived from multispectral indices as well as from C-band SAR data acquired in winter (close to zero liquid water content). To test our hypothesis, we used C-band SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2. Results show that vegetation height can be derived with an RMSE of 44 cm from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and 54 cm from Tasseled Cap Wetness index (TC). Retrieval from C-band SAR shows similar performance, but C-VV is more suitable than C-HH to derive vegetation height (RMSEs of 48 and 56 cm respectively). An exponential relationship with in situ height was evident for all tested parameters (NDVI, TC, C-VV and C-HH) suggesting that the C-band SAR and multi-spectral approaches possess similar capabilities including tundra biomass retrieval. Errors might occur in specific settings as a result of high surface roughness, high photosynthetic activity in wetlands or high snow density. We therefore introduce a method for combined use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 to address the ambiguities related to Arctic wetlands and barren rockfields. Snow-related deviations occur within tundra fire scars in permafrost areas in the case of C-VV use. The impact decreases with age of the fire scar, following permafrost and vegetation recovery. The evaluation of masked C-VV retrievals across different regions, tundra types and sources (in situ and circumpolar vegetation community classification from satellite data) suggests pan-Arctic applicability to map current conditions for heights up to 160 cm. The presented methodology will allow for new applications and provide advanced insight into changing environmental conditions in the Arctic. © 2019 The Authors","Arctic; Biomass; Climate change; Forestry; Permafrost; Radar; Snow; Soil moisture; Surface roughness; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Environmental conditions; Multispectral indices; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical; Photosynthetic activity; Shrubs; Tasseled cap wetness; Tundra; biomass; climate change; environmental conditions; feasibility study; NDVI; permafrost; satellite data; Sentinel; shrub; soil moisture; soil-vegetation interaction; synthetic aperture radar; tundra; vegetation type; Vegetation","Optical; Radar; Shrubs; Tundra; Vegetation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076042309"

At the same time, climate change impacts are pronounced in the Arctic. Ground temperatures are, for example, increasing as well as coastal erosion. A consistent account of the current human footprint is needed in order to evaluate the impact on the environments as well as risk for infrastructure. Identification of roads and settlements with satellite data is challenging due to the size of single features and low density of clusters. Spatial resolution and spectral characteristics of satellite data are the main issues regarding their separation. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 and-2 missions recently provided good spatial coverage and at the same time comparably high pixel spacing starting with 10 m for modes available across the entire Arctic. The purpose of this study was to assess the capabilities of both, Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Sentinel-2 multispectral information for Arctic focused mapping. Settings differ across the Arctic (historic settlements versus industrial, locations on bedrock versus tundra landscapes) and reference data are scarce and inconsistent.

The machine learning approaches Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation have been tested. Records for the Alaskan North Slope, Western Greenland, and Svalbard in addition to high-resolution satellite data have been used for validation and calibration. Deep learning is superior to GBM with respect to users accuracy. GBM therefore requires comprehensive postprocessing. SAR provides added value in case of GBM. VV is of benefit for road identification and HH for detection of buildings. Unfortunately, the Sentinel-1 acquisition strategy is varying across the Arctic. The majority is covered in VV+VH only. DL is of benefit for road and building detection but misses large proportions of other human-impacted areas, such as gravel pads which are typical for gas and oil fields. A combination of results from both GBM (Sentinel-1 and-2 combined) and DL (Sentinel-2; Sentinel-1 optional) is therefore suggested for circumpolar mapping. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptive boosting; Climate change; Deep learning; Mapping; Oil fields; Roads and streets; Satellites; Semantics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Acquisition strategies; Classification approach; High resolution satellite data; Impact on the environment; Industrial development; Machine learning approaches; Semantic segmentation; Spectral characteristics; Classification (of information)","Arctic; Infrastructure; Machine learning; Multi-spectral; SAR; Settlements","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089689584"

They are globally important components of the biogeochemical carbon cycle and have potential feedback effects on climate. These northern waters are mostly small lakes and ponds, and although they may be mapped using very high-resolution satellites or aerial photography, these approaches are generally not suitable for monitoring purposes, due to the cost and limited availability of such images. In this study we evaluated the potential use of widely available high-resolution imagery from Sentinel-2 (S2) for the characterization of the spectral reflectance of thermokarst lakes and ponds. Specifically, we aimed to define the minimum lake area that could be reliably imaged, and to identify challenges and solutions for remote sensing of such waters in the future. The study was conducted in subarctic Canada, in the vicinity of Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik (Nunavik, Québec), an area in the sporadic permafrost zone with numerous thermokarst waterbodies that vary greatly in size. Ground truthing lake reflectance data were collected using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) fitted with a multispectral camera that collected images at 13 cm resolution. The results were compared with reflectance from Sentinel-2 images, and the effect of lake area on the reflectance response was assessed. Our results show that Sentinel-2 imagery was suitable for waterbodies larger than 350 m2 once their boundaries were defined, which in the two test sites would allow monitoring from 11% to 30% of the waterbodies and 73% to 85% of the total lake area. Challenges for remote sensing of small lakes include the confounding effects of water reflection (both direct radiation and diffuse), wind and shadow. Given the small threshold area and frequent revisit time, Sentinel-2 provides a valuable approach towards the continuous monitoring of waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes such as those found in thermokarst landscapes. UASs provide a complementary approach for ground truthing and boundary definition. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerial photography; Antennas; Permafrost; Ponding; Ponds; Radiation effects; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Small satellites; Continuous monitoring; High resolution imagery; Multi-spectral cameras; Sentinel-2; Spectral reflectances; Subarctic; Unmanned aerial systems; Very high resolution; Lakes","Lakes; Permafrost; Ponds; Reflectance; Satellite; Sentinel-2; Subarctic; Unmanned Aerial Systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065042534"

The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring.

The revisit interval between successive overpasses varies in space and time in a complex manner because of a variety of factors and particularly because of the different sensor orbits. The temporal availability of PlanetScope imagery is quantified in this study considering all of the publicly available images acquired globally for a 12 month period from December 1st 2019 to November 30th 2020. A total of 175.8 million images were acquired by the constellation that was composed of between 100 and 133 unique PlanetScope sensors each month and three sensor generations. The local morning overpass times of the three sensor generations were quantified and the most frequently occurring times were 10:16, 10:29, and 10:03 (to the nearest minute) with 90% of the images acquired with a range of morning overpass times of 2 h and 13 min, 1 h and 30 min, and 1 h and 50 min, for PlanetScope-0, PlanetScope-1, and PlanetScope-2, respectively. Maps, histograms and summary statistics of the total number of observations and revisit intervals are derived with respect to a global grid of 4.7 million land points spaced 5.6 km apart in the equal area sinusoidal projection. The annual and monthly number of PlanetScope observations and average revisit intervals did not vary in a geographically uniform manner. This is due to several factors including the different PlanetScope orbits, seasonal high latitude darkness at the time of sensor overpass, and because of the changing number of sensors on orbit as PlanetScope sensors were decommissioned and later generations became operational over the 12 month study period. In addition, the images in each frame of sensed data are not made available if they cannot be geolocated due to cloud and/or featureless or unstructured terrain precluding ground control matching. The PlanetScope constellation provided higher temporal resolution than provided by sensors such as Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2 although 9% of the global land grid locations, predominantly in the interior of Greenland and non-coastal Antarctica, had no observations. Considering the 12 months of global observations, the median average revisit interval was only 30.3 h, and 9.6%, 71.8%, and 88.4% of the land points had average revisit intervals <24 h, <36 h, and < 48 h, respectively. Globally, the median minimum revisit interval was 25 s and the median maximum revisit interval was 9.15 days; 95.4% of the land grid points had a minimum revisit <180 s, and 89.1% had a maximum revisit <480 h (20 days). The PlanetScope images are labelled as “standard” or as “test” quality based on solar geometry, saturated pixel, and geolocation accuracy criteria. The median annual proportion of observations labelled as “standard” at each land grid point over the 12 months was 78.14%. A global cloud analysis was undertaken to quantify the probability of there being at least one and at least two cloud-free PlanetScope observations within 5, 7 and 10 day consecutive periods. Lower probabilities occurred in cloudy regions and where there were fewer observations. The global mean average probability of there being at least one cloud-free observation over the 12 study months was 0.84, 0.88 and 0.92 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The global mean average probability of there being at least two cloud-free observations was 0.65, 0.76 and 0.84 for the 5, 7 and 10 day periods respectively. The probabilities varied seasonally and the northern hemisphere winter (December–February) and spring (March–May) had lower and higher global mean average seasonal probabilities, respectively, than those derived over the 12 months. The high temporal global coverage provided by the PlanetScope constellation will benefit new applications in particular those concerned with assessment of rapidly changing phenomena and assessment of phenomena that cannot be resolved at moderate and coarse resolution. © 2021 The Author(s)","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Image acquisition; Infrared devices; Rock mechanics; Constellation; Cubesats; Global coverage; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observation; Overpass time; Planetscope; Revisit interval; Temporal availability; Three sensors; global change; ground control; histogram; image analysis; Landsat; near infrared; satellite constellation; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; temporal variation; Orbits","Cloud; Constellation; CubeSats; Near coincident sensor observation; Number of observations; Overpass time; PlanetScope; Revisit interval","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109568001"

However, these hydrologic features remain poorly studied mainly because they are too narrow (typically <30 m) to be reliably delineated in conventional moderate-resolution satellite images (e.g., 30 m Landsat-8 imagery). This study demonstrates the utility of 10 m Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument images to map supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap, covering a total area of ∼10,000 km2. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 both capture overall supraglacial drainage patterns, but Sentinel-2 images are superior to Landsat-8 images for delineating narrow and continuous supraglacial rivers. Sentinel-2 mapping across the three study areas reveals a variety of supraglacial drainage patterns. In northwest Greenland near Inglefield Land, subparallel supraglacial rivers up to 55 km long drain meltwater directly off the ice sheet onto the proglacial zone. On the Devon and the Barnes ice caps, shorter supraglacial rivers (up to 15–30 km long) are commonly interrupted by moulins, which drain internally drained catchments on the ice surface to subglacial systems. We conclude that Sentinel-2 offers strong potential for investigating supraglacial meltwater drainage patterns and improving our understanding of the hydrological conditions of ice masses globally. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Barnes Ice Cap; Canada; Canada; Devon Ice Cap; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Nunavut; catchment; glacial hydrology; image analysis; Landsat; meltwater; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Greenland Ice Sheet; Landsat-8; River remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial River; Surface hydrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062844448"

Quad-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is useful for assessing surface roughness, but few studies have applied it for geological mapping. Located in the Canadian Arctic, Axel Heiberg Island is a suitable site for exploring remote predictive geologic mapping techniques that combine quad-polarimetric SAR and multispectral datasets. The island has extensive rock exposure, with little interference from vegetation and snow in late summer. Axel Heiberg Island has the second highest concentration of salt diapirs globally. As a result, it also hosts extensive secondary salt deposits that have been weathered and precipitated away from their source. Because diapirs frequently provide structural traps for petroleum reservoirs, it is important to distinguish between diapiric and non-diapiric salt during early exploration. This study maps diapirs and secondary salts using multispectral data and characterizes them in polarimetric SAR. Diapirs appear rough in C-Band and L-Band radar, whereas the secondary salts appear smooth at both (cm–dm) scales. Field observations confirm salt diapirs are rough at the millimeter–meter scales, whereas secondary salts precipitate on smoother surfaces. These results show that radar can help differentiate between diapiric and secondary salt exposures, which will assist in future resource exploration. ©, Copyright © CASI.","Geological surveys; Mapping; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Polarimeters; Remote sensing; Salt tectonics; Salts; Surface roughness; Field observations; Geologic mapping; Geological mapping; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral datasets; Multispectral remote sensing; Polarimetric SAR; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066014157"

However, any mapping of IWPs at regional to continental scales requires images acquired on different sensor platforms (particularly satellite) and a refined understanding of the performance stability of the method across sensor platforms through reliable evaluation assessments. In this study, we examined the transferability of a deep learning Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model for mapping IWPs in satellite remote sensing imagery (~0.5 m) covering 272 km2 and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (0.02 m) imagery covering 0.32 km2. Multi-spectral images were obtained from theWorldView-2 satellite sensor and pan-sharpened to ~0.5 m, and a 20 mp CMOS sensor camera onboard a UAV, respectively. The training dataset included 25,489 and 6022 manually delineated IWPs from satellite and fixed-wing aircraft aerial imagery near the Arctic Coastal Plain, northern Alaska. Quantitative assessments showed that individual IWPs were correctly detected at up to 72% and 70%, and delineated at up to 73% and 68% F1 score accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively. Expert-based qualitative assessments showed that IWPs were correctly detected at good (40-60%) and excellent (80-100%) accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively, and delineated at excellent (80-100%) level for both images. We found that (1) regardless of spatial resolution and spectral bands, the deep learning Mask R-CNN model effectively mapped IWPs in both remote sensing satellite and UAV images; (2) the model achieved a better accuracy in detection with finer image resolution, such as UAV imagery, yet a better accuracy in delineation with coarser image resolution, such as satellite imagery; (3) increasing the number of training data with different resolutions between the training and actual application imagery does not necessarily result in better performance of the Mask R-CNN in IWPs mapping; (4) and overall, the model underestimates the total number of IWPs particularly in terms of disjoint/incomplete IWPs. © 2020, by the authors.","Aerial photography; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Arctic vehicles; Convolutional neural networks; Fixed wings; Image resolution; Learning systems; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Training aircraft; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Arctic coastal plains; Different resolutions; High resolution satellites; Qualitative assessments; Quantitative assessments; Remote sensing satellites; Satellite remote sensing; Very high spatial resolutions; Deep learning","Arctic; Deep learning; Ice-wedge polygons; Mask R-CNN; UAV; WorldView-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084263212"

Multispectral analysis was accomplished through band ratios, MNF transform, and spectral matching algorithms, from which 4 distinct spectral units were defined. Polarimetric SAR decompositions also showed different scattering mechanisms for these 4 units indicating different surface roughness properties. These multispectral and polarimetric SAR observations were combined with detailed surface textures and morphological features as visible in very high-resolution Quickbird imagery (61 cm/pixel). Remote sensing parameters and their thresholds for characterizing each unit were implemented into a decision-tree algorithm and a remote predictive geological map was produced. Subsequent field and follow-up laboratory investigations enabled the ground-truthing of these predictions. The geological units were defined as follows: (i) (smooth) fluvioglacial deposits, (ii) (moderately rough) chert-bearing dolostone, (iii) (rough) dolostone, and (iv) (rough) dolostone covered by silicified surfaces. The rough surfaces characterized by multiple scattering in the polarimetric SAR decomposition correspond to the occurrences of weathered carbonate rocks, which are relatively resistant to weathering and form blocky surfaces. This shows that SAR-derived surface roughness properties can greatly contribute to defining geological units by combining with lithological mapping. © 2019, Copyright © CASI.","Data fusion; Data mining; Decision trees; Forestry; Lithology; Mapping; Polarimeters; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Surface roughness; Surface scattering; Textures; Trees (mathematics); Weathering; Decision-tree algorithm; Laboratory investigations; Morphological features; Multi-spectral analysis; Polarimetric SAR data; Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars; Scattering mechanisms; Spectral matching algorithms; Synthetic aperture radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060731925"

The concept for the camera system from the start has been to build a sensor node that is drop-in-place for simple roof, marine, pole-mount, or buoy-mounts. After several years of component testing, the integrated SDMSI is now being tested, first on a roof-mount at Embry Riddle Prescott. The roof-mount testing demonstrates simple installation for the high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution SDMSI. The goal is to define and develop software and systems technology to complement satellite remote sensing and human monitoring of key resources such as drones, aircraft and marine vessels in and around airports, roadways, marine ports and other critical infrastructure. The SDMSI was installed at Embry Riddle Prescott in fall 2016 and continuous recording of long-wave infrared and visible images have been assessed manually and compared to salient object detection to automatically record only frames containing objects of interest (e.g. aircraft and drones). It is imagined that ultimately users of the SDMSI can pair with it via wireless to browse salient images. Further, both ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) and S-AIS (Satellite Automatic Identification System) data are envisioned to be used by the SDMSI to form expectations for observing in future tests. This paper presents the preliminary results of several experiments and compares human review with smart image processing in terms of the receiver-operator characteristic. The system design and software are open architecture, such that other researchers are encouraged to construct and participate in sharing results and networking identical or improved versions of the SDMSI for safety, security and drop-in-place scientific image sensor networking. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.
