Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regression-based unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome. © 2022 The Authors","Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mackenzie Delta; Northwest Territories; Competition; Ecology; Forestry; Image classification; Landforms; Landsat; Machine components; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Fractional cover; Greening; LANDSAT; Mackenzie delta; Multi-temporal; Plant functional type; Shrubification; Spectral unmixing; Tundra; Vegetation change; ecosystem structure; herb; machine learning; vegetation cover; Decision trees","Greening; Mackenzie Delta; Shrubification; Spectral unmixing; Tundra; Vegetation change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138797245"

In the last decades due to global climate changes and construction in the coastal zone, the rates of retreat have increased at many sites so that a large part of accumulative coasts turned to erosional. We studied a 7 km long section of the western coast of the Gydan Peninsula in the area of Salman gas field development. Based on multi-temporal satellite imagery interpretation, field geological and topography surveys, we assessed the dynamics of the coast for the periods before and after the facilities' construction. The coast at the area of study is a low-lying (0.5-2 m high) sandy accumulative marine terrace, and before the start of construction (2012-2014) it showed low dynamics with predominantly accumulative processes: mean rate of coastline progradation was 4.1 m/yr. With the beginning of port construction, the dynamics of the coast have changed: in 2014-2017 ¾ of the coast of the studied area experienced retreat (average retreat rate -5.8 m/yr, up to 28.5 m/yr in close proximity of the constructed facilities). We propose that coastal erosion intensification results from human impacts. After 2017, the rates of coastal destruction decreased, but the trend towards retreat continued. © 2021 Lulea University of Technology.

However, radar interferometry can also be used in many other applications, in particular for monitoring seasonal variability of hard-to-reach areas. Small Arctic islands are “white spots” on maps, due to the fact that since the 1950s the cartographic information on them has not been updated, and its updating with the use of ground measurements or images in the optical range is very labor- and resource-intensive. Meanwhile, in the conditions of global climate change, such islands are the most susceptible to transformations. Small Arctic islands can therefore serve as markers of warming processes, for which it is necessary to designate indicators for monitoring environmental changes. The presented work demonstrates the application of interferometric coherence to study seasonal variability. The multitemporal coherence composite (MTC), widely used as a change indicator for agricultural areas, was applied to assess changes in Arctic Vise Island. With the help of the multitemporal composite, the characteristic features of seasonal surface variability at different times of the year were determined on the example of Vise Island. For this purpose, all available interferometric radar data from Sentinel-1 satellite on the territory of the island were processed. Vise (a total of 88 images). A detailed analysis of the MTC composites was performed for 2019, the year for which the largest number of coherence maps was obtained, which was 26. We obtained data on the periods of ice-free water area closest to the island and snow-free surface over the past five years, provided by Sentinel-1 surveys. The conducted study will serve as a basis for creating thematic maps for the territory of Vise Island in the future. © 2021 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, there is a need for improved monitoring of snow for the benefit of forecasting, impact assessments and the population at large. Remotely sensed techniques prove useful for remote areas where there are few field-based monitoring stations. This paper reports on a study of snow season using snow cover area fraction data from the two northernmost counties in Norway, Troms and Finnmark. The data are derived from the daily 500 m standard snow product (MOD10A1) from the NASA Terra MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor for the 2000-2010 period. This dataset has been processed with multi-temporal interpolation to eliminate clouds. The resulting cloud-free daily time series of snow cover fraction maps, have subsequently been used to derive the first and last snow-free day for the entire study area. In spring, the correlation between the first snow-free day mapped by MODIS data and snow data from 40 meteorological stations was highly significant (p < 0.05) for 36 of the stations, and with a of bias of less than 10 days for 34 of the stations. In autumn, 31 of the stations show highly significant (p < 0.05) correlation with MODIS data, and the bias was less than 10 days for 27 of the stations. However, in some areas and some years, the start and end of the snow season could not be detected due to long overcast periods. In spring 2002 and 2004 the first snow-free day was early, but arrived late in 2000, 2005 and 2008. In autumn 2009 snowfall arrived more than 7 days earlier in 50% of the study area as compared to the 2000-2010 average. MODIS-based snow season products will be applicable for a wide range of sectors including hydrology, nature-based industries, climate change studies and ecology. Therefore refinement and further testing of this method should be encouraged. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Arctic; Finnmark; Norway; Troms; Climate change; Image reconstruction; NASA; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Daily time series; Field-based monitoring; first snow free day; Impact assessments; last snow free day; Meteorological station; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer sensors; MODIS; climate change; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; seasonal variation; snow cover; spatiotemporal analysis; spring (season); Terra (satellite); United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Snow","climate change; first snow free day; last snow free day; MODIS; onset of spring; snow","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008193658"

These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area ~ 3 × 104 km2) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (~7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (~400 m) to high elevations (~1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32–45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84–96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800–1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400–800 m) elevation bands, and the 800–1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Climate models; Flow velocity; Glaciers; Ice; Lakes; Runoff; Area fraction; Flow regimes; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Rivers and lakes; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface meltwater; Surface runoffs; climate modeling; correlation; flow control; flow velocity; ice flow; ice sheet; melting; meltwater; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; temporal analysis; water depth; Rivers","Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface runoff","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111800258"

The nature and degree of its impact on natural ecosystems over a long, since 1935, history of its work, varied along with changes in production volumes under different forms of ownership, and the response of ecosystems developed against the background of climate warming. Based on a review of studies carried out in the region, periods with different ratios of technogenic and natural factors in the dynamics of ecosystems are distinguished, which also differ in the methods of their study. In the second half of the 20th century, in the 1970s-1990s, an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere led to the drying up of larch forests at a distance of up to 120 km southeast of the plant, recorded by aerial photography and forest pathological studies, as well as by a map of the ecosystems state, compiled by Landsat imagery and MSU field research. At the end of the 20th century, after the collapse of the USSR, an interruption in the operation of the plant, which passed from state to private ownership, led to a decrease in production rates and emissions into the atmosphere. This was combined with climate warming, which intensified in the Arctic regions. Complex expeditionary work of Siberian scientists in the first decades of the XXI century, including geochemical and dendrochronological studies, fixed the boundaries of zones of varying degrees of disturbance of ecosystems, but at the same time showed that along with the continuing degradation of vegetation, partial restoration of ecosystems is taking place. At the end of the second decade of the XXI century, Russian and American scientists, based on the processing of large volumes of remote sensing data, based on a multi-temporal analysis of vegetation indices, discovered the ""greening"" of low habitats in the Norilsk region as a result of secondary succession with a complex interaction of technogenic and natural, primarily climatic, factors. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Land-cover classification maps of the Arctic regions are essential for monitoring and change detection purposes, as well as upscaling of various ecosystem processes. However, large-scale land cover maps of the Arctic regions are often too coarse to properly capture the heterogeneity of these landscapes. In this study, we bridge this gap through incorporating multi temporal Landsat-8 OLI data in a large-scale land cover classification, and subsequently produce a tundra classification map for the entire Greenland. An algorithm is developed that allows for the extraction of vegetation phenology from single-year time series of 4169 OLI scenes at 30 m resolution despite the low revisit frequency of the satellite and persistent cloud cover. The phenological metrics, satellite-derived wetness, and terrain information are then used to separate land surface classes using a random forest classifier. The optimal algorithm parameters and input layers are identified, ultimately yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 89.25% across the studied area. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on the resulting land-cover map and for the first time presented the geographical distribution, latitudinal gradients, and climate linkages of the various tundra vegetation classes across the ice-free part of Greenland.

Satellite remote sensing shows that over the past three decades, the Grinnell and Terra Nivea ice caps, the southernmost ice caps in the eastern Canadian Arctic, have decreased in area by 18% and 22% respectively, which corresponds to a total area decline of 68 km2 since mapping done in the late 1950s. Cumulative ice loss since the mid-1970s has occurred at a rate of −1.69 km2/yr. The Grinnell ice cap has declined in area by −0.57 km2/yr, while the larger Terra Nivea ice cap has lost ice at a rate of −1.1 km2/yr. Interior thinning has led to the exposure of nunataks far from ice margins, and outlet glaciers have retreated substantial distances up-valley. The rapid reduction in ice area is linked directly to increasing summer air temperatures and suggests that these ice caps are in disequilibrium with recent climate conditions.

Limitations of optical data associatedwith non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet. A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments.

Additionally, these charts may have been compiled using inadequate data and contain unsurveyed areas. However, with more days per year of diminished Arctic sea-ice coverage, including along the North Slope, marine transportation in this region has increased during the past decade, thus increasing the need for updated nautical charts. Due to limited resources available for U.S. Arctic surveying, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is evaluating the capabilities of satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). This technology has proven useful as a reconnaissance tool in tropical and subtropical waters and clear-water conditions, especially over sandy seafloor. But in the Arctic, glacial flour from land reduces water clarity and limits the light penetration depth, which may affect SDB calculations. A new multi-temporal SDB approach is described in this paper using multiple images to extract ""clear water"" areas acquired on different dates. As a proof-of-concept, the extinction depth and bathymetry were calculated over areas that overlap with NOAA Charts 16081 and 16082 using Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery. The derived and charted bathymetry are similar in most areas up to 4.5 m deep. The results of the study also identified a potential uncharted shoal. The multi-temporal SDB approach was further investigated by NOAA and was used to process imagery for other areas along Alaska's North Slope. As a result, the new editions of NOAA Chart 16081 include the location of a potential uncharted shoal, which is the first time an SDB product was utilized for a NOAA chart. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.","Alaska; Arctic; North Slope; United States; bathymetry; ice cover; identification method; Landsat; navigation; NOAA satellite; satellite data; satellite imagery; sea ice","Arctic; navigation charts; satellite-derived bathymetry; water clarity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008684136"

In the study area, the presence of permafrost makes the erosional coasts vulnerable to rising temperatures. The increase in air temperatures contributes to the thawing of coastal sediments and their accelerated destruction. And a decrease in sea ice area potentially increases the wave fetch. The rapidly changing climate of the Arctic should influence the processes of destruction of frozen coasts. At West Yamal Peninsula near Cape Kharasavey the average coastal retreat rate is 1.1 m per year (1977-2016) for 7 km of coastline. Based on the analysis of multi-temporal aerial and space images, it has been established that the maximum retreat rates are typical of coastal segments composed of icy sediments. As for temporal variability, the maximum rate of destruction was observed in 1977-1988 (up to 6.5 m per year) immediately after the beginning of economic development of the territory. In this key site, human impact affects the rate of coastal destruction more than variations in hydrometeorological parameters. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Antennas; Hazards; Petroleum prospecting; Sea ice; Air temperature; Changing climate; Coastal retreat; Coastal sediments; Economic development; Multi-temporal; Rising temperatures; Temporal variability; Gas condensates","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072978498"

Although depositional processes in these environments are of high interest to climate as well as Mars-analog research, several parameters, e.g., debris flow recurrence periods, remain poorly constrained. Here, we present an investigation based on remote sensing as well as in situ data of a ~ 0.4 km2 large colluvial fan in Hanaskogdalen, central Spitsbergen. We analyzed high resolution satellite and aerial images covering five decades from 1961 to 2014 and correlated them with lichenometric dating as well as meteorological data. Image analyses and lichenometry deliver consistent results and show that the recurrence period of large debris flows (≥ 400 m3) is about 5 to 10 years, with smaller flows averaging at two per year in the period from 2008 to 2013. While this is up to two orders of magnitude shorter than previous estimates for Svalbard (80 to 500 years), we found the average volume of ~ 220 m3 per individual flow to be similar to previous estimates for the region. Image data also reveal that an avulsion took place between 1961 and 1976, when the active part of the fan moved from its eastern to its western portion. A case study of the effects of a light rain event (~ 5 mm/day) in the rainy summer of 2013, which triggered a large debris flow, further shows that even light precipitation can trigger major flows. This is made possible by multiple light rain events or gradual snow melt pre-saturating the permafrost ground and has to be taken into account when predicting the likelihood of potentially hazardous mass wasting in polar regions. Furthermore, our findings imply a current net deposition rate on the colluvial fan of ~ 480 m3/year, which is slightly less than the integrated net deposition rate of 576 to 720 m3/year resulting from the current fan volume divided by the 12,500 to 10,000 years since the onset of fan build-up after the area's deglaciation. However, the actual deposition rate, which should increase in a warmer climate including more rain, cannot be constrained due to effects like ongoing toe-cutting of the debris fan and some flows only causing internal redistributions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; debris flow; deposition; image analysis; observational method; polar region; precipitation (climatology); remote sensing; satellite imagery","Colluvial fan; Debris flow; Recurrence period; Svalbard","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033405494"

However, it can be severely distorted, particularly in the case of L-band SAR systems mainly due to a frequent occurrence of ionospheric effects in the polar region. In this study, we developed an efficient method to extract and correct the ionospheric contribution from SAR offset tracking measurements. The method exploits an iterative directional filtering approach, which is based on the pattern and directionality of ionospheric streaks. The measurement performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three L-band advanced land observing satellite phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar pairs. Our results showed that the proposed correction achieved the improved measurement accuracies from 4.68-23.88 to 1.03-1.51 m/yr. It means that the accuracies of corrected measurements were about 5-16 times better than those of the original measurements. From the results, we concluded that our correction technique is highly suitable for the precise measurement of the glacier displacements even in the presence of strong ionospheric effects. Using the proposed method, the variations of glacier velocities were measured in the Vylki, Shury, and Kropotnika glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, which is located in the Russian Arctic Ocean, and the grounding zones were detected from the measurements in the Shury and Kropotnika glaciers. It further confirmed that the proposed correction method is allowed for the precise monitoring of glacier movements. However, in cases of severe ionosphere-distorted measurements, the proposed method may be limitedly applied. © 2017 IEEE.","Arctic Ocean; Arkhangelsk [Russian Federation]; Novaya Zemlya; Russian Federation; Ionosphere; Iterative methods; Radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Advanced land observing satellites; Correction techniques; Directional filtering; Ionospheric correction; Measurement accuracy; Multi-temporal analysis; Phased array type l-band synthetic aperture radars; Precise measurements; displacement; glacier; ionosphere; measurement method; observational method; polar region; synthetic aperture radar; tracking; Radar measurement","Glacier velocity variations; ionospheric effects; ionospheric streak correction; L-band SAR image; Novaya Zemlya; SAR offset tracking; synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018648215"

However, lake-rich regions, such as Siberia, are mostly dominated by rivers and lakes, with few stable geometry features such as those typically used as control points for image registration. Lakes in Arctic regions are generally not static; their shorelines tend to expand and shrink seasonally, and may change substantially between different years, making it difficult to find consistent features for image registration. Consequently, traditional image-to-image registration methods, and even many sophisticated registration algorithms, rarely achieve accurate geometric correction in Arctic regions due to a lack of sufficient control points. In this article, we proposed a summary lake spatial attribute, the inferred deepest point of the lake (DPL), as a feature that is relatively insensitive to lake area changes, and therefore useful for registration of multitemporal images. The central focus of the DPL estimation algorithm is the identification of the largest inner circle (LIC) of the lake polygon. First, the internal Voronoi diagram of a lake polygon is calculated by the ''divide-and-conquer' method. The medial axis (MA) is then calculated by Voronoi diagram simplification, and finally, the LIC center is obtained by computing the distance from the MA intersection to all polygon edges. The approach was used to register HJ-1 and Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images in Siberia, where water bodies dominate the landscape and change significantly over time. The proposed method found a large number of control points from the extracted water bodies. Subpixel registration accuracy of 0.62 pixels (18.5 m) and 0.33 pixels (19.6 m) root mean square error (RMSE) was obtained for the HJ-1 and MSS images, respectively. In comparison, the alternative method of using lake centroids, only achieved 0.75 pixels (22.4 m) and 0.49 pixels (29.3 m) RMSE. This registration accuracy improvement is potentially important for large-scale regional cartography and change detection applications. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Siberia; Computational geometry; Convolution; Image registration; Maps; Mean square error; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Deepest point of the lake (DPL); largest inner circle (LIC); Medial axis; Multi-temporal image; Voronoi diagrams; Waterbodies; accuracy assessment; algorithm; arctic environment; error analysis; lake water; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Lakes","Deepest point of the lake (DPL); largest inner circle (LIC); medial axis (MA); multitemporal image registration; Voronoi diagram; water body identification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078417246"

Datasets that document the spatial and temporal variability of the landscape are needed to monitor the rapid changes. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is specifically suitable for monitoring the Arctic, as SAR, unlike optical remote sensing, can provide time series regardless of weather and illumination conditions. This study examines the potential of seasonal backscatter mechanisms in Arctic tundra environments for improving land cover classification purposes by using a time series of HH/HV TerraSAR-X (TSX) imagery. A Random Forest (RF) classification was applied on multi-temporal Sigma Nought intensity and multi-temporal Kennaugh matrix element data. The backscatter analysis revealed clear differences in the polarimetric response of water, soil, and vegetation, while backscatter signal variations within different vegetation classes were more nuanced. The RF models showed that land cover classes could be distinguished with 92.4% accuracy for the Kennaugh element data, compared to 57.7% accuracy for the Sigma Nought intensity data. Texture predictors, while improving the classification accuracy on the one hand, degraded the spatial resolution of the land cover product. The Kennaugh elements derived from TSX winter acquisitions were most important for the RF model, followed by the Kennaugh elements derived from summer and autumn acquisitions. The results of this study demonstrate that multi-temporal Kennaugh elements derived from dual-polarized X-band imagery are a powerful tool for Arctic tundra land cover mapping. © 2021 by the authors.

This study presents a scalable classification framework, producing novel 10 m resolution land cover maps for Kobbefjord, Disko, and Zackenberg in Greenland. Based on Sentinel-2, a digital elevation model, and Google Earth Engine (GEE), this framework classifies the areas into nine classes. A vegetation land cover classification for 2019 is achieved through a multi-temporal analysis based on 41 layers comprising phenology, spectral indices, and topographical features. Reference data (1164 field observations) were used to train a random forest classifier, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 91.8%. The red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data proved to be particularly well suited for mapping the fen vegetation class.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based monitoring has become increasingly important for understanding the state and dynamics of permafrost landscapes at the regional scale. This study presents a permafrost landscape mapping method that uses multi-temporal TerraSAR-X backscatter intensity and interferometric coherence information. The proposed method can classify permafrost landscape features and map the two most important features in sub-arctic permafrost environments: permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds. First, a land cover map is generated through the combined use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis. An overall accuracy of 98% is achieved when classifying rock and water bodies, and an accuracy of 79% is achieved when discriminating between different vegetation types with one year of single-polarized acquisitions. Second, the distributions of the permafrost-affected areas and thermokarst ponds are derived from the classified landscapes. Permafrost-affected areas are inferred from the relationship between vegetation cover and the existence of permafrost, and thermokarst pond distributions are directly inherited from the land cover map. The two mapped features exhibit good agreement with manually delineated references. The proposed method can produce permafrost landscape maps in complex sub-arctic environments and improve our understanding of the effects of climate change on permafrost landscapes.

The changes caused by climate and oil/gas development Southeast of the city of Nadym were investigated using multi-temporal and multi-spatial remotely sensed images. Comparison between high spatial resolution imagery acquired in 1968 and 2006 indicates that 8.9% of the study area experienced an increase in vegetation cover (e.g. establishment of new saplings, extent of vegetated cover) in response to climate warming while 10.8% of the area showed a decrease in vegetation cover due to oil and gas development and logging activities. Waterlogging along linear structures and vehicle tracks was found near the oil and gas development site, while in natural landscapes the drying of thermokarst lakes is evident due to warming caused permafrost degradation. A Landsat time series dataset was used to document the spatial and temporal dynamics of these ecosystems in response to climate change and disturbances. The impacts of land use on surface vegetation, radiative, and hydrological properties were evaluated using Landsat image-derived biophysical indices. The spatial and temporal analyses suggest that the direct impacts associated with infrastructure development were mostly within 100 m distance from the disturbance source. While these impacts are rather localized they persist for decades despite partial recovery of vegetation after the initial disturbance and can have significant implications for changes in permafrost dynamics and surface energy budgets at landscape and regional scales. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Nadym; Russian Federation; Siberia; Yamalo-Nenets; Animalia; Arctic vehicles; Budget control; Crashworthiness; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Mineral resources; Natural gas vehicles; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Corona; Land-use change; LANDSAT; Quickbird; Remote sensing index; arctic environment; climate change; land cover; land use change; Landsat; permafrost; QuickBird; remote sensing; Climate change","arctic ecosystems; Corona; land use change; Landsat; permafrost; Quickbird; remote sensing indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84952906492"

Quantifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of its mass change is crucial for understanding global climate change. Many studies have been focused on the long-term ice mass change and acceleration, but a more detailed analysis of multitemporal signals, including annual, interannual and transient variations, is still imperative to study the periodic ice mass change. Here, we comprehensively characterize the multitemporal mass changes of the entire GrIS and subregions using a variational mode decomposition method, applied to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite data, surface mass balance model output, climate parameters and GPS observations. We found that both the interannual and transient mass variations of the southern subregions have larger amplitudes associated with pronounced precipitations, indicating that the southern mass change patterns are more vulnerable to short-term climate variability. We also found that the reported rapid mass loss in 2010, 2012, 2016 and 2019 should be attributed to the interannual signals that result from low precipitations, significant runoff and evapotranspiration. The largest interannual mass variation was discovered in 2019 (-235 Gt), but due to the combined effect of interannual loss (-147 Gt) and transient attenuation (-380 Gt), the greatest mass loss (-527 Gt) was observed at the end of 2012. Our study emphasizes the importance of multitemporal signals in characterizing the spatiotemporal GrIS mass change and exploring the coupling effect between ice mass change and climate conditions.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging. The noise level is reduced by a factor of 70% in Greenland test areas and 90% in Antarctic test areas. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Ice; Interferometry; Ionosphere; Ionospheric measurement; Radar; Radar measurement; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Velocity; Velocity measurement; Data stacking; Environmental parameter; Ice velocity; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Ionospheric correction; Ionospheric effects; Range split spectrum; SAR interferometry; accuracy assessment; data processing; environmental factor; ice cover; ionosphere; measurement method; PALSAR; performance assessment; polar region; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Data stacking; Ice velocity; Ionosphere correction; Ionosphere effect; Range split spectrum; SAR interferometry; Synthetic aperture radar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042693320"

We studied a 1.5 km stretch of coastline off Richard’s Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, consisting of multiple retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs) with varying degrees of activity over a one-year period. Multi-temporal 2D and 3D geomorphic analysis was based on unmanned aerial vehicle-Structure-from-Motion (UAV-SfM) data sets collected in 2018 and 2019.

We found that oblique imaging and georeferencing strategy had a large influence on vertical accuracy and variability across the study site and has implications for studying volumetric changes in RTSs.

This paper highlighted the methodological problems that arise at using satellite images for research and mapping of underwater relief; the ways of their solution are offered. Consideration of the depth of penetration of sunlight into the water and analysis of the spectral brightness of underwater objects allow for the determination of the spectrum zone (red zone) optimal for interpreting sandy riverbanks and options for color synthesis. At a limited choice of cloudless images in the Arctic to have images obtained during the minimum water level, not only the imaging season (low-water period) but also interannual runoff fluctuations are taken into account. The water turbidity limits the possibility to interpret the underwater relief. Images obtained with minimal turbidity are selected, and in the case of spreading of turbid waters, multi-temporal images are compared to separate the image of volatile turbid waters from more stable bottom objects; color synthesis is applied at different times. The identification of sandbanks, ridged forms of relief, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpreting based on the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. The identification of sandbanks, ridged relief forms on them, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpretation of the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. To highlight the fuzzy boundaries between the shallows and core zones of streams, the brightness quantization of images is applied. Comparison of the Yenisei River delta shallows map compiled from modern photographs with topographic and pilot maps of the 1970–1980th shows a reduction in the area of shallows adjacent to the tips of large islands in the eastern part of the delta.

Active subglacial lakes, common features in Antarctica, have recently been detected beneath the GrIS and may impact ice sheet hydrology. Despite their potential importance, few repeat subglacial lake filling and drainage events have been identified in Greenland. Here we examine the surface elevation change of a collapse basin at the Flade Isblink ice cap, northeast Greenland, which formed due to sudden subglacial lake drainage in 2011. We estimate the subglacial lake volume evolution using multi-temporal ArcticDEM data and ICESat-2 altimetry data acquired between 2012 and 2021. Our long-term observations show that the subglacial lake was continuously filled by surface meltwater, with the basin surface rising by up to 55 m during 2012-2021, and we estimate 138.2 × 106 m3 of meltwater was transported into the subglacial lake between 2012 and 2017. A second rapid drainage event occurred in late August 2019, which induced an abrupt ice dynamic response. We find that the 2019 drainage released much less water than the 2011 event and conclude that multiple factors, such as the volume of water stored in the subglacial lake and bedrock relief, regulate the episodic filling and drainage of the lake. By comparing the surface meltwater production and the subglacial lake volume change, we find that only 64% of the surface meltwater descended to the bed, suggesting potential processes such as meltwater refreezing and firn aquifer storage, which need to be further quantified.  © 2022 Qi Liang et al.","Antarctica; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; aquifer; ice cap; satellite altimetry; satellite data; subglacial environment","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134071937"

The peak in runoff usually coincides with the highest air temperatures which drive meltwater production. This process is often accompanied by the release of sediments from within the glacier system that are transported and suspended in high concentrations as they reach the proglacial realm. Sediment-laden meltwater is later transported to the marine environment and is expressed on the surface of fjords and coastal waters as sediment plumes. Direct monitoring of these processes requires complex and time-intensive fieldwork, meaning studies of these processes are rare. This paper demonstrates the seasonal dynamics of the Trebrevatnet lake complex and evolution of suspended sediment in the lake and sediment plumes in the adjacent Ekmanfjorden. We use the Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for the period between 2016–2021. We propose a new SSL index combining the areal extent of the sediment plume with the NDSSI for quantification of the sediment influx to the marine environment. The largest observed sediment plume was recorded on 30 July 2018 and extended to more than 40 km2 and a SSL index of 10.4. We identified the greatest sediment concentrations in the lake in the beginning of August, whereas the highest activity of the sediment plumes is concentrated at the end of July. The temporal pattern of these processes stays relatively stable throughout all ablation seasons studied. Sediment plumes observed with the use of optical satellite remote sensing data may be used as a proxy for meltwater runoff from the glacier-fed Trebrevatnet system. We have shown that remote-sensing-derived suspended sediment indexes can (after proper in situ calibration) serve for large scale quantification of sediment flux to fjord and coastal environments. © 2022 by the authors.

Although migratory species move across a wide range of environments during migration, their dynamic response to environments has rarely been considered. Taking advantage of the fine spatial-temporal resolution of satellite tracking data, we studied habitat selection of East Asian greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) along their spring migration route from Yangtze River Basin to Lena Delta and Yana Bay. We developed a novel methodology to improve dynamic species distribution models (SDMs) by incorporating environmental variables derived from remotely sensed data precisely corresponding to migration time. Our results demonstrate that distance to the nearest water body, elevation, human population density and temperature contribute greatly to the models. Water-related and topographic factors (e.g., elevation, slope and distance to the nearest water body) were consistently associated with habitat selection of the geese from wintering area to breeding area, while the varied influences of temperature and human population density in different migration periods are closely related to their adaptation to local environments.

One of the manifestations of these changes is crater creation with blowouts of a gas, ice and frozen soil mixture. In this context, dynamics studies of long-term heaving mounds that turn into craters as a result are relevant. A workflow for detecting and assessing anomalous dynamics of heaving mounds in the Arctic regions is proposed. Areas with anomalous increase of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscattering intensity are detected in the first stage. These increases take place due to sudden changes in local terrain slopes when the scattering surface (mound slope) turns toward the radar. Radar backscattering intensity also rises due to depolarization at newly formed frost cracks. Validation of the detected anomaly is carried out at the second stage through a comparison of multi-temporal digital elevation models obtained from bistatic radar interferometry TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X data. At the final stage, the deformations are assessed within the detected areas using differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) technique by ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. The magnitude of the heaving along the line of sight (LOS) was 22–24 cm in the period from January 2019 to January 2020. In general, effectiveness for detecting the perennial heaving mounds and the rate assessment of their increase were demonstrated in the suggested workflow. © 2023 by the authors.","Backscattering; Climate change; Frozen soils; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Arctic environments; Arctic regions; Bistatic; Bistatic X-band interferometry; Differential interferometry; L-band differential interferometry; Perennial heaving mound; Synthetic aperture radar backscatterings; Work-flows; X bands; Interferometry","Arctic environments; bistatic X-band interferometry; L-band differential interferometry; perennial heaving mound; SAR backscattering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145878002"

In Sierra Nevada (at the Veleta Peak), no permafrost is encountered. All other boreholes are drilled in permafrost. Results show that permafrost warmed at all sites down to depths of 50 m or more. The warming at a 20 m depth varied between 1.5 °C on Svalbard and 0.4 °C in the Alps. Warming rates tend to be less pronounced in the warm permafrost boreholes, which is partly due to latent heat effects at more ice-rich sites with ground temperatures close to 0 °C. At most sites, the air temperature at 2 m height showed a smaller increase than the near-ground-surface temperature, leading to an increase of surface offsets (SOs). The active layer thickness (ALT) increased at all sites between c. 10% and 200% with respect to the start of the study period, with the largest changes observed in the European Alps. Multi-temporal electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) carried out at six sites showed a decrease in electrical resistivity, independently supporting our conclusion of ground ice degradation and higher unfrozen water content. © 2020 The Author(s).

In polar regions, the roughness of the terrain, strong katabatic winds, unreliability of compass readings, and inaccessibility due to lack of infrastructure pose unique challenges for UAV surveying. To overcome these issues, we developed an open-source, low-cost, high-endurance, fixed-wing UAV equipped with GPS post-processed kinematic for the monitoring of ice dynamics and calving activity at several remote tidewater glaciers located in Greenland. Our custom-built UAV is capable of flying for up to 3 h or 180 km and is able to produce high spatial resolution (0.25–0.5 m per pixel), accurately geo-referenced (1–2 pixels) ortho-images and DEMs. We used our UAV to perform repeat surveys of six calving glacier termini in north-west in July 2017 and of Eqip Sermia glacier, west Greenland, in July 2018. The endurance of our UAV enabled us to map the termini of up to four tidewater glaciers in one flight and to infer the displacement and calving activity of Eqip Sermia at short (105 min) timescale. Our study sheds light on the potential of long-range UAVs for continuously monitoring marine-terminating glaciers, enabling short-term processes, such as the tidal effects on the ice dynamics, short-lived speed-up events, and the ice fracturing responsible for calving to be investigated at unprecedented resolution. © Copyright © 2019 Jouvet, Weidmann, van Dongen, Lüthi, Vieli and Ryan.","Arctic; Greenland; Aerial photography; Antennas; Dynamics; Fixed wings; Ice; Photogrammetry; Pixels; Remote sensing; Surveys; Digital elevation model; High resolution; High spatial resolution; Ice dynamics; Katabatic winds; Short term process; Structure from motion; Tidewater glaciers; digital elevation model; glacier dynamics; glaciology; photogrammetry; satellite data; satellite imagery; unmanned vehicle; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","calving glaciers; ice dynamics; remote sensing; structure-from-motion photogrammetry; unmanned aerial vehicle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072802290"

This study provides a novel method to estimate surface runoff through remote sensing of supraglacial lake volumes. Because terminal, non-draining (consistently expanding during the melt season) lakes impound runoff from their surrounding contributing catchments, such changes reflect runoff produced within the catchment. To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments (~10 km2) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8–31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 – 123%. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 – 55%. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Catchments; Glacial geology; Glaciers; Ice; Lakes; Remote sensing; Topography; ArcticDEM; Cumulative runoffs; Delay function; Greenland Ice Sheet; High resolution; Surface mass balance; Surface meltwater; Surface runoffs; agricultural catchment; catchment; digital elevation model; glacier mass balance; hydrological modeling; remote sensing; runoff; simulation; Runoff","ArcticDEM; Greenland ice sheet; Supraglacial lake; Surface mass balance; Surface runoff","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073832522"

Technogenic impact can also influence the rates of their erosion, causing rapid retreat. For key areas on the coasts of Barents and Kara Seas, connections between climate change, human activity and coastal erosion have been analysed. Estimations of thermoabrasion rates were based on the results of direct field monitoring conducted for more than 35 years enriched by application of multitemporal remote sensing data. Hydrometeorological factors of coastal dynamics were analysed using data from stationary observations and reanalysis; the wind-wave energy influencing the intensity of mechanical abrasion was calculated by applying Popov-Sovershaev's method based on observational data, digital elevation models and satellite imagery. It has been found out that periods of high coastal retreat rates are often determined by increase in the wind-wave energy. Such increase becomes possible due to the ice-free period prolongation causing exposure of the coasts to the strongest Autumn storms. Technogenic impact can also considerably influence local lithodynamic and cryogenic processes. Coinciding with periods of high wind-wave energy, human activity can lead to dramatic increase in coastal erosion rates in permafrost areas.","Erosion; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Wave energy conversion; Changing environment; Cryogenic process; Digital elevation model; Environmental change; Mechanical abrasion; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Observational data; Technogenic impact; Climate change","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040455407"

The analysis of experimental data on the size of thermokarst lakes, which area is from a few tens to hundreds of square meters, obtained by the ultra-high resolution images, showed that the histograms of size-distribution of small lakes in Arctic zone of Western Siberia allow their approximation both by power and exponential functions.

For polar bears Ursus maritimus, the physical configuration of the habitat and conditions in which seals are hunted may change on intra- and inter-seasonal scales. Additionally, while the effects of climate change on polar bears have focused on linking reductions in sea ice to body condition and survival, the potential changes to on-ice hunting conditions have not been examined. Employing observational counts of seals killed by polar bears between early-April and late-May 1985-2011 (n = 650), we modelled the likelihood of predation events in the Beaufort Sea, Canada at multi-temporal scales. We used the top model to estimate the expected kill rate of seals in the springs of 1985-1986 and 2005-2006 and integrated the result with fasting rates derived from physiological markers in blood samples. A log-likelihood ratio test suggested a multi-temporal approach fit the seal kill data better than any single scale alone. Predation events were influenced by ringed seal Pusa hispida reproduction and haul-out behaviour, regional sea ice concentration and the phase of climatic indices. The expected kill rate from the top predation model and the estimated mean biomass of seal kills were significant predictors of polar bear fasting rates. Results suggest that 50% less seal biomass was killed in 2005-2006 than in 1985-1986, which correlates with a significant increase in the frequency of polar bears in a fasting state. We propose that the documented changes in polar bear fasting rates between 1985-1986 and 2005-2006 are due to a complex set of abiotic and biotic factors including underlying prey dynamics, rather than a single-scale environmental correlation. © 2015 The Authors.","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Phoca hispida; Ursus maritimus; bear; biological invasion; biomass; biotic factor; body condition; climate change; empirical analysis; haulout behaviour; pinniped; predator-prey interaction; sea ice; survival","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939543524"

We examine this Inglefield Land coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system during the 2016–2019 melt seasons (July to August), using 137 Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 visible/near-infrared satellite images. Two surface water metrics (supraglacial meltwater area fraction Am and proglacial river effective width We) are used to track spatio-temporal variations of surface meltwater moving through this drainage system. Satellite-derived Am and We are also compared with daily surface runoff simulations from the MAR v3.11 and MERRA-2 climate/SMB models, to estimate meltwater routing lag times and assess model performance. Satellite-derived Am and We are highly correlated (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01), indicating that the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system evacuates meltwater directly from the ice surface to the ocean with negligible subglacial storage or delays. Both remotely sensed metrics are positively correlated with modeled runoff, especially MAR (r2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for Am and We, vs. 0.66 and 0.64 for MERRA-2). Lagged MAR runoff (2 days, r2 = 0.87 and 0.82) match both metrics better than simultaneous MAR runoff and the optimal time lag for both metrics are 2 d. We conclude that 1) unlike the southwest GrIS, the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system at Inglefield Land routes surface meltwater runoff directly off the ice surface to the proglacial zone, with virtually no subglacial capture of runoff by moulins; 2) most of the ∼2 d transit time occurs on the ice surface rather than in the proglacial zone; and 3) multi-temporal satellite imaging facilitates holistic, source-to-sink tracking of NW GrIS meltwater from the ice surface to the global ocean. © 2021 The Author(s)","Arctic; Greenland; Inglefield Land; drainage network; glacial hydrology; ice sheet; Landsat; mass balance; meltwater; proglacial environment; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis","Greenland runoff; Proglacial river; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial river; Surface mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122512966"

Maps of these vegetation are needed to improve our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. This requires species distribution to be mapped repeatedly over time, a critical task that becomes extremely challenging in data-poor Antarctic regions, where the lack of field data, logistics, coupled with scarcity of cloud free, quality multitemporal Landsat imagery are major intrinsic constraints to time-series analysis for change detection. This study firstly analyzes the spectral curves of moss and lichen generated by field-based spectroradiometer and then proposes an innovative histogram matching technique where historical Landsat data is modified such that its histogram matches that of present (reference) dataset. This has made it possible to mapping multitemporal Landsat data in the Antarctic Peninsula. The results demonstrate an overall accuracy of 90.5%. Mapping of Arctic vegetation facilitated by histogram matching of Landsat image, according to the results, seems to be an advisable image processing technique for application in a data-poor context. © 2020 Penerbit UTM Press.

A large amount of information obtained during the first years of this system exploitation allows estimating its value for characterization of these regions. We have examined a time series of Sentintel-1A/C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) backscatter coefficient for the period between November 2014 and November 2016 to assess their potential for detecting major seasonal changes of the surface within Kotelny Island (New Siberian Islands archipelago). Temporal backscatter signatures of ten test sites located within the typical landscapes of the island were analyzed. A set of additional information sources about the area (maps, optical images, meteorological data) used for radar images interpretation allowed revealing the main factors influencing the backscattering signal. The largest backscatter variations observed within the studied sites are associated with the processes accompanying the periods of established negative (freezing of active layer, snowfall) and positive (thawing of snow cover and active layer, vegetation growth) temperatures. Differences of backscatter within each image are related to peculiarities of the relief, soils, the type and density of vegetation, amount of standing water. A good separability of Arctic landscapes based on SAR backscatter trends makes it promising to use multi-temporal radar data for landscape types classification and mapping. © 2018 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

However, synthesized overviews of biomass patterns across circumpolar sites have been limited. Based on data from eight study sites in Europe, Siberia and Canada, we ask (1) how biomass is divided between plant functional types (PFTs) and (2) how well biomass patterns can be detected with widely available, moderate spatial resolution (3–10 m) satellite imagery and topographic data. We explain biomass patterns using random forest regressions with the predictors being spectral bands and indices calculated from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery and topographic information calculated from ArcticDEM data. Our results indicate that there are notable differences in vegetation composition between northern landscapes with mosses, graminoids and deciduous shrubs being the most dominant PFTs. Remote sensing data detects biomass patterns, but regression performance varies between sites (explained variance 36–70%, normalized root mean square error 9–19%). There is also variability between sites whether Sentinel-2 or PlanetScope data is more suitable to detect biomass patterns and which the most important predictors are. Topographic information has a minor or negligible importance in most of the sites.

Based on the interpretation of multi-temporal satellite imagery, we assessed coastal dynamics in distinct periods from 1972 to 2020. We analyzed the geological structure of the coast as well as changes in hydrometeorological parameters with time, and considering the human impact, we proposed the main drivers of spatial and temporal variations of coastal dynamics. The studied low-lying sandy accumulative marine terrace was more or less stable in the period before construction (1972–2014). However, with the area’s development, the coast dynamics changed drastically: in 2014–2017, three-quarters of the studied area experienced retreat, and the average retreat rate amounted to 5.8 m/yr, up to 28.5 m/yr near the construction sites. We relate this coastal erosion intensification to human impact combined with the growth of hydrometeorological forcing. Although coastal erosion slowed down after 2017, the retreat trend remained.

They retreat with average rates of 1-2 m per year, depending on climatic and permafrost conditions. In recent decades, retreat rates have shown a tendency to increase. In this paper, we studied the coastal dynamics of two key sites (Ural and Yamal coasts) of Baydaratskaya Bay, Kara Sea, where a gas pipeline had been constructed. Based on multi-temporal aerial and satellite imagery, we identified coastal erosion rates at several time lapses, in natural conditions and under human impact, and discussed their temporal variability. In addition to planimetric (m/yr), we calculated volumetric (m3/m/yr) retreat rates of erosional coasts using ArcticDEM. We also estimated the influence of geomorphology, lithology, and permafrost structure of the coasts on spatial variations of their dynamics. Erosional coasts of the Ural key site retreat with higher mean rates (1.2 m/yr and 8.7 m3/m/yr) as compared to the Yamal key site (0.3 m/yr and 3.7 m3/m/yr) due to their exposure to higher open sea waves, more complex lithology, higher ice content and lower coastal bluffs. Since the 1960s, coastal retreat rates have been growing on both coasts of Baydaratskaya Bay; we relate this effect with Arctic climate warming. From the 1960s to 2005, such growth was moderate, while in 2005-2016 it became rapid, which may be explained by the enhanced wave and thermal action or by the onset of industrial development. The adjacent coastal segments, originally accumulative, remained relatively stable from the 1960s to 2005. After 2005, a considerable part of them began to retreat as a result of changing weather conditions and/or increasing human impact. © 2018 by the authors.","Antennas; Climate change; Coastal zones; Dynamics; Erosion; Lithology; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Baydaratskaya Bay; Coastal erosion; Complex lithology; Industrial development; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Natural conditions; Spatial variations; Temporal variability; Permafrost","Baydaratskaya Bay; Coastal erosion; Permafrost; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053593933"

Due to global warming and its thermal and wind-wave effects, there is a tendency of increase in coastal erosion rates. Understanding of the interaction between permafrost and sea is important to disclose the background of active development of natural resources in the Arctic coastal zone (construction of coastal facilities, offshore pipelines, etc). In the present study, coastal dynamics of the Western Russian Arctic coasts are studied, including Varandey (Pechora Sea), Ural and Yamal coasts near the underwater gas pipeline “Bovanenkovo-Ukhta” across Baydaratskaya Bay (Kara Sea). Kara Sea key-sites are characterized by continuous permafrost, with annual ground temperature of-4…-6 ºC and permafrost thickness of up to 50-100 m. Varandey key-site is located in the zone of sporadic permafrost. Estimations of coastal retreat rates were based on high resolution multitemporal space imagery analysis together with data of airborne surveys. All satellite images were orthorectified to decrease uncertainties. During fieldwork, DGPS mapping of some points with the constant position were made for accurate coastal erosion rates estimations. The study revealed that long-term (1960s-2010s) average annual retreat rates for coasts of different key-sites ranged from 0.5 to 2 m per year: at Varandey – 2.2 m/a; Ural coast of Baydaratskaya Bay – 2 m/a, and Yamal – 0.4 m/a. Coastal erosion rates were calculated for different time intervals, they depend on coastal morphology (cliff height, beach presence), slope exposure, permafrost features (sediment composition, ice content, etc). Studies on coastal dynamics and understanding their various aspects are very important for the attractive Arctic region under the conditions of climate change. The obtained results allow for a better understanding of coastal retreat processes and forecasting of Russian Arctic coastal dynamics in the future. © SGEM2018.","Antennas; Dynamics; Erosion; Global warming; Offshore oil well production; Permafrost; Surveys; Wave effects; Coastal erosion; Coastal morphology; Ground temperature; Russian Arctic; Sediment composition; Space imagery; Sporadic permafrosts; Wind wave effects; Offshore pipelines","Aerial and space imagery; Coastal erosion; Permafrost; Russian Arctic","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058886550"

Every year, after a long harsh winter, the accumulated snow on the Lena watershed melts, leading to the major annual spring flood event causing heavy transport of sediments, organic carbon, and trace metals, both into as well as within the delta. This study aims to analyze the hydrodynamic processes of the spring flood taking place every year in the Lena Delta. Thus, a combination of remote sensing techniques and hydrodynamic modeling methodologies is used to overcome limitations caused by missing ground-truth data. As a test site for this feasibility study, the outlet of the Lena River to its delta was selected. Lena Delta is an extensive wetland spanning from northeast Siberia into the Arctic Ocean. Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellite mission served as input for the hydrodynamic modeling software HEC-RAS. The model resulted in inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities. The model accuracy assessed by comparing the multi-temporal modeled inundation areas with the satellite-derived inundation areas ranged between 65 and 95%, with kappa coefficients ranging between 0.78 and 0.97, showing moderate to almost perfect levels of agreement between the two inundation boundaries. Modeling results of high flow discharges show a better agreement with the satellite-derived inundation areas compared to that of lower flow discharges. Overall, the remote-sensing-based hydrodynamic modeling succeeded in indicating the increase and decrease in the inundation areas, flood depths, and flow velocities during the annual flood events. © 2021 by the authors.

Thaw subsidence is a slow (millimetre to centimetre per year) vertical displacement of the ground surface common in ice-rich permafrost-underlain landscapes. It is difficult to quantify thaw subsidence in tundra areas as they often lack stable reference frames. Also, there is no solid ground surface to serve as a basis for elevation measurements, due to a continuous moss–lichen cover. We investigate how an expert-driven method improves the accuracy of benchmark measurements at discrete locations within two sites using multitemporal TLS data of a 1-year period. Our method aggregates multiple experts’ determination of the ground surface in 3D point clouds, collected in a web-based tool. We then compare this to the performance of a fully automated ground surface determination method. Lastly, we quantify ground surface displacement by directly computing multitemporal point cloud distances, thereby extending thaw subsidence observation to an area-based assessment. Using the expert-driven quantification as reference, we validate the other methods, including in-situ benchmark measurements from a conventional field survey. This study demonstrates that quantifying the ground surface using 3D point clouds is more accurate than the field survey method. The expert-driven method achieves an accuracy of 0.1 ± 0.1 cm. Compared to this, in-situ benchmark measurements by single surveyors yield an accuracy of 0.4 ± 1.5 cm. This difference between the two methods is important, considering an observed displacement of 1.4 cm at the sites. Thaw subsidence quantification with the fully automatic benchmark-based method achieves an accuracy of 0.2 ± 0.5 cm and direct point cloud distance computation an accuracy of 0.2 ± 0.9 cm. The range in accuracy is largely influenced by properties of vegetation structure at locations within the sites. The developed methods enable a link of automated quantification and expert judgement for transparent long-term monitoring of permafrost subsidence. © 2020 The Authors.

Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has long been used to map wetlands due to its sensitivity to surface inundation and ability to penetrate clouds, darkness, and certain vegetation canopies. Here, we track boreal wetland inundation by developing a two-step modified decision-tree algorithm implemented in Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-1 C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) time-series data as inputs. This approach incorporates temporal as well as spatial characteristics of SAR backscatter and is evaluated for the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Alberta (PAD), and Yukon Flats, Alaska (YF) from May 2017 to October 2019. Within these two boreal study areas, we map spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation classes of Open Water (OW), Floating Plants (FP), Emergent Plants (EP), and Flooded Vegetation (FV). Temporal variability, frequency, and maximum extents of transient wetland inundation are quantified. Retrieved inundation estimates are compared with in-situ field mapping obtained during the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE), and a multi-temporal Landsat-derived surface water map. Over the 2017–2019 study period, we find that fractional inundation area ranged from 18.0% to 19.0% in the PAD, and from 10.7% to 12.1% in the YF. Transient wetland inundation covered ~595 km2 of the PAD, comprising ~9.1% of its landscape, and ~102 km2 of the YF, comprising ~3.6%. The implications of these findings for wetland function monitoring, and estimating landscape-scale methane emissions are discussed, together with limitations and uncertainties of our approach. We conclude that time series of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscatter, screened with Sentinel-2 MSI optical imagery and validated by field measurements, offer a valuable tool for tracking transient boreal wetland inundation. © 2022 The Author(s).

Contemporary studies have largely attributed these wildfire events to the Arctic's rapidly changing climate and increased atmospheric disturbances (i.e. thunderstorms). However, existing research has primarily examined the wildfire-climate dynamics of individual large wildfire events. No studies have investigated wildfire activity, including climatic drivers, for the entire tundra biome across multiple years, i.e. at the planetary scale. To address this limitation, this paper provides a planetary/circumpolar scale analyses of space-time patterns of tundra wildfire occurrence and climatic association in the Arctic over a 15 year period (2001-2015). In doing so, we have leveraged and analyzed NASA Terra's MODIS active fire and MERRA climate reanalysis products at multiple temporal scales (decadal, seasonal and monthly). Our exploratory spatial data analysis found that tundra wildfire occurrence was spatially clustered and fire intensity was spatially autocorrelated across the Arctic regions. Most of the wildfire events occurred in the peak summer months (June-August). Our multi-temporal (decadal, seasonal and monthly) scale analyses provide further support to the link between climate variability and wildfire activity. Specifically, we found that warm and dry conditions in the late spring to mid-summer influenced tundra wildfire occurrence, spatio-temporal distribution, and fire intensity. Additionally, reduced average surface precipitation and soil moisture levels in the winter-spring period were associated with increased fire intensity in the following summer. These findings enrich contemporary knowledge on tundra wildfire's spatial and seasonal patterns, and shed new light on tundra wildfire-climate relationships in the circumpolar context. Furthermore, this first pan-Arctic analysis provides a strong incentive and direction for future studies which integrate multiple datasets (i.e. climate, fuels, topography, and ignition sources) to accurately estimate carbon emission from tundra burning and its global climate feedbacks in coming decades. © 2018 The Author(s).
