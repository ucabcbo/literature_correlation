Due to weather and environmental effects, optical remote sensing has limitations in obtaining images where the image quality may be degraded. It's because the images being registered are taken at various times, viewpoints, and types of sensors. In this article, the pre-processing methods, which include radiometric correction and geometric correction, are introduced to enhance the quality of satellite images and identify correct spatial alignment. For radiometric correction, adaptive contrast enhancement is done by combining histogram- and non-linear transfer function-based approaches in CIELAB color space. A comparison study is done to see how the new method compared to other methods. For geometric correction, the features from two images are extracted using Convolutional Neural Network to match and align them. The introduced approach for radiometric correction gave the best average rank of BRISQUE scores and RMSE of contrast scores, and the geometric correction can align two images together with an average accuracy of improvement of 91.78 percent. The findings of this research will provide the preliminary step for any change detection activities.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135525302"

The planting area has also increased significantly in southern China in recent years. It is of great practical significance to clarify the spatial distribution pattern of Artemisia argyi, particularly for the decision making on the regional crop planting structure and the optimization of industrial layout. In this study, the new identification of Artemisia argyi was made to integrate with the multi-temporal GF-1 and GF-6 satellite images. The study area was taken as the Qichun County, Hubei Province, the main production area of Artemisia argyi in China. A total of 20 spectral features were selected, including 8 single-band features, and 12 red-edge vegetation indices, according to the phenology of Artemisia argyi and the spectral bands of high-resolution images. A random forest classification was then performed to estimate the contributions of different red-edge vegetation indices to the Artemisia argyi identification. A systematic evaluation was also made to identify the potential of the integrated GF-1 and GF-6 images. The mapping accuracy was first assessed using the field samples, and then compared with four additional classification scenarios with different inputs of GF-1 and GF-6 images. In addition, the statistical data was used to verify the mapping areas extracted by remote sensing. The evaluation results showed that the integration of GF-1 and GF-6 images was generated the highest accuracy with the user’s and producer’s accuracy of 92.73% and 88.74%, respectively, indicating significantly higher than those of either a single GF-1 or GF-6 data only. Moreover, the fitting data of the mapping and statistical areas in each township showed that the determination coefficient R2 reached 0.70, indicating accurately matching the area and spatial distribution. The features importance was derived from random forest, where the number of red-edge bands and indices accounted for 54% of the top 50 features with the highest importance scores. The red-edge band I (B5) on June 23 (DOY204) of GF-6 data was contributed the most, which was considered as the best spectral feature to identify. The other newly added purple band (B7) of GF-6 was also valuable to distinguish rather than the traditional multiple bands. Furthermore, the optimal periods of identification were determined as early May and early September, when the first and second stubble of leaves were growing rapidly. Another optimal period was also found to extract the spatial distribution in late June and late September, when the plant was more distinguishable from others. Overall, the accuracy of crop identification was effectively improved under the newly added bands of GF-6 WFV images and the associated vegetation indices using the red-edge bands. The integration of GF-1 and GF-6 images can be widely expected to better capture the key phenological characteristics of crop types, where multiple temporal information was used to improve the classification accuracy. Consequently, the present crop identification was suitable for mapping Artemisia argyi. This finding can provide a typical application demonstration to fully realize the finer resolution of multi-source satellites. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this paper, a new method that combines double-branch U-NET with multi-temporal satellite images containing phenological information is introduced to accurately map urban tree canopies. Based on the constructed GF-2 image dataset, we developed a double-branch U-NET based on the feature fusion strategy using multi-temporal images to obtain an accuracy improvement with an IOU (intersection over union) of 2.3% and an F1-Score of 1.3% at the pixel level compared to the U-NET using mono-temporal images which performs best in existing studies for urban tree canopy mapping. We also found that the double-branch U-NET based on the feature fusion strategy has better accuracy than the early fusion strategy and decision fusion strategy in processing multi-temporal images for urban tree canopy mapping. We compared the impact of image combinations of different seasons on the urban tree canopy mapping task and found that the combination of summer and autumn images had the highest accuracy in the study area. Our research not only provides a high-precision urban tree canopy mapping method but also provides a direction to improve the accuracy both from the model structure and data potential when using deep learning for urban tree canopy mapping. © 2023 by the authors.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Forestry; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Features fusions; Fusion strategies; High spatial resolution satellite imagery; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Remote-sensing; Urban forests; Urban tree canopies; Remote sensing","data fusion; deep learning; multi-temporal; remote sensing; urban forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147934630"

The results of the images interpretation were maps compiled showing the outlines of outcrops, identified by visual analysis of multi-temporal images, by brightness quantization for the panchromatic image of 1964 and calculation of the vegetation index using multispectral images of the last two survey dates. This work showed that the combination of visual interpretation of the original images and the results of their digital processing makes jt possible to distinguish areas covered by vegetation of different types and open rock outcrops in the best way, partly even leveling out the differences in illumination of slopes of different steepness. The results were compared with the thermal survey data and verified in the course of geomorphological field studies and UAV surveys. The methodology for mapping the dynamics of slope processes based on the interpretation of multi-temporal images over a time interval of more than 50 years was tested in two key areas characterized by diverse and different-scale manifestations of exogenous processes. Calculations made on the basis of the interpretation results made it possible to determine that the last two large landslides in 2007 and 2014 sharply reduced the area covered by vegetation: from 70% to 7% and from 60% to 4%, respectively. It was found that in the Northern key site, the proportion of the area with traces of slope processes activation for 53 years increased from 20.9 to 30.2%, in the Southern site it increased from 12 to 30%. Analysis of spatial and temporal distribution of areas of slope processes activation showed that in addition to commonly known triggers, such as heavy rainfall and earthquakes, the influence of the spectrum of endogenous processes on the displacement of material on the slopes is obvious in this area. © 2022 Russian Academy of Sciences.

Landsat series optical satellite images are influenced by cloud coverage, acquisition time, sensor types, and seasons, which make it difficult to obtain continuous cloud-free observations. It limits the potential use and analysis of time series images. Therefore, global change researchers urgently need to ‘composite’ multi-sensor and multi-temporal images. Many previous studies have used isolated pixel-based algorithms to composite Landsat images; however, this study is different and develops a batch pixel-based algorithm for composing continuous cloud-free Landsat images. The algorithm chooses the best scene as the reference image using the user-specified image ID or related parameters. Further, it accepts all valid pixels in the reference image as the main part of the result and develops a priority coefficient model. Development of this model is based on the criteria of five factors including cloud coverage, acquisition time, acquisition year, observation seasons, and sensor types to select substitutions for the missing pixels in batches and to merge them into the final composition. This proposed batch pixel-based algorithm may provide reasonable compositing results on the basis of the experimental test results of all Landsat 8 images in 2019 and the visualization results of 12 locations in 2020. In comparison with the isolated pixel-based algorithms, our algorithm eliminates band dispersion, requires fewer images, and enhances the composition’s pixel concentration considerably. The algorithm provides a complete and practical framework for time series image processing for Landsat series satellites, and has the potential to be applied to other optical satellite images as well. © 2022 by the authors.","Harmonic analysis; Image analysis; Image enhancement; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Pixels; Time series analysis; Acquisition time; Cloud cover; Cloud coverage; Compositing; Google earth engine; Google earths; LANDSAT; Optical satellite images; Time-series analysis; Times series; Landsat","cloud cover; composition; Google Earth Engine; Landsat; time series analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137903175"

Land cover/use maps are also created using these data. These data play an important role as a base for determining land cover and land use classes, detecting changes, monitoring forest, agriculture and wetlands, as well as updating the LPIS data used by countries. As well as being reference data in the LPIS update, current land cover and land use classification results with satellite images also provide statistical information about which class has changed over the years and how much the class or classes need to be updated, and will also provide the planning of the update to be made on a national scale. In this study, land cover classification for 2020 covering Çivril-Baklan Plain, which is between the borders of Denizli Province (Turkey), Baklan, Çal and Çivril Districts, was performed. The LPIS classes of the study area drawn in 2015 and the land cover classes as a result of the 2020 classification were compared as a result of the classification process, and particularly the areas with change were referenced in the LPIS update. In the classification process, the open source Eo-Learn library, which uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms in remote sensing studies and Sentinel-2 images that can be accessed directly in this library were used. The open source Eo-Learn library has been preferred because it provides great convenience to users in the classification process with ready-made machine learning models and easy access to satellite images, image processing steps (cloud masking, calculate index, feature extraction, temporal interpolation) are carried out in a certain workflow. Instead of land cover classification from a single image, 17 different time (multi-temporal) images between 01.02.2020 and 31.11.2020 were used. In the classification process, 12 different features were used for the image taken on each date, including NDVI, NDWI, NDBI indices and Tasseled Cap transformations, as well as (Blue) B02, (Green) B03, (Red) B04, (NIR) B08, (SWIR-1) B11, (SWIR-2) B12 bands. In the classification process, the Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LightGBM) algorithm in the Eo-Learn library and the physical blocks produced within the scope of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) project were used as ground truth data; arable land, bare land, forest, artificial surface, shrubland, tree crops and water classes were created. The classification results were evaluated using the K fold (k = 5) cross validation method, with F1 score, recall, and precision values calculated for each class, and the overall accuracy %92.2. When the classification result is compared with the LPIS data, it is seen that the arable land, shrub land, and water classes have changed. This study determined that these classes, in particular, need to be updated. © 2022 The Author(s).

Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images (“S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue” dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%). This suggests that the proposed method provides accurate cloud detection in Landsat images, has good transferability to Sentinel-2 images, and can quickly be adapted for different optical satellite sensors. © 2022 The Authors","Deep learning; HTTP; Image processing; Landsat; Learning systems; Optical data processing; Optical remote sensing; Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Cloud masks; Deep learning; Distortion model; Generative adversarial network; LANDSAT; Model method; Remote-sensing; Satellite sensors; artificial neural network; detection method; image processing; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral analysis; supervised learning; Generative adversarial networks","Cloud detection; Cloud distortion model; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks (GAN); Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136277692"

The proposed method first adaptively constructs a similarity graph to represent the structure of a pre-event image, then uses the graph to translate the pre-event image to the domain of the post-event image, and then computes the difference image. Finally, a superpixel-based Markovian segmentation model is designed to segment the difference image into changed and unchanged classes. The proposed adaptive structure consistency-based image regression model can not only alleviate the impact of noise and changed pixels on the regression process by using the structure-based transformation, but also easily distinguish between changed and unchanged classes in the difference image by using the prior sparse knowledge of changes. Experimental results on six different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with some state-of-the-art methods.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Pixels; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Adaptive structure; Difference images; Heterogeneous sensors; Image regression; Imaging mechanism; Markovian segmentation; Multi-temporal satellite images; State-of-the-art methods; detection method; image analysis; regression analysis; remote sensing; unsupervised classification; Image segmentation","Graph; Heterogeneous data; Image regression; Sparse regularization; Structure consistency; Unsupervised change detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115128900"

Two multi-temporal Landsat images were used, one from the Multispectral Landsat 8-OLI and one from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper ETM+, to calculate the total cultivated land and it is annually changing during the relevant times. In addition to VES and TEM measurements to identify the aquifer(s) properties, all data were processed and interpreted. The inferred information from the processed satellite images showed the reclaimed land grows at a rate of about 11km2/yr without noticeable changes in the shoreline. Moreover, the VES and TEM modeling and interpretation elucidate that the study area contains three successive and separated coastal aquifers represented by Sand dunes, Old Beach, and Kurkar layers. These aquifers can be utilized, but the dunes layer is less important than the others. The comparative aquifer thicknesses were decreased by 4 meters during the total period. Finally, the integration between results produced two statistical relations describing the decreasing of aquifer thickness with annual groundwater discharge and changing of cultivated land rates, and these relations confirmed that the groundwater in the relevant area could be in line with the current rate of development process during the current century. Therefore, the Rafah coastal aquifers are suitable for short to medium sustainable development plans. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","","Coastal aquifer; Egypt; Geoelectrical resistivity; Rafah; Sustainable development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112623945"

Although different time-series spatial resolution satellite images have provided opportunities for tropical forests classification, the complexity and diversity of vegetation types still pose challenges, especially for distinguishing different vegetation types. In this paper, we proposed a Spectro-Temporal Feature Selection (STFS) method based on the Weighted Separation Index (WSI) using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data for mapping tropical forests in Jianfengling area, Hainan Province. The results showed that the tropical forests were classified with an overall accuracy of 93% and an F1 measure of 0.92 with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. As our results also revealed, the WSI based STFS method could be efficient in tropical forests classification by using a fewer feature subset compared with Variable Selection Using Random Forest (14 features and all 40 features, respectively) to achieve the same accuracy. The analysis also showed it was not advisable to only pursue a higher WSI value while ignoring the heterogeneity and diversity of features. This study demonstrated that the WSI can provide a new feature selection method for multi-temporal remote sensing image classification. © 2021 by the authors.

The investigation of the retreat of the glacier surface in the Ampay National Sanctuary is carried out using the historical series of Landsat images and applying the normalized snow differential index between the years 1991 to 2017. The meteorological data from the Tamburco and Abancay stations have been considered to determine the deglaciation and quantify the retreat of the Ampay glacier. The supervised classification spatial visualization method for the Landsat 2 Multispectral Scanner image and the normalized snow differential index have been used to determine the glacier cover area with Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor images. The results show a significant decrease in the surface of the Ampay glacier due to the increase in temperature. The surface of the Ampay glacier in 1991 was 2.13 km2 and in 2017 – 1.09 km2, showing a loss of 1.04 km2 (48.92%) as a consequence of significant climate variability (temperature and precipitation). In 2015, an apparent accumulation of snow was recorded on the Ampay glacier, reaching 2.595 km2, but in the following years, the glacier surface has been decreasing until it reached 1.086 km2 in 2017. It is concluded that the glacial retreat of the Ampay National Sanctuary in the last 25 years with a tendency to continuous deglaciation puts the water resource at risk. © 2022, International Centre for Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems SDEWES.

Space images of high spatial resolution (0.5–3 m), received from Key-Hole-4 (1964), GeoEye (2009), Pleiades-1A/1B (2013, 2016), WorldView-2 (2017) satellites, results of field survey and UAV imagery in 2021, literature and archive materials were used as sources. The developed interpretation technique included both sequential interpretation of preliminary geometrically coordinated multi-temporal images and their digital processing: brightness quantization, calculation of vegetation index NDVI, formation of color multi-temporal composite, which allowed to separate vegetation-covered and bare slope areas by formal features and increased the overall reliability of interpretation. Calculations based on the interpretation results determined that the proportion of the total valley area affected by modern slope processes was 10.5 % in 1964, 14.8 % in 2009, and 13 % in 2017. In the process of images interpretation, it was established that slope processes dominated on the left bank of the Geyser River, where more than 75 % of the area of all outcrops (or 10.2 % of the total studied area of the valley) was concentrated, which is apparently caused by confinement of this valley side to the caldera limiting circular fault, which preserves its activity, and also by the presence of the area of modern uplift there. On the right bank of the river, large areas are occupied by ancient large gravitational shifts, possibly associated with collapsing edges of extrusive massifs. Landslides-slides and erosion in the groundwater outlets are predominant among the modern processes here. The right bank accounts for less than 25 % of the area of all outcrops (or 3.3 % of the total study area). © 2022 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

Taking the Anzigou ditch as an example, we investigate the “Quarry–Landslide–Mudslide” disaster chain model.

We synthesize the evolution of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which experiences high seismic hazard, and derive new datasets relevant for seismic risk modeling. First, the urban sprawl of Bishkek (1979–2021) was quantified using built-up area land cover classifications. Second, a change detection methodology was applied to a declassified KeyHole Hexagon (KH-9) and Sentinel-2 satellite image to detect areas of redevelopment within Bishkek. Finally, vertical development was quantified using multi-temporal high-resolution stereo and tri-stereo satellite imagery, which were used in a deep learning workflow to extract buildings footprints and assign building heights. Our results revealed urban growth of 139 km2 (92%) and redevelopment of ~26% (59 km2) of the city (1979–2021). The trends of urban growth were not reflected in all the open access global settlement footprint products that were evaluated. Building polygons that were extracted using a deep learning workflow applied to high-resolution tri-stereo (Pleiades) satellite imagery were most accurate (F1 score = 0.70) compared to stereo (WorldView-2) imagery (F1 score = 0.61). Similarly, building heights extracted using a Pleiades-derived digital elevation model were most comparable to independent measurements obtained using ICESat-2 altimetry data and field-measurements (normalized absolute median deviation < 1 m). Across different areas of the city, our analysis suggested rates of building growth in the region of 2000–10,700 buildings per year, which when combined with a trend of urban growth towards active faults highlights the importance of up-to-date building stock exposure data in areas of seismic hazard.

After cyclone “Aila,” North 24 Parganas underwent a huge amount of spatial change. According to the Development Research Communication and Services Centre, a total of 55,600 ha cropland area has been affected in this district due to “Aila.” Cropland was transformed into aquacultural pond due to saltwater intrusion in this area. Water intrusion has changed the agricultural practices, livelihood, and also land degradation. Remote sensing data is used for land use and land cover types like water and vegetation area detection. Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential aspect in global climate change studies used in calculating radiation budgets, heat balance studies, and also estimating the climate change scenario in a particular area. Landsat multitemporal imageries during the period of 2000–2020 data are used to identify the water area change detection in the southern parts of North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal.

To reach high performance various techniques of fusion are exploited using a combination of multi-temporal, multispectral and panchromatic satellite images. A solution for handling such kind of images holds when using some simple statistical methods like the Percent Difference (PD) technique as well as the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) one. In this paper, an automatic change detection method issued from the two previous techniques is proposed and applied on multispectral and panchromatic images captured by a high resolution optical satellite. This approach is characterized by two aspects: the first one consists of the fusion of the different data and the second one performs the detection of the changes for the resulting images. The experimental results show the reasonable quantitative performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method for change detection, consisting of an automatic extraction of most of change information as well as the obtention of better results for most precision metrics consisting of an overall accuracy of up to 91% and a Kappa coefficient of up to 66%, comparing to those obtained using the simple PD and PCA techniques. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","detection method; image analysis; image processing; principal component analysis; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis","change detection; fusion; percent difference (PD); principal component analysis (PCA); Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079234276"

The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is geographically situated in the semi-arid zone in Iraq, whose water resources have been limited in the last decades and mostly shared with other neighboring countries. To analyze drought impacts on the vegetation cover and the land surface temperature in the KRI for a span of 20 years from 1998 to 2017, remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have been adopted in this study. For this study, 120 Landsat satellite images were downloaded and utilized, whereas six images covering the entire study area were used for each year of the study period. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surfaces Temperature Index (LST) were applied to produce multi-temporal classified drought maps. Changes in the area and values of the classified NDVI and LST were calculated and mapped. Mann–Kendall and Sen’s Slope statistical tests were used to assess the variability of drought indices variation in 60 locations in the study area. The results revealed increases in severity and frequency of drought over the study period, particularly in the years 2000 and 2008, which were characterized by an increase in land surface temperatures, a decrease in vegetation area cover, and a lack of precipitation averages. Climate conditions affect the increase/decrease of the vegetated cover area, and geographical variability is also one factor that significantly influences the distribution of vegetation. It can be concluded that the southeast and southwestern parts of the KRI were subjected to the most severe droughts over the past 20 years. © 2022 by the authors.

In this context, images from the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4), CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 have been used in remote sensing applications in Brazil. However, the geometric accuracy of the WFI data has not yet been documented in the literature, as it was done for other satellites/sensors such as TERRA/MODIS, Landsat-8/OLI, and Sentinel-2/MSI. This work presents the first study to assess the geometric accuracy of WFI images along different spectral channels, from multi-temporal images, and taking Sentinel-2/MSI images as a reference. Surface reflectance WFI images, Level-4 (orthorectified) with spatial resolution of 55 m (CBERS-4A) and 64 m (CBERS-4 and Amazonia-1) were analysed. Thousands of control points (CPs) were used to quantify the geometric accuracy of more than 300 WFI images and to construct multiple mapping functions to correct the displacements found. The NIR band was taken as a reference in the inter-channel (band-to-band) registration evaluation. In this case, all tiles had an RMSE average of fewer than 0.44 pixels. For the multi-temporal case, the CBERS-4A/WFI had the highest average RMSE (0.87 ± 0.34 pixels). Considering the Sentinel-2/MSI as a reference, there were observed shifts up to 1.45 pixels for CBERS-4/WFI and Amazonia-1/WFI and 2.5 pixels for CBERS-4A/WFI. Given the displacements found, image registration is needed for further time series analysis of WFI images for several applications that requiring precise sub-pixel registration (i.e., land use cover change). As a result, we propose a framework for the automatic registration of WFI images to properly foster the use of WFI images. This framework substantially reduced the misregistrations, decreasing the RMSE average to less than 0.29 pixels for the WFI images from the three satellites. The use of the 2nd degree polynomial as a mapping function proved to be appropriate for registering the WFI data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Brazilian earth observation satellites; Multi-sensor approach; Satellite images time series; Wide-field imager","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139735612"

The task of localization of overgrowth is solved on the basis of multi-temporal satellite images wavelet analysis. This technique allows to operationally and automatically detect areas of fallow lands overgrowth with tree and shrub vegetation. The proposed methodology was tested using satellite images obtained from Quickbird, GeoEye and WorldView satellites. For each image, a fourth-order wavelet decomposition was performed in terms of the Daubeshi wavelet functions. Comparing the different levels of the images wavelet transform, it is possible to divide the areas without tree and shrub vegetation, and where overgrowth was depicted. The method proposed by the authors for detecting changes based on wavelet analysis has shown that this method practically does not depend on the influence of shooting conditions and, accordingly, is more effective at detecting changes. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146878976"

As it is necessary to study phenological data over a period of time across a large territory, a lot of storage space is needed to save the satellite images and a lot of calculation time to analyse all this information. Sensing periods are usually established based on subjective expert criteria or previous experience. However, this decision may cause several differences when discriminating crop patterns, besides not guaranteeing good precision. These processes would greatly improve if the appropriate time periods could be found systematically using the minimum number of satellite images in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to determine a suitable sensing period for crop identification using Sentinel-2 images, applying hill climbing algorithms to the training sets of neural network models.

Most of the conventional remote sensing software and land cover classification approaches, however, are only designed for single-date observations. To fully utilize the amount of data we receive and to improve land use/land cover mapping (LULC), technological advancements in machine learning, open-source processing, and GPU-accelerated hardware should be utilized. In this paper, a methodology for classification of temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 images was developed using open-source Python libraries. Light Gradient Boosting Machine, a machine learning algorithm that uses tree-based learning, was used to classify different land cover types based on a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Although the use of powerful machine learning algorithm resulted to more accurate land cover maps, temporal inconsistencies are still pervasive when dealing with time series outputs. To remove these temporal inconsistencies that resulted from misclassifications, temporal land cover filter based on transition probability matrix was applied on the time series land cover maps to modify the illogical land cover transitions. Accuracy assessment revealed good performance of the approach, which produced higher overall accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Image classification; Light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM); Multivariate alteration detection (MAD); Sentinel 2 image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110027736"

Consequently, monitoring and detecting the changes of coastal areas is thus necessary in order to provide valuable information for future mitigation and adaptation. Recently, the utilization of satellite images for coastal areas has been used widely and effectively as a viable alternative to in-situ observation and monitoring. In this study, multi-temporal satellite imagery data from Sentinel-2 have been used to find out the changes in the coastal area of Gianyar and Klungkung Regency - Bali, considering the capability which has good resolution with a wide swath and high revisit time. Sentinel-2 imagery data taken from 2016 and 2019 at an interval of about 4 years were collected to determine coastline changes. There are two main steps to detect the coastline. First is image classification by supervised classification where each pixel has been labeled with one or three classes. And the second is to make border segmentation between sand and water by applying the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). The areas that are experiencing erosion and accretion were determined by using the overlay method between two satellite images. Results show that about 9,248 m2 of coastline were eroded in Gianyar Regency and 121,000 m2 in Klungkung Regency for the period of 2016 to 2019. Meanwhile, the accretion area reached 158,615 m2 in Gianyar and 32,159 m2 in Klungkung Regency.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Bali; Coastline change; Erosion; MNDWI; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141838816"

Quaternary sea-level fluctuations, especially during the last transgression, left geomorphic marks on the atoll and its surrounding shelf. This study investigated the shelf of Rocas Atoll based on single-beam, sonography, grabbed bottom sediments, and multi-temporal satellite imagery. The Rocas Atoll has a surrounding shelf with general E–W orientation, predominantly flat with a water depth of 25 m. The shelf break occurs between 45 and 50 m water depth, reaching up to 80 m locally on northwestern. Inner and outer shelf zones are marked by step-terrace features. The deepest break in relief (T1) occurs at ∼70 m water depth, a terrace (T2) at 40 m, and another terrace (T3) occurs at 30 m. Most of the hard-bottoms are reefs. Close to the atoll, in shallow depths, reefs occur aggregated, forming a tridimensional structure of low relief mounds and paths. As the water depth increases toward the outer shelf, the reefs occur isolated. The geomorphologic patterns of this shelf are analogous to the northeast Brazilian shelf, reflecting the influence of Pleistocene/Holocene sea-level oscillations. Furthermore, multi-temporal satellite images between 2001 and 2019 reveal that modern processes of reef erosion, as a response to decadal climate phenomena, intensify the shelf sedimentation, and the South Equatorial Currents shape the modern shelf and affect seasonally the sediment transport and sand body dimensions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","","Bathymetry; Carbonate sedimentation; Marine terraces; Reefs; Sea-level changes; Sidescan sonar","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129455547"

In particular, in the field of crop classification, time dimension information is particularly important. Although some advanced machine learning algorithms, such as random forests (RFs), can achieve good results, they often ignore the time series information. To make full use of temporal and spectral information in multitemporal remote sensing images, a channel attention-based temporal convolutional network (CA-TCN) is proposed in this letter. Specifically, the proposed method is composed of two main modules: temporal convolutional network and attention block. The temporal convolutional network can capture long-range dependence by using a hierarchy of temporal convolutional filters. To capture relevant information inside the sequence and enhance the important information, the attention block is used to enhance the important features in the channel dimension since not all bands contain equal information in crop type classification. The proposed CA-TCN can excavate deeper phenological characteristics.

It has resulted in significant changes in estuarine wetland ecosystems between rainy and dry seasons. To avoid estuary vulnerability, monitoring and evaluation of the estuarine ecosystems are very critical tasks. The main goal of this research is to propose and implement a novel deep learning method in monitoring various ecosystems in estuarine regions. The processing speed and accuracy of common neural networks is improved more than ten times through spatial and context paths integrated into a novel Bilateral Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). The multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite images (including Sentinel-2, ALOS-DEM, and NOAA-DEM images) served as input data. As a result, four BiSeNet models out of 20 trained models achieved a greater than 90% accuracy, especially for interpreting estuarine waters, intertidal forested wetlands, and aquacultural lands in subtidal regions. These models outperformed Random Forest and Support Vector Machine approaches. The best one was used to map estuarine ecosystems from 12 satellite images over a five-year period in the largest estuary in northern Vietnam. The ecosystem changes between dry and rainy seasons were analyzed in detail to assess the ecological succession in estuaries. Furthermore, this model can potentially update new estuarine ecosystem types in other estuarine areas across the world, making possible real-time monitoring and assessing estuarine ecological conditions for sustainable management of wetland ecosystem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Viet Nam; Decision trees; Deep learning; Ecosystems; Learning systems; Rivers; Semantics; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Wetlands; Bilateral semantic segmentation; Deep learning; Dry seasons; Ecosystem management; Electrical power; Estuarine wetland ecosystems; Learning approach; Rainy seasons; Segmentation models; Semantic segmentation; ecosystem management; estuarine ecosystem; machine learning; modeling; segmentation; wetland management; Article; bilateral semantic segmentation model; community succession; deep learning; environmental management; environmental monitoring; estuarine species; flow kinetics; geographic distribution; image segmentation; machine learning; nonhuman; processing speed; satellite imagery; semantic web; sustainable agriculture; vegetation; Viet Nam; wetland; Estuaries","Bilateral semantic segmentation; Deep learning; Estuary; Sustainability; Wetland","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130303989"

The paper presents the results of studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest fires and their consequences for 2001-2019. in the basin of the Kichera River, located in the north of Buryatia, where the greatest loss of forest cover in the Republic over the past 20 years has been noted. The research was carried out using statistical materials from a number of international projects and open access databases specializing in the processing of satellite information about fires, as well as using our own calculations based on the interpretation of multi-zone satellite images. The results of the calculation in the GIS environment of the number of fires and the area of total loss of forest cover in the Kichera River basin for each year, as well as the results of their comparison are given. The most unfavorable years in terms of pyrogenic conditions were identified (2006, 2010, 2015, 2019). Inaccuracies in accounting for the loss of forest cover in open access databases are noted, associated with accounting for losses in the next year, and not the year corresponding to the fire. Based on multi-temporal Landsat-7-ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images, based on the integration of the results of calculating two spectral indices NDVI and NBR, as well as their difference variations (dNDVI and dNBR), identification, mapping and determination of the area of burnt forest areas in the Kichera River basin were carried out for years with the highest flammability. The analysis revealed a clearly defined trend of an annual increase in the number of fires, primarily due to a decrease in precipitation, high temperatures and a decrease in the water level in Lake Baikal. It is noted that the role of the pyrogenic factor in the overall reduction of forest area in the Kichera River basin in some years exceeds 90%. An analysis of the spatial confinement of burnt forest areas makes it possible with a high degree of probability to assume a predominantly anthropogenic origin of fires. © 2022 SPIE.","Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Lakes; Photomapping; Rivers; Water levels; Watersheds; Forest area; Forest cover; Forest cover loss; Forest fires; Kichera river basin; North of the baikal natural territory; Remote-sensing; River basins; Spectral indices; The normalized burn ratio index; Remote sensing","Forest cover loss; forest fires; Kichera river basin; North of the Baikal natural territory; remote sensing; spectral indices; the Normalized Burn Ratio index (NBR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146711665"

One important feature of satellite images is the trade-off between spatial/spectral resolution and their revisiting time, a consequence of design and physical constraints imposed by satellite orbit among other technical limitations. In this paper, we focus on fusing multi-temporal, multi-spectral images where data acquired from different instruments with different spatial resolutions is used. We leverage the spatial relationship between images at multiple modalities to generate high-resolution image sequences at higher revisiting rates. To achieve this goal, we formulate the fusion method as a recursive state estimation problem and study its performance in filtering and smoothing contexts.

The need for satellite systems to monitor rice crops and assist in rice crop management is gaining in popularity. The European Space Agency's (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform's which enhanced the temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution, opening the way for their widely use in crop monitoring. Aside from the technical features of the Sentinel-2 A and B constellation, the easily accessible type of information they generate as well as the appropriate support software have been significant improvements for rice crop monitoring. In this study, the spectral reflectance has been analysed to find how far their potential in determining rice growth phases. The highest spectrum in reflectance was observed in the near infrared (NIR) region (842 nm). Because of the structure of mesophyll cells tissues and the inner backscatter of air spaces, moisture content, and air-water abstraction layers within the leaves, the reflectance in the NIR region seems to be much larger than in the visible band. The multi-temporal vegetation index namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) have derived from ten Sentinel-2 images cover the entire rice season. These indices have been tested to determine the rice growth phases over the rice season. The spatial distribution of each tested indices is displayed in the map output. The maps are then analysed and compared to determine the potential of each index in determining rice growth phases. It was discovered in this study that there was a quadratic correlation between all of the tested indices and rice age. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most accurate vegetation index for estimating rice growth phases, followed by SAVI and NDMI.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135488177"

Although ice avalanches have been widely observed in mountainous regions around the world, only a few ice avalanche events have been studied comprehensively, due to the lack of available data. In this study, in response to the recent catastrophic rock-ice avalanche (7 February 2021) at Chamoli in the India Himalaya, we used high-resolution satellite images and found that this event was actually a glacier-rock landslide, where the collapse of the rock-ice body was caused by the sliding of the bedrock beneath the glacier, for which the source area and volume loss were about 2.89×105 m2 and 2.46×107 m3, respectively, corresponding to an average elevation change of about -85 m. Furthermore, visual analysis of the dense time-series satellite images shows that the overall downward sliding of the collapsed rock-ice body initiated around the summer of 2017, and thereafter exhibited clear seasonality (mainly in summer). Meteorological analysis reveals a strong rainfall anomaly in the initiation period of the sliding and a remarkable winter warming anomaly in the 40 days before the collapse. Comparisons of multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) further suggest that the glacier geometry in the collapsed areas was likely changing (i.e., accelerated surface thinning in the lower part of the glaciers and insignificant change in the upper part), which is consistent with the region-wide climate warming. Finally, by combining the above findings and a geomorphic analysis, we conclude that the rock-ice avalanche event was mainly caused by the joint effects of climate and weather changes acting on a steeply sloping and fracture-prone geological condition. The findings of this study provide new and valuable evidence for the study of slope/glacier instability at high altitudes. This study also highlights that, for the Himalaya and other high mountain ranges, there is an urgent need to identify the glaciers that have a high risk of ice avalanches. © 2021, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chamoli; Himalayas; India; Uttarakhand; Climate change; Hazards; Ice; Landforms; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Driving effect; High resolution satellite images; Himalayas; Ice avalanches; Mountain hazard; Mountainous regions; Remote-sensing; Rock avalanche; Rock-ice avalanche; Weather change; climate change; glacier; mountain region; natural hazard; remote sensing; rock avalanche; weather; Rocks","Climate change; Himalaya; Mountain hazards; Remote sensing; Rock-ice avalanche","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117571724"

The statistical detection method is applied to a residual sequence computed from backward and forward novelty filters applied to all images in the series. Significant changes are computed with a guarantee on their number of false alarms (NFA).

However, in-season crop mapping over a large area is still challenging due to the insufficiency of ground truth in the early stage of a growing season. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient machine-learning workflow for the rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans fields without ground truth data for the current year. We use trusted pixels, a set of pixels that are predicted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data with high confidence in the current year's crop type, to label training samples on multi-temporal satellite images for crop type classification. The entire mapping process only involves a limited number of satellite images acquired within the growing season (normally 3–4 images per scene) and no field data needs to be collected. According to the investigation on 12 states of the U.S. Corn Belt, it is found that a considerable number of trusted pixels can be identified from the historical CDL data by the trusted pixel prediction model based on artificial neural network. According to the experiment on 49 Landsat-8 scenes and 31 Sentinel-2 tiles, the in-season maps of corn and soybeans are expected to reach 85%–95% agreement with CDL as well as field data by mid-July. Once the in-season satellite imagery becomes available, the crop cover map can be rapidly created even with limited computational resources. This study provides a new perspective and detailed guidance for rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans, which can be potentially applied to identify more diverse crop types and scaled up to the entire United States. © 2021","Corn Belt; United States; Glycine max; land use change; Landsat; machine learning; maize; pixel; satellite data; Sentinel; soybean; vegetation mapping","Crop mapping; Cropland Data Layer; Land use and land cover; Landsat; Machine learning; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115787824"

The prediction of crop yield includes the extensive manual sampling or the use of remote sensing images at present. Particularly, the remote sensing is preferred to predict the large-scale crop yield, providing a large number of satellite images with long time and high spatial resolution. Much effort has been made on the crop yield prediction using remote sensing images and deep learning. However, the yield generally presents nonlinear spatio-temporal characteristics, due mainly to the growth status of crops changes with the time. A single deep learning cannot make full use of crop growth characteristics in multi-temporal images. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Networks - Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) estimation model was proposed to extract rich spatial-spectral features from multi-spectral remote sensing images. The time dependence in the phase remote sensing image was also adaptively learned among the various stages in the growth period of winter wheat. As such, the growth characteristics of winter wheat were integrated from multiple scales, further to predict the yield. Furthermore, the main production areas of winter wheat in the country were taken as the research area, including 1 713 districts and counties. The forecast dataset of winter wheat production was finally constructed using the statistical output of winter wheat, MODIS surface reflectance, day and night surface temperature images, and land cover data from 2001 to 2018, thereby to verify the performance of CNN-GRU production estimation model. The results showed that: 1) The annual average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the CNN-GRU production estimation model from 2016 to 2018 were 818.3 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was reduced by 20.13%, 18.81%, 29.51%, 34.84%, and 36.57%, respectively, compared with the CNN, GRU, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Therefore, the CNN-GRU yield estimation model can be expected to accurately predict the winter wheat yield, further to effectively extract the space-spectrum-time information in the entire growth period of winter wheat from multi-temporal remote sensing images. 2) Six time windows were divided during the whole growth period of winter wheat, including the sowing-emergence, tillering-overwintering, green-rising, jointing-booting, heading-flowering, and filling-maturity period. Among them, the highest accuracy of CNN-GRU estimation model was found in the filling-maturation period. Specifically, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE were 817 and 556 kg/hm2, respectively, and R2 was greater than 0.7. However, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE during the heading-flowering period were 823 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was 0.7% lower than the filling-maturation period. Therefore, the proposed CNN-GRU yield estimation model can accurately predict the output of winter wheat in the middle and late stages of growth period, particularly for the national yield of winter wheat two months in advance. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The application of change detection in remote sensing is considered complicated due to continuous interaction of humans with nature. Further, the change detection in land cover and water bodies plays a major role in global change. Manual change detection process via experts consumes more time to survey the land, whereas detection of changes in land cover and water bodies via an artificial intelligence (AI) model enables faster change detection. However, multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data calibration poses a serious problem in remote-sensing application. It makes the entire clustering process a difficult one and hence the accuracy of change detection degrades. In this paper, we apply the task of unsupervised learning to a deep learning model namely deep belief network. Here, the land cover images are clustered using the unlabeled data, where the algorithms are trained in unsupervised manner. The intelligent decisions are made available via deep belief network that clusters the uncategorized the land covers and water bodies images from the satellite image database. The dataset includes Landsat sensors' datasets in dry semi-arid river basin in Western India. The performance of the unsupervised deep belief network is evaluated in terms of various performance metrics that includes accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, geometric mean, peak signal noise ratio and mean average percentage error. © 2022 IEEE.","Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Change detection; Clusterings; Continuous interactions; Deep belief networks; Detection process; Global change; Land cover; Remote-sensing; Sensing areas; Waterbodies; Remote sensing","Change Detection; Clustering; Deep Belief Network; Land Cover","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128909664"

The current study presents an autonomous method for extracting water bodies from satellite pictures that use a single-band threshold approach with bilateral filtering.

In this context, remote sensing images have shown a high potential in forest cover changes detection. In Vietnam, although the existence of a large number of such images and ground-truth labels, current researches still relied on classical methods employed manual indices, such as multi-variant change vector analysis (MVCA) and normalized difference vegetation index. These methods highly require domain knowledge to determine threshold values for forest change that are applicable only for studied areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to detect coastal forest cover changes, which can exploit available dataset and ground-truth labels. Moreover, the proposed method does not require much domain knowledge. We used multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery to train a segmentation model, that is based on the U-Net network. It was used then to detect forest areas at the same location taken at different times. Lastly, we compared obtained results to identify forest disturbances. Experimental results demonstrated that our method provided a high accuracy of 95.4% on the testing set. Furthermore, we compared our model with the MVCA method and found that our model outperforms this popular method by 3.8%. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

This allows more spectral changes to be detected, especially major changes that reflected on the overall spectral signature (associating with the abrupt land-cover transitions), as well as subtle changes that reflect only on a portion of the spectral signature (associating with the change of physicochemical properties of the land-cover classes). Currently, there are some available hyperspectral change detection (CD) data sets. However, they have the following drawbacks. First, there is a lack of diversity in the data source; all data sets were created using the Hyperion sensor mounted on the EO-1 satellite. Second, these data sets mainly concentrate on the river and agriculture scenes, which lose their diversity for representing different land-covers. In this paper, we construct three new change detection data sets by using the multitemporal images acquired by the China's new generation of hyperspectral satellites, i.e., OHS, GF-5 and ZY1-02D. These data sets present various event-driven land-cover changes, such as new building construction, crop replacements, and the expansion of energy facilities. Then a novel unsupervised hyperspectral change detection approach is proposed based on the intrinsic image decomposition (IID).

We have accumulated large archives of satellite images of snow–glacial systems on Earth with different spatial resolutions over the past 50 years. Together with the previously created topographic maps displaying glaciers, glacier catalogs, special maps, and atlases of ice and snow, they provide data to determine changes in areas, lengths, volumes, and altitudes of glaciers during the current climate warming. In 1986, the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) was founded to monitor glacier fluctuations in different regions of the Earth. However, the number of observation sites is limited. The Global Ground Glacier Observing Network mainly includes those glaciers where we previously conducted ground-based studies of glacier front fluctuations, mass balance measurements, measurements of meteorological parameters, ice flow velocities, and ablation features. To identify regional differences, different altitude and plan locations, the influence of permafrost, and the background landscape environment requires that data on a larger number of glaciers be analyzed. Therefore, groups of researchers from Irkutsk and Beijing began to study the dynamics of glaciers in the inland regions of Eurasia within the framework of international projects. Several glaciers were selected in the mountains of the south of Eastern Siberia, the Mongolian Altai, and the eastern part of the Tien Shan. We recorded current glacier fronts and their elevations. The lengths and areas of glaciers in the early 1970s and early 2000s and their current state were determined. In recent decades, some connections between the dynamics of glaciers and changes in meteorological parameters have been revealed. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Altai; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Irkutsk; Mongolia; Myanmar; Shan; Siberia; Tien Shan; World; ablation; glacier; global warming; mountain","cold content; dynamics of glaciers; eastern ridges of the Tien Shan; Mongolian Altai; monitoring; south of Eastern Siberia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126776735"

Deep learning (DL) method which is attracting widespread interest has proven to be an efficient approach to measure the similarity between image pairs in quick and accurate manner by extracting complex and detailed features from satellite images. However, Image matching of VHR satellite images remains challenging due to limitations of DL models in which the results are depending on the quantity and quality of training dataset, as well as the difficulty of creating training dataset with VHR satellite images. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of DL-based method in matching pair extraction which is the most time-consuming process during image registration. This paper also aims to analyze factors that affect the accuracy based on the configuration of training dataset, when developing training dataset from existing multi-sensor VHR image database with bias for DL-based image matching. For this purpose, the generated training dataset were composed of correct matching pairs and incorrect matching pairs by assigning true and false labels to image pairs extracted using a grid-based Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for a total of 12 multi-temporal and multi-sensor VHR images. The Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), proposed for matching pair extraction on constructed training dataset, proceeds with model learning and measures similarities by passing two images in parallel to the two identical convolutional neural network structures. The results from this study confirm that data acquired from VHR satellite image database can be used as DL training dataset and indicate the potential to improve efficiency of the matching process by appropriate configuration of multi-sensor images. DL-based image matching techniques using multi-sensor VHR satellite images are expected to replace existing manual-based feature extraction methods based on its stable performance, thus further develop into an integrated DL-based image registration framework. © 2022 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

The farmlands are divided into small pieces that consider the different behaviors of farmers for their planting contents in Taiwan. Hence, the conventional image classification process cannot produce good outcomes. The crop phenological information will be a core factor to multi-period image data. Accordingly, the study intends to resolve the previous problem by using three different SPOT6 satellite images and nine Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar images, which were used to calculate features such as texture and indicator information, in 2019. Considering that a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) index (i) can integrate different image data sources, (ii) can integrate data of different lengths, and (iii) can generate information with time characteristics, this type of index can resolve certain classification problems with long-term crop classification and monitoring. More specifically, this study used the time series data analysis of DTW to produce “multi-scale time series feature similarity indicators”. We used three approaches (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Decision Tree) to classify paddy patches into two groups: (a) the first group did not apply a DTW index, and (b) the second group extracted conflict predicted data from (a) to apply a DTW index. The outcomes from the second group performed better than the first group in regard to overall accuracy (OA) and kappa. Among those classifiers, the Neural Network approach had the largest improvement of OA and kappa from 89.51, 0.66 to 92.63, 0.74, respectively. The rest of the two classifiers also showed progress. The best performance of classification results was obtained from the Decision Tree of 94.71, 0.81. Observing the outcomes, the interference effects of the image were resolved successfully by various image problems using the spectral image and radar image for paddy rice classification. The overall accuracy and kappa showed improvement, and the maximum kappa was enhanced by about 8%. The classification performance was improved by considering the DTW index. © 2022 by the authors.

This study proposes a geographic information system (GIS)-based methodology to estimate the water volume changes in water reservoirs. Two specific methods are proposed using Australian National University’s Digital Elevation Model (ANUDEM) raster surface and Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface models, both utilizing normalized difference water index (NDWI) of Sentinel 2A satellite images for water-covered area and coastline and digital elevation model (DEM) for 3D modelling of the reservoir. The most crucial part of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of the model findings considering hydrological, meteorological and anthropogenic factors, simultaneously. Application of the proposed methods is provided for the analysis of the multi-temporal water volume changes of Bayramiç Dam Lake (Çanakkale, Turkey) in two hydrological periods covering the 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 water years. The results indicate that the TINS model produced water volume values much closer to the in situ Turkish General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) values than the ANUDEM model. The performance of these methods was also assessed by the temporal dynamics of surface hydrological processes. Regarding the water storage dynamics, hydro-meteorological factors influence the water input, while anthropogenic factors strongly influence the water output. Water consumption for irrigation and electricity generation was found to be the most important water budget components of the total water consumption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anthropogenic Effects; Australia; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Lakes; Remote Sensing Technology; Water; Australia; 3D modeling; Budget control; Digital instruments; Digital storage; Geomorphology; Lakes; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Surveying; water; Anthropogenic factors; Australian National University; Digital elevation model; Meteorological factors; Normalized difference water index; Reservoir volume; Surface modeling; Volume change; Water reservoir volume; Water volumes; comparative study; dam; digital elevation model; environmental assessment; GIS; lake water; NDVI; remote sensing; reservoir; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Article; Australia; comparative study; dam (barrier); financial management; geographic information system; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); lake ecosystem; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; normalized difference water index; remote sensing; satellite imagery; scoring system; surface water hydrology; Turkey (republic); water monitoring; water supply; environmental monitoring; human; lake; Geographic information systems","DEM; GIS; NDWI; Surface models; Water reservoir volume","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122968838"

Local specialty fruits (e.g. walnut, jujube, apricot, fragrant pear, and apple) have been produced in four prefectures of Southern Xinjiang around the Tarim River Basin, accounting for more than 80% of the total fruit planting area in Xinjiang. It is very necessary to real-time and accurately acquire the fruit tree type and area information under the pattern of forest and crops interplanting, further to improve the quality and efficiency of the specialty fruit industry. Taking the continuous area of forest and crops interplanting in Hotan oasis of southern Xinjiang in China as an example, this study aims to extract the structure information of fruit trees from the satellite images. The high-resolution remote sensing image data with abundant texture and spectral characteristics was also integrated with the medium-resolution sensing image data with multi-temporal characteristics. Firstly, an object-oriented programming was used to extract the high-precision boundary of fruit trees parcel using GF-2 (PMS) image data. The GF-2 image data was divided into the winter (February) and summer-autumn (July-September). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was determined to identify the spectral and texture features between target objects and other ground objects. Four plots were obtained to gradually eliminate the non-target ground categories. Then, the NDVI time series products were constructed using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 image data. A decision tree model was established to extract the interplanting walnut, pure walnut, jujube, and grape orchard, according to the characteristics of phenology. There were many peaks and troughs in the NDVI time series curve of fruit trees in one year. The peak represented the flourishing period of fruit trees' growth, and the trough reflected the orchard management (such as irrigation and pruning branches). There were some outstanding and different time windows for the NDVI timing series of pure walnut, interplanting walnut, jujubes, and grapes, particularly for the rarely staggered overlapping. These differences were greatly contributed to the classification of fruit trees. Finally, the multi-phase orchard classification was overlaid the high-resolution of fruit trees parcel, further to obtain the distribution of fruit crops in the study area. The research results show that the major area of fruit was 4.28×105 hm2 here, with 3.31×105 hm2 of the walnut orchard (including interplanting and pure walnut), 8.29×104 hm2 of jujube, and 1.40×104 hm2 of grapes. The area of interplanting walnuts accounted for 63.8% of the total fruit area, The user accuracy and overall classification accuracy were both exceed 90%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.95, fully meeting the accuracy requirements of agroforestry classification at the county and city level. The relative accuracies of walnuts, jujube, and grapes were 62.1%, 97.8%, and 85.2%, respectively, using remote sensing extraction, compared with the forestry survey in 2019. The areas of jujube and grape using remote sensing extraction were close to the forestry survey data. The walnut planting areas in the Hotan area were mainly distributed in the upper reaches of Yurunkax and Karakax River with suitable soil and water conditions. The jujube trees were mostly distributed in the downstream oasis-desert ecotone, and the grapes were mostly distributed in the sandy desert of the lower reaches of the Karakax River. This finding can provide a strong reference for the fruit tree extraction under the pattern of forest and crop intercropping. © 2022, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This paper presents the methodology developed to produce a prototype relative to 2018 as the first land cover map of the future annual map series (COSsim). A total of thirteen land cover classes are represented, including the most important tree species in Portugal. The mapping approach developed includes two levels of spatial stratification based on landscape dynamics. Strata are analysed independently at the higher level, while nested sublevels can share data and procedures. Multiple stages of analysis are implemented in which subsequent stages improve the outputs of precedent stages. The goal is to adjust mapping to the local landscape and tackle specific problems or divide complex mapping tasks in several parts. Supervised classification of Sentinel-2 time series and post-classification analysis with expert knowledge were performed throughout four stages. The overall accuracy of the map is estimated at 81.3% (±2.1) at the 95% confidence level. Higher thematic accuracy was achieved in southern Portugal, and expert knowledge significantly improved the quality of the map. © 2022 by the authors.

In our case states represent affine transformations. The proposed method globally combines via synchronization pairwise transformations computed for all the image combinations of the multi-temporal sequence, beyond the traditional image-to-base approach available in remote sensing and GIS packages.

A maximum likelihood classifier and normalised vegetation index differencing were used to determine LULC changes. Mangrove vegetation cover was examined using fraction vegetation cover analysis. Classification accuracy for LULC type was 86.1% and 87.2% for 2002 and 2017, respectively. The results showed a 22.06% loss (122.52 ha) and 4.47% increase (24.99 ha) in mangrove areas. Mangrove areas were converted to oil palm plantations (32.7%), forests (32.3%), settlements (9.25%), barren land (8.99%), rivers (6.8%), swampland (6.11%), urban development (1.67%), rubber plantations (1.25%), bodies of water (0.77%) and roads (0.09%). Increases in mangrove vegetation cover were observed along riverbanks away from development activities. Decreases in mangrove vegetation cover were affected by land-use activities. Proper management is required to avoid further loss of mangrove areas, and appropriate LULC management planning is needed to conserve mangrove areas and sustain firefly ecotourism. © 2021 The Authors","","Change detection; Firefly ecotourism; Landsat images; Mangrove; Vegetation cover fraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112646346"

An effective prediction method is necessary for food security. In this study, we extract the optimal vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to stripe rust at different time-periods, and develop a wheat stripe rust prediction model with satellite images to realize the multi-temporal prediction. First, VIs related to stripe rust stress are extracted as candidate features for disease prediction from time series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the optimal VI combinations are selected using sequential forward selection (SFS). Finally, the occurrence of wheat stripe rust in different time-periods is predicted using the support vector machine (SVM) method. The results of the features selected demonstrate that, before the jointing period, the optimal VIs are related to the biomass, pigment, and moisture of wheat. After the jointing period, the red-edge VIs related to the crop health status play important roles. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the prediction model, which is based on SVM, is generally higher than those of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The SVM method is more suitable for time series predictions of wheat stripe rust. The model obtained accuracy based on the optimal VI combinations and the SVM increased over time; the highest accuracy was 86.2%. These results indicate that the prediction model can provide guidance and suggestions for early disease prevention of the study site, and the method combines time series Sentinel-2 images and the SVM, which can be used to predict wheat stripe rust. © 2021 by the authors.

In this sense, remote sensing products have shown their power to investigate soil properties, but the assessment of its spatial information can be hampered by the presence of other objects than soil. To overcome this issue, soil scientists have been studying spatial patterns from multi-temporal satellite images aiming at at improving soil property maps. In this work, we applied the cubist algorithm to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, organic matter and iron contents, and soil color components) in south-eastern Brazil using multi-temporal (Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI) and single-date images (PlanetScope, Landsat8-OLI, and Sentinel2-MSI). We aimed to evaluate the influence of satellite's spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions on soil mapping. Predictive models were constructed with 120 soil samples and using four (vis-NIR) and six (vis-NIR-SWIR) spectral bands as predictors in a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The multi-temporal image obtained from the Sentinel2-MSI satellite (with 10 m pixel size and six spectral bands), showed the best model performances in cross-validation (R2 between 0.48 and 0.78). The PlanetScope image, which has only four bands in the vis-NIR region and spatial resolution of 3 m did not improve model performances, although the R2 values were higher for soil color components (R2 > 0.5). Satellite images in different spatial, spectral and temporal resolution provides slightly different soil property maps which may promote different strategies regarding soil classification and management. However, satellite images should be used with caution, as they provide only surficial information about the soil variability and confirmation with field surveys is required. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Agronomy; Decision making; Image classification; Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil surveys; Cubist; Landsat 8-OLI; Multi-temporal image; Planetscope; Property maps; Sentinel 2-MSI; Soil classification; Soil management; Soil mapping; Soil property; algorithm; image classification; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; soil classification; soil color; soil organic matter; soil property; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; topsoil; Soils","Cubist; Landsat 8-OLI; Multi-temporal images; PlanetScope; Sentinel 2-MSI; Soil classification; Soil management; Soil mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103422737"

This study first obtained images from the Sentinel-2 satellites for the period 2015–2020 with the objective of applying multi-temporal spectral indices to assess areas burned in wildfires and prescribed fires in the Margalla Hills of Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using those images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which are often used to assess the severity of fires, were calculated for wildfires and prescribed fires. For each satellite image, spectral indices values were extracted for the 5th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th and 95th percentiles of pixels of each burned area. Then, boxplots representing the distribution of these values were plotted for each satellite image to identify whether the regeneration time subsequent to a fire, also known as the burn scar, and the severity of the fire differed between the autumn and summer wildfires, and with prescribed fires. A statistical test revealed no differences for the regeneration time amongst the three categories of fires, but that the severity of summer wildfires was significantly different from that of prescribed fire, and this, for both indices. Second, SAR images were obtained from the Sentinel-1 mission for the same period as that of the optical imagery. A comparison of the response of 34 SAR variables with official data on wildfires and prescribed fires from the Capital Development Authority revealed that the 95th percentile of the Normalized Signal Ratio (NSR p_95) was found to be the best variable to detect fire events, although only 50% of the fires were correctly detected. Nonetheless, when the occurrence of fire events according to the SAR variable NSR p_95 was compared to that from the two spectral indices, the SAR variable was found to correctly identify 95% of fire events. The SAR variable NSR p_95 is thus a suitable alternative to spectral indices to monitor the progress of wildfires and assess their severity when there are limitations to the use of optical images due to cloud coverage or smoke, for instance. © 2021 by the authors.

Deep Learning (DL) based methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have recently received increasing attention in CD problems demonstrating high potential. However, most of the CNN-based CD methods are designed for bi-temporal image analysis. Here, we propose a Three-Dimensional (3D) CNN-based CD approach that can effectively deal with HR image time series and process spatial-spectral-temporal features. The method is unsupervised and thus does not require the complex task of collecting labelled multi-temporal data. Since there are only a few pretrained 3D CNNs available that are not suitable for remote sensing CD analysis, the proposed approach starts with a pretrained 2D CNN architecture trained on remote sensing images for semantic segmentation and develops a 3D CNN architecture using a transfer learning technique to jointly deal with spatial, spectral and temporal information. A layerwise feature reduction strategy is performed to select the most informative features and a pixelwise year-based Change Vector Analysis (CVA) is employed to identify changed pixels. Experimental results on a long time series of Landsat 8 images for an area located in Saudi Arabia confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © Authors 2022","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image analysis; Network architecture; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Time series; Time series analysis; 3d convolutional neural network; Change detection; Change vector analyse; Change vector analysis; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; High-resolution images; Image time-series; Transfer learning; Deep learning","3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Change Detection (CD); Change Vector Analysis (CVA); Deep Learning; High Resolution (HR) Image; Transfer Learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131940906"

One of the basic tasks is the pixel-wise classification of land cover, i.e.The task of identifying the physical material of the Earth's surface in an image. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) are successfully used for this task. In this paper, we investigate different FCN variants, using different methods for the computation of spatial, spectral, and temporal features. We investigate the impact of 3D convolutions in the spatial-Temporal as well as in the spatial-spectral dimensions in comparison to 2D convolutions in the spatial dimensions only. Additionally, we introduce a new method to generate multitemporal input patches by using time intervals instead of fixed acquisition dates. We then choose the image that is closest in time to the middle of the corresponding time interval, which makes our approach more flexible with respect to the requirements for the acquisition of new data. Using these multi-Temporal input patches, generated from Sentinel-2 images, we improve the classification of land cover by 4% in the mean F1-score and 1.3% in the overall accuracy compared to a classification using mono-Temporal input patches. Furthermore, the usage of 3D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions improves the classification performance by a small amount of 0.4% in the mean F1-score and 1.2% in the overall accuracy.  © Authors 2022.","Convolutional neural networks; Image classification; Image enhancement; Remote sensing; 3d-CNN; Convolutional neural network; Earth's surface; Fully convolutional neural network; Land cover; Land cover classification; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Remote-sensing; Spatial temporals; Convolution","3D-CNN; FCN; land cover classification; Multi-Temporal images; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132043839"

To obtain information from the satellite data, the Maximum likelihood supervised classification technique and post-classification change detection strategy were applied. Besides, Spectral indices were utilized to define the ground truth. Thus, the study area was divided into four main land use/cover classes, and hence five satellite images for the years; 1997, 2007, 2014, 2017, and 2019 with low cloud cover were identified. According to the study, urban development resulted in a significant conversion of vegetation cover to the urban development of around 36 km2 during the past 22 years. The generated map showed that between 1997 and 2019, the built-up area increased by 43.62 percent whereas vegetation cover decreased by 41.72 percent.

Rajshahi city in Bangladesh facing rapid urban expansion by replacing LU/LC such as vegetation cover, water bodies (natural resources) and bare land to urban settlements. This study aims to identify the LU/LC changing patterns of Rajshahi city for 2000, 2010 and 2020 and simulate future LU/LC changes for 2040. Multi-temporal cloud-free Landsat satellite images were used to estimate the LU/LC and urban settlement changing pattern using remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. A support vector machine algorithm was used to classify the LU/LC classes. All the classified LU/LC maps demonstrate excellent accuracy by showing more than 85% overall accuracy. The multi-layer perception Markov chain (MLP-MC) model was used to predict the future LU/LC scenario for 2040. Validation of the predicted LU/LC map demonstrated more than 90% overall accuracy. The study found that an average of 3.6 km2 urban settlements increased at 10 years interval by replacing the natural resources. The future prediction shows that more than 60% of the total city area will be transformed into urban settlements by 2040. The dramatic increase in urban settlements and reduction in green cover and water bodies will damage the environmental sustainability of Rajshahi city by increasing temperature and heatwaves. This study will help the urban planners and policymakers to make proper sustainable development decisions by understanding the LU/LC changing pattern. © 2021 The Author(s)","","Change detection; Land use/land cover; Remote sensing; Simulation; Urban settlements","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115772753"

In addition to resistivity and TEM measurements to identify the aquifer(s) properties, all data were processed and interpreted.

Moreover, the geophysical modelling and interpretation elucidate, the study area contains three successive and separated coastal aquifers dunes, old beach, and Kurkar water-bearing layers. These aquifers can be utilized, but the dunes layer is less important than the others. The comparative aquifers thicknesses during the periods indicated were decreased by 4 m during the total period. Finally, the statistical relations between groundwater and cultivated land changing rates confirmed that the groundwater in the relevant area could be in line with the current rate of development process during the current century.

However, the acquisition of optical images is significantly unstable due to the influence of cloudy and rainy weather, which seriously restricts the application of this method in practice. To solve this problem, this study proposed an optical-SAR imagery-based rice mapping method which has the advantages of less dependence on optical images, easy operation and high classification accuracy. To account for the trait of sparse availability of optical images, this method only needs one clear sky optical image in the rice growth period and combined it with multi-temporal SAR images to achieve a high accuracy rice mapping result. Meanwhile, this paper also proposed a comprehensively multi-scale segmentation parameter optimization algorithm, which considers the area consistency, shape error and location difference between the segmented object and reference object, and adopts an orthogonal experiment approach. Based on the optical image, the boundaries of the parcel objects can be segmented, which were subsequently used to perform the object-oriented classification. The results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed method in Yangzhou City is 94.64%. Moreover, according to a random pick test, it is encouraging that the proposed method has strong robustness in response to the instability of the acquisition time of SAR images. A relatively high overall accuracy of 90.09% suggested that the proposed method can provide a reliable rice mapping result in cloudy and rainy areas. © 2022 by the authors.","","data fusion; multi-scale image segmentation; operational system; rice mapping","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144863617"

This study developed a framework to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of floods and to assess flood exposure through utilization of satellite images, ground-based participatory mapping of flood extent, and socio-economic data. Drawing on a case study in the White Volta basin in Western Africa, our results showed that synergetic use of multi-temporal radar and optical satellite data improved flood mapping accuracy (77% overall agreement compared with participatory mapping outputs), in comparison with existing global flood datasets (43% overall agreement for the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Near Real-Time (NRT) Global Flood Product). Increases in flood extent were observed according to our classified product, as well as two existing global flood products. Similarly, increased flood exposure was also observed, however its estimation remains highly uncertain and sensitive to the input dataset used. Population exposure varied greatly depending on the population dataset used, while the greatest farmland and infrastructure exposure was estimated using a composite flood map derived from three products, with lower exposure estimated from each flood product individually. The study shows that there is considerable scope to develop an accurate flood mapping system in SSA and thereby improve flood exposure assessment and develop mitigation and intervention plans. © 2022, The Author(s).","Environmental Monitoring; Floods; Remote Sensing Technology; Rivers; Satellite Imagery; environmental monitoring; flooding; procedures; remote sensing; river; satellite imagery","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126077839"

To date, however, there has been no systematic spatial and temporal analysis of shoreline change trends along the MBREMP coast. In this study, we conducted an analysis of multi-temporal earth observation satellite imagery for assessment of MBREMP shoreline change trends, over the period 1991–2019, using satellite images and geographic information system techniques. Satellite images retrieved from Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager) instruments were analyzed within a geographic information system environment. Shorelines were extracted from satellite imagery and shoreline change rates were measured along transects using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software. From the analysis performed over the period of 28 years, we concluded that shoreline changes in MBREMP were dominated by erosion with an average erosion rate of −1.5 m/year ±1.4 m/year. No-shoreline change (stable shoreline) was identified in 34.8% of transects analyzed, erosion in 63.9%, while accretion occurred in 1.3%. The extent of erosion and accretion varied, however, from one area to another. Accretion and lower erosion rates were measured in the northern part of MBREMP, while higher erosion rates were found in the southern part of the park, which serves as important feeding, breeding, and nesting habitats for endangered turtle species. These results do contribute to identify the most affected areas of MBREMP shoreline and to inform and guide further research related to the sustainable management of ecosystems and the maintenance of the natural systems/resources contained in the park. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","","Coastal monitoring; DSAS; GIS; MBREMP; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112578161"

This study focuses on evaluating the accuracy of satellite derived bathymetry derived from multispectral images recorded by various sensors with various spatial resolution. The study area is located in a small island nearby Morotai Island, Indonesia. Four SDB models were compared. The implementation of the SDB model was carried out by combining echo-sounding measurements and the reflectance of blue, green, red, and near infrared bands of three satellite images (World View 2, Sentinel 2A and Landsat 8). Our findings reveal that all three satellite images performed well in assessing SDB at various spatial and spectral resolution, however, the use of high-resolution imagery did not always improve accuracy, for example when using SVM (Support Vector Machine). When using RF (Random Forest), Sentinel 2A produced the best accuracy and when using GAM (Generalized Additive Model), the most feasible result was generated only by using WorldView 2 image.

Although disturbed by several typhoons during two decades of natural vegetation succession, the landslide restoration rate has reached 87.5% with the invasion or regrowth of vegetation gradually. A predicted logarithmic model with statistically significant difference was derived to estimate the restoration trend of the landslide in the studied area. Most of the poorly vegetated areas are located along the ridgelines, as verified by field surveys. Landslide restoration was carried out in three stages, (1) vulnerable landslides and fast-growing invasive vegetation (1999/9 - 2005/9); (2) stabilized landslides and slow-growing vegetation toward the vegetated strips (2005/9 - 2009/11); and (3) more stabilized landslides and vegetation toward secondary forest (2009/11–2020/2). Topographic location, water supply, typhoon disturbance, invasive or residual vegetation patterns and succession time are the main factors of landslide restoration. The evaluated results indicate that nature itself is a complex ecological balance system with a strong capacity for vegetation recovery at landslides, and can be used by government agencies to add in the recovery of landslide areas. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Conformal mapping; Debris; Earthquakes; Forestry; Hurricanes; Landslides; Recovery; Self organizing maps; Vegetation; Water supply; Catastrophic earthquake; Change analysis; Landslide change analyse; Landslide restoration rate; Large-scale landslides; Multi-temporal; Satellite images; Self-organizing-maps; Vegetation restoration; Vegetation successions; Restoration","Landslide change analysis; Landslide restoration rate; Self-organizing map","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147849519"

The accuracy in classification and area measurement is required for remote monitoring various regions such as water area, cultivation regions, reservoir water spread, and disease spread in cultivation area. Traditionally, Google Earth Pro-based area measurement has error in area measurement due to curvature nature and irregular land surface. Moreover, exact point identification on land surface on Earth pro is difficult due to frequent changes on the land surface. The problem in the land area measurement is mostly affected due to the man-made changes in that particular land area. In this paper, we solve land area measurement error problem through the automated single and multithresholding pixels of different iterations on the land surface by the BSO algorithm. The land cover region pixel intensity changes on the curvature region of land surface with respect to spatial and temporal variations which are identified through BSO optimization-based image segmentation for exact area measurement. For the experimentation of accurate measurement, land area images such as urban, semiurban, hill, and coastal region from LANDSAT and SENTINEL images for period 2016 to 2019 are taken for the land area measurement study. BSO enhances and segments the land regions such as road, building, water body, vegetation, bare land, hill, and coastal region of about 32% more than particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, the urban land area measurement accuracy increases to about 97% than the irregular land surface area.  © 2022 L.

They have a long history and represent an important factor in global changes in urban landscape. An attempt was made to determine the spatio-temporal changes in land use and land areas caused by anthropogenic activities. The study was carried out on the basis of multi-temporal satellite images (for 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015) of the US Geological Survey, obtained from various Landsat satellites. Satellite image processing was carried out in the ERDAS Imagine 2014 and ArcGIS 10.3.1 programs. As a result, four maps were compiled that reflect the spatial and temporal dynamics of land. They are divided into five types: vegetation cover, bare soil, sand, water bodies and built-up areas. The results of the study indicate a significant decrease in the area of vegetation cover: from 85.1% in 1985 to 79.6% by 2015. There was also a significant increase in the built-up area, from 0.7 to 4.0% over a 30-year period. It has been established that unplanned changes in land use have an extremely negative impact on the ecological situation as well as on the human habitat. It has been concluded that it is necessary to conduct a reasonable policy aimed at correcting unplanned urbanization and the demographic situation in the province under consideration. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Punjab; ArcGIS; human activity; land cover; land use; satellite imagery; temporal variation","controlled classification; growth; land cover; land use; spatio-temporal changes; urban landscape","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127319985"

Agricultural practices can benefit from temporally dense satellite image time series (SITS) for accurate understanding of the phenological evolution and behavior of crops. Developing techniques that deal with high spatial correlation and high temporal resolution requires a shift in the processing paradigm and poses new challenges in terms of data processing and methodology. This article presents an automatic approach to large-scale precise mapping of small agricultural fields based on the analysis of S2-SITS at Country level. The approach deals with a flexible and automatic processing chain for massive data and was tested at Country level. The large-scale application requires to consider: the management of big amount of data with particular attention to download and pre-processing of S2-SITS; and MT fine characterization of crop fields accounting for the strong variability in size and phenological behaviors when mapping at large scale. Both challenges are addressed in an automatic way by exploiting and/or updating state-of-the-art methodologies.

Because irrigated rice production differs from other agricultural fields, this study developed a paddy field mapping model based on phenological aspects, various satellite sensor data, and an object-based approach. This study uses the phonological features of rice plants as well as annual data on land surface temperature (LST) to produce the paddy map. The core remote sensing data consists of the yearly LST from MODIS and multi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite imagery. The detection of phenological characteristics and the selection of relevant Landsat images were made possible by analyzing the LST time series with Google Earth Engine. After that, object-based image classification and fuzzy functions are used to create flexible and comprehensible rules for discovering paddy fields in Rasht, Iran. Data such as the digital elevation model (DEM) and spectral indices including NDVI, EVI, and LSWI were employed to improve the object-based classification. Due to the unique properties of paddy lands, a DEM of 12.5 m obtained from the ALOS PALSAR sensor could help distinguish paddy lands from other vegetation. A comparison finally made between the object-based and pixel-based classification methods showed that the former is more accurate. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for the pixel-based classification approach were 92% and 0.89, respectively, whereas overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for the object-based classification method were 94% and 0.92, respectively.

The current trend consists in a general reduction in the area of agricultural land used, including the area of arable land on chernozem decreased from 73 to 42% of the area, hayfields and pastures - from 5 to 1%. The land removed from agricultural use occupies an area of 19.8 thousand hectares. On abandoned lands, tree and shrub vegetation develops. 65% of the area of chernozem soils is erosion-hazardous. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118462903"

The Highland regions of Ethiopia are typical examples of these phenomena. The objective of this study was to analyze spatiotemporal changes in land use/ land cover and their impacts on land surface temperature in the suha watershed, northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. Multi-temporal Landsat images (1985–2019) were used to analyze LU/LC changes and LST using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Image preprocessing, supervised classification, accuracy assessment, and change detection were conducted to identify LU/LC classes, area coverage, and their transitions. Thermal bands of these satellite images were also used to extract LST. Significant changes in land use/land cover (spatial and temporal) were observed in the suha watershed during the study periods. Agricultural land has got the largest proportion in all study periods. The barren land and built area also expanded greatly in 35 years period. Agricultural land has increased by 15417.6 ha (34.8%) and bare land has expanded by 5297.2 ha (373.6%). However, grazing and shrub lands were reduced by18568.4 ha (72.1%) and 3544.2 ha (47.6%), respectively. Spatial and temporal variation of LST was also observed in the same period. The highest mean values were found on impervious surfaces (built-up areas and bare land), and the lowest values were recorded on forest land. A negative correlation was found between LST and NDVI. Undesirable land use and land cover changes put greater pressure on environmental resources, resulting in an adverse effect on them. Therefore, to reverse this situation and create a balanced ecosystem, management strategies should be applied that mainly focus on soil conservation technologies in steep slope areas, improve afforestation and apply proper land-use policies. The outcomes of this research are useful in designing and implementing appropriate strategies that can address critical social and environmental problems. It also provides new knowledge that helps us better understand the spatiotemporal land use land cover changes and their impacts on LST. © 2022","","Landsat image; LST, GIS & remote sensing; LU/LC change; Suha watershed","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129674798"

The purpose of this research is to quantify the effect of Iran’s Forest Nationalization Law (FNL) in a part of Zagros Forest over a 68-year time period (1955–2022) using 1955 historical aerial photos, 1968 Corona spy satellite photography, and classification of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. A past classification change detection technique was used to identify the extent and the pattern of land use changes in time. For this purpose, six periods were defined, to cover the time before and after the implementation of FNL. A 0.27% deforestation trend was identified over the period after the FNL. Dense and open forested area has decreased from 7175.62 ha and 68,927.46 ha in 1955 to 5664.26 ha and 59,223.38 ha in 2022. The FNL brought decisive changes in the legal and forest management systems at the state level, mainly by giving their ownership to the state. Accordingly, the FNL and the related conservation plans have not fully succeeded in protecting, rehabilitating, recovering, and developing the sparse Zagros Forest ecosystems, as their most important goals. © 2023 by the authors.","Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Iran; Quercus; Aerial photography; Antennas; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Land use; Satellite imagery; Aerial photos; Case-studies; Change detection; Conservation policy; Declassified satellite photography; Forest cover change; Google earth engine; Google earths; Historical aerial photo; Machine-learning; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; Iran; oak; procedures; Deforestation","change detection; conservation policies; declassified satellite photography; Google Earth Engine; historical aerial photos; machine learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146493622"

Classification algorithms are the primary source to generate LCLU maps. Since texture information is essential to generate LULC maps from VHR images, the object-based classification methods should be used instead of pixel-based methods. Also, in urban mapping, it is vital to select the appropriate classifier according to the type of land covers. Recently, in addition to machine learning algorithms, deep learning methods have also been used to classify VHR images. In this study, we compare the accuracy of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with some machine learning methods, for classification of Pleiades satellite image with 50 cm spatial resolution. The results showed CNN algorithm has the highest classification accuracy when the training samples are increased. However, the difference between the classification accuracy of the CNN and relevance vector machine (RVM) models is not that significant so that one could use a more straightforward method with less training data rather than a complicated one with large volumes of data. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","algorithm; artificial neural network; image classification; image processing; land cover; land use change; mapping method; pixel; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral resolution; urban area","Deep learning; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Urban mapping; Very high-resolution satellite image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107538147"

These are dominant morphological changes that can lead the meandering analysis to a distinct conclusion. Dharla river, a transboundary river between Bangladesh and India and originated from the Himalayas, has imperative roles in recurring floods and erosion in North-Western Bangladesh. Excessive erosion impacts badly the livelihood of people residing on the floodplains, and accretion leads to a decline in river width resulting in reduced river flow. Thus, a study on the riverbank line shifting and bar dynamics in both short- and long-term time scale is important for better understanding the local geomorphology and making effective management plans accordingly. Hence, in this study, the bank line shifting of the Dharla River has been assessed using ArcGIS and Google Earth pro satellite images historical time frame of 31 years. The average erosion of the right bank has been found to be more than the average erosion in the left bank. This information implies that the river’s right bank faces more erosion, risking the stability of the river. The right bankside of the river (Kurigram) faces erosion during the monsoon because of this high erosion rate. The sinuosity of this river varies from 1.24 to 1.51, indicating the meandering nature of the river. The analysis of bar dynamics turns out to be rising with the time resulting from the erosions over the years. This survey will be obliging to deter the erosion along the Dharla riverbanks by directing the researchers towards the root of this problem. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Dynamics; Floods; Geographic information systems; Rivers; Arc GIS; Bangladesh; Bar dynamic; Erosion-accretion; Geographics; Google earths; Line-shifting; Multi-temporal satellite images; Riverbank erosion; Sinuosity; Erosion","Arc-GIS; Bar dynamics; Erosion-Accretion; Google Earth; Sinuosity","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119353294"

Multitemporal RS images usually include different land use/land cover (LULC) types; therefore, considering an identical linear relationship during RRN modeling may result in potential errors in the RRN results. To resolve this issue, we proposed a new automatic RRN technique that efficiently selects the clustered pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) through a coarse-to-fine strategy and uses them in a fusion-based RRN modeling approach. In the coarse stage, an efficient difference index was first generated from the down-sampled reference and target images by combining the spectral correlation, spectral angle mapper (SAM), and Chebyshev distance. This index was then categorized into three groups of changed, unchanged, and uncertain classes using a fast multiple thresholding technique. In the fine stage, the subject image was first segmented into different clusters by the histogram-based fuzzy c-means (HFCM) algorithm. The optimal PIFs were then selected from unchanged and uncertain regions using each cluster’s bivariate joint distribution analysis. In the RRN modeling step, two normalized subject images were first produced using the robust linear regression (RLR) and cluster-wise-RLR (CRLR) methods based on the clustered PIFs. Finally, the normalized images were fused using the Choquet fuzzy integral fusion strategy for overwhelming the discontinuity between clusters in the final results and keeping the radiometric rectification optimal. Several experiments were implemented on four different bi-temporal satellite images and a simulated dataset to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method yielded superior RRN results and outperformed other considered well-known RRN algorithms in terms of both accuracy level and execution time. © 2022 by the authors.

The Mujib basin is considered as one of the major sources for water production in Jordan, while the agricultural production is the main consumer sector for water in the basin. High multi-temporal multi-spectral resolutions Sentinel-2b satellite images were used to identify the land use types using the supervised classification that applied on spring and summer growing season. The results show that the temporal NDVI curve is very useful in distinguishing between different crops type with high details, and is used in assisting the agricultural land use pattern. Multi-temporal NDVI images were used to identify the cropping pattern within the agricultural land using the unsupervised classification approach. The results show that the rainfed agriculture is confined in the high rainfall zones with one period of growing season, while the irrigated agricultural crops are spreading in the basin over the whole year with different periods of growing seasons. Irrigated vegetables and tree crops are the dominant agricultural crops in the basin with more than 70% of cultivated land. Most of the irrigated vegetables and trees are grown in the summer seasons under high temperatures conditions which consumes the highest percentage of irrigated water.

Methods of planned soil inventory form the basis for identifying unused agricultural soil, the main purpose of which is to assess the reasons for land retirement from active economic circulation, cultural and technical state of landholdings and to prepare recommendations for commissioning soils into agricultural circulation. Agriculture is a vast and vital branch of the national economy of the Russian Federation It is necessary to introduce modern technologies, state-of-the-art machinery, investments as well as to put into action several land management measures in order to facilitate the development of this sector of the national economy. The data provided by Earth remote sensing gives the necessary and relevant information to the customers regarding structure, state and detailed characteristics of agricultural soils and other assets of agricultural production; the line-up, state and growth of crops. Earth remote sensing data allows to solve more complex analytical tasks, such as forecasting crop yield and calculating the optimal doses of fertilizers. It is convenient to use Earth remote sensing data for monitoring and analyzing soils. With the assistance of that data, based on satellite images, it is possible to identify not only the types of crops, but also the degree of weediness, state of yield, accurate field boundaries, sown area and so on and so forth.

Bomas protect livestock from predation by wildlife and potential theft. Due to the concentration of animal faeces inside bomas, they not only become nutrient-rich patches that can add to biodiversity, but also hotspots for the emission of nitrous oxide (N2O), an important greenhouse gas, especially when animals are kept inside for long periods. To provide an accurate estimate of such emissions for wider landscapes, bomas need to be accounted for. Moreover, initial experiments indicated that more frequent shifts in the boma locations could help to reduce N2O emissions. This stresses the need for better understanding where bomas are located, their numbers, as well as when they are actively used. Given the recent advances in satellite technology, resulting in high-frequent spectral measurements at fine spatial resolution, solutions to address these needs are now within reach. This study is a first effort to map and monitor the appearance of bomas with the use of satellite image time series. Our main dataset was a dense times series of 3 m resolution PlanetScope multispectral imagery. In addition, a reference dataset of boma and non-boma locations was created using GPS-collar tracking data and 0.5 m resolution Pléiades imagery. The reduction of vegetation cover and increase of organic material following boma installation result in typical spectral changes when contrasted against its surroundings. Based on these spectral changes we devised an empirical approach to infer approximate boma installation dates from PlanetScope's near infrared (NIR) band and used our reference dataset for setting optimal parameter values. A NIR spatial difference index resulted in clear temporal patterns, which were more apparent during the wet season. At landscape scale our approach reveals clear spatio-temporal patterns of boma installation, which could not be revealed from less frequent sub-meter resolution imagery alone. While further improvements are possible, we show that small-sized (150–500 m2) temporary surface changes, such as those that occur when pastoralists use mobile bomas, can be detected with dense image time series like those offered by the PlanetScope constellation. In future, this could lead to better assessment of a) spatio-temporal livestock distribution, b) the contribution of bomas to N2O emissions and soil fertility at landscape scale, and c) the uptake of enclosure rotation practices at large spatial scales. © 2022 The Authors","Kenya; Agriculture; Animals; Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Infrared devices; Nitrogen oxides; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Time series; Tracking (position); Animal tracking; Cubesat; Cubesat, greenhouse gas; Dry land; Grassland; Greenhouses gas; Image time-series; Livestock enclosure; Remote-sensing; Satellite image time series; Satellite images; Savanna; data set; dryland farming; greenhouse gas; image resolution; nitrous oxide; satellite imagery; savanna; soil fertility; tracking; vegetation cover; Enclosures","Animal tracking; CubeSat, greenhouse gases; Drylands; Grasslands; Livestock enclosures; Remote sensing; Satellite image time series; Savanna","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131663485"

The lack of high-resolution multi-temporal inventory of glacial lakes in TP hampers a better understanding and prediction of the future trend and risk of glacial lakes. Here, we created a multi-temporal inventory of glacial lakes in TP using a 30-year record of 42,833 satellite images (1990–2019), and we discussed their characteristics and spatio-temporal evolution over the years. Results showed that their number and area had increased by 3285 and 258.82 km2 in the last 3 decades, respectively. We noticed that different regions of the TP exhibited varying change rates in glacial lake size; most regions show a trend of expansion and increase in glacial lakes, while some regions show a trend of decreasing such as the western Pamir and the eastern Hindu Kush. The mapping uncertainty is about 17.5%, which is lower than other available datasets, thus making our inventory reliable for the spatio-temporal evolution analysis of glacial lakes in the TP. Our lake inventory data are publicly published, it can help to study climate change–glacier–glacial lake–GLOF interactions in the Third Pole and serve as input to various hydro-climatic studies. © 2023 by the authors.","Climate change; Earth (planet); Glacial geology; Poles; Uncertainty analysis; Freshwater ecosystem; Future trends; Glacial lakes; Global climate changes; High resolution; Lake inventory; Multi-temporal; Spatiotemporal evolution; Third poles; Tibetan Plateau; Lakes","glacial lake; lake inventory; spatio-temporal evolution; Tibetan Plateau","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146585766"

This paper highlighted the methodological problems that arise at using satellite images for research and mapping of underwater relief; the ways of their solution are offered. Consideration of the depth of penetration of sunlight into the water and analysis of the spectral brightness of underwater objects allow for the determination of the spectrum zone (red zone) optimal for interpreting sandy riverbanks and options for color synthesis. At a limited choice of cloudless images in the Arctic to have images obtained during the minimum water level, not only the imaging season (low-water period) but also interannual runoff fluctuations are taken into account. The water turbidity limits the possibility to interpret the underwater relief. Images obtained with minimal turbidity are selected, and in the case of spreading of turbid waters, multi-temporal images are compared to separate the image of volatile turbid waters from more stable bottom objects; color synthesis is applied at different times. The identification of sandbanks, ridged forms of relief, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpreting based on the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. The identification of sandbanks, ridged relief forms on them, and the contours of underwater channels are performed by direct interpreting by the variations in the brightness of the image in the red zone. To identify sandy-silty and silty shallows, indicative interpretation of the distribution of aquatic vegetation on silty deposits is used. To highlight the fuzzy boundaries between the shallows and core zones of streams, the brightness quantization of images is applied. Comparison of the Yenisei River delta shallows map compiled from modern photographs with topographic and pilot maps of the 1970–1980th shows a reduction in the area of shallows adjacent to the tips of large islands in the eastern part of the delta. This is in accordance with earlier revealed activation of the erosion of the banks of the branches of the Yenisei delta in the XXI century. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Russian Federation; Yenisei River; aquatic plant; mapping; relief; sand; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shallow water; silt; water level","aquatic vegetation; core zone; sand; satellite images; shallows; silt; water level","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111925382"

In Vietnam, mangrove is mainly distributed in the Mekong delta. Recently, mangrove areas in this region decreased rapidly in both quality and quantity. The forest became bare, divided and scattered into many small patches, which was a major driver of ecosystem degradation. Without a quantitative method for effectively assessing mangrove health in the regional scale, the sustainably conserving mangrove is the challenge for the local governments. Remote sensing data has been widely used for monitoring mangrove distributions, while the characterization of spatial metrics is important to understand the underlying processes of mangrove change. The objectives of this study were to develop an approach to monitor mangrove health in Mui Ca Mau, Ca Mau province of Vietnam by utilizing satellite image textures to assess the mangrove patterns. The research result showed that mangrove areas increased double by 2015, but the forest had become more fragmented. We can be seen those changes in land use mainly come from land conversion from forest to shrimp farms, settlements areas and public constructions. The conserving existing mangrove forest in Mui Ca Mau should consider the relations between mangrove health and influencing factors indicated in the manuscript. © 2022 Hai et al.

Recent studies on crop yield production are limited to regional-scale predictions. The regional-scale crop yield predictions usually face challenges in capturing local yield variations based on farm management decisions and the condition of the field. For this research, we identified the need to create a large and reusable farm-scale crop yield production dataset, which could provide precise farm-scale ground-truth prediction targets. Therefore, we utilise multi-temporal data, such as Sentinel-2 satellite images, weather data, farm data, grain delivery data, and cadastre-specific data. We introduce a deep hybrid neural network model to train this multi-temporal data. This model combines the features of convolutional layers and recurrent neural networks to predict farm-scale crop yield production across Norway. The proposed model could efficiently make the target predictions with the mean absolute error of 76 kg per 1000 m2. In conclusion, the reusable farm-scale multi-temporal crop yield dataset and the proposed novel model could meet the actual requirements for the prediction targets in this paper, providing further valuable insights for the research community. © 2021 by the authors.

Landsat-OLI 16-day inter-annual images are invaluable sources obviating crop monitoring into issues of crop types detection, crop yield prediction, and crop pattern studies. Although many classification methods such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML) were implied for crop type mapping, recent researches often use an object-based classification approach. In this study, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) classifier based on rule-based decision tree (RBDT) and object-based nearest neighbor (OBNN) used to delineate five common crop types (includes Wheat and Barley together in one class, rice, multiple crop (MC), Alfalfa and Spring crops) in Isfahan city and nearby areas. The classification was applied in five scenarios using different vegetation indexes including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), green normalized difference vegetation index GNDVI and their combination. All scenarios property and accuracy assessed both with by class separation distance matrix and confusion matrix. The overall accuracy of classification with using only one vegetation index was lower than other scenarios. It was the lowest for GNDVI rating 37% whereas combination of Indexes resulted better accuracy. In final map with combination of NDVI, GNDVI and NDWI, overall accuracy and kappa achieved to 88% and 0/83 successively. Comparing individual accuracy of different crops showed that MC crops with 66% has the lowest accuracy and Wheat-Barely crops with 94.8% individual accuracy has the Maximum accuracy.

The Hyper-spectral images must be classified to map co-ordinates from the image co-ordinates which is the most important and unavoidable step. For this process, the ground control points (GCPs) to be extracted manually from the remotely sensed images based on the ground truth values which are a time-consuming process. But conventional approaches result in the improper classification. Hence, to overcome this problem the proposed method is functions based on the Hybrid iterative block-coordinated descent algorithm-least square unmixing (HIB-CDA-LSU) for noise and un-certainties. This approach removes the various noises presented in the HSI without losing the actual information. Then, on this outcome feature entropy based super-pixel segmentation (FESPS) is applied to divide the image into multi-temporal segments. Thus, each classification region of HSI perfectly segmented. Followed by probabilistic pixel based principal component analysis (Probabilistic-PCA) is utilized for the extraction of Hyperspectral features. Thus, the detailed features of each segmented region perfectly extracted. Then, for classifying the multi-temporal HSI satellite imagery, Multi kernel-based support vector machine (MK-SVM) based supervised machine learning classification is used. The MK-SVM has the low computational complexity and capable of classifying the various classes in the Hyperspectral image. Thus, each individual class allotted to each kernel of SVM for classifying the region. The simulation results shows that the proposed Hybrid approach gives the maximum classification accuracy compared to the state of art approaches. © 2021 IEEE.","Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Least squares approximations; Pixels; Remote sensing; Rock mechanics; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Classification accuracy; Conventional approach; Ground control points; Hyper-spectral images; Hyperspectral imagery; Low computational complexity; Remotely sensed images; Supervised machine learning; Image classification","hyperspectral imagery; least square unmixing; principal component analysis; super-pixel segmentation; support vector machine","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113814236"

These rapid land demands increased the pressure on the country area to rebuild urban centers and cities surrounding the coast. The purpose of this research is to detect and investigate changes in land use and land cover (LULC), which is one of the most critical aspects of planning and managing the use of land as a natural resource. The massive growth in land demand, particularly in small-area countries like Bahrain, forces decision-makers to re-plan the main island areas (Bahrain, Muharraq, Sitra, and Nabih Saleh). The study focuses on mapping the LULC changes detection over 1986–2020. It employs an integrated approach of remote sensing and GIS (Geographic Information System) to analyze and evaluate the changes in the LULC area in the main islands using multi-temporal and multispectral Landsat satellite imagery acquired in 1986, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2013, and 2020.

In this study, the effect of meteorological drought on a water body was investigated. The annual temporal change in the water area of Atikhisar Dam Lake in Çanakkale province, Turkey, and the only water source in the region, was monitored using multi-temporal satellite remote sensing between 1984 and 2020. The areal change of the lake was determined by the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) produced from multispectral Landsat satellite images. The spatial–temporal change of meteorological drought in the region is presented by the cumulative deviation curve. The changes in meteorological drought were examined by the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). All remote sensing and meteorological drought analysis were performed according to the 12-month water year calendar. The findings show that the lake area can be determined with approximately 83% accuracy via NDWI, and the cumulative deviation curve indicates that an extraordinary dry period may occur soon. On the other hand, according to SPI and SPEI data, it was determined that the dam lake area is not under the effect of meteorological drought alone. However, due to the lack of evaporation in the region, it was found that SPI was slightly more associated with the areal change of the lake. The ability to exhibit temporal change, view wide areas at one time and easily integrate data from different sources indicate that remote sensing data from satellites is a very efficient tool in drought analysis and water resources management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Dam lake; Landsat; Meteorological drought; NDWI; Remote sensing; SPEI; SPI","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140341017"

To capture and quantify SOC contents at a field scale, Earth Observation (EO) can be a valuable data source for area-wide mapping. The extraction of exposed soils from EO data is challenging due to temporal or permanent vegetation cover, the influence of soil moisture or the condition of the soil surface. Compositing techniques of multitemporal satellite images provide an alternative to retrieve exposed soils and to produce a data source. The repeatable soil composites, containing averaged exposed soil areas over several years, are relatively independent from seasonal soil moisture and surface conditions and provide a new EO-based data source that can be used to estimate SOC contents over large geographical areas with a high spatial resolution. Here, we applied the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) to the Landsat archive between 1984 and 2014 of images covering Bavaria, Germany. Compared to existing SOC modeling approaches based on single scenes, the 30-year SCMaP soil reflectance composite (SRC) with a spatial resolution of 30 m is used. The SRC spectral information is correlated with point soil data using different machine learning algorithms to estimate the SOC contents in cropland topsoils of Bavaria. We developed a pre-processing technique to address the issue of combining point information with EO pixels for the purpose of modeling. We applied different modeling methods often used in EO soil studies to choose the best SOC prediction model. Based on the model accuracies and performances, the Random Forest (RF) showed the best capabilities to predict the SOC contents in Bavaria (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 1.24%, RPD = 1.77, CCC = 0.78). We further validated the model results with an independent dataset. The comparison between the measured and predicted SOC contents showed a mean difference of 0.11% SOC using the best RF model. The SCMaP SRC is a promising approach to predict the spatial SOC distribution over large geographical extents with a high spatial resolution (30 m). © 2021 by the authors.

In order to control area specific weed control on basis of classification and management of disease in farmland, hyperspectral images have been acquired from the satellite images in the remote sensing area. With different observation conditions and sensor characteristics, hyperspectral image classification based on spectral evolution simultaneously extracts the sets of spectral signatures of endmembers and maps the corresponding abundance maps from multiple spectral images. It then utilizes multiple supervised and unsupervised mechanisms for class-specific variations on weed and its diseases. Obviously mapping method degrades on accuracy of the coupling of the spectral evolution simultaneously. In this paper, a novel efficient weed classification and disease management on spectral evolution mapping should be proposed using Multivariate principle component analysis. It is examined as change detection mechanism which explores variation in the class features efficiently as the context of images is basis of bands of weed plant and its associated plant diseases, further it leads to a good tradeoff between wider receptive field and the use of Context is employed towards mapping Agriculture Land cover spectral evolution in the hyperspectral images. Proposed approach is capable of computing the spectral correlation among two images with respect to spectral similarity. Finally, it predicts the large intra class variation of weed accurately on temporal changes of the agriculture surfaces along various climate seasons and fields. Experimental analysis of the proposed mechanism was validated on Landsat 8 dataset to compute overall accuracy of the model on the changes in the weed and its diseases. The results of the work exhibits that proposed model can enhance the classification accuracy and reduces the differences of multi-temporal effects compared with existing state of art approaches.  © 2022 IEEE.","Change detection; Classification (of information); Disease control; Diseases; Hyperspectral imaging; Image classification; Multivariant analysis; Photomapping; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Weed control; Change detection; Disease management; Features reductions; Hyperspectral image processing; LANDSAT; Principle components analysis; Spatial indexes; Spectral evolution; Spectral indices; Weed classification; Landsat","Artificial Intelligence; Classification; Disease Management; Feature Reduction; Hyperspectral Image processing; Landsat; Spatial and Spectral Indices; Weed Classification","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141541316"

Rapid, accurate, and remote spatial assessment of oil contamination is critical to implementing countermeasures that prevent potentially lasting ecological damage and irreversible harm to local communities. Satellite remote sensing has been used to support such assessments in inaccessible regions, although mapping small terrestrial oil spills is challenging – partly due to the pixel size of remote sensing systems, but also due to the distinguishability of small oil spill areas from other land cover types. We assessed the usability of freely available Sentinel satellite images to map terrestrial oil spills with machine learning algorithms. Using two test sites in South Sudan, we demonstrated that information from the Sentinel-1 and -2 instruments can be used to map oil spills with more than 90 % classification accuracy. Classification accuracy was significantly increased (>95 %) with the addition of multi-temporal information and spatial predictor variables that quantify proximity to oil production infrastructure such as pipelines and oil pads. The mapping of terrestrial oil spills with freely available Sentinel satellite images may thus represent an accurate and efficient means for the regular monitoring of oil-impacted areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Machine Learning; Petroleum Pollution; South Sudan; South Sudan; land cover; machine learning; observational method; oil production; oil spill; remote sensing; satellite data; article; human; human rights; land use; oil spill; pipeline; predictor variable; quantitative analysis; random forest; satellite imagery; South Sudan; usability; algorithm; environmental monitoring; machine learning; South Sudan","Google Earth Engine; Human rights; Land cover; Machine learning; Oil spill; Pollution; Random forest; Remote sensing; Sentinel-1/2; South Sudan; Spectral indices; Terrestrial oils spill","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111770501"

The increasingly high spatiotemporal resolutions of globally available satellite images (e.g., Landsat) create new possibilities for generating accurate datasets. Although winter wheat classification using Landsat time-series data has been increasingly acknowledged in the literature, the contributing effects of a single acquisition date on classification remain poorly explored. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of a single acquisition date (nine acquisition dates were obtained throughout the growing season) on winter wheat classification using multi-temporal Landsat 8 imagery. We adopted Dynamic time warping (DTW) to discriminate winter wheat and determined the most relevant acquisition dates for classification accuracy with different numbers of images. The most significant advantage of DTW from other similarity measurement methods is that DTW can identify the optimal alignment of two time-series datasets with an unequal number of images. Then, we calculated the importance of each acquisition date using the random forest algorithm and quantified their contributions to the classification using variance analysis. The conditional combination of our best accuracy was 84.51% for overall accuracy (OA) and 84.62% for F-score when all nine images were used for the classification. While the lowest accuracy was 46.2% for OA and 51.3% for F-score through the classification of two image combinations from the wintering and heading images. It was shown that the initial and late growth images were the most discriminating dates for time series classification of winter wheat in ∼ 91% of the total combinations explored (i.e., 456 combinations). The main effects of the late growth images and their interactions significantly affected model accuracy, while the interactions between the initial growth images also played an important role, particularly for greater numbers of acquisition dates. The relative contributions explained by the main effects of late growth images gradually decreased with the increasing image acquisition dates, while those explained by the internal interactions of both initial and late growth images significantly increased. The wide distribution of winter wheat in many parts of the world and its strong consequences for global food security suggest that better monitoring of wheat is necessary, and the results indicated that appropriate selection of image dates was significant for accomplishing this task. © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The dynamic increase in LST results in the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. In this study, future LULC change scenarios, seasonal (summer & winter) LST variations, and LST distribution over different LULC classes were predicted using Landsat satellite images for 1999, 2009, and 2019 in Rajshahi District, Bangladesh. Cellular Automata (CA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) procedures were used to predict the LULC changes and seasonal LST variations for 2029 and 2039. In addition, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informants Interviews (KIIs) were conducted to identify the possible impacts of LULC change, LST shifts, and climate change on agricultural productivity and developed a sustainable land use management plan for the study area. Validation of the CA model demonstrated an excellent accuracy with a kappa value of 0.82. Similarly, the ANN model's validation using Mean Square Error (0.523 and 0.796 for summer) and Correlation coefficient (0.6023 and 0.831 for winter) values demonstrated a good prediction accuracy. The LULC prediction result indicated that the built-up area will be expanded by 58.03 km2 and 79.90 km2, respectively, from 2019 to 2029 and 2039. The predicted seasonal LST indicated that in 2029 and 2039, more than 23.30 % and 50.46 % of the summer and 3.02 % and 13.02 % of the winter seasons will likely be experienced LSTs greater than 35 °C. The results of public participation exposed that changes in LULC classes, variations in LST, and climate change significantly impact the regional biodiversity (loss of farmland and water bodies), reduce agricultural productivity, and increase extreme weather events (flood, heavy rainfall, and cold/warm temperature). This study provides the useful guidelines for agricultural officers, urban planners, and environmental engineers to understand the spatial configurations of built-up area enlargement and provide effective policy measures to conserve farming lands to ensure environmental sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s)","","Agricultural land; Artificial neural network; Cellular automata; Land surface temperature; Land use/Land cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111527297"

Bangladesh is undergoing dramatic changes in land cover/land use (LC/LU) change, primarily due to rapid urbanization. Urbanization converts the natural resources (water bodies) into impervious surfaces (urban areas and roads). Rajshahi is one of the largest metropolitan cities in Bangladesh, and its urban sustainability is affected by the demolishment of water bodies influenced by rapid LC/LU change. Satellite images at different spatial resolutions are extensively used for extracting water body information at various periods. Using multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI satellite images, the study aimed to estimate the spatiotemporal LC/LU change and identify the most influential LC/LU parameters that contributed to the reduction of surface water body from 1989 to 2019. The support vector machine, matrix union, and image difference algorithms were applied to estimate LC/LU classification, conversion of LC/LU, and water body to other LC/LU classes. Results revealed that a massive increase in the built-up area (16%) and infrastructural development were the primary cause for water body reduction, and loss of water bodies was estimated at around 8% in the last 30 years. Key informant's interviews were conducted to identify the effective management and technical strategies for developing a sustainable IWRM plan utilizing modern technology. The estimated hydro-geomorphological (modeling flow direction, stream network, flow accumulation, and surface water potential zones) information would be beneficial to any developing country.

The satellite images were geocoded into the universal transverse mercator (UTM) coordinate system zone 43 N. The unsupervised classification method was done by using an iterative self-organizing data analysis algorithm to compare the images and to classify the images into various land cover categories. Kappa statistics were used to assess the validation of the present study. The analysis suggests the total forest covered in 1999 was 22.69% and that of 2008 was 24.04% and reduced to 6.09%, in 2017.

The rainfall for the catchment was estimated as 558.4 mm/year, whereas the mean evaporation was computed as 2,214 mm/year by the Penman method. The annual direct rainfall contribution to the lake was found to be 25.84 MCM (million cubic meters) with a runoff inflow in the catchment area of 37.2 MCM. This balance pointed to the mean evaporation of 108.2 MCM/year in the lake indicating that the water inflow was greater than the outflow. A major cause for the rise of the lake level was the drainage of excess irrigation water toward the lake, mainly from the Fentale Irrigation Farm. The average increment of the groundwater level in the area was 12 cm/year from 2010 to 2014. From 1998 to 2014, the electrical conductivity was reduced by 25.6%, and calcium was increased by 96%. The study outlined that appropriate irrigation drainage should be implemented in the catchment to ensure the balance between the rainfall, infiltration, and surface runoff to optimize economic and social welfare in the area. © 2022 The Authors.","Ethiopia; Lake Beseka; Catchments; Groundwater; Hydrodynamics; Irrigation; Lakes; Rain; Runoff; Ethiopia; Groundwater chemistry; Irrigation waters; Lake Beseka; Lake chemistry; Multi-temporal satellite images; Penman method; Rainfall contributions; Water balance; Water inflows; drainage; electrical conductivity; evaporation; hydrodynamics; hydrological regime; inflow; irrigation; outflow; runoff; saline lake; water budget; water flow; Evaporation","drainage; evaporation; hydrodynamics; Lake Beseka; water balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131863239"

However, the impacts of such practice are not always taken into account when the mines are established, and the environmental cost of in-stream aggregate mining is generally not assessed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impacts of aggregate mining conducted in La Puerta River (Tafí valley, Northwest Argentina), a dry-pit in-stream mine, by considering the geomorphological, geoarchaeological, and human effects. Multitemporal analysis of the area using remote sensors (aerial photographs and satellite images 1970–2020), high-resolution drone digital elevation models and orthomosaics (2018–2019), and an intensive survey demonstrated that the mining area grew exponentially between 2002 and 2020 under unregulated mining. As a result, this practice exerts great environmental impact, including channel section alterations and destabilization of riverbanks, soil loss, river profile changes, and the formation of lag deposits of discarded materials, thus increasing environmental hazard under unpredictable flows. Finally, this is a highly touristic area that has suffered substantial landscape degradation and irreversible archaeological damage. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Argentina; Aggregates; Antennas; Landforms; Remote sensing; Digital elevation model; Discarded materials; Distributary channels; Environmental costs; Environmental hazards; Landscape degradation; Multi-temporal analysis; Northwest Argentina; aggregate; alluvial fan; environmental impact assessment; flood; hazard assessment; landscape; mining; sensor; Environmental impact","anthropic impact; flood hazard; geomorphological hazard; heritage hazard; landscape degradation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114456074"

However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediterranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of environmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3% and 14.6% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2–82.7% overall accuracy. We believe the proposed classification approach will help improve the mapping of the shrubland ecosystems, which will significantly affect natural resource management, conservation, and adaptation to climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Turkey; ecosystem service; machine learning; mapping; natural resource; Sentinel; time series","Feature extraction; Google earth engine (GEE); Machine learning; Maquis; Random Forest; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138339129"

It uses this model to analyze differences in the pixel and its spatial context-based predictions in subsequent time periods for CD. We combine this spatial context-based CD with ensembling over mutually exclusive neighborhoods and transitioning from pixel to object-level changes with morphological operations. SiROC achieves competitive performance for CD with medium-resolution Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planetscope imagery on four datasets. Besides accurate predictions without the need for training, SiROC also provides a well-calibrated uncertainty of its predictions.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Forecasting; Mathematical morphology; Optical sensors; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Change detection; Multi-temporal; Optical image; Optical imaging; Optical-; Remote-sensing; Spatial context; Spatial resolution; Unsupervised; Urban analysis; morphology; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal analysis; urban area; Geometrical optics","Change detection (CD); multitemporal; optical images; unsupervised; urban analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120579030"

Yet, despite the increasing accuracy of digital soil mapping (DSM) in recent years, generating regional-scale, high-accuracy soil maps remains a challenging task. Our study objective was to propose a new DSM method based on temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) data and to compare the DSM result with a legacy soil map of China. In this study, 13 Landsat multispectral data from 2000 to 2019 were fused by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to obtain temporal information, a shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (SRTM-DEM) was used as spatial information, and Gaofen-5 satellite hyperspectral data was used as spectral information. TSS information was obtained after the DWT and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal and spectral information, combined it with the spatial information. Then, the TSS information and random forest model were used for DSM. The results indicated that 1) The mapping result based on TSS information was highly correlated with the legacy soil map. In different soil classes, there were minute differences in the core area and large differences in adjacent soil classes between the two maps. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on TSS information were 88.11% and 0.82, respectively. 2) With the same values of the soil moisture, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on hyperspectral data were 6.80% and 0.02, respectively, higher than those based on multispectral data. 3) With increasing temporal information, the DSM accuracy continuously increased, and the mapping accuracy based on multi-temporal multispectral data was higher than that based on mono-temporal hyperspectral data when the number of multi-temporal multispectral images reached 6. 4) The DSM accuracy was effectively improved when terrain factors were considered, and the terrain factors featuring a strong separability for various soil classes differed. The DSM method proposed in this study based on TSS information from multi-sources remote sensing data greatly improved the DSM accuracy and provided new insight for future DSM research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","China; Data fusion; Decision trees; Image classification; Image enhancement; Landsat; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Signal reconstruction; Soil moisture; Topography; Tracking radar; Vegetation mapping; Digital soil mappings; Hyperspectral Data; Mapping accuracy; Mapping method; Multi-spectral data; Multi-temporal; Soil class; Soil classification; Soil maps; Spectral information; environmental protection; mapping; satellite imagery; soil classification; Discrete wavelet transforms","Data fusion; Hyperspectral data; Mapping; Multi-temporal; Soil class; Soil classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134849338"

Dams are structures that influence agricultural activities and have high economic contributions. The dams' structural safety was mainly addressed using conventional measurement techniques. However, these might not be time-efficient and practical, considering the large surfaces of dams. This paper presents a long-term InSAR analysis of the Atatürk Dam, Turkey's largest and one of the five biggest dams in Europe using ERS, ENVISAT, and Sentinel-1 satellites images. Since only Sentinel-1 data have acquisitions in ascending and descending orbits, we could estimate surface movements also in the vertical and east-west directions using both lines of sight (LOS) displacements. The results showed that the east-west movement is higher than vertical movement. As a result, we observe a maximum of 10 mm/yr displacement in the LOS direction at the dam's crest for period of 2003 and 2010, decreasing down the slope. © 2021 IAA","Geodetic satellites; Safety engineering; Agricultural activities; Economic contribution; InSAR; Line of Sight; Lines-of-sight; Multi-temporal; Rock-fill dam; Sentinel-1; Structural safety; Structural safety monitoring; Dams","Deformation; InSAR; Rock-fill dam; Structural safety monitoring","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115033026"

As a first step, we trained our CNN model on images at a single time step for multi-label classification, i.e. mono-temporal. We incorporated time-series images using a LSTM model to assess whether or not multi-temporal signals from satellites improves CLC classification. The results demonstrate an improvement of approximately 0.89% in classifying satellite imagery on 15 classes using a multi-temporal approach on monthly time series images compared to the mono-temporal approach.

Urban transformation processes, such as gentrification as well as the increase in poor urban neighbourhoods (e.g., slums) produce new urban patterns. The intersection of very rapid socio-economic and demographic dynamics are often insufficiently understood, and relevant data for understanding them are commonly unavailable, dated, or too coarse (resolution). Traditional survey-based methods (e.g., census) are carried out at low temporal granularity and do not allow for frequent updates of large urban areas. Researchers and policymakers typically work with very dated data, which do not reflect on-the-ground realities and data aggregation hide socio-economic disparities. Therefore, the potential of Earth Observations (EO) needs to be unlocked. EO data have the ability to provide information at detailed spatial and temporal scales so as to support monitoring transformations. In this paper, we showcase how recent innovations in EO and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can provide relevant, rapid information about socio-economic conditions, and in particular on poor urban neighbourhoods, when large scale and/or multi-temporal data are required, e.g., to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring. We provide solutions to key challenges, including the provision of multi-scale data, the reduction in data costs, and the mapping of socio-economic conditions.

This study presents a detailed and an updated glacier inventory of 2020 for the Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB), Kashmir Himalayas using Sentinel-2 data and documents 308 glaciers. The glaciers range in size from 0.01 to 10.51 km2 and cover an area of 102.1 km2. All glaciers are located in the elevation zone between 3500 and 5000 masl. About 86% of glaciers are small in size (< 0.5 km2) and constitute 38.7% of total ice cover. However, glaciers with size greater than 0.5 km2 are only 14% but constitute a major proportion 61.3% of glacier area. Majority of small glaciers are a result of defragmentation of larger ones, hence more vulnerable to melting. Multi-date satellite images were used to assess glacier fluctuations of selected glaciers (≥ 0.3) for the period 1990–2020. The total glacier area has reduced from 85.25 to 68.17 km2 (20%) at the rate of 0.56 km2 a−1. Glaciers in the lower elevation zone (3800–4200 masl) have lost about 35% of their area at the rate of 0.22 km2 a−1.

This work consists of multitemporal satellite images at high and low spatial resolution. After the preprocessing and processing operations of these images and the calculation of the spectral indices NDWI (Normalies difference water index), NDVI (Normalies difference vegetation Index) and BI (Brilliance Index), we have developed multi-temporal maps of the vegetation, water and soil. The establishment and processing of land cover maps (LCM) through the use of the ""change detection""application has allowed us to quantify the changes in vegetation cover during the last 28 years in the Korifla basin. As a result, the NDVI maps show that the vegetation cover of the Korifla basin suffered a degradation between the 1990s and 2010 against a regeneration between 2010 and 2018. This last increase is not detectable by the SVM method. As for the ""change detection""technique, it confirms the regression of the areas of plant cover between 1990 and 2010 followed by an increase between 2010 and 2015 and relayed by a new regression of these areas between 2015 and 2018.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124906950"

It is causing major coastal structure damage and requires harbour dredging. The current study aimed at integrating remote sensing, geographical information system, and statistical methods to monitor and quantify spatio-temporal shoreline dynamics along Ilaje Local Government, Ondo State, Nigeria over 31 years (1986–2017). Four multi-temporal and spectral Landsat satellite images were used to examine the shoreline changes for a long-term period (1986–2017), besides three short-term time intervals. Images were classified using supervised classification to map the land use land cover changes in the study area. Integrating the Digital Shoreline Analysis System version 4.3 tool within ArcGIS facilitated the quantification of shoreline changes via the End-Point Rate and Net Shoreline Movement statistical techniques. The study revealed a coastal length of about 80 km with both accretion and erosion processes actively shown along the coastline. About 40 km of the coastline was found to be accreting with an average of + 1.08 m/year followed by 35.4 km of coastal erosion with an average of − 1.40 m/year and 4.6 km of the coast more or less appears stable. The overall shoreline changes fall within high accretion (> + 1 to ≤ + 2) to high erosion (< − 1 to ≥ - 2) of shoreline classification. The results show significant erosion, which could impact high economic, social, and environmental costs. The study provides baseline information on shoreline dynamism in the coastline areas of Ilaje Ondo State which will serve as a veritable data for the sustainable control of coastal erosion in the study area and other shoreline with similar characteristics. © 2021, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Nigeria; Ondo; coast; coastal erosion; GIS; remote sensing; shoreline change; spatiotemporal analysis","Coastal erosion; Geographic Information System; Nigeria; Remote sensing; Shoreline dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118341683"

To distinguish mangroves from other areas, it is necessary to rely on biological properties: water and vegetation cover. This study develops a method by analyzing the time series of water and vegetation cover in specific areas to determine criteria for accurate mangrove extraction. For more detail, 5 criteria canopy, greenness, NDVI &gt; 0.6, NDVI &lt; 0.2, and LSWI &gt; 0.45 are extracted. These 5 indices are considered to correlate with annual mean NDVI to set thresholds for mangroves. Besides, terrain elevation data is also considered to filter out the mixed vegetation close to mangrove. This approach is applied to coastal areas of Vietnam to produce a mangrove forests map in 2020 using Google Earth Engine. Then 47 mangrove-reference points are used to check the mangrove map with an accuracy of about 85%. Finally, the mangrove map in 2020 is overlaid with the mangrove map in 2011 generated from Landsat images to determine the change of mangroves over 9 years. The results show that after 9 years, 95,000 ha of mangrove was preserved, approximately 120,000 ha disappeared, and approximately 67,000 ha of new forests. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Forestry; Canopy; GEE; Greenness; LSWI; Mangrove; Mangrove forest; NDVI; Vegetation cover; Viet Nam; Water cover; Vegetation","Canopy; GEE; Greenness; LSWI; Mangrove; NDVI","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147847499"

However, biocrust forming organisms have been shown to be dramatically vulnerable to climate and land use change occurring in these regions. In this study, we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of biocrust-dominated pixels (NDVIbiocrust) obtained from hyperspectral and LANDSAT-7 data to analyse biocrust development over time and to forecast future NDVIbiocrust development under different climate change and livestock density scenarios in southern Africa. We validated these results by analysing the occurrence and composition of biocrusts along a mesoclimatic gradient within the study region. Our results show that NDVIbiocrust, which reached maximum values of 0.2 and 0.4 in drier and wetter years, respectively, mainly depended on water availability. A predicted decrease in rainfall events according to all future climate scenarios combined with increased temperatures suggested a pronounced decrease in NDVIbiocrust by the end of the 21st century caused by reduced biocrust coverage. Livestock trampling had similar effects and exacerbated the negative impacts of climate change on biocrust coverage and composition. Data assessed in the field concurred with these results, as reduced biocrust cover and a shift from well-developed to early stages of biocrust development were observed along a gradient of decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures and livestock density. Our study demonstrates the suitability of multi-temporal series of historical satellite images combined with high-resolution mapping data and Earth system models to identify climate change patterns and their effects on biocrust and vegetation patterns at regional scales. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Southern Africa; Agriculture; Climate change; Climate models; Earth (planet); Land use; Remote sensing; Soils; Space optics; Vegetation; Biocrust; Dry land; Dryland soil; Earth system modeling; Landsat imagery; Livestock density; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal landsat imagery; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote-sensing; Space-for-time study; agricultural intensification; climate change; land use change; NDVI; pixel; soil cover; soil crust; Earth system models","Biocrust; Drylands soils; Earth system model; Livestock density; Multi-temporal Landsat imagery; NDVI; Remote sensing; Space-for-time study; Spatial distribution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116885049"

The research method used is the transformation of the vegetation indices ARVI, DVI, EVI, GNDVI, MSAVI, NDVI, RVI and TSAVI. Based on the results of the analysis carried out, the identification of mangrove density shows that the index value is in the range -1-18.31 with the division of density classes into 5 classes, namely very low, low, medium, high and very high. The mangrove class is in the range of values from 0.4 to 0.8 with a medium to very high density class. The results of the map accuracy test which were validated using 30 samples in the field obtained an accuracy of 84.38%.

The study performs a multitemporal analysis of CBERS-4 and Sentinel-2 data to assist the inspection process of the National Electric Energy Agency and proposes a reflection on this technology as a free tool for regional development management. The methodology observed inspection reports, images with different temporal and spatial resolutions and the ability of the images to integrate the inspection process of electricity generation in Brazil through photointerpretation. The results demonstrate that the processing of free images optimizes the human and financial resources, being able to verify three of the five stages of works supervised by the Agency to guarantee the schedule of implantation of the hydroelectric plants in any region of the country with the same capacity of use. In addition, remote sensing data are presented as an excellent tool in the management of regional development where the plants are implemented or other related management and monitoring applications, as they provide greater transparency and efficiency to the control over large areas, such as that exercised by the Agency, strengthening accountability and considerably reducing one of the most sensitive aspects to the regulatory body and the management of large areas: information asymmetry. © 2022, Universidade de Taubate.

Although the advantages of image segmentation to delineate agricultural fields in images are already known, the literature shows that it is rarely used to consider temporal changes in highly managed regions with the intensification of agricultural activities. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate a multitemporal segmentation method based on the coefficient of variation of spectral bands and vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 images, considering two agricultural years (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) in an area with agricultural intensification. Images of the coefficient of variation represented the spectro-Temporal dynamics within the study area. These images were also used to apply an edge detection filter (Sobel) to verify their performance. The region-based algorithm Watershed Segmentation (WS) was used in the segmentation process. Subsequently, to assess the quality of the segmentation results produced, the metrics Potential Segmentation Error (PSE), Number-of-Segments Ratio (NSR), and Euclidean Distance 2 (ED2) were calculated from manually delineated reference objects. The segmentation achieved its best performance when applied to the unfiltered coefficient of variation images of spectral bands with an ED2 equal to 7.289 and 2.529 for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020, respectively. There was a tendency for the WS algorithm to produce over-segmentation in the study area; however, its use proved to be effective in identifying objects in a dynamic area with the intensification of agricultural activities.  © Authors 2022.","Edge detection; Image segmentation; Vegetation; Agricultural activities; Agricultural intensification; Assesseg; Coefficients of variations; Multi-temporal; OBIA; Sobel; Spectral band; Vegetation index; Watershed segmentation; Agriculture","AssesSeg; Coefficient of Variation; Edge Detection; OBIA; Sobel; Vegetation Index; Watershed Segmentation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132047385"

At the beginning of the 20th century, it was a typical sea bay; however, by the 21st century, it lost the features of a marine area and a single water body and was divided into two parts with their specific hydrographic network, water regime, landscapes, biota, and anthropogenic load. Rehabilitation of the wetlands of the former sea bay requires urgent and scientifically grounded measures, as well as good knowledge of the causes and features of its rapid degradation and data on its current hydrological-morphological and hydroecological state. In 2018–2020, the authors carried out a series of field reconnaissance, geodetic, hydrometric, botanical, and hydrochemical works in this part of the mouth, created a network of stations, took numerous water samples and bottom soil samples, and analyzed them in laboratories. A vast array of data from Roshydromet (Russian Hydrometeorological Service) stations, as well as multi-temporal cartographic materials and satellite images, have been accumulated and studied; a multilayer GIS and various maps, empirical dependencies, diagrams, and graphs have been constructed; the results of studies by outside specialists have been considered. This study has made it possible to comprehensively describe the current state of the former Agrakhan Bay, build a depth map, a landscape map, a map of bottom sediments, a map of macrophytes, and a map of hydrochemical parameters, describe the water regime and water balance of the main water bodies of the former bay, determine the relationships between the main hydrological and morphological characteristics, etc. Patterns, causes, long-term stages, and parameters of the unfavorable morphodynamics of the Agrakhan Bay in the 20th century and at the very beginning of the 21st century have been studied. This has made it possible to justify measures for partial restoration of the hydrological and ecological potential of the water bodies of the former Agrakhan Bay. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Russian Federation; Terek River; bay; fluvial geomorphology; hydrography; hydrology; morphodynamics; runoff; twentieth century; twenty first century","bay; branch; delta; hydrological state; hydrotechnical activity; level; morphological changes; runoff; Terek; the Caspian","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139197326"

One strategy to achieve this is to extract building footprints and track them in multi-temporal data as observed in SpaceNet's Challenges. Although several unique solutions have been presented for this problem, this task can become extremely difficult for partially obscured buildings with densely overlapping boundaries, such as those found in underdeveloped countries like Pakistan. Consequently, in this paper we propose a framework to address this problem by merging built-up area segmentation with digital maps. In the first step, satellite image is passed to a deep learning model that predicts segmentation masks over the built-up area following which building construction profiles are generated by overlaying digital maps over these predicted masks. We compare the results with ground truth profiles and our results show that the proposed method extracts building counts and construction profiles with an accuracy of 95%.  © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The method uses a pre-existing quali-quantitative analysis to assess the relative risk indices of buildings, which provide comparative results useful for prioritisation purposes, in combination with a historical-geographical settlement analysis consistent with the ‘territorialist’ approach to the urban and regional planning and design. The quali-quantitative analysis is based on a new proposed survey-sheet model, useful to collect building information necessary for the relative risk estimation, whereas the historical-geographical investigation is based on the multi-temporal comparison of aerial and satellite images. The proposal to combine two consolidated methods represents an innovation in estimating relative risk. Considering that Stromboli Island had never been subjected to similar analyses, the results of the relative seismic risk assessment are novel and moreover identify buildings with a fairly-low and spatially-uniform relative risk. The results of the relative tsunami risk assessment are consistent with results of similar past studies, identifying buildings with a higher relative risk index on the northern coast of the island. The combined use of a building-by-building survey with a multi-temporal analysis of settlements allows obtaining a higher detail than previously available for the region. If adequately modified, the proposed combination of methods allows assessing relative risk also considering other geo-environmental hazards and their cascading effects, in a multi-hazard risk assessment perspective. © 2022","","Aeolian archipelago; Relative risk assessment; Seismic risk; Stromboli; Tsunami risk; Volcanic islands","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129019852"

Basins with high forest improves hydrological functionality by promoting reduction in surface runoff, increase infiltration and aquifer recharge, and ensures base flow regulation amongst others. On the other hand, the conversion towards highly anthropized productive systems is usually accompanied by precarious environmental management that alters the hydrological cycle and reduction in water quality in basins. Aim: The goal of this study was to analyze land use changes and their effect on water efficiency index (WEI) in three sub-basins. Methodology: The methodology included a multi-temporal analysis of satellite images to identify land uses, also the use of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model for hydrological analysis in each sub-basin, information needed for calculating the WEI. Results: The results revealed the existence of no significant difference in terms of WEI between the sub-basins with predominant tree cover of native or artificial, being higher (0.89) than the WEI values reported by the sub-basin with agricultural land use (0.65). It is concluded that hydrological functions are more efficient in basins with forest cover, made up of native or exotic species, than agricultural land use with annual crop rotations. The results contribute to decision making on public policies associated to the rural productive activities. Concluded: Finally, we conclude the necessity of the promotion of forest plantation management techniques that avoid clear-cutting and multiple rotations in basin headwaters and riparian areas. © 2021 The Author(s)","","Clear-cutting; Land cover; Land use; Mixed forest; Native forest; SWAT","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118357017"

Domain experts in agriculture work with crop type labels that are organised in a hierarchical tree structure, where coarse classes (like orchards) are subdivided into finer ones (like apples, pears, vines, etc.). We develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and significantly improves the mapping of rare crop types. The three-level label hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN), such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g., apples, pears) at a coarser level (e.g., orchard), thereby boosting classification performance at the fine-grained level. Additionally, labelling at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according to the classification scores; as coarser labels with high confidence are sometimes more useful for agricultural practice than fine-grained but very uncertain labels. We validate the proposed method on a new, large dataset that we make public. ZueriCrop covers an area of 50 km × 48 km in the Swiss cantons of Zurich and Thurgau with a total of 116′000 individual fields spanning 48 crop classes, and 28,000 (multi-temporal) image patches from Sentinel-2.

The algorithm first carried out the radiation calibration and registration of the GF-4 satellite image, used the spectral difference between the cloud and the typical ground surface to obtain potential cloud pixels, and then used the difference between the sequence GF-4 satellite image to identify cloud pixels. Finally, the mid-infrared band was used to retrieve the brightness temperature of the surface to remove the ice and snow pixels. The algorithm was verified in three research areas of Hainan, Liaoning and Anhui, and the detection results were compared with the detection results of traditional single-phase cloud detection algorithm, SVM cloud detection algorithm, and RTD cloud detection algorithm. The results show that the algorithm is better than the others.

As a result, the areas occupied by mountain tundra communities are considerably reduced and, hence, the biodiversity of the alpine mountain is decreased. The goal of this study is to assess the climate-driven transformation of the alpine forest ecosystems of Iremel Massif using a suite of methods. The comparison of multi-temporal topographic maps and satellite images served to establish that over the past 60 years, the continuous limits of open forests have shifted by 5.5 m/decade to the higher altitudes and 21.6 m/decade horizontally. The area of the boundary shift of the open forest was 6.97 km2. For the first time, changes in the areas occupied by various types of woody vegetation in the study region were quantified based on landscape repeat photography and the WSL Monoplotting Tool software. On the northeastern slope of Bolshoy Iremel, over the past 40 years, the area of closed forests has increased by a factor of almost 2, the area of open forests has increased by a factor of 5, the area of sparse forests has increased by a factor of 2, and the area of plots with single trees has decreased by a factor of 4. Analysis of the age structure of Siberian juniper (Juniperus sibirica Burgsd.) revealed that substantial expansion of that species into mountain tundra communities occurred above the upper limits of open forests from 1920 to 1930 and from 1950 to 1980. The most dramatic increase in the number of trees began only after the 1990s, and it has been continuing until today. A high correlation has been found between the number of established J. sibirica shrubs and the amount of precipitation in the first months of the cold season (November-January) in the previous five years (Spearman's correlation coefficient is 0.61). © Siberian Federal University.

However, geometric misalignment and radiometric dissimilarity occur when acquiring multitemporal VHR satellite images owing to external environmental factors, and these errors cause various inaccuracies, thereby hindering the effective use of multitemporal VHR satellite images. Such errors can be minimized by applying preprocessing methods such as image registration and relative radiometric normalization (RRN). However, as the data used in image registration and RRN differ, data consistency and computational efficiency are impaired, particularly when processing large amounts of data, such as a large volume of multitemporal VHR satellite images. To resolve these issues, we proposed an integrated preprocessing method by extracting pseudo-invariant features (PIFs), used for RRN, based on the conjugate points (CPs) extracted for image registration. To this end, the image registration was performed using CPs extracted using the speeded-up robust feature algorithm. Then, PIFs were extracted based on the CPs by removing vegetation areas followed by application of the region growing algorithm. Experiments were conducted on two sites constructed under different acquisition conditions to confirm the robustness of the proposed method. Various analyses based on visual and quantitative evaluation of the experimental results were performed from geometric and radiometric perspectives. The results evidence the successful integration of the image registration and RRN preprocessing steps by achieving a reasonable and stable performance. © 2021 by the authors.

Numerous supraglacial streams flowing directly over the NW GrIS surface drain a large lobe of grounded ice at Inglefield Land, into the proglacial Minturn River and the Nares Strait. Owing to the absence of moulins and crevasses, this continuous supraglacial-proglacial drainage system regulates the evacuation of surface meltwater from the ice sheet to the ocean. We examine this Inglefield Land coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system during the 2016–2019 melt seasons (July to August), using 137 Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 visible/near-infrared satellite images. Two surface water metrics (supraglacial meltwater area fraction Am and proglacial river effective width We) are used to track spatio-temporal variations of surface meltwater moving through this drainage system. Satellite-derived Am and We are also compared with daily surface runoff simulations from the MAR v3.11 and MERRA-2 climate/SMB models, to estimate meltwater routing lag times and assess model performance. Satellite-derived Am and We are highly correlated (r2 = 0.85, p < 0.01), indicating that the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system evacuates meltwater directly from the ice surface to the ocean with negligible subglacial storage or delays. Both remotely sensed metrics are positively correlated with modeled runoff, especially MAR (r2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for Am and We, vs. 0.66 and 0.64 for MERRA-2). Lagged MAR runoff (2 days, r2 = 0.87 and 0.82) match both metrics better than simultaneous MAR runoff and the optimal time lag for both metrics are 2 d. We conclude that 1) unlike the southwest GrIS, the coupled supraglacial-proglacial drainage system at Inglefield Land routes surface meltwater runoff directly off the ice surface to the proglacial zone, with virtually no subglacial capture of runoff by moulins; 2) most of the ∼2 d transit time occurs on the ice surface rather than in the proglacial zone; and 3) multi-temporal satellite imaging facilitates holistic, source-to-sink tracking of NW GrIS meltwater from the ice surface to the global ocean. © 2021 The Author(s)","Arctic; Greenland; Inglefield Land; drainage network; glacial hydrology; ice sheet; Landsat; mass balance; meltwater; proglacial environment; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis","Greenland runoff; Proglacial river; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial river; Surface mass balance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122512966"

However, many remote sensing satellite images contain cloud noise, resulting in difficulties in practical applications. Existing cloud removal methods are limited when an image contains lots of clouds or thick clouds. Besides, most methods need a cloudless image as a reference. Our study proposes an advanced algorithm to remove cloud noise (especially thick clouds) in remote sensing images, including a cloud segmentation model, prior knowledge refinement, and Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. Firstly, we trained a Cloud-net model to segment cloud regions. RGB and Near Infrared (NIR) images are fed into the Cloud-net model. Then it outputs coarse segmentation images. Secondly, we introduced the prior knowledge to refine and recover segmentation results. Finally, we designed cloud removal rules based on D-S evidence theory to fuse muti-temporal remote sensing images. Our method achieves a surprising performance on GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite images, reducing the average percentage of cloud noise from 30 % –40 % to 2 % –8 % per image. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Disasters; Image segmentation; Infrared devices; Remote sensing; Satellites; Cloud segmentation; Cloud segmentation model; De-noising; Dempster Shafer evidence theory; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal denoising; Remote sensing images; Satellite remote sensing; Satellite remote sensing image; Segmentation models; Weather forecasting","Cloud segmentation model; D-S evidence theory; Multi-temporal denoising; Satellite remote sensing image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145009654"

Modeling how agroecosystems respond to variations in soil attributes, relief and crop management dynamics can guide soil conservation. This research presents a new approach to evaluate soil loss by water erosion in cropland using the RUSLE model and Synthetic Soil Image (spectroscopy technique), which uses time series remotely sensed environmental, agricultural and anthropic variables, in the southeast region of São Paulo State, Brazil. The availability of the open-access satellite images of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Landsat satellite images provided ten years of rainfall data and 35 years of exposed soil surface. The bare soil surface and agricultural land use were extracted, and the multi-temporal rainfall erosivity was assessed. We predict soil maps’ attributes (texture and organic matter) through innovative soil spectroscopy techniques to assess the soil erodibility and soil loss tolerance. The erosivity, erodibility, and topography obtained by the Earth observations were adopted to estimate soil erosion in four scenarios of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) residue coverage (0%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in five years of the sugarcane cycle: the first year of sugarcane harvest and four subsequent harvesting years from 2013 to 2017. Soil loss tolerance means 4.3 Mg ha−1 exceeds the minimum rate in 40% of the region, resulting in a total soil loss of ~6 million Mg yr−1 under total coverage management (7 Mg ha−1). Our findings suggest that sugarcane straw production has not been sufficient to protect the soil loss against water erosion. Thus, straw removal is unfeasible unless alternative conservation practices are adopted, such as minimum soil tillage, contour lines, terracing and other techniques that favor increases in organic matter content and soil flocculating cations. This research also identifies a spatiotemporal erosion-prone area that requests an immediately sustainable land development guide to restore and rehabilitate the vulnerable ecosystem service. The high-resolution spatially distribution method provided can identify soil degradation-prone areas and the cropland expansion frequency. This information may guide farms and the policymakers for a better request of conservation practices according to site-specific management variation. © 2022 by the authors.","Agricultural wastes; Biogeochemistry; Crop rotation; Ecosystems; Farms; Land use; Organic compounds; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil conservation; Soils; Textures; Topography; Bio-energy; Conservation practices; Crop residue; Remote-sensing; RUSLE; Soil degradation; Soil erosion; Soil loss; Sustainable land use; Water erosion; Erosion","bioenergy; crop residue; remote sensing; RUSLE; soil degradation; sustainable land use","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145972116"

It extends from Burullus inlet to the east to Kitchener drain outlet to the west. Burullus headland has several types of coastal protection structures, such as seawalls, groins, revetments, jetties, basalt riprap (rock wall), and detached breakwaters; these structures were constructed to mitigate coastal erosion. This study aims to compare rates of shoreline displacement prior to and after the construction of the aforementioned structures and to evaluate their efficiency in protecting Burullus headland from erosion during the period from 1973 to 2018. Multi-temporal satellite images and Digital Shoreline Analysis System software have been used to detect and quantify shoreline changes and to predict the shoreline position at 2030, depending on the resulted rates of shoreline displacement. The analysis showed that Burullus headland coast would be divided into four zones, according to the intensity of the erosion; these are: Zone A with accretion's rate of 0.67 m/year; Zone B, the most affected area by erosion with retreating rate of 4.32 m/year; Zone C, which includes 14 of detached breakwater, showed an accretion rate of 5.62 m/year; and finally, Zone D, which includes 9 groins, was characterized by retreating rate of 2.88 m/year. The results of this study show that some types of protection structures were not effective in mitigating coastal erosion in the case of Burullus headland.

However, few surface deformation studies have focused on the distinction between different types of anthropogenic ground deformation. Based on Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, this study employs the hybrid multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method to extract the surface deformation of Chaoshan Plain from 2015 to 2020, with a spatial resolution of 30 m × 30 m. A series of historical optical satellite images and groundwater extraction data are used to help distinguish different types of human activities that have induced surface deformation. The characteristics of ground deformation induced by different types of anthropogenic activities are explored in the space and time dimensions. Results show that InSAR ground deformation in the study area is mainly caused by three types of human activities: groundwater extraction, land reclamation, and construction. Groundwater extraction has impacted >50% of the regional surface deformation by area. The interannual variability of the surface deformation rate corresponds well to that of groundwater extraction, and the subsidence effect can last for more than five years with seasonal variability. The maximum surface subsidence rate in land reclamation areas reaches ~100 mm/year, with a linear decreasing trend against time. Without extra compaction, the reclamation area can continue to deform almost at the same rate for several years. The rapid increase of overlying loads caused by construction in the reclamation area has led to a sharp decrease in the deformation rate within 2–3 years after the completion of the construction. In areas absent of other human-induced deformation, construction activities are shown to cause surface subsidence of 10–20 mm/year in a relatively short period. In areas experiencing a combination of construction and groundwater extraction, land subsidence rates of >50 mm/year are observed. This study shows that the spatial and temporal analysis of the correlations between human activities and InSAR surface deformation is an effective way to attribute the driven factors of coastal plain deformation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","","Anthropogenic activities; Chaoshan Plain; InSAR; Surface deformation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147565038"

Geospatial analyses using various statistical and quantitative methods which are more applicable, accurate and dependable to measures the spatio-temporal trend of erosion accretion and estimate the change rate of shoreline. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have been used for the identification of shoreline change over the various time scales. To identify the rate Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was applied in the current research. The present study aimed to identify the trend of coastal erosion accretion during 43 years (1975–2018) which is divided into four short term period (1975–1988, 1988–2000, 2000–2010 and 2010–2018) between the coastal stretch of Subarnarekha and Rasulpur estuary along Bay of Bengal using multi temporal satellite images. The accurate shoreline position has been delineated by the histogram threshold method using the images of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper. The shoreline change rate has been calculated based on cast transect method through some statistical techniques such as End Point Rate (EPR) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) in GIS application. 70.42 km long coastal stretch along Bay of Bengal has been divided into three littoral zones (LZ) to analyze the shoreline shifting on a zone basis. From the analysis it has been observed that maximum erosion occurred between 1988 and 2000 time period in all zones. The result shows that highest rate of net shoreline movement has been found in LZ I (− 1715.71 m) in 1975–1988 and LZ III (− 1719.65 m) in 2000–2010 at Subarnarekha estuary and Junput respectively. The present study reveals that most of the accretive formation is observed in 2000–2010 and 2010–2018. Major accretion is identified in the southern part of Subarnarekha estuary, 23.93 m/year in EPR method. Maximum shades of changes was experienced in LZ I, especially in Subarnarekha estuary area. In the time span of 1975–1988 this area faced the highest erosion and highest accretion with the rate of − 78.54 m/year and 23.93 m/year respectively through EPR method. During 1988–2000, − 37.35 m/year erosional rate was found in the Subarnarekha estuary. The highest erosional rate was − 8.48 m/year in Beguran Jalpai during 1988–2000 by EPR.

However, research in this area is promising, since salinity is a clear limiting factor that influences vegetation growth; thus, it affects the spectral characteristics of vegetation. This study carried out an analysis of multi-temporal high-resolution space images, which consisted of comparison with detailed ground-based data on soil salinity using the principal component method and multiple linear regression. Images from the QuickBird (2007) and SuperView-1 (2021) spacecraft with a spatial resolution of 2 m were used as remote sensing data. Ground studies were carried out in 2011 and 2021. Soil salinity was estimated from the specific electrical conductivity (EC) in an aqueous suspension of 1 : 5. It was found that there were no significant changes in soil salinity in the key area over the 10-year period; however, there were changes in the state of vegetation, which are reflected on the maps of the NDVI vegetation index. Multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images were used as a basis to calculate the principal components; it was concluded that the first three components explained almost 97% of the entire image variance. Models built using multiple linear regression analysis describe soil salinity well (R 2 of the model is 0.68, 0.77, 0.83 for the 0–30, 0–50, 0–100 cm layers, respectively). When tested on a control sample, the constructed models based on remote data showed good convergence (R 2 between the predicted and real values of EC is 0.70, 0.87, 0.83 for the 0–30, 0–50, 0–100 cm layers, respectively). The proposed models will be useful for assessing the salinization of soils in the solonetzic complex in the south of the steppe zone according to high-resolution satellite imagery. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","","Caspian lowland; NDVI; principal component analysis (PCA); QuickBird; soil salinity assessment; solonetzic complexes; SuperView-1","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141145348"

The area played an important role for the agricultural economy and the traffic of goods and people, from the south of Italy towards the central regions, starting from the Neolithic period, and reaching the zenith with the Greek polis of Metaponto and its hinterland. The site is herein analyzed through an integrated use of several Earth observation and remote sensing technologies and ancillary data produced over the years by archaeologists and scholars. The aim was to identify new buried elements of archaeological interest, for the reconstruction of the historical-archaeological landscape. Through the combined use of optical and radar satellite images, high-resolution images obtained by Unmanned Aerial System (visible, multispectral, and thermal infrared), geophysical data, and archival data, it was possible to deepen the knowledge of the area, in particular the ""Castrum""area, identifying new buried evidence (structures, roads, and elements of the ancient landscape).  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Antennas; Remote sensing; Agricultural economy; Case-studies; Earth observations; Integrated use; Multi sensor; Multi-temporal; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing technology; Southern Italy; Technology data; Agriculture","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129894430"

Consequently, a lot of major land cover changes happened. To retrospectively quantify such land cover changes, this study analysed synthetic aperture radar images of the Sentinel-1 satellites by applying the Google Earth Engine. Three satellite images are analysed by the multitemporal difference-adjusted dispersion threshold approach to capture land cover changes such as demolished buildings and new buildings by applying a threshold. This approach uses synthetic aperture radar data that are rarely considered in previously existing land cover change services. Urbanization or urban sprawl leads to changes in the urban form globally. These can be caused, for example, by migration or regionally by structural change, etc., such as in the study area presented here. The results are validated with reference data sets, which are publicly available nationally (e.g., house contour lines, normalized digital terrain model, digital orthophotos) or which are publicly available globally like the Global Urban Footprint and the World Settlement Footprint.

In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based method for cloud/shadow-covered missing data reconstruction for time-series Landsat images. Central to this method is the combined use of autoencoder, long-short-term memory (AE-LSTM)-based similar pixel clustering and for backward LSTM-based time-series prediction. First, manually delineated cloud/shadow-covered masks were overlaid onto multi-temporal satellite images to produce pixel-wise time-series data with masking values. Second, these pixel-wise time series were clustered by an AE-LSTM-based unsupervised method into multiple clusters, for searching similar pixels. Third, for each cluster of target images, a for-backward-LSTM-based model was established to restore missing values in time series data. Finally, reconstructed data were merged with cloud-free (image) regions to produce cloud-free time-series images. The proposed method was applied onto three datasets of multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI images to restore cloud/shadow-covered images. The reconstruction results, showing an improvement of greater than 10% in normalized mean-square error compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in time-series reconstruction for satellite images. © 2022 The Author(s).

Andhra Pradesh has the second longest (972 km) coastline in India. The present study analyzed shoreline change and its future prediction by employing satellite-derived data and geographic information system. End point rate (EPR) and linear regression rate (LRR) statistical tools in the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) were used to estimate historical shoreline change rate between 1973 and 2015. Erosion and accretion of the coastline were delineated from Landsat satellite images for 1973, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015; subsequently, shoreline is predicted for short-term (2025) and long-term (2050) periods. The study showcased that the river mouths of Krishna and Godavari experienced higher rate of change in shoreline position influenced by the deltaic environment and fluvial processes. LRR model prediction depicts the average rate of shoreline change during 2015–2025 will be 4.64 m, while between 2015 and 2050 it will increase to 16.25 m. The study observed that the error between predicted and actual shoreline is higher in the river mouth and deltaic plains.

Further, spatial metrics (Shanon’s entropy, class area (CA), number of patches (NP), largest patch index (LPI)) has indicated scattered development of built-up. Increase CA (11470 ha in 2008 and 13806 ha in 2018) and NP (221 in 2008 and 476 in 2018) have indicated isolated development of built-up with small area coverage. Increase in LPI (12.5% in 2008 and 13.5% in 2018) of built up indicated compact growth of dense built-up in the southern and eastern side leading to the vertical expansion of the city area. Linear expansion of the residential built-up, industrial, and commercial area along the highways, roads and railways and vehicular emission has contributed to the high aerosol concentration. While, in the rural region the high aerosol loading has also been observed because of the extensive use of fertilizer and stubble burning.

These supraglacial rivers and lakes play an important role in controlling surface meltwater routing and storage. However, the hydromorphology of these complex supraglacial features remains poorly quantified. In this study, we mapped the multi-temporal supraglacial rivers and lakes on the northeast GrIS (area ~ 3 × 104 km2) using sixty-five 10 m Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images acquired during the 2017 summer, and quantified their primary hydromorphology, including meltwater area fraction, meltwater volume, supraglacial river length, river sinuosity, river depth, supraglacial lake area, lake shape, and lake depth. The quantified hydromorphology was compared with variable ice flow regimes and regional climate model (RCM) runoff. The results indicate that widespread supraglacial rivers and lakes maximally cover 5.3% of the northeast GrIS, which is more than double the previous estimates and only slightly lower than that for the strongly melting southwest GrIS (~7.0%). As the surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats, supraglacial rivers and lakes migrate from the ice sheet margin (~400 m) to high elevations (~1400 m). The satellite-mapped surface meltwater area fraction for the entire study area is positively correlated with the RCM surface runoff before the timing of peak melt (August 1), but decreases relatively slowly (by 32–45%) compared to the rapidly decreasing runoff (by 84–96%) in August. Large elevational variations were found for the peak magnitude and timing of the meltwater extent and volume. High (800–1400 m) elevation bands achieve peak values over two weeks later than low (400–800 m) elevation bands, and the 800–1000 m elevation band yields maximum peak values due to the wide distribution of supraglacial rivers. Furthermore, the supraglacial drainage patterns vary with different ice flow regimes. There are long rivers and few lakes in areas where ice deformation controls the ice flow velocity while there are short rivers and large, narrow lakes in areas where basal sliding is a major component of the ice flow. Meanwhile, long, sinuous rivers and small lakes form on the floating ice. In general, this study conducts a preliminary investigation of supraglacial rivers and lakes on the poorly-studied northeast GrIS and reveals that surface melt and ice flow control the hydromorphology of supraglacial rivers and lakes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Climate models; Flow velocity; Glaciers; Ice; Lakes; Runoff; Area fraction; Flow regimes; Greenland Ice Sheet; Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Rivers and lakes; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface meltwater; Surface runoffs; climate modeling; correlation; flow control; flow velocity; ice flow; ice sheet; melting; meltwater; runoff; satellite imagery; Sentinel; temporal analysis; water depth; Rivers","Ice flow; Northeast Greenland; Supraglacial lake; Supraglacial river; Surface runoff","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111800258"

In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve atmospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 ± 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals. © 2022 The Authors","France; Aerosols; Benchmarking; Calibration; Mean square error; Optical properties; Optical remote sensing; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Statistical tests; Uncertainty analysis; Water vapor; Aerosol optical depths; Atmospheric corrections; Copernicu sentinel-2; Intercomparison exercise; Intercomparisons; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Surface reflectance; Uncertainty; Water vapour; AERONET; aerosol; atmospheric correction; calibration; Landsat; performance assessment; radiative transfer; remote sensing; Landsat","Aerosol optical depth; Atmospheric correction; Copernicus Sentinel-2; Intercomparison; Landsat 8; Surface reflectance; Water vapour","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144399947"

Due to rapid urbanization in the last few decades, massive reduction of urban vegetation cover (VC) has increased the land surface temperature (LST) and hampered the environmental sustainability. This study aims to identify the VC cover loss on LST increase in Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) area using geospatial techniques. The study established the relationship between VC loss and LST increase using transformation analysis and micro-level directional mapping in ArcGIS 10.6 software. Multi-temporal Landsat TM/OLI satellite images were used for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, to classify land use/land cover (LULC) classes, the transition between VC and urban area (UA), directional distribution of UA and VC, and variation of ward wise LST distribution due to VC loss in the study area. The maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm was used to classify the LULC maps. All the classified LULC maps demonstrated an overall accuracy of more than 85%. The spectral radiance model was used to extract LST information from satellite images. The analysis of LULC estimation suggests a significant net increase in UAs (+18%) and a reduction in VC (-17%) from 1990 to 2020. The maximum temperature of the city was increased to 37.75 °C in 2020 from 23.46 °C in 1990. The assessed LST showed that the lower recorded temperature zones in 1990 were converted into a higher temperature zone in 2020. The mean LST distribution showed a growing trends in UA, and reduction in VC, which converted the study region from a moderate temperature zone to a high-temperature zone. The study demonstrates that a rise in the non-evaporated surfaces, i.e., UA and a reduction in the green cover, were the most significant influential factors to increase the LST effect. Remote sensing techniques have been proved a very useful tool for urban planners and policymakers in taking appropriate measures to ensure sustainable development, conservation of the city's natural resources and minimize the influence of urbanization on LST. © 2021","","Land surface temperature; Remote sensing; Urban area; Vegetation cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117201892"

Assessing nutrient input and export as well as retention risks is critical to ensuring the quality and safety of drinking water sources. Conventional balance methods for nutrient estimation rely on statistical data and a huge number of estimation coefficients, which introduces uncertainty into the model results. This study aimed to propose a convenient, reliable, and accurate nutrient prediction model to evaluate the potential nutrient retention risks of drinking water sources and reduce the uncertainty inherent in the traditional balance model. The spatial distribution of pollutants was characterized using time-series satellite images. By embedding human activity indicators, machine learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), were constructed to estimate the input and export of nutrients. We demonstrated the proposed model’s potential using a case study in the Yanghe Reservoir Basin in the North China Plain. The results indicate that the area information concerning pollution source types was effectively established based on a multi-temporal fusion method and the RF classification algorithm, and the overall classification low-end accuracy was 92%. The SVM model was found to be the best in terms of predicting nutrient input and export. The determination coefficient (R2 ) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of N input, P input, N export, and P export were 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.93, respectively, and 32.75, 5.18, 1.45, and 0.18, respectively. The low export ratios (2.8–3.0% and 1.1–2.2%) of N and P, the ratio of export to input, further confirmed that more than 97% and 98% of N and P, respectively, were retained in the watershed, which poses a pollution risk to the soil and the quality of drinking water sources. This nutrient prediction model is able to improve the accuracy of non-point source pollution risk assessment and provide useful information for water environment management in drinking water source regions. © 2022 by the authors.

Besides, the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) studies the shoreline shift rate analysis. Multi-temporal satellite images have revealed accretion and erosion patterns in the areas of concern. Landsat images with different periods were geometrically and radiometrically corrected, then classified through assigning 8 different classes for the quantitative coastline delineation analysis from 1987 to 2019: (Landsat 5–TM, Thematic Mapper (TM)), Landsat7 ETM+, worldview 2, and Sentinel 2). To detect both land use and land cover change (LULCC) and shoreline growth, a maximum controlled classification tool is used. The DSAS was used to measure the coastal changing rate as a powerful statistical analysis tool, and thus to predict the behavior of the coastal shift over a long time. DSAS used two separate methods: EPR and LRR. The results concluded that, primarily as a consequence of unregulated landfill practices before tourist facilities, Hurghada's coastal region experienced an average accretion rate of 1.38 m/y. Moreover, the El-Gouna study revealed drastic modifications because of the development of its coastal zone's closed inland lagoons.

This is an essential preparatory stage in identifying the natural or anthropogenic activities that had a negative impact on it. This research used the spatiotemporal modelling approach in Idku Lake, Egypt between 1973 and 2021. Various image processing such as vector analysis, spectral indices and supervised classification were used to classify the satellite images into the identified LULC features. Water, hydrophytes, and fish farms were recognized using multi-temporal Landsat images. The findings indicated that the hydrophytes growth is a minor component that has in the past caused a decrease in the lake’s water area, particularly in the years 1973, 1985, and 1990. This hydrophyte cover is caused by both the drainage system and the nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. But from 2003 to 2021, this factor started to decline due to the government’s efforts to protect the lake. An additional issue that started to appear, particularly from 1985, is human activities including the establishment of fish farms. This led to the loss of 72.89 km2 (57%) over a 48-year period. In other words, human encroachments on Idku lake are the primary cause of its deformation, and this needs to be taken into account to ensure that it is preserved as an aspect of sustainable development of water sources. The methodology and results of this research will assist the government and stockholders in developing a future plan for protecting the environment and ecosystems not only in Idku lake but also in other lakes with similar environmental conditions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Anthropogenic activities; Egypt; GIS; IDKU lake; Remote sensing; Spatiotemporal modelling","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142293099"

Mango is a major fruit crop in India, but detection of changes in mango crops remains a challenging task because the reason that many perennial crops have similar reflectance profiles. Therefore, a potent change detection technique is required for different applications such as the rate of deforestation, urban developments, damage evaluation, and resource monitoring. Compared to annual and seasonal crops, relatively few studies have been conducted on change detection in perennial fruit crops. In this study, a novel log ratio change detection technique (i.e., LR-PCA) is developed using the fusion of log-ratio (LR) and principal component analysis (PCA) images derived from bi-temporal soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) images to extract meaningful information and detect temporal changes in the mango fruit crop areas with high change detection accuracy. The proposed approach comprised two steps: (1) SAVI images from 2015 and 2019 were used to retrieve the log-ratio (LR) and principal component (PC) images, respectively, and both the images were fused by applying the pixel-by-pixel fusion approach. (2) Fused images were classified into three classes: 'positive change', 'no change', and 'negative change' using a derived threshold value. The results show that the LR-PCA method of change detection yields a high change detection accuracy of 92% in comparison with the other change detection methods viz. vegetation image differencing, image ratioing, PCA, and log-ratio. To validate the adaptability of the proposed algorithm, experiments with two sets of bi-temporal SAVI indices images belonging to the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh State determine that the proposed change detection method performs well as compared to the existing individual methods for detection of changes in mango fruit crop. The proposed method is expected to be useful for detecting changes in the area of perennial crops. In the future, an accurate and efficient change detection analysis may be helpful for developing a real-time mango fruit crop monitoring system at the national level.  © 2013 IEEE.","Change detection; Crops; Damage detection; Deforestation; Fruits; Image analysis; Image fusion; Pixels; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing; Urban growth; Vegetation mapping; Change detection; LANDSAT; Landsat 8 OLI; Log ratio; Mango crop; Principal-component analysis; Remote-sensing; Satellite broadcasting; Vegetation mapping; Landsat","Change detection; Landsat 8 OLI; Log ratio; Mango crop; Principal component analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135758692"

Unfortunately, the existence of the cloud interferes with these activities. The small coverage of high-resolution satellite imageries is also needed to be extended to a larger coverage for monitoring large areas. A method for generating the cloud-free tile-based mosaic for high-resolution satellite images is proposed in this paper to address the issues, namely Mosaic Tile-Based (MTB). The basic idea of this method is to take advantage of the cloud cover information from multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images to select the best image with the minimum cloud cover. SPOT-6 and SPOT-7 pan-sharpened images are used to test the method's reliability. First, each image is re-shaped becomes tiles and keeps the information of its acquisition date. Each tile image is then calculated and assessed based on its cloud cover. Tile image selection is conducted in the next step to select the best tile with the lowest percentage of the cloud cover. In the last step, a mosaic of each best tile is conducted to produce a cloud-free mosaic. As a result, the mosaic product has a minimum cloud cover and larger coverage. The proposed method has beneficial as it keeps the original acquisition date on each tile and is faster for image processing activities. Thus, this method can be used as an alternative method for generating cloud-free mosaic for high-resolution satellite images to support natural resources and disaster monitoring. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144027074"

They prevent the development of water and wind erosion. Over the recent decades, the rates of PFPs development in Russia have decreased many times over as compared to the middle of the last century. At the same time, due to natural and anthropogenic factors, the existing PFPs are subject to large-scale degradation processes, while there is a lack of information about their current state. Land cover type information products and forest monitoring systems cover only a part of the PFPs. Protective forest belts with a width of 10–20 m are reflected very fragmentarily on the existing global and national satellite maps of forests. The well-known approaches to the mapping of PFPs are based on expert interpretation of Earth remote sensing (ERS) data of ultra-high spatial resolution or ground-based surveys using GPS receivers. Such methods are time consuming and cannot be applied over large areas. The paper proposes a new approach for mapping PFPs based on multi-season satellite ERS data using the BSFI (Bi-Season Forest Index). The index is calculated as the normalized difference between the minimum NDVI value for the vegetation period and the maximum albedo determined in winter when there is snow cover on the earth’s surface. Pixels with positive values of this index can be attributed to the areas covered with tree vegetation. We have compared the PFP area with the results of expert interpretation of detailed satellite images and widely used information products of satellite land cover mapping. The PFP area was identified on the basis of the BSFI using satellite imagery data obtained by the Sentinel-2 toolbox. The comparative analysis showed a close connection between the results obtained using the Sentinel-2 data and the estimates of the PFP area based on expert interpretation of detailed satellite images. The connection was characterized by a correlation coefficient R = 0.99. The analysis also allowed establishing the value of accuracy of forest identification based on this index at the level of 91 %. The relative error in identifying field-protective forest belts in the 50 m zone around the field boundaries was 9 %. The proposed approach is recommended for mapping PFPs in sparsely forested regions, where it is possible to obtain satellite images of the earth’s surface with snow cover. © 2022 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

This exacerbates the phenomenon of urban heat islands (UHI), one of the main threats to the quality of human life. In this research, a post-classification change detection algorithm is proposed based on UHI classification maps are generated using multi-temporal Landsat images from a rapidly developing urban area, in Iran in 17-years’ time interval. The main research objective is to investigate the effects of constructing new built-up areas on urban heat islands considering the land surface temperature, vegetation coverage, and surface object types. The production of UHI classification maps is based on the probabilistic reasoning rules for integrating the LST, Albedo, and NDVI as lines of evidence considering land use/land cover (LU/LC) object types. The analysis of the UHI change detection results in the rapidly developing urban area in this research indicates that the area percentage of built-up object class has increased by 12.1% in 17 years. This amount of construction led to a 23.7% increase in the high UHI class, which is equivalent to 2931 hectares. Moreover, the regions with medium and low UHI have decreased by − 16.09 and − 9.12%, respectively, which indicates an increase in the intensities of urban heat islands during this period. © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","Iran; algorithm; classification; detection method; heat island; Landsat; NDVI; satellite imagery; urban development; urban growth; urbanization","Albedo; Land surface temperature; Land use land cover map; Urban heat island","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117047875"

To this end, satellite images provide an invaluable source of Earth observations to monitor land cover in areas that are otherwise difficult to access. With the continuous development of new satellites, it is important to optimize the existing maps for further monitoring of Arctic ecosystems. This study presents a scalable classification framework, producing novel 10 m resolution land cover maps for Kobbefjord, Disko, and Zackenberg in Greenland. Based on Sentinel-2, a digital elevation model, and Google Earth Engine (GEE), this framework classifies the areas into nine classes. A vegetation land cover classification for 2019 is achieved through a multi-temporal analysis based on 41 layers comprising phenology, spectral indices, and topographical features. Reference data (1164 field observations) were used to train a random forest classifier, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 91.8%. The red-edge bands of Sentinel-2 data proved to be particularly well suited for mapping the fen vegetation class. The study presents land cover mapping in the three study areas with an unprecedented spatial resolution and can be extended via GEE for further ecological monitoring in Greenland. © 2021 by the authors.

Monitoring glacial variations is crucial to assess the consequences of climate change on the territory. In this work different geomatics techniques are exploited to measure and monitor the Rutor glacier over the years. In this study two different techniques were adopted to generate 3 digital surface models (DSMs): aerial and satellite photogrammetry. Two photogrammetric aerial surveys were carried out: at the end of the hydrological year 2019/20 and at the end of the following hydrological year. Additionally, a very high-resolution satellite stereo pair, acquired by the Pléiades-1A platform in 2017, was processed to assess whether satellite images can be applied to extract the 3D surface of the Rutor glacier. In order to evaluate the Rutor glacier mass-balance throughout the years several reference points were positioned and measured before the 2021 aerial flight. Thanks to the presence of the materialized points the 2021 model is considered as the ‘Reference Model’ against which subsequent models can be compared for glacier analysis. This model was validated by means of a comparison with the authoritative Regional DSM based on LiDAR surveys. In alpine glaciers, the positioning of artificial square cross target in time invariant areas is crucial to enable a multitemporal 4D analysis. The use of very high-resolution satellite imagery allows large areas to be mapped in 3D, but with lower accuracies proportionally decreasing with respect to slope and exposure. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aerial photography; Climate change; Photogrammetry; Satellite imagery; Stereo image processing; Surveys; 3d; Aerial photogrammetric survey; Alpine glacier; Case-studies; Digital surface models; Glacier monitoring; Hydrological years; Multi-platform; Multi-scales; Multi-temporal; Antennas","3D; Aerial photogrammetric survey; Glacier monitoring; Multi-temporal; Photogrammetry; Satellite","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141728376"

The epicenter is located in the middle section of Qilian-Haiyuan fault in the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau, which is a seismic gap. It is of great significance to study this earthquake for understanding the tectonic deformation mechanism, strain release process and seismic hazards of the NE Tibetan Plateau. Methods: Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (D-InSAR) is used to obtain the coseismic deformation along the line of sight (LOS) of the Menyuan earthquake from Sentinel-1 satellite images. The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation are used to obtain the EW coseismic deformation from the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data. Based on the coseismic deformation field derived from InSAR interferograms, we invert the slip distribution. Results: The LOS deformation fields showed that the Menyuan earthquake caused a surface rupture of about 20 km long and the maximum LOS displacement was 0.75 m. The maximum EW displacement derived from optical images was 2.5 m. The slip distribution model showed that the Menyuan earthquake was dominated by a sinistral strike-slip. The coseismic slip is concentrated at a depth of 0-10 km. The maximum slip was 3.25 m at a depth of 4.89 km and the rake angle was 10.44°. The estimated total seismic moment is 1.07×1019 N·m, corresponding to a magnitude of Mw 6.6. Conclusions: According to the results from aftershock relocation, field investigation and tectonic background, we infer that the seismogenic fault is the Lenglongling fault and the eastern segment of Tuolaishan fault is also ruptured. The stress on the eastern segment of the Lenglongling fault and the western segment of the Tuolaishan fault is enhanced, implying that there is the possibility of strong earthquakes in this region in the future. © 2022, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

The lack of periodic, high-resolution, short–medium-term, annual, and seasonal observations considerably limit the comprehensive understanding of the processes and mechanisms of gully erosion caused by multiple forces at the watershed scale. Therefore, in this study, we periodically monitored the geomorphic, morphological, and volume changes of a stabilized gully both annually and seasonally in a small agricultural watershed (6 ha) in the southern black soil region in northeast China based on the centimeter-level resolution of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived orthoimages and digital terrain models (DTMs) from 2015 to 2020. Compared with submeter-resolution satellite images, the multitemporal UAV data exhibited strong adaptability and various advantages for the assessment of short–medium-term (≤5 years) gully erosion rates in this region. The results demonstrated that the gully has an actively retreating headcut that was always the main source of sediment yield. The linear, areal, and volumetric gully headcut retreat (GHR) rates were 0.74 m year−1, 7.29 m2 year−1, and 9.66 m3 year−1, respectively. GHR in the rainy season accounted for 94.62% of the annual linear erosion and 87.64% of the areal erosion. In particular, sidewall collapse and gully head expansion dominated in the early rainy season, which accounted for 66.67% of the annual linear erosion and 49% of the areal erosion. Our results provide high-resolution orthoimages and a DTM time series produced by a UAV to evaluate short–medium-term (5 years) GHR rate and quantify the contribu-tion of freeze–thaw processes, snowmelt, and rainfall to gully erosion in the region. The findings contribute to understanding the gully erosion processes induced by multiple forces in the southern black soil region of northeast China. © 2022 by the authors.

However, databases of landslide events are often spatially biased towards roads or other infrastructure, with few reported in remote areas. In this study, we demonstrate how Google Earth Engine can be used to create multi-temporal change detection image composites with freely available Sentinel-1 and-2 satellite images, in order to improve landslide visibility and facilitate landslide detection. First, multispectral Sentinel-2 images were used to map landslides triggered by a summer rainstorm in Jølster (Norway), based on changes in the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) between pre-and post-event images. Pre-and post-event multi-temporal images were then created by reducing across all available images within one month before and after the landslide events, from which final change detection image composites were produced. We used the mean of backscatter intensity in co-(VV) and cross-polarisations (VH) for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and maximum NDVI for Sentinel-2. The NDVI-based mapping increased the number of registered events from 14 to 120, while spatial bias was decreased, from 100% of events located within 500 m of a road to 30% close to roads in the new inventory. Of the 120 landslides, 43% were also detectable in the multi-temporal SAR image composite in VV polarisation, while only the east-facing landslides were clearly visible in VH. Noise, from clouds and agriculture in Sentinel-2, and speckle in Sentinel-1, was reduced using the multi-temporal composite approaches, improving landslide visibility without compromising spatial resolution. Our results indicate that manual or automated landslide detection could be significantly improved with multi-temporal image composites using freely available earth observation images and Google Earth Engine, with valuable potential for improving spatial bias in landslide inventories. Using the multi-temporal satellite image composites, we observed significant improvements in landslide visibility in Jølster, compared with conventional bi-temporal change detection methods, and applied this for the first time using VV-polarised SAR data. The GEE scripts allow this procedure to be quickly repeated in new areas, which can be helpful for reducing spatial bias in landslide databases. © 2022 by the authors.

This article critically evaluates the spatiotemporal morphological variations due to erosion, accretion, and subsurface deformation of the island through multi-temporal geospatial and geophysical data analysis, ground-water quality-quantity, and also determines the nature and rate of changes from 2003 to 2020. This is the first study in this island on which multi-temporal Landsat Satellite Imagery and seismic data have been used with geospatial techniques with Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and petrel platform, respectively. The analysis of satellite images suggests that the island first appeared in 2003 in the Bay of Bengal, then progressively evolved to the present stable condition. Significant changes have taken place in the morphological and geographical conditions of the island since its inception. Since 2012, the island has been constantly accreted by insignificant erosion. It receives tidally influenced fluvial sediments from the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river system and the sedimentary accretion, in this case, is higher than the erosion due to relatively weaker wave action and longshore currents. It has gained approximately 68 km2 area, mostly in the northern part and because of erosion in the south. Although the migration of the Bhasan Char was ubiquitous during 2003–2012, it has been concentrated in a small area to the east since 2018. The net shoreline movements (NSM) suggest that the length of the shoreline enlarged significantly by around 39 km in 2020 from its first appearance. Seismic and GPS data clearly indicate that the island is located on the crest of a slowly uplifting low-amplitude anticline, which may result in a stable landform around the island. Based on the analysis of historical data, it has been assessed that the current configuration of Bhasan Char would not be severely affected by 10–15-foot-high cyclone. Therefore, FDMN rehabilitation here might be safer that would be a good example for future geo-environmental assessment for any areas around the world for rehabilitation of human in remote and vulnerable island. The findings of this research will facilitate the government’s decision to rehabilitate FDMN refugees to the island and also contribute to future research in this area. © 2022 by the authors.

This chapter aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of satellite-based earthquake damage assessment using multi-temporal remote sensing images. Change detection methods compare remote sensing images acquired at different times to discover the changes in the land cover, but the images typically have different properties, such as different spatial resolution, type of sensors and the incidence angle. Filtering-based methods are very successful in extracting contextual information from an image by removing redundant spatial details and preserving the geometric characteristics of the objects in the region of interest. The chapter focuses on the general view of the use of synthetic aperture radar images for earthquake studies, including tectonics to damage-level identification. To identify an earthquake-induced damage level at the building scale, it is necessary to use a very high-resolution image. © ISTE Ltd 2021.

To assess the shoreline changes, the analysis of multi-temporal satellite images has been carried out. A historical trend is established for the study period from 1991 to 2019. The analysis has been made in three timelines considering various developing activities. There was no significant coastal infrastructure development during 1991 to 1999; however, between 1999 and 2009, a major port, pier, and a groyne field were constructed. Additionally, a port was established between 2009 and 2019. Erosion was observed on the coast from Kattupalli to Karungali at a rate of −16.85 m/yr since 2009, while the coast on the south of Ennore port is accreting at the rate of +12.43 m/yr during the same period.

The movement of suspended sediment along the coastal water is an indicator of erosion and deposition of the coastal landforms. This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes and the corresponding spatio-temporal pattern of suspended sediment concentration of the southern Kerala coast using Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0–10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.85 with the field data. Similarly, the shoreline erosion and accretion have been analysed from the shoreline change analysis methods. In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast. It is inferred that, with the use of satellite images, the relation between the erosion/accretion pattern and the suspended sediment pattern along the coast can be visualised and qualitatively studied. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.","India; Kerala; Indicator indicator; accretion; concentration (composition); satellite imagery; sediment transport; Sentinel; shoreline change; suspended sediment","sentinel images; shoreline change analysis; Suspended sediment concentration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116834785"

The pace and magnitude of the LCCs in Ethiopia are threatening the natural ecosystem and creating vulnerability to environmental hazards. This study used a combination of remotely sensed data, field interviews, and observations to examine the dynamics and identify the driving forces of LCC from 1986 to 2020 in the Muger sub-basin, Ethiopia. Multi-temporal satellite images were classified using supervised and unsupervised methods. Information from focus group discussions and the variable ranking method were used to explain the drivers of the observed changes. The study results showed a decline in forest cover from 11.80% in 1986 to 5.90% in 2020, which indicates a loss of 49.90% of the forest cover that existed in 1986. Bare land declined from 1.15% in 1986 to 0.57% in 2020. Similarly, grazing land declined from 1.52% in 1986 to 0.41% in 2020. Wetland also declined from 1.93% in 1986 to 0.31% in 2020. Conversely, during the same period, the proportions of cultivated land, built-up areas, shrubland, and water bodies have risen from 68.86% to 70.44%, from 0.03% to 1.53%, from 14.39% to 20.27%, and from 0.34% to 0.56%, respectively. Population growth and poor agricultural practices were identified as the main causes of LCC in the sub-basin. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that implementation of comprehensive and integrated basin management policies and strategies will be indispensable to managing the risks and ensuring sustainable development in the larger Abay basin. © 2022 by the authors.","Ethiopia; accuracy assessment; basin management; field survey; land cover; remote sensing","accuracy assessment; causative factors; change detection; field survey; remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138850498"

Five main classes, i.e., volcanic structures, agriculture, settlement, sand dune and plain bareland are considered depending on the structure of the region. Within the category, the coherence value and DEM value are evaluated. In the accuracy assessment analysis, a reference map produced from aerial photogrammetry is used. Additionally, global DEM TanDEM-X data is also tested in the study region. In the analysis, quality metrics, mean error (ME), root means square error (RMSE), standard deviation (STD), and the normalized median absolute deviation (NMAD) are used. The results showed that as the temporal baseline increases the coherence values and the quality of the DEM product decrease. The RMSE values range between 2.36 m to 7.09 m in different classes. The TanDEM-X data provided high accuracies over each class range from 0.88 m to 2.40 m. Since the study area is vulnerable to sinkhole formation, sinkhole-like signals were also observed in the interferograms obtained from different and sequential pairs. The high-resolution repeat-pass PAZ data pointed out its potential for interferometric products generation.  © Authors 2022","Antennas; Interferometry; Photogrammetry; Quality control; Radar imaging; Synthetic aperture radar; Digital elevation model; High resolution; InSAR; PAZ; Repeat pass; Satellite images; Strip-map mode; Surface-deformations; TanDEM-X; X bands; Surveying","coherence; DEM; InSAR; PAZ; surface deformation; X-band","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131925431"

These modifications come by direct and indirect activities of human actions when securing essential resources. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze these land changes for the best management of natural resources and to ensure better livelihood of the inhabitants. The influx of population from the Kumasi metropolis and peripheral areas coupled with urbanization is causing rapid changes to LULC in the Atwima Nwabiagya District. This has put pressure on the land cover especially in the forest cover areas and has affected the socioeconomic activities in the district. In view of this problem, this research sought to map and analyze the spatio-temporal LULCC patterns using multi-temporal satellite images from 1986-2019 and to identify the socioeconomic factors and their impact of LULC on the study area. Seven LULC classes were identified including; bare land, closed forest, cropland, open forest, savannah, settlement, and water. The results showed that during the period under review (1986-2019) there have been losses of 4178.5 hectares (7%) in closed and open forest and bare land whilst crop land and settlement have seen an increase of 21685.3 hectares (37%). In all, settlement establishment as a result of population increase, commercial activities, and porous land tenure system was identified as the main factors for LULCC in the Atwima Nwabiagya District. © 2021 The Author(s)","","Atwima Nwabiagya; Land cover change; Socioeconomic; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120347039"

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users. © 2022 by the authors.

In this paper, a technical framework is presented for wide area landslide detection: (i) multi-temporal satellite optical images are used to detect landslides with distinguishable geomorphological features; (ii) Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) assisted InSAR stacking is employed to generate annual surface displacement rate maps in radar line of sight using satellite SAR images from both ascending and descending tracks, which are in turn utilized to automatically detect active landslides from ground motion using hotspot analysis, and (iii) the distribution characteristics of the detected landslides are investigated by examining their relationships with topographic and hydrological factors. Three expressways in Sichuan Province, China—namely the Yakang (Ya’an-Kangding), Yaxi (Ya’an-Xichang), and Lushi (Luding-Shimian) expressways—and their surrounding regions (a total area of approximately 20,000 square kilometers) were chosen as the study area. A total of 413 landslides were detected, among which 320 were detected using multi-temporal satellite optical images, and 109 were detected using GACOS-assisted InSAR stacking. It should be noted that only 16 landslides were detected by both approaches; these landslides all exhibited not only obvious geomorphological features but also ground motion. A statistical analysis of the topographic and hydrological factors shows that of the detected landslides: 81% are distributed at elevations of 1000–2500 m, over 60% lie within the elevation range of 100~400 m, and 90% present with medium and steep slopes (20°~45°), and 80% are located within areas seeing an annual rainfall of 950~1050 mm. Nine landslides were found to pose potential safety hazards to the expressways. The research findings in this paper have directly benefitted the Sichuan expressways; equally important, it is believed that the technical framework presented in this paper will provide guidance for hazard mitigation and the prevention of transportation hazards in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","Factor analysis; Feature extraction; Geometrical optics; Hazards; Landslides; Radar imaging; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Area detection; Atmospheric corrections; Generic atmospheric correction online service; Hotspot analyse; Hotspots; Interferometric synthetic aperture radar stacking; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; On-line service; Optical remote sensing; Sichuan; Sichuan expressway; Stackings; Wide area detection; Optical remote sensing","GACOS; hotspot analysis; InSAR stacking; landslide; optical remote sensing; Sichuan expressways; wide area detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137260858"

Flood mapping from SAR images is based on backscattering coefficient differences. The change rules of the backscattering coefficient with different flooding depths of ground objects are essential prior knowledge for flood mapping, while their absence greatly limits the precision. Therefore, minimizing the backscattering coefficient differences caused by non-flood factors is of great significance for improving the accuracy of flood mapping. In this paper, non-flood factor influences, i.e., monthly variations of ground objects and polarization and satellite orbits, on the backscattering coefficient are studied with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images for five ground objects in Kouzi Village, Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China. Sentinel-1 images in different rainfalls are used to study the variation of the backscattering coefficient with flooding depths. Since it is difficult to measure the flooding depth of historical rainfall events, a hydrological analysis based on the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) is used to estimate the flooding depth. The results showed that the monthly variations of the maximum backscattering coefficients of farmland and construction and the backscattering coefficient differences caused by the satellite orbit were larger than the minimum backscattering coefficient differences caused by inundation. The flood extraction rules of five objects based on Sentinel-1 were obtained and analyzed, which improved flood extraction knowledge from qualitative to semi-quantitative analysis. © 2022 by the authors.","Backscattering; Floods; Mapping; Orbits; Polarization; Radar imaging; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Characteristics analysis; Flood extraction; Flood mapping; Floodings; Ground objects; Inundation; Multi-temporal; Satellite orbit; Sentinel-1; Extraction","backscattering coefficient; flood extraction; inundation; polarization; Sentinel-1","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136493251"

In a situation where most of the economic and social relations remain informal and rarely captured in the official documents, landscapes become the visible marker of the changing, intersecting and sometimes conflicting interests of these actors. In this paper, we analyse and juxtapose social and landscape data to examine how these relations are manifested in the land cover, which is a valuable proxy for studies of landscapes in a situation of remoteness. Using interviews and observations, we collected and analysed data on pertinent social, cultural and professional ties and examined local land-use practices and diverse economic interests during fieldwork in August 2020. The analysis of forest change was carried out using statistical and forest plan data, and a land-cover map was created using Landsat satellite images from 2020. The resulting map illustrates preservation of a traditional way of life in the form of seasonal migration infrastructure which includes summer pastures with summer houses and informal roads connecting them with settlements. However, multi-temporal maps with field data validation are needed to support more detailed accounts of change captured in the interviews.  © 2022 Copyright 2022 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands","Buryatia; Russian Federation; land cover; land use; Landsat; landscape; satellite imagery","land cover; land use analysis; landscapes; Okinskiy district; traditional land use","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129157949"

Landsat images for three different time-periods (1999, 2009 and 2019) were used to quantify changes between 1999 and 2019. Eight major classes were identified on satellite images, namely: Barren land, agriculture, built-up, waterbody, wetland, range land, scrub land and snow/glacier. Results indicate that major land use in Ladakh is barren land in all three time-periods and that built-up area has increased significantly by 123 sq km (800 %) between 1999 and 2019.

An analysis of the images made it possible to assess the structural parameters of the tree and shrub vegetation forming on the fallows. Spatio-temporal heterogeneity of post-agrogenic natural regeneration of woody vegetation at the local level was revealed. The overgrowing of small areas, mostly surrounded by a forest wall, occurs almost simultaneously over the entire area. On a fallow with a large area and an insignificant forest wall, overgrowing occurs from the forest wall, gradually moving away from it over time. At the same time, the predominance of deciduous trees near the forest wall is replaced by the predominance of conifers as they move away from it.

Deposits of five rock avalanche deposits of volumes varying from 1.5 to 150 million cubic metres are distinguished by detailed geomorphological mapping and dating. The landslides were originated in volcanic rocks affected by hydrothermal alteration. The largest three avalanche deposits, formerly considered as a single deposit, were dated using Terrestrial Cosmogenic Nuclide methods. The results show three distinct ages from Late Pleistocene to Holocene, confirming the hypothesis of separate events. The presence of clay minerals detected by X-ray diffraction in matrix samples confirm the presence of hydrothermal alteration in the landslide source areas detected by satellite image multispectral analyses, suggesting an important control of such alteration in the landslide generation. The present river morphology and outcrops of lacustrine deposits and outburst terraces evidence that the largest rock avalanches, with deposit thicknesses of up to about 100 m, have dammed the valley to be later eroded by the Pangal river.

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an $F1$ score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Media streaming; Remote sensing; Satellites; Urban growth; Change detection; Deep learning; Features extraction; Multispectral satellite image; Remote-sensing; Shape; Spatial pyramid pooling; Spatial pyramids; Streaming medium; multispectral image; Sentinel; Feature extraction","Change detection (CD); deep learning; multi-spectral satellite images; spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127087143"

The information of vegetation type on the water-land ecotone is important for detecting the health of the wetland, and its protection. Seasonal flooding is a key factor in controlling the environment in water-land ecotone. Even preventing direct detection of the flooded vegetation with satellites, seasonal flooding has effects on the distribution of plants, which may provide potential information on vegetation classification with satellites. Therefore, the study induces flooding index in vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with satellites. We applied Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map vegetation in the Dongting Lake with random forest method. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to obtain the flooding index (i.e. inundation frequency), and Sentinel-2 images were applied to acquire the optical characteristic of vegetation. A comparative experiment based on whether the flooding index was added or not during vegetation mapping in the Dongting Lake was carried out to explore the role of flooding index in vegetation mapping. The results concluded that (1) seasonal flooding will hinder vegetation mapping using a single phase of optical information; (2) the classification accuracy of single phase scenario was significantly improved with the aid of flooding index especially in wet season; (3) the classification accuracy can be somewhat improved by adding flooding index for the multi-temporal scenario. The study implies that inundation frequency information can be used for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone, especially for complex regions with insufficient cloud-free satellite images. © 2022 The Author(s)","China; Dongting Lake; Hunan; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Floods; Image classification; Lakes; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Wetlands; Dongting lake; Flooding index; Floodings; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-1 & 2 image; Single phasis; Vegetation classification; Vegetation mapping; Water-land ecotone; ecotone; flooding; Sentinel; vegetation classification; vegetation mapping; Vegetation mapping","Dongting Lake; Inundation frequency indicator; Sentinel-1 & 2 images; Vegetation classification; Water-land ecotone","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138135447"

In complement to the large body of studies developing vegetation mapping methods through the use of remote sensing data, we tested for the possibility of developing a cost-effective method to map salt marsh vegetation as a basis for monitoring a French Nature Reserve. Using classical multivariate ordination and cluster analyses, accurate and ecologically relevant vegetation groups matching existing typologies were determined from a vegetation database collected for management and conservation rather than mapping purposes. This resulted in six distinct vegetation groups, which were mapped through the combination of the NIR spectral band and radiometric indices (NDVI and NDWI) derived from multispectral 2 m-resolution satellite images (Pleiades images). The addition of a LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) layer was also tested. The final classified map of the reserve based only on optical layers had an overall accuracy of 75.5% (Kappa coefficient of 0.71), with varying success between the different vegetation groups. The addition of the DEM slightly decreased map accuracy to 73.6% (Kappa of 0.68). Decreasing the number of records used for map training had detectable negative effects on map accuracy. This study demonstrated that using already existing field observations combined with only a few spectral bands and radiometric indices from multi-temporal multispectral images with a high spatial resolution can be used as a basis to aid in vegetation classification and mapping of saltmarsh habitats, with the goal of monitoring their dynamics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Europe; accuracy assessment; cluster analysis; digital elevation model; environmental gradient; image classification; lidar; NDVI; remote sensing; saltmarsh; satellite data; vegetation mapping; vegetation structure; wetland","Arcachon bay; Multi-temporal image classification; Multispectral data; Phytosociology; Saltmarsh zonation; Southwestern France; Vegetation mapping; Wetland remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079908865"

Flooding is a natural hazard and largely depends on account of natural factors that pose risks to life and property. The Ghaggar river basin causes substantial flooding in the south-east part of Punjab region owing to higher precipitation in Siwalik region and neighbor states which lead to rise in the water level of Ghaggar flood plain. The present study focuses primarily on the mapping of flood inundated area using SAR data during 2019 floods and the impact assessment in the Ghaggar basin. Further, a comprehensive analysis has been carried out by Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) data to investigate the intensity and frequency of precipitation over the basin. Multi-temporal, dual-polarized (VH & VV) Sentinel-1 (SAR) data have been used for mapping the flood inundated area during July to September, 2019. SAR data is very useful and most preferred for detecting flood inundated area in all weather and day/night time. In this study, binarization technique was applied to separate satellite image pixel values into flooded and non-flooded group. Threshold for backscattering coefficient (σ0) between -10 to -18dB has been applied to extract the maximum flood pixels. It was also observed that flood extent was in its peak during July 20 to 23, 2019 and on July 27, 2019 and impacted a large part of agricultural and urban patches during this time. The results have been validated with Radasat-1 image and found an accuracy of 82% in both polarizations. The finding reveals that ~9000 hectares of land have been affected in Patiala and Sangrur districts. The results revealed that paddies were mostly inundated by flooding with low elevation and low slope. From the proposed approach, it is found that the SAR data along with GIS can be used efficiently for mapping of flood inundated area. The resultant maps could be utilized by the government officials, resource managers effectively for damage assessment and relief measures. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

The spatial distribution ofwinterwheat planting areas is closely related to food security; however, mapping winter wheat with time-series finer spatial resolution satellite images across large areas is challenging. This paper explores the potential of combining temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data available via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for mapping winter wheat in Shandong Province, China. First, six phenological median composites of Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI reflectance measures were generated by a temporal aggregation technique according to the winter wheat phenological calendar, which covered seedling, tillering, over-wintering, reviving, jointing-heading and maturing phases, respectively. Then, Random Forest (RF) classifier was used to classify multi-temporal composites but also mono-temporal winter wheat development phases and mono-sensor data. The results showed that winter wheat could be classified with an overall accuracy of 93.4% and F1 measure (the harmonic mean of producer's and user's accuracy) of 0.97 with temporally aggregated Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datawere combined. As our results also revealed, itwas always good to classifymulti-temporal images compared to mono-temporal imagery (the overall accuracy dropped from 93.4% to as low as 76.4%). It was also good to classify Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery combined instead of classifying them individually. The analysis showed among the mono-temporal winter wheat development phases that the maturing phase's and reviving phase's data were more important than the data for other mono-temporal winter wheat development phases. In sum, this study confirmed the importance of using temporally aggregated Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI data combined and identified key winter wheat development phases for accurate winter wheat classification. These results can be useful to benefit on freely available optical satellite data (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and prioritize key winter wheat development phases for accurate mapping winter wheat planting areas across China and elsewhere. © 2020 by the authors.","Decision trees; Food supply; Image classification; Mapping; Accurate mapping; Development phasis; Optical satellites; Overall accuracies; Satellite images; Shandong province; Spatial resolution; Temporal aggregation; Crops","Crop development phase; Google earth engine; Multi-temporal; Temporal aggregation; Winter wheat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088273943"

However, due to technical and budget limitations, current satellite sensors have a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions. No single sensor can simultaneously achieve a fine spatial resolution and a frequent revisit cycle although a large number of remote sensing instruments with different spatial and temporal characteristics have been launched. For example, Landsat sensors have fine spatial resolutions (1560 m) but long revisit frequencies (16 days). By contrast, a moderate resolution imaging spectro-radiometer (MODIS) instrument has a frequent revisit cycle (1 day) but a coarse spatial resolution (2501 000 m). In addition, optical satellite images are frequently contaminated by clouds, cloud shadows, and other atmospheric conditions. These factors limit applications that require data with both high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. Spatio-temporal satellite image fusion is an effective way to solve this problem. Many spatio-temporal fusion methods have been proposed recently. Existing spatio-temporal data fusion methods are mainly divided into the following three categories: weight function-based methods, unmixing-based methods, and dictionary learning-based methods. All of these methods require at least one pair of observed coarse- and fine-resolution images for training and a coarse-resolution image at prediction date as input data. The output of spatio-temporal fusion methods is a synthetic fine-resolution image at prediction date. All spatio-temporal fusion methods use spatial information from the input fine-resolution images and temporal information from the coarse-resolution images. Unfortunately, existing spatio-temporal fusion methods cannot achieve satisfactory results in accurately predicting land-cover type change with only one pair of fine-coarse prior images. Thus, spatio-temporal satellite image-fusion method based on linear model is proposed to improve the prediction capacity and accuracy, especially for complex changed landscapes. Method: The temporal model is assumed to be independent of sensors, and a linear relationship is used to represent the temporal model between images acquired on different dates. Therefore, the spatio-temporal fusion is transformed into estimating parameters of the temporal model. To accurately capture earth surface change during the period between the input and prediction dates, we carefully analyzed the reasons for the temporal change, and then the temporal change was divided into two types: phonological and land cover type. The former is mainly caused by differences in atmospheric condition, solar angle at different dates, and is global and flat. The latter is mainly caused by the change on the surface, and is local and abrupt. Therefore, parameters of the model from global and local perspectives were estimated. To accurately estimate the parameters, we need to search for similar pixels in the local window to ensure that the pixels used for parameter estimation satisfies spectral consistency. Moreover, considering that the land-cover type may change during the period, we find that the spatial distribution of similar pixels may change at different dates. Therefore, a multi-temporal search strategy is introduced to flexibly select appropriate neighboring pixels. Only pixels that have similar spectral information to the target pixel at both base date and prediction date are considered to be similar pixels, which eliminate the block effect of traditional algorithms. After searching similar pixels and solving the temporal model, the input fine resolution image was combined with the temporal model to predict fine image at target date. The aforementioned strategies make our method achieve good prediction results even if the earth surface changed drastically. Result: We compared our model with two popular spatio-temporal fusion models: spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method on two datasets. The experiment results show that our model outperforms all other methods in both datasets. In the first experiment, the dataset constitutes primarily phenological change. Therefore, all three methods achieve satisfactory results and our method achieves the best result. Quantitative comparisons show that our method achieves high correlation coefficient (CC), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and lower root mean square error (RMSE). Compared with STARFM and FSDAF, our method increases CC by 0.25% and 0.28%, PSNR by 0.153 1 dB and 1.379 dB, SSIM by 0.79% and 2.3%, and decreases RMSE by 0.05% and 0.69%. In the second experiment, the dataset has undergone dramatic land-cover type change. Therefore, both STARFM and FSDAF have block effects at different levels visually. In quantitative assessment, compared with STARFM and FSDAF, our method increases CC by 6.64% and 3.26%, PSNR by 2.086 dB and 2.510 7 dB, SSIM by 11.76% and 11.2%, and decreases RMSE by 1.45% and 2.08%. Conclusion: In this study, a spatio-temporal satellite image-fusion method based on linear model is proposed. This method uses a linear model to represent the temporal change. By analyzing the characteristics of the temporal change, the temporal model is constrained from local and global perspectives, and the solved model can represent the temporal change accurately. In addition, the method uses a multi-temporal similar pixel search strategy to search for similar pixels more flexibly, thereby eliminating the block effect of previous methods, fully utilizing spectral information in neighboring similar pixels, and improving the accuracy of prediction results. The experimental results show that in terms of visual comparison, compared with two popular spatiotemporal fusion methods, the proposed method can predict land-cover type change more accurately, and our findings are close to the true image. In the quantitative evaluation, our method improves CC, PSNR, RMSE, SSIM, and other indicators to varying degrees in each band. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

We therefore propose in this paper a more in depth detection and analysis of observable changes. This approach is intended to be generic and independent of the type of satellite used, whether band limited or multispectral. It is based on a global analysis of the sequence. The detection stage is based on the definition of a residual sequence calculated from the novelty filter. A statistical approach based on the NFA test is then employed to detect significant changes. We then use these detections to classify the changes according to their nature: unique or lasting. To establish the efficiency of the method, we created an open dataset of 28 sequences of 20 images acquired by Sentinel-2 in different regions of the world. We obtain satisfactory results which are consistent with the visual observations of experts. © 2021 IEEE","Satellites; Time series analysis; Change analysis; Change detection; Dataset; Dense-time; Image time-series; Multi-spectral; Multi-temporal; Registered images; Satellite images; Times series; Time series","change detection; dataset; multi-temporal; satellite; time series","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129818719"

Forests account for more than 40% of the total land area and have a very rich and diverse vegetation. Monitoring the changes in the vegetation cover is obviously important yet challenging, considering such large varying areas and climatic conditions. A traditional remote sensing technique to monitor the vegetation cover involves the use of optical satellite images. However, in presence of the cloud cover, the analyses done using optical satellite image are not reliable. In such a scenario, radar images are a useful alternative due to the ability of radar pulses in penetrating through the clouds, regardless of day or night. In this study, we have used multi temporal C band satellite images to monitor vegetation cover changes for an area in Dau Tieng and Ben Cat districts of Binh Duong province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. With a collection of 46 images between March 2015 and February 2017, the changes of five land cover types including vegetation loss and replanting in 2017 were analyzed by selecting two cases, using 9 images in the dry season of 3 years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and using all of 46 images to conduct Random Forest classifier with 100, 200, 300 and 500 trees respectively. The result in which the model with nine images and 300 trees gave the best accuracy with an overall accuracy of 98.4% and a Kappa of 0.97. The results demonstrated that using VH polarization, Sentinel-1 gives quite a good accuracy for vegetation cover change. Therefore, Sentinel-1 can also be used to generate reliable land cover maps suitable for different applications. © 2021 Polish Mineral Engineering Society.

In the assessment, planning, and monitoring of forest resources, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) play a critical role. This study used multi - temporal Landsat satellite images to assess changes in forests and other LULC along the Indus River's Bindi Dheraja Sukkar in southern Pakistan. Forest and other LULC were classified using multitemporal Landsat data obtained during the years 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2017. In addition, from the classed maps of 2008 and 2017, forest cover and other LULC change detection maps were created. Ground sample locations and high-resolution Google Earth images were used to verify the final maps. According to the findings, forest area reduced by 17.18 percent with a yearly decline rate of 1.72 percent from 2008 to 2017, whereas agriculture land rose by 26.4 percent with a yearly growth rate of 2.6 percent. With a yearly drop rate of 0.48 percent, the area of water bodies and barren land declined by 4.85 percent and 4.81 percent, respectively.

Stem pests of coniferous plantations quickly took a dominant position, increasing the area of their cells in 5 years by 7.7 times leading to high ecological and economic losses. The available diagnosis of damage to pine trees by visual signs is ineffective. The exponential increase of bark beetle infestation hinders the implementation of costly field campaigns to prevent and mitigate its effects. Remote sensing may help to overcome such limitations as it provides frequent and spatially continuous data on vegetation condition. Using Sentinel-2 images as main input, two models have been developed to test the ability of this data source to test the ability of this data source to monitor the condition and damage of forests by bark beetle. The first approach was based on the selection (segmentation) of the affected areas using the method of automatic object recognition on satellite images, which is based on the pixel-oriented approach and artificial neural networks. And the second was based on the construction of a time trend of vegetation and forest moisture using cloud computing algorithms of Google Earth Engine. The proposed approaches on the example of a test plot of Tobolsk forestry Kamin-Kashirsky district of Volyn region with a total area of 54 ha were presented. The study period was from 2015 to 2020.

The changing of these two factors can be assessed using remote sensing technology. This study was conducted by analysing the Landsat 8 satellite images, soil data of field surveys, laboratory analyses and statistical computations. Soil properties such as soil moisture and soil salinity were estimated using soil moisture index (SMI) and soil salinity index (SSI), respectively. The research combined and integrated the soil data from survey and laboratory with Landsat 8 satellite images to build two multiple regression equations model named the soil pH Index (SpHI). They are based on bare soil and paddy leaf models as the explanatory factors of soil moisture and soil salinity changes. All the computation processes were replicated three times using three different dates of Landsat 8 satellite images to produce the multi-temporal analysis. Soil moisture increased after 30 days, while the salt content was only trace amounts. Both proposed models detected 4.49–7.59 of soil pH, 4.66 in bare soil model and 6.62 in paddy leaf model. During the planting period, the soil pH in bare soil model decreased to 2.12–6.47 while the paddy leaf model increased to 4.49–7.59 with RMSE 1.40 and PRMSE 24% of accuracy. The spatial relationship between soil pH, soil salinity and soil moisture are linear but varied in correlation level from weak, moderate to strong.

Since almost 30% of the global soils are degraded, it is important to study and map them for improving their management and use. We aimed to obtain a Soil Degradation Index (SDI) based on multi-temporal satellite images associated with climate variables, land use, terrain and soil attributes. The study was conducted in a 2598 km2 area in São Paulo State, Brazil, where 1562 soil samples (0–20 cm) were collected and analyzed by conventional methods. Spatial predictions of soil attributes such as clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and soil organic matter (OM) were performed using machine learning algorithms. A collection of 35-year Landsat images was used to obtain a multi-temporal bare soil image, whose spectral bands were used as soil attributes predictors. The maps of clay, CEC, climate variables, terrain attributes and land use were overlaid and the K-means clustering algorithm was applied to obtain five groups, which represented levels of soil degradation (classes from 1 to 5 representing very low to very high soil degradation). The SDI was validated using the predicted map of OM. The highest degradation level obtained in 15% of the area had the lowest OM content. Levels 1 and 4 of SDI were the most representative covering 24% and 23% of the area, respectively. Therefore, satellite images combined with environmental information significantly contributed to the SDI development, which supports decision-making on land use planning and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Climate; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Remote Sensing Technology; Soil; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; rain; bare soil; climate variation; index method; management practice; satellite imagery; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; terrain; Article; cation exchange; climate; environmental management; k means clustering; land use; learning algorithm; prediction; random forest; remote sensing; soil degradation; support vector machine; temperature; Brazil; climate; environment; environmental monitoring; soil","Land use/land cover; Landsat; Remote sensing; Soil degradation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091382230"

Low-cost mitigation measures are common in Nepalese highways, however, they are not even applied sufficiently to control slope instability since the major part of this highway falls still under the category of feeder road, and thus less resources are made available for its maintenance. It is subjected to frequent landslide events in an annual basis, especially during monsoon season. The Gorkha earthquake, 2015 further mobilized substantial hillslope materials and damaged the road in several locations. The aim of this research is to access the dynamic landslide susceptibility considering pre, co and post seismic mass failures. We mapped 5,349 multi-temporal landslides of 15 years (2004–2018), using high resolution satellite images and field data, and grouped them in aforementioned three time periods. Landslide susceptibility was assessed with the application of ‘certainty factor’ (CF). Seventy percent landslides were used for susceptibility modelling and 30% for validation. The obtained results were evaluated by plotting ‘receiver operative characteristic’ (ROC) curves. The CF performed well with the ‘area under curve’ (AUC) 0.820, 0.875 and 0.817 for the success rates, and 0.809, 0.890 and 0.760 for the prediction rates for respective pre, co and post seismic landslide susceptibility. The accuracy for seismic landslide susceptibility was better than pre and post-quake ones. It might be because of the differences on completeness of the landslide inventory, which might have been possibly done better for the single event based co-seismic landslide mapping in comparison with multitemporal inventories in pre and post-quake situations. The results obtained in this study provide insights on dynamic spatial probability of landslide occurrences in the changing condition of triggering agents. This work can be a good contribution to the methodologies for the evaluation of the dynamic landslide hazard and risk, which will further help to design the efficient mitigation measures along the mountain highways. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bagmati; Kathmandu; Nepal; assessment method; coseismic process; Gorkha earthquake 2015; landslide; slope dynamics; slope stability","Certainty factor; Dynamic landslide susceptibility; Gorkha earthquake; Sino-Nepal highway","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095725931"

Radiometric normalization is a fundamental and important preprocessing method for remote sensing applications using SITS due to the radiometric distortion caused by noise between images. Normalizing the subject image based on the reference image is a general strategy when using traditional radiometric normalization methods to normalize multitemporal imagery (usually two or three scenes in different time phases). However, these methods are unsuitable for calibrating SITS because they cannot minimize the radiometric distortion between any pair of images in SITS. The existing relative radiometric normalization methods for SITS are based on linear assumptions, which cannot effectively reduce nonlinear radiometric distortion caused by continuously changing noise in SITS. To overcome this problem and obtain a more accurate SITS, we propose a nonlinear radiometric normalization model (NMAG) for SITS based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Greedy Algorithm (GA). In this method, GA is used to determine the correction order of SITS and calculate the error between the image to be corrected and normalized images, which avoids the selection of a single reference image. ANN is used to obtain the optimal solution of error function, which minimizes the radiometric distortion between different images in SITS. The SITS composed of 21 Landsat-8 images in Tianjin, China, from October 2017 to January 2019 was selected to test the method. We compared NMAG with other two contrast methods (Contrast Method 1 (CM1) and Contrast Method 2 (CM2)), and found that the average root mean square error (µRMSE) of NMAG (497.22) is significantly smaller than those of CM1 (641.39) and CM2 (543.47), and the accuracy of normalized SITS obtained using NMAG increases by 22.4% and 8.5% compared with CM1 and CM2, respectively. These experimental results confirm the effectiveness of NMAG in reducing radiometric distortion caused by continuously changing noise between images in SITS. © 2021 by the authors.

But no detailed information is available about the land-use changes due to aquaculture in comparison with other land use modifications. Hence, the land-use changes and predictions have been explored in India's leading aquaculture region using multitemporal satellite images (1986–2016), spatial techniques, and land change modeling. Agriculture was the largest proportionate land use in the study area and consistently used for aquaculture and buildings. There were no aquaculture farms in 1986; however, their area had expanded to 12,575 ha by 1996 and further increased to 38,564 ha (207%) in 2006. It then reduced in area by 36% in 2016. Agricultural lands have been used for 74%, 66%, and 15% of aquaculture development during 1986–1996, 1996–2006, and 2006–2016, respectively. Scrublands and mudflats have been used for aquaculture growth between 6 and 22% and 1–2% at different periods of our study. Salt pans and mangroves were occasionally used (less than 0.5%) for aquaculture. Dynamic land-use changes have been observed between agriculture and scrublands. The reconversion to agriculture occurred from the aquaculture area by 20 and 51% during 1996–2006 and 2006–2016, respectively. It is predicted that the aquaculture area will further reduce, but agriculture is likely to be used for aquaculture and for buildings, despite the existing ban. Land availability is a major limiting factor; thus, it will pose a significant challenge and lead to conflicts in the future if not planned for now. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","India; Decapoda (Crustacea); Rhizophoraceae; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aquaculture; Markov processes; Agricultural land; Aquaculture growths; Environmental issues; Land availability; Land change modeling; Land-use change; Multi-temporal satellite images; Spatial analysis; future prospect; GIS; land use change; Markov chain; model; resource development; satellite data; satellite imagery; shrimp culture; spatial analysis; Land use","GIS; India; land-use change; Markov land change modeller; satellite data; shrimp (prawn) aquaculture","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102848833"

It is a very important information so that the subsidies will reach the targeted farmers correctly. Manual surveying followed by visual digitization and interpretation are costly, time consuming and very tedious process, which is in contrast to remote sensing-based segmentation classification that is able to identify the relevant cultivated plots of the paddy. Moreover, an object-based image analysis could replace the manual interpretation of the mapping cultivation areas at the plot level. Hence, a deep learning segmentation algorithm is proposed in this work. This semantic segmentation architecture consists of three types of layer, which are convolutional layer, nonlinear activation layer and pooling layers. This architecture is then used to segment the paddy cultivation areas into “Active Paddy Parcel (PA)”, “Miscellaneous paddy parcel (PT)” and “Non-Paddy Areas (N)”. The results show that the proposed segmentation technique returns promising outcome with mean accuracy of 0.896 for a good satellite image condition. Proper handling of satellite data during images preparation is important in order to obtain good results. For future work, an optimal combination of high resolution of optical images with multi-temporal and multi-polarised radar images can be considered to complement the weakness of each modality. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

A total of thirty-six classifications were carried out, based on seven classes: water, building and infrastructure, bare soil, sparse vegetation, grasslands, sparse forest and dense forest. The results showed that the highest overall accuracy was provided for all scenarios by RF (53.03%-93.06%), followed by kNN (49.16%-89.63%), while the lowest classification accuracy was created by SVM (47.86%-86.08%).

Thus, the identification of the main drivers of this process in agricultural landscapes is critical to understand the drivers determining restoration success. A growing number of studies have explored the biophysical and, less often, the socioeconomic drivers of forest regeneration using remote sensing approaches, but have not directly considered the influence of farmers’ decisions in spatial prediction models of forest regeneration. We explored the influence of biophysical and socioeconomic drivers on forest regeneration in a rural landscape of Southeastern Brazil, where native forest cover increased by 7.7%. We evaluated forest regeneration through the analysis of time series of multi-temporal satellite images and socioeconomic information obtained through a Social Survey with 47 landowners, using each farm as the study unit. Natural forest regeneration was mainly favored by lower land suitability for agriculture and higher proximity (lower distances) to forest remnants, as well by higher numbers of land-uses types in the farm and lower economic dependence of landowners from the farm income. Our results emphasize the importance of considering farmers’ decisions on predictive models of natural forest regeneration, which are critically needed to guide the implementation of large-scale forest restoration initiatives in agricultural landscapes. © 2021","","Forest landscape restoration; Forest regrowth; Forest restoration; Large-scale restoration; Second-growth forests; Secondary forests; Tropical forests","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107990449"

Landsat satellite images from 2000, 2010, and 2019 were used to assess the land-use change. Geospatial input data on rainfall, soil type, terrain characteristics, and land cover were employed for soil erosion hazard classification and mapping. Landscape vulnerability was examined on the basis of land-use change, erosion hazard class, and landslide frequency ratio. Then the erodible hazard areas were identified and prioritized at the scale of river distribution zones. The image analysis of Sabaragamuwa Province in Sri Lanka from 2000 to 2019 indicates a significant increase in cropping areas (17.96%) and urban areas (3.07%), whereas less dense forest and dense forest coverage are significantly reduced (14.18% and 6.46%, respectively).

The rock mass and debris of the slope failure formed a landslide dam. The discharge of the dammed lake plus the failure events caused significant socio-economic losses. Many slow-moving areas appeared after the two failure events and potential landslide risk still exists. Retrieving the long-term spatial-temporal pattern of landslide activity can help us to understand and mitigate landslide disasters. However, it is difficult to monitor all movement episodes of some landslides using single satellite dataset and method, due to the different deformation characteristics. Employing multiple radar and optical images may solve this problem. In this study, the Landsat 8, the ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images are used to obtain the surface displacements before the first failure event by using the cross-correlation technique (for Landsat 8 images) and the pixel offset tracking technique. The displacement velocity map after the second failure is derived by the Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) method from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and the Sentinel-1 images. The maximum radar line of sight (LOS) average velocity is 3 m/yr between Jan. 2007 and Feb. 2011, and 12 m/yr between Jul. 2015 and Jul. 2018. From Oct. 2013 to Feb. 2018, the maximum horizontal average velocity is 5.8 m/yr. The movement accelerated from Jul. 2017. A large deformation area appeared on the south of the failed slope after the second failure. The unstable area observed by the MT-InSAR is much larger than that obtained through the field measurements. In the first month after the second failure, the maximum LOS displacements are more than 20 cm. The depletion area and the neighboring zones of the landslide are unstable even one year after the second failure.

Satellite remote sensing data are nowadays essential to perform such task, thanks to their capability to survey disastrous events also in remote and under-monitored regions, with frequent revisit time and accurate spatial resolution. Even though satellite imageries are presently used to analyze several phenomena related to eruptions, automatic methods and synergic exploitation of different sensors are rarely considered. In this work, we have analyzed satellite images coming from both synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors, to study the effusive eruption of Fogo volcano, Cape Verde, which took place between November 2014 and January 2015. In particular, we have exploited multi-sensor images from Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, Landsat-8, and Earth-Observing-1 missions, to retrieve lava flow patterns and volcanic source parameters related to the eruption. The main outcome of our work is the application of a new automatic change detection technique for estimating the lava field and its temporal evolution, combining the SAR intensity and the interferometric SAR coherence. The innovative algorithm is able to take full advantage of the Sentinel-1 mission’s 6-day repeat cycle. Such data are here used for the first time for lava mapping, thereby providing an unprecedented example of using the multi-temporal interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence to automatically monitor lava flow evolution in emergency phase. This new technique, jointly used with optical satellite images, is capable of resolving with spatial and temporal detail the evolution of lava flows.

It is estimated that the massive rockslide of ~ 23 million cubic meter volume containing base rock, deposited ice, and snow got detached from the northern slopes of the Trishul mountain range near Ronti Glacier and created a vertical fall of almost 1700 m before severely impacting the Ronti Gad valley located at 1.5 km downstream of Ronti Glacier snout. The huge detached mass of rock and ice (GLIMS ID: G079733E30381N) swiftly moved downstream through the glaciated valley entraining snow, debris, mud on its way, caused rapid fluidization, created massive water/slush waves, and washed away partially or completely the hydel power projects and bridges in its route. It is estimated that ~ 0.93 Peta Joules of potential energy led to the generation of a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy, good enough to trigger above-mentioned processes. Post-event analysis of high-resolution satellite data shows flood water marks in the valley and on the rock outcrops reaching up to ~ 80–150 m height on the way to Raini Village. The mud and the slush produced through this process led to the formation of a dammed lake and temporarily blocked one of the tributaries of the Rishiganga joining from the northeast. This study provides an insight into the sequence of events as they unfolded, through multi-temporal satellite image analysis, aerial survey, seismological data in conjunction with various other geo-spatial and geo-visualization tools for unraveling the flood event that has happened on February 7, 2021.

In this line, satellite images are useful tools that can assist in obtaining soil information from a synoptic point of view. This study aimed at evaluating how satellite images at different resolutions (spatial, spectral and temporal) can influence the representation of soil variability over time, the percentage of bare soil areas and spatial predictions of soil properties in southeastern Brazil. We used single-date and multi-temporal images (SYSI, Synthetic Soil Images) of bare soil pixels from the Sentinel2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) to conduct this research. Two SYSIs were obtained from images acquired in four years (2016–2019) for each satellite (SYSI S2-MSI and SYSI L8-OLI) and a third SYSI, named SYSI Combined, was obtained by combining the images from both satellites. The single-date images for each satellite was acquired in September, when the influence of clouds was low and bare soil pixels was predominant. Single-date images and SYSIs were compared by means of their spectral patterns and ability to predict topsoil properties (clay, sand, silt, and organic matter contents and soil color) using the Cubist algorithm. We found that the SYSIs outperformed single-date images and that the SYSI Combined and SYSI L8-OLI provided the best prediction performances. The SYSIs also had the highest percentage of areas with bare soil pixels (~30–50%) when compared to the single-date images (~20%). Our results suggest that bare soil images obtained by combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are more important for soil mapping than spatial or spectral resolutions. Soil maps obtained via satellite images are important tools for soil survey, land planning, management and precision agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Brazil; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Forecasting; Photomapping; Pixels; Satellites; Soil surveys; Different resolutions; Multi-temporal image; Multispectral instruments; Operational land imager; Organic matter content; Prediction performance; Spatial informations; Synthetic soil images; bare soil; Landsat; precision agriculture; quantitative analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; soil survey; Soils","Bare soil pixels; Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Spatial resolution; Spectral resolution; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091914235"

Despite its importance to many disciplines, predicting SM continuously, accurately, and inexpensively over a large area is a great challenge due to its dynamic nature controlled mostly by the spatial and temporal variability of these factors. Static environmental covariates, such as those derived from a digital elevation model, are commonly used in digital soil mapping (DSM); these are typically less suitable for predicting dynamic properties. Easily available multi-temporal satellite images show strong promise to capture this variability. The objective of this study was to predict SM from multi-temporal satellite images using a DSM approach. Specifically, we examined the feasibility of using dynamic, static, and combinations of environmental covariates (ECs) to predict SM in the Balikhli_Chay watershed in Iran on four separate dates in June, July, August, and September 2018 coincident with satellite overpass. Cubist and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms (MLAs) were trained for making SM predictions for individual dates, and the data was then compiled without considering the date to create generalized models. The baseline for comparisons were the models developed using only static ECs. For June, July, August, and September, Cubist R2 improvements were 96%, 78%, 185% and 120%, respectively. Using the generalized models, R2 improved by as much as 223% and RMSE decreased by as much as 47% when comparing the best SM prediction model in each month to models developed using only static ECs for that same month using the Cubist model. Similar model improvements were seen for the RF model. The generalized Cubist and RF MLAs performed equally well with concordance of 0.91 and 0.90 for Cubist and RF respectively, and low RMSE of 3.04 and 2.98. The best Cubist and RF MLAs by month were always those developed with dynamic, or satellite-derived, ECs. Based on the variable importance statistics, land surface temperature (LST) was the most important EC. This study showed the strong predictions, and the practical feasibility of using multi-temporal satellite data as a dynamic EC that could help to capture the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture. This approach could likely be extended to other dynamic soil property (e.g., soil temperature). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Balikh River; Decision trees; Forecasting; Land surface temperature; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mapping; Predictive analytics; Satellites; Soil moisture; Topography; Digital elevation model; Digital soil mappings; Dynamic soil properties; Machine learning algorithm (MLAs); Multi-temporal satellite images; Soil moisture predictions; Spatial and temporal variability; Spatial and temporal variation; digital mapping; hydrological cycle; satellite imagery; seasonality; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatiotemporal analysis; topography; Soil surveys","Cubist; Land surface temperature; Landsat 8; Machine learning; Soil moisture; Static and dynamic environmental covariates","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098698966"

A novel image-fusion strategy based on the fast local Laplacian filter is employed to generate a difference index using the complementary information extracted from the change vector analysis and absolute gradient difference of the bitemporal satellite images. The difference index is then segmented into changed and unchanged pixels using a fast level-set method. A novel local outlier method is then applied to the unchanged pixels of the bitemporal images to identify the initial RCSS, which are then scored by a novel unchanged purity index, and the histogram of the scores is used to produce the final RCSS. The RRN between the bitemporal images is achieved by adjusting the subject image to the reference image using orthogonal linear regression on the final RCSS. The proposed method is applied to seven different data sets comprised of bitemporal images acquired by various satellites, including Landsat TM/ETM+, Sentinel 2B, Worldview 2/3, and Aster. The experimental results show that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art RRN methods.

A non-parametric k-NN method has frequently been employed. In Finland, such multi-source NFI (MS-NFI) forest variable estimates for municipalities have been produced eight times. A relatively large variation has been observed between subsequent estimates. In this study, a large-scale evaluation of small-area estimates from an MS-NFI conducted in 2013 was carried out in comparison with pure NFI field data-based estimates and error estimates. The proportion of municipalities with significant differences was larger than expected, e.g. over 10% for the mean volume, which indicates systematic error in the small-area estimates. A multi-temporal data fusion combining MS-NFI estimators from three time points-2011, 2013 and 2015-was tested as a means to improve single time point MS-NFI estimates of the mean volumes of growing stock and of tree species groups. A generalized least squares (GLS) technique and unweighted averaging were tested. The improvement was small but consistent when validated against the NFI field data-based estimates for the municipalities.

Shoreline changes may be a reflection of the degradation of coastal ecosystems because of human activities. Understanding the shoreline dynamics is, therefore, a topic of global concern. Earth observation data, such as multi-temporal satellite images, are an important resource for assessing changes in coastal ecosystems. In this research, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor and map historical shoreline dynamics in the Hangzhou Bay in China where the Qiantang River flows into the East China Sea. Specifically, we aimed to capture and quantify both the spatial and temporal shoreline changes and to assess the link between anthropogenic activities and shoreline changes on the integrity of this coastal area. We implemented a Tasselled Cap analysis (TCA) on Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2018 in GEE to calculate the wetness coefficient. We then applied Otsu method for automatic image thresholding on the wetness coefficient to detect waterbodies and shoreline changes. Further, we adopted the nighttime light data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) from 1992 to 2013 as a proxy of human activities. The results show that in the hotspot areas, the shoreline has moved by more than 5 km in the last decades, accounting for approximately 900 km2 of land accretion. Within this area, the human activity, indicated by the intensity of nighttime light, increased significantly. The results of this work reveal the influence of human activities on the shoreline dynamics and can support policies that promote the sustainable use and conservation of coastal environments. Our methodology can be transferred and applied to other coastal zones in various regions and scaled up to larger areas. © 2020 The Author(s).

Data were comprised of high-spatial-resolution (QUICKBIRD) and moderate spatial resolution (SENTINEL-2) satellite images that allowed for the mapping of areas that were affected by major lithological and morphological changes. PLEIADES tri-stereo and LiDAR DEMs have been quantitatively and qualitatively compared and, although there are artefacts in the smaller structures (e.g., ridges and valleys), there is still a clear consistency between the two DEMs for the larger structures (as the main valleys and ridges). The period between July 2010 and May 2012 showed only minor changes consisting of volcanoclastic sedimentation and some overflows outside the crater. Otherwise, between May 2012 and May 2017, large topographic changes occurred that were related to the emplacement of the 2014 lava flow in the NE part of the Sciara del Fuoco and to the accumulation of a volcaniclastic wedge in the central part of the Sciara del Fuoco. Between 2017 and 2019, minor changes were again detected due to small accumulation next to the crater terrace and the erosion in lower Sciara del Fuoco. © 2020 by the authors.","Geomorphology; Image resolution; Lithology; Optical radar; Stereo image processing; Surveying; Volcanoes; Digital elevation model; Geomorphological evolution; High spatial resolution; Light detection and ranging; Morphological changes; Remote sensing data; Slope dynamics; Topographic changes; Remote sensing","LiDAR DEM; PLÉIADES tri-stereo DEM; Remote sensing volcanoes; Slope dynamics; Topographic change detection; Volcanic geomorphology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080860104"

However, its triggering factors and its diffusion, along with the relationship between active-channel planform dynamics and vertical adjustments, are still quite debated and only few studies are available. This research deals with the active-channel planform changes occurred along the Scrivia River floodplain reach (NW Italy) over the period 1999-2019 and it aims at investigating in detail the ongoing geomorphological processes under the river management perspective. The study is based on a quantitative multitemporal analysis of aerial photographs and satellite images performed in a GIS environment and supported by field surveys. The outcomes revealed a generalized trend of gentle active-channel widening together with widespread bank instability and several (26% of total banks) intense and localized bank retreats involving both the modern floodplain and the recent terrace. In the investigated 20-year period, the active-channel area has increased by 22.7% (from 613.6 to 753.0 ha), its mean width by 25% (from 151.5 to 189.3 m), whereas no relevant length variations have been noticed. These morphological dynamics have been more or less pronounced both at reach scale and over time. The extreme floods occurred in the investigated period can be considered the most important triggering factor of the active-channel planform changes, most probably together with an increase of the reach-scale unit stream power due to changes in the channel geometry occurred over the 20th century. © 2020 by the authors.","Italy; Antennas; Banks (bodies of water); Floods; Aerial Photographs; Channel change; Channel widening; Controlling factors; Morphological dynamics; Multi-temporal analysis; River management; Triggering factors; floodplain; GIS; instability; river management; satellite imagery; Rivers","Channel changes; Channel widening; Controlling factors; Evolutionary trajectories; Italian rivers; River management; Scrivia river","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081746582"

Method: Through the Google Earth Engine platform, Landsat and Sentinel series of remote sensing images were used to extract multi-temporal canopy spectrum data for the broadleaved Korean pine forest (primary forest) and birch-aspen forest (secondary forest), both were in a same succession series in Changbai Mountain. Also we analyzed the seasonal variations of the canopy spectrum characteristics of the two, the seasonal and inter-annual variation of vegetation greenness, and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the inter-annual vegetation greenness variation and the monthly average temperature of the same period from 1985 to 2019. Result: (1) For canopy spectral reflectance of the primary forest, the visible light was higher in leaf-off season than in growing season, while the near-infrared reflectance showed an opposite pattern. In the vigorous growth season (from the end of May to the end of October), the canopy reflectivity of the primary forest and the secondary forest was similar in the visible light band, but the near-infrared band was significantly different, and the secondary forest canopy reflectivity was higher. The phenomenon of ""red valley"", ""green peak"", ""blue valley"" and ""red edge"", the curve form of spectral reflectance in the two vegetation types were evident, and the interannual fluctuation was weaker than that of the secondary forest. (2) The greenness of primary forest and secondary forest showed the same changing trend. It exhibited growth during leaf development in spring and attenuation during leaf fall in autumn. In the non-growing season, the degree of change in vegetation index of the primary forest was relatively stable and greater than that of the secondary forest, indicating that the understory of the secondary forest had high light transmittance. In vigorous growing season, the EVI and S2REP of the secondary forest were larger than those of the original forest, and the physiological activities of the vegetation canopy were more vigorous. Different satellite image data showed consistent performance, and the EVI peak of the secondary forest appeared slightly earlier than the original forest. (3) During the 35-year period from 1985 to 2019, the temperature in the study region had been on the rise, resulting in the increase in both vegetation greenness and the length of growing season; EVI of the primary forest was increasing, with the rate greater in summer than in other seasons. The interannual difference between spring and autumn for enhanced vegetation index was significant. (4) Compared with the primary forest, the interannual variation in EVI of the secondary forest was more correlated with spring temperature. At the beginning of growing season, both forests presented the same pattern that EVI and temperature were positively correlated. During the entire growing season, EVI increased steadily prior to the period when temperature reached a high level. Conclusion: Long-term continuous monitoring and analysis of canopy spectrum changes can effectively reflect the difference in vegetation phenology between the primary forest and the secondary forest. Temperature rise may be one of the important factors causing the greenness of the broadleaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain of northeastern China.

Our findings indicated that: (1) there are general increasing trends of average annual precipitation and temperature for the period between 2009 and 2019, (2) inspection of multi-temporal satellite images between 2003 and 2017 showed rapid urban expansion, mainly through modification of hillslopes for urban development, which is expected to pose critical consequences on slope instability, (3) field investigations attributed rockfall activity to weathered exfoliated granodiorite hillslopes with abundant tension cracks and steep slopes, (4) slope degrees reached 79° with a general slope direction toward the urbanized areas, and (5) the rockfall motion was simulated along six profiles with dynamic urban areas along the termination of each profile, which showed that several blocks along the six profiles can reach the profile termination with medium intensity rockfall activity and kinetic energy ranges between 50 and 80 kj. The reported rockfall motion can threaten lives, houses and infrastructures. Therefore, protective precautions were suggested to prevent and mitigate the impact of rockfall activity along the studied profiles and similar areas in the mountainous western Arabian Peninsula. © 2020, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","","Makkah region; Natural hazards; Precipitation; Remote sensing; Thawr mountain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096041307"

However, a few glaciers have undergone considerable temporally advances or even surged during the mid-19th to 20th century CE. These valley glaciers are mainly located in the Central Andes of Chile and Argentina. The research presented here focuses on the changes of the Cachapoal Glacier in the Southern Central Andes of Chile. Spectacular glacier advances occurred at least three times in historical times, which lead to river blockages and successive lake outburst floods. The glacier advances were reconstructed with a multi-method approach including geomorphological mapping, 10Be cosmogenic exposure dating of moraines, multi-temporal comparison of historical and recent photographs and paintings as well as the interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images and the analysis of early travel reports. The article highlights the diversity of environmental conditions for the formation of glaciers in terms of the topographical and climatic setting and the resulting distinct glacier behavior along the Andes Mountains. It is argued for the Cachapoal Glacier that the glacier advances are intrinsic to the glacier type and may not be necessarily climate-dependent. This is characteristic for avalanche-fed glaciers of which the glacier dynamic is strongly controlled by the topographic setting and sudden inputs of ice and rock avalanches as well as by the specific debris transfer system and hydrological drainage pattern. At the regional level, the fluctuations of the Cachapoal Glacier are compared with glaciers of neighboring mountain ranges in the Southern Central Andes and at the global scale with those of the Karakoram Mountains in High Asia with a similar dynamic glacier behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Andes; Chile; aerial photograph; geomorphological mapping; glacial lake; glacier advance; glacier surge; moraine; outburst; satellite imagery; topography","Cachapoal Glacier; Central Andes; Chile; Debris-covered glaciers; Glacier lake outbursts; Glacier surges; Topography-controlled glacier advances","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092135589"

The proposed index, while being conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, can extract the built-up areas from Landsat7 satellite images efficiently. For Landsat7 satellite imagery, classification performances of the proposed index along with support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and three existing built-up indices have been examined for three study sites of 1° Latitude \times 1^\circ Longitude ( \approx 12\,100~{\mathrm {sq}}\cdot {\mathrm {km}} ) area from three diverse geographical regions in India. The computed value of the M-Statistics for PB1BI is consistently greater than 1.80, indicating a better spectral separability between built-up and nonbuilt-up classes by the index. In order to improve the performance of the built-up indices, this article has suggested a bootstrapping method for threshold estimation in addition to the existing Otsu's method for the same. It has been found that using bootstrapping method instead of Otsu's method for threshold estimation has helped to improve the classification performance of built-up indices up to 17.75% and 40.49% in terms of overall accuracy and kappa ( \kappa ) coefficient, respectively. It has been observed that for the validation set, average overall accuracy (97.45%) and kappa ( \kappa ) coefficient (0.907) of PB1BI for considered study sites are not only significantly higher than existing indices but also comparable with the same of SVM (99.10% and 0.942) and ANN (87.24% and 0.450). This article has also shown that the proposed index provides a stable performance for multitemporal analysis of the study sites and is able to capture growth in built-up region in time horizon. The classification performance of PB1BI has also been verified for Landsat8 imagery across 11 study sites from different continents around the globe, and the results show overall accuracy and \kappa to be consistently more than 90% and 0.75, respectively. For considered study sites, the reported values of average accuracy and \kappa of PB1BI for built-up classification using Landsat8 satellite data are 95.7151% and 0.8843, respectively.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Geographical regions; Neural networks; Satellite imagery; Bootstrapping method; Classification performance; Comparison of performance; Multi-temporal analysis; Overall accuracies; Spectral reflectances; Spectral separability; Threshold estimation; algorithm; artificial neural network; detection method; Landsat; methodology; satellite imagery; support vector machine; Support vector machines","Artificial neural network (ANN); Landsat7; Landsat8; machine learning (ML); support vector machine (SVM); threshold estimation; urban built-up extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099780108"

The research objective is to identify the change information of interest and filter out the irrelevant change information as interference factors. Recently, the rise in deep learning has provided new tools for change detection, which have yielded impressive results. However, the available methods focus mainly on the difference information between multitemporal remote sensing images and lack robustness to pseudochange information. To overcome the lack of resistance in current methods to pseudochanges, in this article, we propose a new method, namely, dual attentive fully convolutional Siamese networks, for change detection in high-resolution images. Through the dual attention mechanism, long-range dependencies are captured to obtain more discriminant feature representations to enhance the recognition performance of the model. Moreover, the imbalanced sample is a serious problem in change detection, i.e., unchanged samples are much more abundant than changed samples, which is one of the main reasons for pseudochanges. We propose the weighted double-margin contrastive loss to address this problem by punishing attention to unchanged feature pairs and increasing attention to changed feature pairs. The experimental results of our method on the change detection dataset and the building change detection dataset demonstrate that compared with other baseline methods, the proposed method realizes maximum improvements of 2.9% and 4.2%, respectively, in the F1 score.

To assess the dynamics of the coastline, multitemporal remote sensing data were used. Shoreline positioning for the historical period of the 1950s was interpreted from archival aerial images (Kazan University Library). 1975 satellite images obtained during the Corona reconnaissance space program KeyHole-9 Hexagon satellite (10.06.1975). For their georeferencing very high-resolution satellite images were used (2019). The maximum errors of georeferencing are less than 3 pixels for both sites. In 2018-2019, field surveys of the shoreline fragments at the Ostolopovsky and the Laishevskoe settlements were carried out in 2020-at Ostolopovo hillfort placement. For field studies, a DJI Phantom 4 drone and GNSS receiver with real-Time kinematic corrections were used. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), as an extension module of the ArcGIS software, was used to quantify shoreline displacement. Shoreline indicators such as linear retreat rate (m/year), shoreline displacement (m) were automatically calculated. A quantitative assessment of the Kuibyshev shoreline transformation makes it possible to evaluate the damage caused to archaeological sites and the risk of their further destruction.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Generally, it involves the analysis of multitemporal remote sensing images of the same sensor or different sensors. The nonnormalizable radiometric differences, which are added due to environmental interferences, could lead to increase the intra-class variability in multitemporal images, and hence, the change detection problem would be nonlinear. To cope with these issues, a novel unsupervised manifold learning based change detection technique is proposed, which discovers the nonlinear structure of data hidden in original space. The proposed framework consists of two processing stages. In the first stage, a novel orthogonal unsupervised discriminant projection (OUDP) based technique is proposed for feature extraction. The orthogonal basis vectors, obtained from OUDP, are able to provide discriminant features. In addition, in the second stage, a novel radial-basis function based clustering is presented, which yields the better clustering than the single clustering approach. Moreover, an extended kernel-weighted OUDP technique is also presented, which improves the performance of OUDP technique. Particularity of the proposed framework resides on following three things. First one is the creation of eigenvector space by using the nonoverlapping blocks of the image. Second one is the extraction of features by exploiting the local neighborhood information around each pixel, this generates clear or spot free change maps. The last one is the RBF stage of clustering technique, which greatly improves the classification of the unchanged and changed pixels. Experimental results on multispectral images of different sensors validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Extraction; Pixels; Remote sensing; Space optics; Clustering approach; Clustering techniques; Environmental interference; Multi-temporal image; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Multispectral images; Orthogonal basis vectors; Radial basis functions; Chemical detection","Change detection; K-means clustering; Multitemporal satellite images; Orthogonal unsupervised discriminant projection (OUDP); Radial basis function (RBF)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103355825"

This study describes a semi-automated, object-based habitat classification method for change detection of tropical forest succession since 1945. The study uses a set of black and white aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images which differ in quality and resolution, to investigate forest successional patterns and their implications for informed ecosystem and land rehabilitation management. For optimized habitat boundary delineation from black and white aerial photographs and panchromatic satellite images, three levels of hierarchical image object primitives were created. The minimum object sizes of 50 m2, 500 m2, and 1000 m2 maximized inter-object and minimized intra-object variability according to the scale of habitat patches and imagery used. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) provided additional Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textural features of segmented objects which helped to incorporate knowledge-based rule-sets into the final habitat classification which was done manually. Results show accuracies for grassland greater than 94%, monoculture plantations were distinguished from natural forest with 95% accuracy, and isolated mature stands of natural forest achieved 75% accuracy. Consideration of multi-date images increased the accuracy of distinguishing between mixed plantations and natural forest as well as between shrubland and young secondary forest. The resulting maps of vegetation structure at five time periods from 1945 to present gave new insights into the ecological processes of secondary forest succession. These include the surprising rapid rate of natural forest regeneration, at an annual rate of 7.7% from 1945 to 2014, and an even faster rate of 11% during a period when hill fires were controlled. The last areas to succeed to forest are those which are still, or at some time have been under exotic mono-cultural plantations. This suggests that long term protection from hill fire would be a better option for assisting natural succession in the landscape than plantations, which are both costly, and act as barriers to natural succession. Overall, with more than 92% mapping accuracy, the method can be adapted for other multi-temporal, multi-sensor studies as it enables inclusion of spatial theories by dividing the satellite image into time-consistent geographic entities according to the scale of target objects and image resolution. The accurate maps of forest cover patches at different successional stages can also help in site specific management of the recovering forest, such as introduction of shrub seedlings to bridge bottlenecks in seed dispersal according to shrub density and dispersal distances for forest birds. Late successional tree species can also be introduced in areas where only early successional species are present after 50 years of succession. © 2018","China; Hong Kong; accuracy assessment; aerial photograph; biodiversity; ecological modeling; habitat restoration; habitat structure; image classification; image resolution; regeneration; restoration ecology; satellite imagery; secondary forest; succession; vegetation mapping","Aerial photograph; Forest succession; Hong Kong; Temporal mapping","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047424453"

This study aims at investigating the long-term forest cover transformation in Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR), Jharkhand, India, using Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite images during 1975–2015. The forest cover was delineated utilizing various keys of visual interpretation techniques. Results: The forest cover was primarily decreased in the north-eastern and north-western parts in PTR. In order to identify the anthropogenic disturbance in the forest reserve, human settlement density was mapped using high-resolution Google Earth imagery. The results showed a positive correlation between human population density and settlement density. Five major affected sites with an outer buffer of 2 km were demarcated in order to deduce the anthropogenic influences in major non-forested sites in PTR. It was observed that the forest change was maximum at site 3 (Ranidah, area 61.06 km2, − 6.47% change) followed by site 2 (Saidup, area 124.38 km2, − 7.65% change), where settlement units were also high (2638 and 2621 settlement units, respectively). At site 1 (Barkheta, area 81.59 km2), − 1.99% change was observed, and at site 4 (Samadh Tola, area 9.15 km2), 1.03% change was observed having moderate settlement units (2422 and 1892 settlement units, respectively). Areas with the low level of human settlements (1038 settlement units) observed the least change, i.e., at site 5 (Netarhat, area 48.52 km2), 0.58% change was observed mainly during the years. Conclusions: The forest cover exhibited an overall decrease of 14.55 km2 (− 1.34% change) with episodic variation during 1975–2015 in PTR, Eastern India. A significant forest disturbance occurred primarily in the north-eastern and north-western parts of PTR along the forest fringe due to the high population and settlement density.

The nature and degree of its impact on natural ecosystems over a long, since 1935, history of its work, varied along with changes in production volumes under different forms of ownership, and the response of ecosystems developed against the background of climate warming. Based on a review of studies carried out in the region, periods with different ratios of technogenic and natural factors in the dynamics of ecosystems are distinguished, which also differ in the methods of their study. In the second half of the 20th century, in the 1970s-1990s, an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions into the atmosphere led to the drying up of larch forests at a distance of up to 120 km southeast of the plant, recorded by aerial photography and forest pathological studies, as well as by a map of the ecosystems state, compiled by Landsat imagery and MSU field research. At the end of the 20th century, after the collapse of the USSR, an interruption in the operation of the plant, which passed from state to private ownership, led to a decrease in production rates and emissions into the atmosphere. This was combined with climate warming, which intensified in the Arctic regions. Complex expeditionary work of Siberian scientists in the first decades of the XXI century, including geochemical and dendrochronological studies, fixed the boundaries of zones of varying degrees of disturbance of ecosystems, but at the same time showed that along with the continuing degradation of vegetation, partial restoration of ecosystems is taking place. At the end of the second decade of the XXI century, Russian and American scientists, based on the processing of large volumes of remote sensing data, based on a multi-temporal analysis of vegetation indices, discovered the ""greening"" of low habitats in the Norilsk region as a result of secondary succession with a complex interaction of technogenic and natural, primarily climatic, factors. © 2021 Lomonosov Moscow State University.

However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001–2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 ± 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 ± 0.05 m and 1.52 ± 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km2 that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years. © 2021 by the authors.

Remote sensing with a large field of view provides us with a potential technique for large-scale crop mapping. However, most of the previous studies have focused on multi-temporal crop mapping, requiring multiple imaging over a period of time, which is impossible in the cloudy season due to the absence of clear atmospheric windows. Recently, with the progress of spaceborne hyperspectral imaging technology, wide-width hyperspectral satellite images, which provide abundant spectral and spatial structure information, have made the precision crop mapping of large areas possible. This paper focuses on deep learning based crop mapping using one-shot hyperspectral satellite imagery, where three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, i.e., 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 3D-CNN models, are applied for end-to-end crop mapping. In addition, a manifold learning based visualization approach, i.e., t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), is introduced to illustrate the discriminative ability of the deep semantic features extracted by the different CNN models. To demonstrate the advantages of one-shot hyperspectral satellite images, an experiment was designed to compare the crop mapping performance of different remote sensing data sources, where both mono-temporal and multi-temporal multispectral images (MSIs) of the same research area were introduced for a systematic comparison. The classification accuracy when using hyperspectral satellite images was found to reach more than 94%, which was much better than that when using mono-temporal MSIs, and was comparable to the result when using multi-temporal MSIs. These findings will be important for the application of hyperspectral data when mapping large-area crop landscapes, and they confirm the potential of CNN models, particularly 3D-CNN models, for crop recognition. © 2021","Convolution; Crops; Deep neural networks; Hyperspectral imaging; Remote sensing; Semantics; Spectroscopy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Agricultural management; Convolutional neural network; Crop mapping; Deep learning; Hyperspectral satellite; Hyperspectral satellite imagery; Multi-temporal; Multispectral images; Neural network modelling; Satellite images; algorithm; crop plant; detection method; economic development; image resolution; multispectral image; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Satellite imagery","Convolutional neural network; Crop mapping; Deep learning; Hyperspectral satellite imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105866347"

This national forest was previously cleared and used for agricultural purposes for an extended period of time according to media reports published between 2007-2015. In order to perform a LU/LC examination, a time series of LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images acquired from 3 dates (25/11/1999, 28/11/2007 and 21/11/2015) were used for image segmentation and LU/LC classification. Furthermore, a CART algorithm and crucial image band ratios, such as MSAVI and NDVI, including mean of image layer bands, were used to improve image classification of degradation of the forest. The information from three thematic layers sampling points that had been derived from visual interpretations was used for CART training, applying and classifying the satellite images into 6 LU/LC classes, namely, (1) dense forest, (2) light forest, (3) bare land, (4) agricultural area, (5) plantation area, and (6) bodies of water on hierarchical image networks. Prior to the deforestation detection analysis, each image scene was classified individually using a CART algorithm. Then, the classified images were synchronized with the main map for performing land use/ land cover changes analysis focused on deforestation using image hierarchical image network by relation to image objects in vertical and horizontal aspects. The results indicated that the forest areas decreased dramatically by 50% from 1999-2007. On the other hand, there was a slight increase in bare land by an area of 38.68 sq.km. The majority of the area was used for farm land according to the report of the Forest Management Office, Khon Kaen province. The vegetation area emerged in the central area surrounding by bare land and agricultural area. In 2007-2015, the vegetation rapidly decreased by 30.89 sq.km., and the area tended to be bare land and agricultural area. © 2021, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

This study aims to investigate the impact of coal mining activities on the changes of tidal flats using remote sensing in Cam Pha, Ha Long, one of the biggest coal basins in Vietnam. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of tidal flats constructed by Landsat satellite images acquired in years 1989, 2001, and 2014 are compared to determine the volume changes. Besides, coal mining activities including coal production, waste rock dump area, and the expansion of open coal mine during the period 1989-2014 are investigated using correspondent Landsat images and the reports from the coal mine companies in the study area. Sediment samples in tidal flats are analyzed to determine the origin of the sediments. As the results, organic matter in the tidal flats is dominant with the concentration of 459 g/kg to 607 g/kg, which is evidence for the impact of coal exploitation on the coastal environment. In addition, the relationship between coal mine activities and tidal flat variation is well observed in this study. © 2021 Polish Mineral Engineering Society.

However, monitoring the frequency and locality of this practice poses a major challenge, as these events are typically unreported. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 imagery for the detection of EOM amendments. Specifically, we investigated the spectral shift resulting from GWC and manure application at two spatial scales, satellite and proximal. At the satellite scale, multispectral Sentinel-2 image pairs were analyzed before and after EOM application to six cultivated fields in the Versailles Plain, France. At the proximal scale, multi-temporal spectral field measurements were taken of experimental plots consisting of 14 total treatments: EOM variety, amendment quantity (15, 30 and 60 t.ha−1 ) and tillage. The Sentinel-2 images showed significant spectral differences before and after EOM application. Exogenous Organic Matter Indices (EOMI) were developed and analyzed for separative performance. The best performing index was EOMI2, using the B4 and B12 Sentinel-2 spectral bands. At the proximal scale, simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, which were created using field measurements, successfully monitored all EOM treatments for three days, except for the buried green waste compost at a rate of 15 t.ha−1. © 2021 by the authors.

However, a drawback to this approach is that it is limited to displacement along the radar line-of-sight direction. An accurate understanding of land subsidence requires estimation of 3D displacement. One solution is to combine observations from multiple sources and directions, such as multi-Temporal SAR images acquired on ascending and descending orbits, with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data. While this approach estimates 3D displacement, other methods do not account for differences in data accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method for estimating 3D land subsidence from multi-Temporal SAR images and GNSS data by using the weighted least squares method. The weights for data sources are calculated from the PSI results and GNSS data. We apply the method to Kansai International Airport, using 13 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ascending images from 2014 to 2018 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 descending images from 2015 to 2018. Root mean squared errors in the east-west, north-south and vertical directions are 6, 13, and 10 mm/year, respectively. These results demonstrate that combining PSI and geodetic results is effective for monitoring land deformation accurately with high spatial resolution. © Authors 2020.

This poses a significant challenge to object-based image analysis (OBIA) owing to the presence of complex spatio-temporal information in the time-series data. This study evaluates object-based land-cover classification in the northern suburbs of Munich using time-series from optical Sentinel data. Using a random forest classifier as the backbone, experiments were designed to analyze the impact of the segmentation scale, features (including spectral and temporal features), categories, frequency, and acquisition timing of optical satellite images. Based on our analyses, the following findings are reported: (1) Optical Sentinel images acquired over four seasons can make a significant contribution to the classification of agricultural areas, even though this contribution varies between spectral bands for the same period. (2) The use of time-series data alleviates the issue of identifying the “optimal” segmentation scale.

In this regard, time-series multi-view high-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details for clearly characterizing NCBAs, but this leads to great heterogeneity and complexity, owing to the high spectral variation, complicated imaging conditions, and different viewing angles. Moreover, to date, the vertical features and time-series information from these images have not been fully exploited for urban change detection. In this paper, our primary objective is to automatically detect the presence of NCBAs, and meanwhile, to investigate the feasibility of identifying their change timing using time-series multi-view ZY-3 high-resolution satellite images. To this aim, we propose an automatic change detection method consisting of three components: 1) firstly, we jointly use planar-vertical features to delineate the NCBAs; 2) object-based temporal correction is subsequently applied to improve the spatiotemporal consistency of the features; and 3) finally, a multi-temporal change detection model is used to simultaneously capture the NCBAs and the change timing. We applied the method on two urban fringe areas of Beijing (7 multi-temporal image sets) and Shanghai (7 multi-temporal image sets), respectively, which are cities that have been experiencing rapid urbanization. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. For both study areas, the F-score values reached nearly 90% in terms of NCBA detection, and with respect to the change timing, the overall accuracies with a one-year tolerance strategy reached around 92%. The joint use of the planar-vertical features and the inclusion of multi-temporal images make the proposed method a promising approach for automatically providing the spatiotemporal information of NCBAs in practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Buildings; Optical resolving power; Satellites; Time series; Urban growth; Change detection; High resolution; Multi-temporal; Multi-views; ZY-3; Feature extraction","Building; Change detection; High-resolution; Multi-temporal; Multi-view; ZY-3","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082744370"

Economic growth resulted in the addition of external water resources from the Tajo River (1979) as part of the National Water Plan (1933). Irrigation water has caused the water table to rise since 1979. Furthermore, water resources have boosted urban touristic expansion, industrial estates, and road infrastructures. This study presents a diagnosis of the official flood hazard maps by applying remote sensing techniques that enable the identification of (i) areas flooded during recent events; and (ii) the possible effects of anthropogenic actions on fluvial processes affecting flooding (land use and land cover change—LULCC). The flooded areas were identified from a multispectral satellite image taken by a sensor on Sentinel-2. A multi-temporal analysis of aerial photographs (1929, 1956, 1981, 2009, and 2017) showing the fluvial and anthropic environment at a detailed scale (1:25,000) was used to define the fluvial geomorphology and the main anthropic alterations on the Rebollos ephemeral stream. Official inputs from geographical information repositories about land use were also gathered (LULC). The result was compared to the official flood hazard maps (SNCZI) and this revealed floodable areas that had not been previously mapped because official maps rely only on the hydraulic method. Finally, all the recent changes that will have increased the disastrous consequences of flooding have been detected, analyzed, and mapped for the study area. © 2021 by the authors.

These performances are superior to those obtained with radar data acquired by Sentinel-1, with F-score deviations of 9% lower on average, and up to 29% (on cork oak/SSC level). Neither the addition of optical radiometric indices, nor the optical and radar combination data provide a significant improvement in performance obtained with Sentinel-2 data. In order to exploit the data obtained, future work would focus on studying the temporal profiles of each type of crop. © 2020 Soc. Francaise de Photogrammetrie et de Teledetection.

The objects of study are landfills and dumps in the Perm Territory, which differed from each other in the types and timing of reclamation work. The state of the vegetation cover on the reclaimed and self-overgrowing objects was compared with the reference plots with naturally formed herbage of zonal meadow vegetation. The process of reclamation of the territory of closed landfills was assessed by the presence and homogeneity of the vegetation layer and by the values of the vegetation index NDVI. To identify the dynamics of changes in the vegetation cover, we used multi-temporal satellite images from the open resources of Google Earth and images in the visible and infrared ranges of the Landsat-5/TM and Landsat-8/OLI satellites.

The reliable and rapid flood maps are the critical parameters in preparing the disaster management plans. This study demonstrated an effective flood mapping framework using freely available multi-temporal Earth Observation (EO) images, including C-band Sentinel-1A & 1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and optical WorldView-3 images, for analyzing the 2018 flood event of Kerala, India. Two Change Detection (CD) techniques, i.e. Ratio Index (RI) and Normalized Change Index (NCI) combined with semi-automatic thresholding are implemented on temporal descending pass SAR images for flood identification. For ascending pass SAR images, the statistical-based thresholding method is implemented. The results indicate that combined use of ascending and descending pass SAR images contributed to a better understanding of flood conditions. It is also inferred that the use of a pre-flood image can enhance flood area estimation and helps in minimizing the overestimation errors. The results also found that NCI outperforms RI for Kerala flood event. Flood area extracted from these techniques is plotted against the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall datasets, which showed a similar trend.

This provides rich spatial details of the objects on the Earth surface, while their spectral discrimination is relatively low. Recently, the increase of the satellite revisit times made it possible to acquire more frequent data coverage for finer classification. In this article, we proposed a novel multitemporal deep fusion network (MDFN) for short-term multitemporal HR images classification. Specifically, a two-branch structure of MDFN is designed, which includes a long short-term memory (LSTM) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The LSTM branch is mainly used to learn the joint expression of different temporal-spectral features. For the CNN branch, the three-dimensional (3-D) convolution is firstly applied along the temporal and spectral dimensions to jointly learn the temporal-spatial and spectral-spatial information, respectively, and then the 2-D convolution is performed along the spatial dimension to further extract the spatial context information. Finally, features generated from the two different branches are fused to obtain the discriminative high-level semantic information for classification. Experimental results carried on two real multitemporal HR remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed MDFN provides better classification performance over the state-of-the-art methods, and it also shows the potentiality to use short-term multitemporal HR images for more accurate land use/land cover mapping. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Brain; Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image fusion; Land use; Long short-term memory; Remote sensing; Satellites; Semantics; Convolutional neural network; Deep feature fusion; Features extraction; Features fusions; Images classification; Land cover classification; Land use/land cover; Land use/land cover  classification; Long short term memory; Multi-temporal image; Spatial resolution; artificial neural network; image classification; image resolution; land cover; land use change; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Image resolution","Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep feature fusion; land use/land cover (LULC) classification; long short term memory (LSTM); multitemporal images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117822737"

However, the mainstream convolutional neural networks based on 2D convolution collapse the time series information. In this study, a 3D fully convolutional neural network (FCN) embedded with a global pooling module and channel attention modules is proposed to extract discriminative spatiotemporal presentations of different types of crops from multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images. Firstly, a novel 3D FCN structure is introduced to replace 2D FCNs as well as to improve current 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by providing a mean to learn distinctive spatiotemporal representations of each crop type from the reshaped multi-temporal images. Secondly, to strengthen the learning significance of the spatiotemporal representations, our approach includes 3D channel attention modules, which regulate the between-channel consistency of the features from the encoder and the decoder, and a 3D global pooling module, which selects the most distinctive features at the top of the encoder. Experiments were conducted using two data sets with different types of crops and time spans. Our results show that our method outperformed in both accuracy and efficiency, several mainstream 2D FCNs as well as a recent 3D CNN designed for crop classification.

Remote sensing technique with the advantages of multi-spatial, multi-spectral, multi-temporal resolution is a promising solution to meet the information requirement. This study proposes an approach of coupling the high-resolution satellite images and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data to observe the variation of Tan An open rocky mine during its lifetime. Five satellite images with the resolution of 0.5 m acquired in 2006, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and two ortho-images with 0.034 m resolution constructed from UAV photos captured in 2019, 2020 are used to make land cover maps. The analysis of land cover changes discovers 3 stages of open-pit mine exploitation consisting of unprompted exploitation, exploiting outbreak and stable exploitation corresponding to the changes in the mine. Besides, two Digital Surface Models (DSM) constructed by UAV photos are compared to calculate the elevation and volume changes. The assessment of the correlation between elevation change and land cover change indicates that the mineral exploitation is in the vertical range from 645 m to 660 m, and the exploitation trend is following the horizontal expansion rather than the deep excavation. Additionally, this experiment results in 79,422 m3 of mineral taken from the mine, and 34,022 m3 of soil used for the restoration within a year from June 2019 to June 2020. © 2020 Polish Mineral Engineering Society.

Cities are suffering from a marked rise in temperature, compared with the surrounding rural areas, this problem occurs in most cities of the world. The reason for their formation is the increasing of human activity in the form of city components, such as buildings and roads that replace green spaces and open spaces. This means that most of these materials have the ability to absorb solar radiation and convert it into heat energy that increases the heat of their environment. Remote sensing technique is used to determine the thermal island through using Landsat satellite images as well as the use of GIS technology in mapping and analysis of spatial variation for thermal island. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated to extract vegetation cover from 2003 to 2018. The land surface temperature is estimated from the thermal band of satellite images for the same period. The change in vegetation cover is linked to the change in land surface temperature to determine the effect of vegetation cover degradation on surface temperature, also to determine the relationship between thermal island and land uses. The values of NDVI was high in 2003 and it ranged from (-0.714 - 0.693); this indicates a high vegetal cover, while its value is decreased to (-0.22 - 0.509) in 2018, pointing out to the significant deterioration of vegetation cover in 15 years. The land surface temperature is increased from (10.93-36.26) in 2003 to (22.62-50.29) in 2018; all this at the expense of converting the green, open and agricultural areas to residential, commercial and industrial uses as well as the large number of random settlements that appeared in Baghdad after 2003. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082088935"

Within this framework, geographic information system, digital shoreline analysis system, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, and multi-temporal satellite images were utilized. The measurement of shoreline displacement was mainly divided into six analysis regions. In digital shoreline analysis system, several statistical parameters such as end point rate, linear regression rate, shoreline change envelope, and net shoreline movement were computed to measure the rates of shoreline displacement in terms of erosion and accretion. The maximum shoreline change between 1975 and 2019 was determined as 556.45 m by shoreline change envelope parameter. The maximum shoreline change was 16.35 m/year by end point rate parameter and 12.91 m/year by linear regression rate parameter. While erosion has been observed in 3rd, 4th and 6th segments, accretion has been observed in other segments. When all the transects were taken into consideration, an accretion observed. The results indicate that there is a decrease in area of the lake. Experiment results show that integrated use of multi-temporal satellite images and statistical parameters are very effective and useful for shoreline change analysis. It is thought that the structures such as irrigation pond and dam that are built on the streams that recharge the lake and average rainfall and average temperature conditions are the main reasons of the fluctuations and changes in the shorelines. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Burdur [Turkey]; Salda Lake; Turkey; digital mapping; experimental study; GIS; precipitation intensity; satellite imagery; shore (nonmarine); spatial analysis; temperature profile","DSAS; GIS; Lake Salda; Landsat; Shoreline change; Spatial analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084038458"

As secondary forests are now more widespread than primary forests, understanding their functioning and role in the biosphere is increasingly important. This includes understanding how they achieve stability, how they accumulate species and build biodiversity and how they cycle nutrients and carbon. This study investigates how we can restore tropical secondary forests to resemble high biomass, highly biodiverse and stable ecosystems seen today only in primary, undisturbed forests. The study used historic aerial photographs and recent high-resolution satellite images from 1945 to 2014 to map forest patches with five age categories, from 14-years to over 70-years, in Hong Kong's degraded tropical landscape. A forest inventory comprising 28 quadrats provided a rare opportunity to relate patterns of species composition at different stages during the succession with topographic and soil characteristics. The topographic variables accounted for 15% of the variance in species abundance, and age of forest stands explained 29%. Species richness rapidly increased after the first 15 years, but was lower in old-growth, than in medium age forest. This is attributed to the inability of late-successional species to disperse into the young forests as the natural dispersal agents (birds, mammals) have been lost. Light-loving pioneers which are unable to tolerate the shade of older forests, cannot regenerate in their own shade, therefore species diversity declines after a few decades. For ecosystem restoration in tropical secondary forests, introduction of late-successional species is necessary to assist natural succession, given the absence of native fauna, seed dispersal agents, and the surrounding altered environment. We also show that remote sensing can play a pivotal role in understanding the recovery and functioning of secondary forest regeneration as its contribution to the biosphere is increasingly important. © 2020","China; Hong Kong; Aves; Mammalia; Antennas; Biodiversity; Biospherics; Conservation; Ecosystems; Mammals; Remote sensing; Restoration; Secondary recovery; Tropics; Ecosystem restoration; Environmental constraints; High resolution satellite images; Late-successional species; Natural forest regenerations; Soil characteristics; Species composition; Tropical secondary forests; abundance; biodiversity; biosphere; carbon cycle; environmental degradation; forest inventory; forest management; landscape; nutrient cycling; restoration ecology; species richness; tropical forest; article; biomass; biosphere; bird; conservation biology; ecosystem regeneration; ecosystem restoration; fauna; forest stand; Hong Kong; landscape; nonhuman; photography; population abundance; satellite imagery; seed dispersal; shade; soil; species composition; species diversity; species richness; tropical rain forest; Reforestation","Biodiversity conservation; Degraded landscape; Environmental constraints; Multi-temporal; Remote sensing; Spatial patterns; Succession: secondary forest; Tropical forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090012421"

Multitemporal land cover can help us to understand the change process of the regional environment and formulate corresponding protection policies. For single-period image classification, the spatial-temporal information is often ignored, and the classification accuracy is difficult to improve. In this paper, an iterative hidden Markov model (STHMM) is proposed to optimize the multitemporal classification, in which a stacked autoencoding classifier is used to calculate the initial class probability, and the extended random walker-based spatial optimization technique is adopted to optimize the class probability.

These activities can result in changes in the existing coastline. Moreover, the city of Surabaya has a reasonably long coastline. This study calculated the speed of shoreline change using remote sensing technology of SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 high- resolution satellite imagery from 2015 to 2019. Calculation of shoreline change speed is assisted by the application of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) using several methods, namely Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE), Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), End Point Rate (EPR), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). Based on data processing and analysis, the longest coastline of Surabaya City was found in 2015 with a length of 69.605 km, and the shortest coastline was in 2019 with a length of 65.759 km. The maximum speed of Surabaya shoreline changes can be identified by using the SCE method (956.590 m), the NSM method (+584.722 m), the EPR (+148.725 m per year), and the LRR (+154.386 m per year). Also, an analysis of land area changes during the 20152019 period resulted in the Kalisari Village experiencing the most significant accretion of 358073.62 m2, while in Keputih Village abrasion of 30189.72 m2.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Data handling; Landforms; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Surveying; Analysis system; Data processing and analysis; High resolution satellite imagery; Human activities; Maximum speed; Multi-temporal satellite images; Remote sensing technology; Shoreline change; Satellite imagery","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104862671"

To calculate the NDVI, surface reflectance from the KOMPSAT-3/3A satellite image was used. Satellite images from four years were used, and the zones where the images overlap was designated as the area of interest (AOI) for the study, and by setting a profile passing through highly vegetated area as a data analysis method, the changes by year were examined. In addition, random points were extracted within the AOI and displayed as a box plot to quantitatively indicate change of NDVI distribution pattern. The main results of this study showed that the NDVI in 2014 was low within AOI in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant, but vegetated area continued to expand until 2021. These results were also confirmed in the change monitoring results shown in a profile or box plot. In disaster areas where access is restricted, such as the Fukushima nuclear power plant area, where it is difficult to collect field data, obtaining land cover classification products with high accuracy using satellite images is challenging, so it is appropriate to analyze them using primary outputs such as vegetation indices obtained from high-resolution satellite imagery. It is necessary to establish an international cooperation system for jointly utilizing satellite images.

In the present study, the changes in LULC were analyzed by means of multi-temporal remote sensing of Qena-Luxor Governorates in Egypt between 1984 and 2018. In order to map and monitor the land use land cover changes, several remotely sensed data were applied to create multi-maps using (1) the normalized difference vegetation index and (2) supervised classification of Landsat images using field chick and accuracy assessment, including field verification and Google Earth Professional. Therefore, the lands in the study area can be classified as follows: (1) agricultural lands, (2) built-up areas, (3) water bodies, (4) reclaimed lands, and (5) desert lands. The results indicate that agricultural lands grew from an average of 1238.7 km2 (9.8%) in 1984 to 1707.04 km2 (13.40%) in 2018 and urban lands increased from 345.2 km2 (2.7%) in 1984 to 445.28 km2 (3.5%) in 2019. Furthermore, the reclaimed lands increased approximately from 4379.7 km2 in 1984 (i.e., 34.4% of the total study area) to 4521.05 km2 in 2000 (35.507%). However, this class was followed by a marked decline to 4373.51 km2 (34.35%) between 2000 and 2010 and then increased to approximately 4442 km2 (34.89%) between 2010 and 2018.

This paper investigated geological and geomorphological features and space-time evolution over a 65-year time span (1954–2019) of a large earthflow, representative of wide sectors of the Apennine chain of southern Italy. The landslide, with a maximum length of 1.85 × 103 m, affects an area of 4.21 × 105 m2 and exhibits two source zones: a narrow and elongated transport zone and a lobate accumulation zone. Spatial and temporal morphological changes of the earthflow were assessed, comparing multi-source and multi-temporal data (aerial photographs, Google Earth satellite images, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) system data). Geomorphic changes, quantified using Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) of differences, highlighted an extensive lowering of the topographic surface in the source area and a significant uplift at the landslide toe. Moreover, the multi-temporal analysis showed a high increase of landslide surface (more than 66%) during the last 65 years. The volumetric analyses showed that different sectors of the earthflow were active at different times, with different rates of topographic change. Overall, the used approach highlighted the great potentiality of the integration of multi-source and multi-temporal data for the diachronic reconstruction of morphological landslide evolution. © 2020 by the authors.

The study area is characterized by the Yanshanian granite that is widespread across southern-eastern China. The urban setting is studied using multitemporal analysis of satellite images, borehole investigations and field surveys. Given the local hydrostratigraphy, a conceptual model was developed to identify the physical and anthropogenic factors that regulate the urban groundwater system. Based on the conceptual model and the data collected from the field or compiled from the literature, the average annual effective recharge is estimated to be 290 mm/year, after the urbanization process. From rural to urban conditions, it is estimated that the effective recharge increased by 170% and sewers intercept at least 23% of the effective recharge.

Despite the development of various methods, quantification of IS on multi-temporal scale is still challenging in complex urban areas due to the mixed pixel problem and the spectral ambiguity between classes. This study aimed at developing an algorithm, named Rule-Based Spectral Unmixing Algorithm (RBSUA), to derive sub-pixel IS fraction at annual scale using a time series of satellite images. A rule-based composite scheme is developed to integrate temporal contextual information into the popular Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to improve the classification of spectrally ambiguous classes. The developed algorithm also encompasses a temporal filtering to derive consistent IS fractions. Evaluation of the algorithm in a complex urban area–the National Capital Region (NCR), India–shows an improved performance in separating spectrally ambiguous classes, particularly IS and soil, and obtaining consistent series of IS fraction. The developed algorithm yielded the accuracy of annual IS fraction between 88% and 91% which is considerably higher than those from the original MESMA (48% to 83%). The application of the RBSUA in the NCR, India, shows that the IS has increased in the study area from the initial value of 377 ± 78 km2 in 1992 to 708 ± 64 km2 in 2017. The results suggested that the developed algorithm was effective in deriving IS at the sub-pixel level and detecting changes at the annual frequency. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","India; Classification (of information); Time series; Annual time series; Complex urban area; Contextual information; Impact on surfaces; Impervious surface; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; National capital regions; Temporal filtering; algorithm; annual variation; heat island; image classification; pixel; satellite imagery; spatial distribution; time series; urbanization; Pixels","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078984990"

Ground-based weather measurements are limited in their ability to fully capture the unpredictable nature of meteorological conditions. However, remotely-sensed satellite imagery can offer crucial information on the atmosphere and the local environment, providing a broader perspective for more accurate PV estimation. This study proposes a novel Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) framework, which integrates meteorological satellite imagery, meteorological elements, and past PV measurements to predict short-term PV power. The performance of the proposed model for solar energy prediction was tested on a solar power plant located in South Korea. Results demonstrated that the DCNN model successfully learned the complex meteorological factors such as cloud motion and solar irradiance by integrating stacked multi-temporal COMS images with ground-based meteorological data and previous PV data as input sources. In addition, we confirmed that the use of multi-temporal, multi-band meteorological satellite image significantly improves the prediction accuracy. These results were confirmed by evaluating the normalized mean absolute error of the solar energy output which indicated the proposed model's effectiveness for short-term PV power predictions. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

The Cyclone Idai, which hit the region in March 2019 with strong winds causing extensive flooding and a massive loss of life, was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the Southern Hemisphere. The aim of this study was to use pre-and post-cyclone Idai Landsat satellite images to analyze temporal changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) across the Sofala Province. Specifically, we aimed—(i) to quantify and map the changes in LULC between 2012 and 2019; (ii) to investigate the correlation between the distance to Idai’s trajectory and the degree of vegetation damage, and (iii) to determine the damage caused by Idai on different LULC. We used Landsat 7 and 8 images (with 30 m resolution) taken during the month of April for the 8-year period. The April Average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the aforementioned period (2012–2018, pre-cyclone) was compared with the values of April 2019 (post-cyclone). The results showed a decreasing trend of the productivity (NDVI 0.5 to 0.8) and an abrupt decrease after the cyclone. The most devastated land use classes were dense vegetation (decreased by 59%), followed by wetland vegetation (−57%) and shrub land (−56%). The least damaged areas were barren land (−23%), barren vegetation (−27%), and grassland and dambos (−27%). The Northeastern, Central and Southern regions of Sofala were the most devastated areas. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between the relative vegetation change activity after Idai (NDVI%) and the distance to Idai’s trajectory was 0.95 (R-square 0.91), suggesting a strong positive linear correlation. Our study also indicated that the LULC type (vegetation physiognomy) might have influenced the degree of LULC damage. This study provides new insights for the management and conservation of natural habitats threatened by climate hazards and human factors and might accelerate ongoing recovery processes in the Sofala Province. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, this study analyzes the effect of radiometric resolution on the radiometric and phenological normalization, which is preprocessing for multi-temporal satellite images.

The unpaired bi-temporal images are spatially aligned using Mode Improved Scale Invariant Feature Transform (M-SIFT) to achieve sub-pixel co-registration accuracy. The surface changes are detected using Guided Image Filter Enhanced Multivariate Alteration Detection (GIF-MAD). The guidance image is extracted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and an operational processing framework is devised to generate change detection map. EPOCH is evaluated with Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images and Landsat multi-temporal images that observe Earth for more than three decades. The procedure is generalized to detect changes using different satellite images over one of our neighboring planet Mars. EPOCH is compared with state-of-the-art techniques, and found to have closest consensus with ground truth data.

In the study, the potential of repeat-pass high resolution PAZ images were investigated. To this aim, both linear backscatter and interferometric results were presented. We used multi-temporal X-band (3.1 cm wavelength) new generation single look complex (SLC) data from Spanish PAZ in single polarization data. PAZ is based on TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X platform to establish a constellation with them to shorten the revisit time and increase data acquisition capacity. We applied two analysis on PAZ data to assess the performance of the satellite images. For the analysis a semi-arid and almost flat region of Central Anatolia was selected. The images are acquired in both ascending and descending orbits. Each pair has 33 days of temporal baselines. Firstly, backscatter analysis was conducted over the region for different land cover classes. Secondly interferometric analysis was applied to determine phase difference and coherence features. As the region has sand dunes, bareland and uncultivated agricultural fields the coherence analysis showed high values, while cultivated fields showed variations of coherence due to different growth of vegetation. Since the region is prone to sinkhole formation the high-resolution PAZ indicated its advantage as determining a sinkhole that has a circle shape. The displacement of ground surface is determined in line of sight direction. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Data acquisition; Interferometry; Orbits; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Agricultural fields; Coherence analysis; Phase difference; Satellite images; Single polarization; Single-look complex datum; Sinkhole formation; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Synthetic aperture radar","Coherence; PAZ; Repeat-pass InSAR; SAR; Subsidence","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091181800"

Within the Congo Basin, substantial deforestation has been quantified over the past years following the recent advancement in remote sensing and GIS applications in forestry research. Satellite images and ground based data are used to map deforestation, forest degradation and disturbances and their corresponding drivers. In Cameroon, recent studies show a general increase in deforestation over the past years. In most forest reserves of the Western Highlands, forest cover loss is basically as a result of rising population of in-situ and nearby settled communities. The Metchie-Ngoum Protection Forest Reserve (PFR) is but one. The study evaluates forest cover changes in the Metchie-Ngoum PFR using remote sensing and ground observations. It was revealed that forest cover though remained relatively stable over the study period (1984–2015), witnessed much degradation resulting to 36.11% estimated secondary forest cover by 1984. Secondary forest also experienced a cumulative loss to clearings/farms and built-up area from 1984 to 2000. The year 2000 was the most alarming. Forest loss is linked to oil palm expansion, increase population and built-up area and settlement related activities like logging. Faced with such rising threat on forest reserves, only a concerted action can guide sustainable forest management and conservation. The study thus recommends the design and implementation of a guided forest conservation policy which gradually applies proper sensitization, frequent visits by eco-guards, less intimidation, participatory forest mapping and the incorporation of forest communities in the sustainable management of forest reserves. © 2018","Cameroon; West Region; Elaeis; Conservation; Deforestation; Geographic information systems; Palm oil; Change detection; Design and implementations; Forest cover loss; Land cover/use; Open-source GIS; Remote sensing and GIS; Sustainable forest management; Sustainable management; detection method; forest cover; GIS; land use change; logging (timber); protected area; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sustainable forestry; temporal analysis; Remote sensing","Change detection; Forest cover loss; Land cover/use; Open source GIS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059345478"

Reduction of water resources and the growth of water intake and reservoirs in the source rivers have severely desiccated the Aral Sea. This study aimed to model the spatiotemporal and surface temperature changes of the Aral Sea in the period 1986–2017 using the Landsat multi-temporal satellite data and remote sensing techniques. Since the desiccation period was accompanied by climate change, hydrological data of source rivers, as well as climate data were collected from meteorological stations near the Aral Sea, to study the causes of changes. To achieve the research objectives, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was selected among the other indices to extract and quantify the water area changes. Land and water surface temperature values were calculated using the thermal bands to examine the surface temperature change, which has rarely been discussed in the literature. The results revealed a significant decrease in the Aral Sea surface area (~ 78%) and a considerable increase in the land surface summertime temperature (~ 12 °C).

Cellular Automata (CA) Markov chain model used to monitor and predict the future land use land cover pattern scenario in a part of Brahmaputra River Basin, India, using land use land cover map derived from multi-temporal satellite images. Land use land cover maps derived from satellite images of Landsat MSS image of 1987 and Landsat TM image of 1997 were used to predict future land use land cover of 2007 using Cellular Automata Markov model. The validity of the Cellular Automata Markov process for projecting future land use and cover changes calculates using various Kappa Indices of Agreement (Kstandard) predicted (results) maps with the reference map (land use land cover map derived from IRS-P6 LISS III image of 2007). The validation shows Kstandard is 0.7928. 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 CA contiguity filters are evaluated to predict LULC in 2007 using 1987 and 1997 LULC maps. Regression analysis have been carried out for both predicted quantity as well as prediction location to established the cellular automata (CA) contiguity filters impacts on predictions results. Correlation established that predicted LULC of 2007 and LULC derived from LISS III Image of 2007 are strongly correlated and they are slightly different to each-other but the quantitative prediction results are same for when 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 CA contiguity filters are evaluated to predict land use land cover. When we look at the quantity of predicted land use land cover of 2007 area statistics are derived by using 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 CA contiguity filters, the predicted area statistics are the same.

However, the enforcement of a nationwide lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can possibly provide a ray of hope. We analyze the lockdown's impact on the water quality status of this stretch using a combination of measured parameters and satellite image derived indices. Class C Water Quality Index estimates of nine stations indicate an improvement of 37% during the lockdown period. The Biological Oxygen Demand and Chemical Oxygen Demand values reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, compared to the pre-lockdown phase, while Faecal Coliform declined by over 40%. Similar analysis of 20 major drains that meet the Yamuna revealed declining effluent loads and discernable improvements in drain contaminant status were ascertained via a hierarchical cluster analysis. Reach-wise suspended particulate matter content, turbidity and algal signatures were derived from multi-temporal Landsat-8 images of prior and ongoing lockdown periods for 117 channel segment zones. These parameters also declined notably within most stretches, although their extents were spatially varied. While the partial/non-operational status of most industries during the lockdown enabled significant reduction in effluent loads and a consequent betterment in the river water quality, its spatial variations and even deterioration in some locations resulted from the largely undiminished inflow of domestic sewage through multiple drains. This study provides an estimate of possible river recovery extents and degree of improvement if deleterious polluting activities and contaminants are regulated properly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rivers; Water Quality; Delhi; India; algae; Coronavirus; Biochemical oxygen demand; C (programming language); Deterioration; Effluents; Hierarchical clustering; Hierarchical systems; Image segmentation; Oxygen; Rivers; Sewage; Wastewater disposal; Water quality; river water; Biological oxygen demand; Measured parameters; River water quality; Satellite images; Similar analysis; Spatial variations; Suspended particulate matters; Water quality indexes; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; coliform bacterium; COVID-19; environmental impact assessment; Landsat; parameterization; respiratory disease; river water; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; water quality; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; chemical oxygen demand; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; fecal coliform; human; industry and industrial phenomena; National Capital Territory of Delhi; pandemic; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; river ecosystem; satellite imagery; sewage; turbidity; water analysis; water contamination; water quality; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; India; river; virus pneumonia; River pollution","Algae signature; Coronavirus pandemic; Environmental pollution; River health; Stream ecological conditions; Turbidity measurement","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088903756"

A main challenge is then to design methods able to leverage the complementarity between the temporal dynamics and the spatial patterns that characterize these data structures. Focusing on land cover classification (or mapping) tasks, the majority of approaches dealing with SITS data only considers the temporal dimension, while the integration of the spatial context is frequently neglected. In this work, we propose an attentive spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network that exploits both spatial and temporal dimensions in SITS. Despite the fact that this neural network model is well suited to deal with spatiooral information, this is the first work that considers it for the analysis of SITS data. Experiments are conducted on two study areas characterized by different land cover landscapes and real-world operational constraints (i.e., limited labeled data due to acquisition costs).

Two oil spills in Ogoniland in 2008/9 were by far the largest in terms of both duration (149 days combined) and magnitude (82,939,170 l combined), but little is understood about the extent of impact of these events because traditional field-based surveys are virtually impossible in this region. In this study, the normalised difference vegetation index, a technique used for measuring plant health, was applied to multi-temporal satellite images to delineate an extensive area of 393 km2 that has experienced vegetation mortality resulting from the oil pollution. These effects persist to present and are exacerbated by continuing subsequent spill events. Independently collected field samples confirmed the high concentrations of hydrocarbon pollutants in the impact area. The extensive tidal river network and mangrove swamps have facilitated the spread of oil, with the delta becoming a sink for the oil that is dispersed but not removed. Over 1 million people live within the area contaminated by oil and have potentially been exposed to pollution through direct and indirect pathways over a prolonged period. The population in the impact area is particularly vulnerable to chronic illness due to its young age structure and pre-existing very low life expectancy. Hence, there is an urgent need to mitigate the impacts of the pollution on environmental and human health. The novelty of this work is that satellite remote sensing allows the impacts of pollution to be monitored across large areas in a geographically remote and challenging environment. The outputs from this study could be used to guide the future spatial targeting of the limited remediation resources that are available, to achieve positive outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Niger Delta; Nigeria; Gas industry; Heavy oil production; Oil spills; Remote sensing; River pollution; Satellites; Vegetation; hydrocarbon; Environmental costs; Environmental damage; Life expectancies; Multi-temporal satellite images; Normalised difference vegetation index; Oil and gas exploration; Satellite remote sensing; Tidal river network; cost analysis; environmental degradation; NDVI; oil spill; pollution exposure; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial data; age distribution; Article; chronic disease; concentration (parameter); ecosystem restoration; environmental health; health status; human; life expectancy; mangrove; mortality; Nigeria; nonhuman; oil spill; plant parameters; priority journal; remote sensing; satellite imagery; swamp; vegetation; water pollution; water sampling; Petroleum prospecting","Exposure; NDVI; Oil spills; Pollution; Spatial impact","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101416573"

The cameras are designed to gather remotely sensed images, which are used to sense things of the earth's surface. Like the cameras on the satellites and the airplanes takes pictures of the different area, allowing us to get every minute detail about it. Now, change detection is the process to identify the changes or differences in various parts of land characteristics at different intervals. This process can be carried by manual observation or by the use of remote sensing software. Because of the rapid urbanization there has been a significant impact on resources and urban environment. But with the use of high quality multi-spatial and multi-temporal remote sensing data, it is quite easy to possibly observe the changes in the urban environment. Therefore, the given study aims to quantify changes in the urban area of Symbiosis University Nagpur, Maharashtra India using Land satellite image. These changes of urbanization are detected by satellite images of Land-Sat MSS in march-2016, march-2018 and may-2020 using a geographic information system (GIS).

Also, it is to assess the drought based on a multi-temporal analysis and trends of the DSI obtained from Terra MODIS satellite images. DSI is a standardized product based on evapotranspiration (ET) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), highlighting the differences over a certain period of time compared to the average. The study areas are located in Romania: three important agricultural lands (Oltenia Plain, Baragan Plain and Banat Plain), which have different environmental characteristics. MODIS products have been used over a period of 19 years (2001–2019) during the vegetation season of the agricultural crops (April–September). The results point out that those agricultural areas from the Baragan Plain and Oltenia Plain were more affected by drought than those from Banat Plain, especially in the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. Also, the drought intensity and the agricultural surfaces affected by drought decreased in the first part of the vegetation season (March–May) and increased in the last part (August–September) in all three study areas analyzed.

However, unlike satellite images acquired in near-real-time over wide areas, there are limited amount of labeled data used for model training. In this article, three kinds of deep learning applications - data augmentation, semisupervised classification, and domain-adapted architecture - were tested in an effort to overcome the limitation of insufficient labeled data. Among the diverse tasks that can be used for classification, rice paddy detection in South Korea was performed for its ability to fully utilize the advantages of deep learning and high spatiotemporal image resolution. In the process of designing each application, the domain knowledge of remote sensing and rice phenology was integrated. Then, all possible combinations of the three applications were examined and evaluated with pixel-based comparisons in various environments and city-level comparisons using national statistics. The results of this article indicated that all combinations of the applications can contribute to increase classification performance, even though the uncertainty involved in imitating or utilizing unlabeled data remains. As the effectiveness of the proposed applications was experimentally confirmed, enhancement in the applicability of deep learning was expected in various remote sensing areas. In particular, the proposed applications would be significant when they are applied to a wide range of study areas and high-resolution images, as they tend to require a large amount of learning data from diverse environments, owing to high intra-class heterogeneity. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","South Korea; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Labeled data; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Classification performance; Data augmentation; High resolution image; Multi-temporal SAR; National statistics; Semi-supervised classification; Spatio-temporal resolution; Spatiotemporal images; image resolution; learning; paddy field; phenology; pixel; rice; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; Deep learning","Data augmentation; data labeling; deep learning; domain adaptation; remote sensing; semisupervised classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095750604"

A long-standing challenge in the remote sensing community is about how to efficiently exploit multiple sources of information and leverage their complementarity, in order to obtain the most out of radar and optical data. In this work, we propose to deal with land cover mapping in an object-based image analysis (OBIA) setting via a deep learning framework designed to leverage the multi-source complementarity provided by radar and optical satellite image time series (SITS). The proposed architecture is based on an extension of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) enriched via a modified attention mechanism capable to fit the specificity of SITS data. Our framework also integrates a pretraining strategy that allows to exploit specific domain knowledge, shaped as hierarchy over the set of land cover classes, to guide the model training. Thorough experimental evaluations, involving several competitive approaches were conducted on two study sites, namely the Reunion island and a part of the Senegalese groundnut basin. Classification results, 79% of global accuracy on the Reunion island and 90% on the Senegalese site, respectively, have demonstrated the suitability of the proposal. © 2020 by the authors.

Data from Landsat images captured in 2009, 2015, and 2018 was employed to analyze and predict the spatial distributions of LULC categories. The Random Forest (RF) was adopted to classify the images into ten different LULC classes. Besides, integration of Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov Neural Network (MLP-NN) with Markov Chain (MC) was applied to predict the future LULC changes in the region based on the change detection over the previous years. For all classified images, overall accuracy (OA) ranged from 77.35% to 84.55% with kappa (K) coefficient index ranging from 0.75 to 0.8. The results revealed that the annual population growth together with social-economic development was regarded as major drives for land conversion in the area. The predicted map showed a significant decrease trend in the forest classes by 2025, accounting for 23 thousand ha. However, residential areas, rubber, and agricultural land classes are predicted to rise to 460 ha, 3,000 ha, and 20,000 ha, respectively. The simulated model and calibrated area data may be a vital contribution to sustainable development efforts of the local based on the dynamics of LULC and future LULC change scenarios. Overall, ascertaining the complex interface related to changes in land use and its major drivers over time provides useful information predict to explore the future trend of LULC changes, establish alternative land-use schemes and serve as guidelines for urban planning policymakers. © Authors 2020.","Agricultural robots; Decision trees; Digital storage; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Economics; Forecasting; Image classification; Land use; Markov chains; Population statistics; Satellite imagery; Agricultural land; Complex interface; Land use/ land covers; Land use/land cover change; Multi layer perceptron; Overall accuracies; Population growth; Residential areas; Multilayer neural networks","Land use/ land cover change; Landsat satellite images; Markov–Chain (MC); Multi-layer perceptron neutral network (MLP-NN); Prediction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100909987"

Mount Khakaborazi and Khakaborazi National Park is situated in this study area. It is the highest peak in Myanmar (19,315 feet or 5,887 meter) always covered with snow all the year round. This park is the most northerly, biggest and highest ecotourism site in Myanmar and Southeast Asia region (3,812 square kilometers). Mountains are among the most fragile environments on the earth. The purpose of this research was to study the environmental situation of mountain environment especially changes of land cover spatially and temporally (1995 and 2019). Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image data with 6 reflective bands, 30 meter spatial resolution is very excellent data source for image classification and mapping. There have four major steps for this image data analysis: image data pre-processing, image classification, accuracy assessment and chage detection analysis. In this analysis, selection of classification algorithm, training areas and post classification was done for smoothening classified image. Editing and checking was applied by using google earth and UTM maps for the validation of result. The result of satellite image analysis showing over 20 percent of vegetation disappeared within 24 years indicated the deforestation of this study area from 1995 to the year 2019. Overall accuracy of classification is estimated over 77 percent. Therefore, remote sensing is an effective method to implement the objective of this research paper. According to this method, estimate the vegetation cover with high accuracy without doing field experiments.

An established approach to map invasive species across large areas is based on the combination of satellite or aerial remote sensing data with ground truth data from fieldwork. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, also referred to as unmanned aerial systems (UAS)) may represent an interesting and low-cost alternative to labor-intensive fieldwork. Despite the increasing use of UAVs in the field of remote sensing in the last years, operational methods to combine UAV and satellite data are still sparse. Here, we present a new methodological framework to estimate the fractional coverage (FC%) of the invasive shrub species Ulex europaeus (common gorse) on Chiloé Island (south-central Chile), based on ultra-high-resolution UAV images and a medium resolution intra-annual time-series of Sentinel-2. Our framework is based on three steps: 1) Land cover classification of the UAV orthoimages, 2) reduce the spatial shift between UAV-based land cover classification maps and Sentinel-2 imagery and 3) identify optimal satellite acquisition dates for estimating the actual distribution of Ulex europaeus. In Step 2 we translate the challenging co-registration task between two datasets with very different spatial resolutions into an (machine learning) optimization problem where the UAV-based land cover classification maps obtained in Step 1 are systematically shifted against the satellite images. Based on several Random Forest (RF) models, an optimal fit between varying land cover fractions and the spectral information of Sentinel-2 is identified to correct the spatial offset between both datasets. Considering the spatial shifts of the UAV orthoimages and using optimally timed Sentinel-2 acquisitions led to a significant improvement for the estimation of the current distribution of Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, we found that the Sentinel-2 acquisition from November (flowering time of Ulex europaeus) was particularly important in distinguishing Ulex europaeus from other plant species. Our mapping results could support local efforts in controlling Ulex europaeus. Furthermore, the proposed workflow should be transferable to other use cases where individual target species that are visually detectable in UAV imagery are considered. These findings confirm and underline the great potential of UAV-based groundtruth data for detecting invasive species. © 2020 The Authors","Chile; Ulex europaeus; aerial survey; angiosperm; invasive species; mapping method; orthophoto; phenology; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shrub; texture; time series analysis; unmanned vehicle; vegetation index","Chile; Co-registration; Invasive species; Plant phenology; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Time-series; UAV texture parameters; UAV vegetation indices; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105550185"

IC island is a 63 km-long barrier and it is limited by the Icapara inlet to the north, and the Cananéia inlet to the south. This system has been affected by intense changes in its morphology since the opening of the Valo Grande artificial channel in 1852 A.D., connecting the nearby Ribeira de Iguape river to the Mar Pequeno lagoon. In this context of anthropogenic disturbance on the coastal systems, the objective of this study is to understand the active mechanisms, both natural and anthropogenic, controlling the morphological changes of the northeastern portion of the IC, from monthly as well as centenary timescales. We analyzed successional addition and erosion of beach ridges using a multi-temporal dataset obtained by Optically Stimulated Luminescence, aerial photos (1962 and 2000), satellite images (1980–2016) and GNSS surveys (2015–2017). The results were compared to climatic (rainfall and waves) data. Northeastward migration rates of the IC ranged from 15.5 m/y, on the GNSS surveys, to 154 m/y, calculated based on OSL rates. Changes on rates on the northeastward inlet migration barrier are related to anthropogenic interference, mainly the Valo Grande opening and climate changes. Sediment accumulation occurred mainly during the summer on the baymouth spits. This depositional scheme is consistent with the highest values of Ribeira de Iguape river flow and the low synergy of waves coming from the South. By contrast, the retrogradation of the coastline occurs in the winter, when the wave power is stronger than in the summer. This seasonal configuration is controlled both by the bidirectional longshore drift and by the fluvial discharge. © 2021 The authors.","","Anthropogenic influence; Beach ridges; El Niño; Optically Stimulated Luminescence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104665081"

The spatial data used for yield forecasting or the delimitation of management zones are very diverse, often of different quality and in different units to each other. For various reasons, approaches to combining geodata are complex, but necessary if all relevant information is to be taken into account. Data fusion with belief structures offers the possibility to link geodata with expert knowledge, to include experiences and beliefs in the process and to maintain the comprehensibility of the framework in contrast to other “black box” models. This study shows the possibility of dividing agricultural land into management zones by combining soil information, relief structures and multi-temporal satellite data using the transferable belief model. It is able to bring in the knowledge and experience of farmers with their fields and can thus offer practical assistance in management measures without taking decisions out of hand. At the same time, the method provides a solution to combine all the valuable spatial data that correlate with crop vitality and yield. For the development of the method, eleven data sets in each possible combination and different model parameters were fused. The most relevant results for the practice and the comprehensibility of the model are presented in this study. The aim of the method is a zoned field map with three classes: “low yield”, “medium yield” and “high yield”. It is shown that not all data are equally relevant for the modelling of yield classes and that the phenology of the plant is of particular importance for the selection of satellite images. The results were validated with yield data and show promising potential for use in precision agriculture. © 2019, The Author(s).","agricultural land; complexity; crop yield; data processing; forecasting method; knowledge; management practice; parameterization; phenology; precision agriculture; satellite data; satellite imagery","Belief theory; Management zones; NDVI; Remote sensing; Segmentation; Transferable belief model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075383630"

High spatial resolution remote sensing images can be used to detect subtle vegetation changes. The major objective of this study was to map and quantify forest vegetation changes in a national scenic location, the Purple Mountains of Nanjing, China, using multi-temporal cross-sensor high spatial resolution satellite images to identify the main drivers of the vegetation changes and provide a reference for sustainable management. We used Quickbird images acquired in 2004, IKONOS images acquired in 2009, and WorldView2 images acquired in 2015. Four pixel-based direct change detection methods including the normalized difference vegetation index difference method, multi-index integrated change analysis (MIICA), principal component analysis, and spectral gradient difference analysis were compared in terms of their change detection performances. Subsequently, the best pixel-based detection method in conjunction with object-oriented image analysis was used to extract subtle forest vegetation changes. An accuracy assessment using the stratified random sampling points was conducted to evaluate the performance of the change detection results. The results showed that the MIICA method was the best pixel-based change detection method. And the object-oriented MIICA with an overall accuracy of 0.907 and a kappa coefficient of 0.846 was superior to the pixel-based MIICA. From 2004 to 2009, areas of vegetation gain mainly occurred around the periphery of the study area, while areas of vegetation loss were observed in the interior and along the boundary of the study area due to construction activities, which contributed to 79% of the total area of vegetation loss. During 2009–2015, the greening initiatives around the construction areas increased the forest vegetation coverage, accounting for 84% of the total area of vegetation gain. In spite of this, vegetation loss occurred in the interior of the Purple Mountains due to infrastructure development that caused conversion from vegetation to impervious areas. We recommend that: (1) a local multi-agency team inspect and assess law enforcement regarding natural resource utilization; and (2) strengthen environmental awareness education. © 2019, The Author(s).","China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Purple Mountain; esthetics; image analysis; infrastructural development; naturalness; pixel; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; vegetation cover","Direct detection method; High spatial resolution satellite images; Object-oriented; Purple Mountains; Vegetation change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065985461"

An experiment on the fusion of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images in agricultural fields was conducted to evaluate the prediction performance. Three representative fusion models, including Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), SParse-representation-based SpatioTemporal reflectance Fusion Model (SPSTFM), and Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), were applied to this comparative experiment. The three spatio-temporal fusion models exhibited different prediction performance in terms of prediction errors and spatial similarity. However, regardless of the model types, the correlation between coarse resolution images acquired on the pair dates and the prediction date was more significant than the difference between the pair dates and the prediction date to improve the prediction performance. In addition, using vegetation index as input for spatio-temporal fusion showed better prediction performance by alleviating error propagation problems, compared with using fused reflectance values in the calculation of vegetation index. These experimental results can be used as basic information for both the selection of optimal image pairs and input types, and the development of an advanced model in spatio-temporal fusion for crop monitoring. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

Single band methods, spectral index methods, classification using machine learning and spectral un-mixing methods are the widely used strategies for surface water mapping from multi-spectral images. Level set theory based algorithms have been successfully employed in image segmentation problems and are proven to be effective. This study presents a hybrid level set theory based segmentation algorithm which is a combination of edge based and region based approaches to detect and delineate surface water bodies in Landsat 8 images. Level set algorithms were applied in combination with Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to further improve the delineation accuracy. Robustness of the proposed approach was established by successfully applying the algorithm to delineate water bodies of different sizes, ranging from 0.5 km2 to 298 km2 in surface area. The proposed algorithm was also compared with established machine learning based delineation methods and found to be faster than the algorithms those produced comparable delineation outputs. As the ground truth was not available for accuracy measurement, the output image of the proposed method was compared with the outputs of the machine learning algorithms using Pearsons correlation co-efficient, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Dice Similarity Index. The proposed algorithm was subsequently applied to multi-temporal Landsat data for water body change detection and analysis. © 2021, International Association of Engineers.

The glacier lake inventory is based on Landsat 7 and 8 (15 m spatial resolution), and Sentinels 2A (10 m spatial resolution) satellite imageries. The data revealed that during the years 2002–2017, the number of glacial lakes increased from 215 to 255.

Detecting and quantifying active mines and reclaimed areas are very important tasks given the effects of surface mining on the environment. In this paper, Landsat imagery for the years 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2017 was used to map the extent of surface mining and reclamation in the Jiu Valley mining area. The satellite images were classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to map land cover classes, including mined areas, and post-classification comparison (PCC) technique to track changes through time. In order to identify and quantify active mines and reclaimed areas of mined areas, we used indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index-2 (MSAVI-2). For the entire area studied, during the period 1988–2017, the extent of surface mining was 6.5%, with peaks in the periods 1988–1998 and 1998–2008, namely, 205.2% and 4.0%, respectively, as a result of the extension of surface exploitation as distinct from that underground. Land cover conversion to mined areas was almost exclusively from agricultural, forest, and pasture. The results show that NDVI estimated the largest surfaces with active mines, reclaimed grassland, and reclaimed woodland, within the mined areas. SAVI and MSAVI-2 estimated larger surfaces classified as reclaimed forest. As a result of the expansion of surface mining areas, the landscape was considerably degraded through mining scars, landscape fragmentation, degradation, and pollution. However, during the past few years, reclamation activity has intensified in the affected areas through the occurrence of spontaneous vegetation, but also through forestation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Mining; Romania; Soil; Hunedoara; Jiu Valley; Romania; Agricultural robots; Forestry; Landforms; Mining; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Landsat imagery; Landscape fragmentation; Multi-temporal; Normalized difference vegetation index; Post-classification comparisons; Satellite images; Support vector machine algorithm; Vegetation index; algorithm; land cover; land reclamation; Landsat; mine; mining; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; support vector machine; vegetation index; agricultural land; Article; case study; controlled study; environmental exploitation; environmental reclamation; forest; grassland; land use; landscape; measurement accuracy; pasture; pollution; reforestation; Romania; satellite imagery; support vector machine; surface mining; vegetation; environmental monitoring; mining; soil; Reclamation","Active mine; Reclaimed area; Satellite images; Spectral mixture analysis; Vegetation index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098731920"

Under global warming, the growth of vegetation is affected by climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall, which have also led to changes in the structure of the timberline and its distribution along the altitudes. In order to observe the trend of timberline in Taiwan under global warming, this study focused on Yushan peaks as study site, which represents the Taiwan's alpine ecosystem, using multi-temporal Landsat 8 satellite images that were acquired in 2013, 2016 and 2019 and meteorological data. The satellite images were atmospherically corrected using the FLAASH and pansharpened using the NNDiffuse technique. The different land cover in Yushan namely forest, low vegetation, bareland, and river were classified using the SVM supervised classification. The changes in the distribution of trees in different periods with the changes in the meteorological data were identified, classified, analysed and compared.

However, the development and validation of these models are more challenging where the monitoring stations are limited, unevenly distributed, and particularly scarce in many developing countries. Alternatively, satellite images allow detecting the multi-temporal flood extent over large horizontal areas with a cost advantage for hydrological calibration and validation. Many approaches have been explored to distinguish floodwater from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data. However, most of the SAR-based flood studies use only intensity bands to detect the water surface. Studies using polarimetric and coherence for flood detection are few because of their complexity. The general objective of this study is to investigate and explore the potential of intensity, polarimetric, and coherence information of SAR Sentinel-1 satellite data to detect flooded areas and enhance the reliability of flood mapping in rural landscapes. This study tested 15 approaches as the combination of intensity bands with textures, polarimetry, and coherence images derived from dual-polarization Single Look Complex (SLC) Sentinel-1 C-band data. Random Forest (RF) model was used to classify these SAR-based image compositions to detect the flood areas. The model Overall accuracies (OA), precision (Producer accuracies - PA), and sensitivity (User accuracies - UA) were used to evaluate the RF classification and contribution of intake SAR-based image components. Results showed that the modest model accuracies were achieved (UA = 75%, PA = 86.9%, OA = 94.3%) when flood image intensity bands were combined with Alpha, Anisotropy, and the co-event coherence images. It was concluded that the use of polarimetric and coherence information can significantly improve the accuracy of flood maps derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Our goal in this study was to assess LUCC in Sardasht related to the Iraq-Iran war in a 22 year period (1976–1998). LUCC of Sardasht city was evaluated using Landsat satellite image time series of MSS and TM data. We classified multi-temporal Landsat imagery using Random Forest classifier, then Land Change Modeler (LCM) was used to change detection and analysis. Change detection results showed that during 1976–1998, 5363.37 ha of forest areas were declined and converted to the croplands, rangelands and built-up areas. The highest decrease of forest areas was in periods of before (1976–1984) and after the war (1988–1993 and 1993–1998), 1331, 1734, and 2066 ha, respectively. While, during the war (1984–1988), only 54 ha decrease has taken place in forest lands of Sardasht. Also, increasing in other land uses during this period was significantly less than other periods. Calculation of annual rate of deforestation showed that the period of 1993–1998, has the highest rate of degradation in forest areas with a rate of −0.45%. While, during and before the war, it was −0.01% and − 0.20%, respectively. With the start of the war, residents of the region migrated to safe areas. The result of this migration was reducing forest conversion to other land uses. Trends in deforestation and forest degradation intensified after the end of the war. The causes of this destruction were destroying regulatory and control infrastructure on forests and natural resources in addition to the return of the inhabitants and an increase in demand for food and agricultural development. Moreover, after the war, the attention of the government was towards supplying the needs of human societies. Therefore, not enough attention was paid to monitoring and controlling over the degradation of natural resources. It is therefore necessary to reduce residents' dependence on natural resources through accurate and detailed planning and to increase their participation in forest conservation. In this regard, conservation programs should be continued strongly. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation; Deforestation; Degradation; Forests; Iran; Iraq; Land Use; Natural Resources; Agricultural robots; Conservation; Decision trees; Deforestation; Image classification; Natural resources; Satellite imagery; Agricultural development; Conservation programs; Control infrastructures; Forest conservation; Land use/cover change; LANDSAT satellite images; Monitoring and controlling; Random forest classifier; Land use","Deforestation; Land change modeler; Land cover change trajectory; Political issues; Sardasht; War","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087330450"

Unfortunately, geospatial data of natural habitats of the GBHs are often outdated, imprecise, and coarse, and need updating for improved management and protection actions. Recent developments in satellite image availability, combined with enhanced machine learning algorithms and computing capacity, enable cost-efficient updating of geospatial information of these already severely fragmented habitats. This study aimed to develop a more accurate method for mapping closed canopy evergreen natural forest (CCEF) of the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) ecoregion in Tanzania and Kenya, and to update the knowledge on its spatial extent, level of fragmentation, and conservation status. We tested 1023 model possibilities stemming from a combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery, spatial texture of S1 and S2, seasonality derived from Landsat-8 time series, and topographic information, using random forest modelling approach. We compared the best CCEF model with existing spatial forest products from the EAM through independent accuracy assessment. Finally, the CCEF model was used to estimate the fragmentation and conservation coverage of the EAM. The CCEF model has moderate accuracy measured in True Skill Statistic (0.57), and it clearly outperforms other similar products from the region. Based on this model, there are about 296,000 ha of Eastern Arc Forests (EAF) left. Furthermore, acknowledging small forest fragments (1-10 ha) implies that the EAFs are more fragmented than previously considered. Currently, the official protection of EAFs is disproportionally targeting well-studied mountain blocks, while less known areas and small fragments are underrepresented in the protected area network. Thus, the generated CCEF model should be used to design updates and more informed and detailed conservation allocation plans to balance this situation. The results highlight that spatial texture of S2, seasonality, and topography are the most important variables describing the EAFs, while spatial texture of S1 increases the model performance slightly. All in all, our work demonstrates that recent developments in Earth observation allows significant enhancements in mapping, which should be utilized in areas with outstanding biodiversity values for better forest and conservation planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forestry; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Textures; Topography; Biodiversity values; Conservation planning; Conservation status; Eastern arc mountains; Geo-spatial informations; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Terrestrial biodiversity; Topographic information; Mapping","Conservation; East Africa; Eastern arc; Forest remote sensing; Machine learning; Multi-sensor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085345764"

Weighted sum analysis was applied to the urbanized area' class and the data available on geologic units, so as to identify areas vulnerable to groundwater contamination. The vegetated areas of São Francisco do Sul and Itapoá have diminished along the 2000's, but recovery measures, such as reforesting and restraint of soil exposure, have been adopted, with 89.61% success. The urban zone has increased 3.36% in the last 28 years. The achieved overall accuracy for the classification was of 79.33% and the Kappa coefficient was 0.69.

Analysis of the LULC revealed a significant built-up growth in an elongated shape preferably on the upland areas. We also observed an increase in vegetation class area which is in fact due to the increased practice of agricultural plantation in low-lying areas and along the river course.

A study on the variation in runoff is ideal to understand the effect of urbanization on the environment. This paper attempts to study the effect of the changing land use scenario on the amount of runoff in Kolkata. The multi-temporal images were downloaded from USGS site and verified with topographical maps of scale 1:50,000 obtained from Survey of India. The runoff curve number is an empirical parameter used for predicting the direct runoff. The widely used NRCS-CN method was used to determine the runoff. Hydrology based mathematical expressions were used for direct conversion from Antecedent Moisture Condition I (dry) to Antecedent Moisture Condition III (wet). The runoff was estimated from the curve number which was determined from land use map of the area over time. It is seen that over the years there has been a considerable change in the land use pattern of the city.

The temporal and spatial evolution of post-earthquake landsliding has become the focus of attention of scholars and the public. The Mianyuan River basin is selected as a case study, and the temporal and spatial evolution trend of post-earthquake landsliding is quantitatively analyzed using multi-temporal satellite images. Methods: Firstly, the satellite images of Landsat 7, SPOT-5, RapidEye and Planet from 2007 to 2018 are collected and preprocessed such as atmospheric correction, ortho-rectification and image cutting, etc. Then, the maximum likelihood method and the random forest algorithm are engaged to automatically detect the landsliding in the Mianyuan River basin using the preprocessed satellite images. Finally, the landslide detection accuracy of the two methods is evaluated by comparing the landslides interpreted manually and the landslides detected automatically.Results: The average recognition accuracy of random forest algorithm is 86.73%, while the average recognition accuracy of maximum likelihood method is 73.11%. The total area of new landslides detected by the random forest algorithm in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 are 0.24, 51.54, 19.25, 7.21, 6.39, 7.35, 3.51, 3.82 km2, respectively.Conclusions: The random forest algorithm method has higher detection accuracy than the maximum likelihood method. The landsliding activity in the study area during the 10 years after the Wenchuan earthquake can be divided into three stages: 2008 to 2011 is the strong activity period, the scale and frequency of landsliding activity are significantly increased than before the earthquake, and the disaster losses are serious; 2012 to 2016 is the moderate activity period, the scale and frequency of landsliding activity gradually decreased, and disaster events occurred occasionally; 2017 to 2018 is the weak activity period, the scale and frequency of landsliding activity decreased significantly. After 2017, disaster events rarely occurred in the study area, but landsliding activity still did not return to the pre-earthquake level. © 2020, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University.

Therefore, this study sought to integrate the cellular automata and Markov chain model using remotely sensed data and geographical information system (GIS) techniques to monitor, map, and detect the spatio-temporal LULC change in Zaria city, Nigeria. Multi-temporal satellite images of 1990, 2005, and 2020 were pre-processed, geo-referenced, and mapped using the supervised maximum likelihood classification to examine the city’s historical land cover (1990–2020). Subsequently, an integrated cellular automata (CA)–Markov model was utilized to model, validate, and simulate the future LULC scenario using the land change modeler (LCM) of IDRISI-TerrSet software. The change detection results revealed an expansion in built-up areas and vegetation of 65.88% and 28.95%, respectively, resulting in barren land losing 63.06% over the last three decades. The predicted LULC maps of 2035 and 2050 indicate that these patterns of barren land changing into built-up areas and vegetation will continue over the next 30 years due to urban growth, reforestation, and development of agricultural activities.

Consequently, lake ice has been included among the Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and there is a need to set up operational monitoring capabilities. Multi-temporal satellite images and publicly available webcam streams are among the viable data sources capable of monitoring lake ice. In this work we investigate machine learning-based image analysis as a tool to determine the spatio-temporal extent of ice on Swiss Alpine lakes as well as the ice-on and ice-off dates, from both multispectral optical satellite images (VIIRS and MODIS) and RGB webcam images. We model lake ice monitoring as a pixel-wise semantic segmentation problem, i.e., each pixel on the lake surface is classified to obtain a spatially explicit map of ice cover. We show experimentally that the proposed system produces consistently good results when tested on data from multiple winters and lakes. Our satellite-based method obtains mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) scores > 93%, for both sensors. It also generalises well across lakes and winters with mIoU scores > 78% and >80% respectively.

Specifically, UHI adversely affects the quality of life of city dwellers in the form of thermal discomfort, resulting in a rise in energy consumption to mitigate the effects of the increase in surface temperature. Therefore, studying the presence, extent, spatial distribution and changes in surface temperature is essential as it could generate meaningful and useful information for sustainable urban planning. This research used four multi-temporal Landsat images covering three decades to examine surface temperature changes and urban heat islands in the Wassa West areas of south-western Ghana. The research was implemented through the application of several mathematical models, remote sensing and GIS techniques to determine land surface temperature variations over the study period. The results of the study showed a consistent rise in surface temperature over the 30-year period. For instance, in 1990, the minimum and maximum surface temperatures were 14.96 °C and 27.17 °C, respectively. In 2020, the minimum and maximum temperatures had increase to 24.22 °C and 31.23 °C, respectively. A consistent decline in the vegetation of the study was equally observed over the period, and this was attributed to the increase in urban settlements and large-scale mining activities in the study area. The results further indicated that low surface temperatures were observed in rural areas with high vegetation, whereas high surface temperature values were consistently observed in areas with impervious surface covers such as mining and urban areas, suggesting the presence of the UHI phenomenon. The study identifies environmentally critical areas in the study areas warranting the urgent attention of society and specific measures that could contribute to reducing the fast increase in surface temperature and mitigate the risk of heat-related conditions has been discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ghana; Wassa West; Western Region; abundance; heat island; heat wave; land surface; public health; satellite imagery; surface temperature; urban area; vegetation dynamics","Impervious surfaces; Land surface temperature; Satellite image; Urban heat island; Vegetation abundance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086734090"

The complexity and disparity of features in remote sensing images bring great difficulties to image registration. We propose a deep learning method based on the Siamese network to address this problem. Unlike traditional methods doing feature extraction and feature matching separately. We pair patches from sensed and reference images, and directly learn the mapping relationship between those image patch pairs and their matching labels. This end-To-end network architecture helps us optimize the entire network, which is what traditional methods lack. Besides, we use the spatial scale convolution layer in the feature extraction network to improve scale variations' adaptability.

Due to limited radiometric sensitivity to forest biomass variation at C-band, basic multitemporal change detection approach was supplemented by spatial texture analysis to separate disturbed forest from intact. The developed technique primarily uses multi-temporal aggregation of orthorectified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery that are acquired before and after the logging operations. The actual change analysis is based on textural features of the log-ratio image calculated using two SAR temporal composites compiled of SAR scenes acquired before and after the logging operations. Multitemporal aggregation and filtering of SAR scenes decreased speckle and made the extracted textural features more prominent. The overall detection accuracy was around 80%, with some underestimation of the area of forest disturbance compared to reference based on optical data. The user’s accuracy for disturbed forest varied from 76.7% to 94.9% depending on the accuracy assessment approach.

A number of requirements are imposed on farmers, including the maintenance of permanent grassland, fallow land or crop diversification. To meet these requirements, the European Union guarantees subsidies, but at the same time fields must be monitored focusing on crop identification. The limitation of field inspection and substituting it with crop recognition using satellite images could increase the effectiveness of this procedure. The application of satellite imagery in automatic detection and identification of dominant crops over a large area seems to be technically and economically sound. The paper discusses the concept and the results of automatic classification based on a Random Forests classifier performed on multitemporal images of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8. A test site was established in a complex agricultural structure with long and narrow parcels in the south-eastern part of Poland. Time-series images acquired during the growing season 2016 were used for multispectral classification in different configurations: for Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 separately and for both sensors integrated. Different Random Forests approaches and post-processing methods were examined based on independent data from farmers' declarations records, reaching the best accuracy of over 90% for crops like winter or spring cereals. Overall accuracy of the classification ranged from 72% to 91% depending on the classification variant.

The random forest algorithm was adopted to identify the typical forest types. Firstly, the area is classified into forest and non-forest types. Secondly, the forest cover was sub-classified into coniferous forest and broad-leaved forest. In the end, eight types of coniferous forests (Cupressus funebris forest, Abies forest, Pinus densata forest, Picea forest, Pinus yunnanensis forest, Larix forest, Pinus armandi forest, Tsuga dumosa forest) were identified within the cover of coniferous forest.

Identifying the Pseudo-Invariant Features (PIF) with invariant or near-invariant radiometric reflectance over a certain period in multi-temporal images is a key to radiometric normalization. This paper proposed a novel method for automatic extraction and optimal selection of PIF. First, the change vectors including brightness, and spectral and spatial domains of bitemporal images were generated. Then, the pixels of each change vector were sorted from the lowest to the highest value, and the majority vote algorithm was used to extract the initial PIF. Finally, the PIF was selected by the iterative linear regression and outlier analysis. Taking two multi-spectral high-resolution Tripesat-2 images acquired on November 27, 2016 and July 18, 2017 as example, two typical regions with different land cover types were selected to test the proposed method. The proposed method was compared with Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) and Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) methods. The applicability of the proposed method was also validated by two WorldView-2 and Landsat OLI images. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of the PIF that extracted within two regions were 98.74% and 98.71%, respectively. The extracted PIF was distributed in the unchanged areas and covered the main land cover types in the images; (2) the linear regression models of the relative radiometric normalization using the PIF extracted by the proposed method were significant (p<0.000 1); (3) the differences in image brightness, spectral domain, and spatial domain were taken into account in this method with less parameters and high operability; (4) compared with MAD and IR-MAD, the proposed method showed a better performance in extraction precision and an significant linear regression model of the relative radiometric normalization; and (5) the proposed method was suitable for other medium- or high-resolution remote sensing images with same bands. © 2021, Science Press.

Comparison of multi-temporal images was made for 13 test sites in various areas of the cryolithozone (north of the European part of Russia, Western Siberia, north of Eastern Siberia, Transbaikal hollows, Central Yakutia, the Far East and Chukotka). In total, a little more than 117,000 lakes are covered by the study. Interpretation of space images is performed with QGIS software complex in automated mode using spectral index NDWI. The analysis of data at most reference sites (9 of 13) revealed negative dynamics both in the area and the number of lakes. The largest changes were recorded for ponds (area up to 5 hectares) – a reduction in the number and area by 12%. Minimal losses were identified for the “very large lakes” group – 6.2 and 3 %, respectively. The increase in average annual air temperatures observed in most reference areas did not cause a widespread increase in the number and total area of thermocarst lakes. Only in 3 sections (Yessei and Verkhneangarsk hollows, Lena river delta), the increase in lake areas was most likely the result of the activation of thermocarst and thermoabrasion processes under conditions of rising average annual air temperature. It was concluded that the connection between the dynamics of lakes and the nature of permafrost rocks is not traced: for both continuous and island distribution, multi-directional changes in the number and area of lakes are characteristic. © 2021, Center of Geodesy, Cartography and SDI, FSBI.

Glacier extraction from satellite images is an essential step in large-scale area change monitoring. However, glacier extraction is usually influenced by cloud cover and seasonal snow, and thus far, there is no effective and automatic method to monitor glacier area change in large regions. In this study, a new method ‘multi-temporal minimum NDSI composite’ is proposed for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow extraction, and the results agree well with the glacier inventory (excluding the debris part), except in Himalayan regions where non-seasonal snow exists widely out of glaciers. This method is also used to estimate the glacier and nonseasonal snow area changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the past 29 years. With this method, we can use abundant Landsat images of summer seasons from continuous years to composite a cloud-free and seasonal snow-free glacial image pixel by pixel. Glacial maps for the whole HMA are produced every 10 years beginning in 1990, so glacier changes are presented in different subregions and periods. The number of images which is used to composite a glacial map in each pixel is also given for uncertainty analysis. According to the results, the clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area in HMA decreased by −0.43 ± 0.19%/a during 1990–2018 but had high temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area decreased rapidly during 1990–2000, slowed down during 2000–2010, and then sped up during 2010–2018.

Changing land use patterns are of great importance in environmental studies and critical for land use management decision-making. Thus, it is important to understand the relationship between the pattern of land use/cover change and its drivers in a region to initiate specific planning and management decisions. The objective of this study was to quantify changes in land use from a case study area in Chalous, Iran and identify geophysical characteristics (e.g., slope, elevation and soil) and socio-economic (e.g., population density, tourist industry, accessibility and land price) elements of the changes. This will help assess the impact on the trends in changing land use in the study area and elsewhere with similar conditions. In this study, multi-temporal satellite images, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and semi-structured interviews were used to evaluate the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes over a 20-year period (1996–2016). Supervised classification based on the maximum likelihood algorithm was used to obtain the land use classes with an overall accuracy of 87%, 92% and 93.50%, and kappa coefficients of 82.87%, 88.66% and 89.98% for 1996, 2006 and 2016, respectively. Change detection analysis also showed that agricultural land was reduced by 11.09% and built up areas were increased by 15.89% over the period of 20 years. The comprehensive evaluation of geophysical and socio-economic driving forces and the local characteristics of farmers indicated that economic factor and the tourist industry mainly contributed to the change from agricultural lands to built-up areas. In addition, a lack support from the government and the agricultural ministry also contributed to these conversions. Thus, investigation of the complexity of socio-ecological relationships and interaction with land use change drivers are necessary for sustainable planning and development and policy decisions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Iran; Chalous; Iran; Mazandaran; agricultural land; algorithm; environmental management; GIS; land use change; landscape evolution; maximum likelihood analysis; policy making; questionnaire survey; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; agricultural land; agricultural worker; algorithm; article; environmental management; geographic information system; government; human; Iran; kappa statistics; maximum likelihood method; population density; satellite imagery; semi structured interview; soil; tourism; urban area; agriculture; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; geographic information system; Iran","Change trend; Driving forces; Environmental management; GIS; Policy making; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080119540"

Remote sensing techniques also represent important tools to achieve this goal. This paper aimed at mapping and analysing LULC changes in the Baer and Al-Bassit region of the Latakia Governorate in Syria. For this goal, 15 multi-temporal Landsat images from the period of 1972–2018 were used, and each image was classified using maximum likelihood algorithm-supervised classification into four categories of land use: forests, agricultural land, water and urban areas. Accuracy assessment of all images was performed; the average value of the overall accuracy of the classification was 89%, and the average value of the Kappa index was 0.85. The area of each land use category was calculated in each LULC map, and each category’s trends over the study period were analysed using linear regression analysis. The forest category was the only group that decreased (by 21.8% between 1972 and 2018), compared to an increase in all other categories over the same period (0.6%, 4.3% and 16.8% for water, urban areas and agricultural land, respectively). This indicates a conversion of forests into agricultural land and urban areas. The results of this study can be used as an efficient tool to manage and improve the Baer and Al-Bassit forests in terms of physiographical and human characteristics; they could also facilitate the creation of a database for LULC changes in this region. © 2021, Scientific Journal of King Faisal University Basic and Applied Sciences.

Along the 350 km long coastline, the diversity of environmental conditions induces various tidal flats with different characteristics. This study applies the waterline method for multi-temporal satellite images to build Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of tidal flats during the last 25 years. 117 Landsat images acquired with TM, ETM+, and OLI have been processed to construct tidal flat DEMs in 1989, 2000, and 2014. Waterlines extracted from single spectral bands (near-infrared [NIR], short wave infrared [SWIR]) or band ratios (normalized difference water index [NDWI], normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], Green/SWIR) of the Landsat data have been compared with waterlines digitalized on Spot, Aster and Worldview 2 images. This experiment allows us to determine the best band (or band ratio) for extracting waterlines depending on local conditions. Consequently, the study shows that the Green/SWIR ratio image is a good solution for extracting waterlines in the black coal tidal flats of Cam Pha. However, the NDWI index appears to be a better choice for the other parts of the study area. The vertical accuracy of the tidal flat DEMs reaches 0.144 m. The change analysis of the DEMs also emphasizes the tidal flat evolution in both vertical and horizontal dimensions, i.e. erosion or accretion. The erosion of the tidal flats along the northern coast of Vietnam is particularly developed in the area extending from Yen Hung to Mong Cai, especially in Mong Cai with an amount of about 50 × 106 m3 of sediments lost between 1989 and 2014. On the contrary, the tidal flats in the south of the study area show a high rate of deposition due to the sediments fed by Red and Thai Binh rivers. About 35 × 106 m3 of sediments deposited in the tidal flat surrounding the Red River mouth between 1989 and 2014.

The basic aim of this study was to assess the impact of land use land cover (LULC) change on soil physico-chemical properties and nutrients loss under different land use/land cover changes within Miandam watershed of Swat valley, Pakistan. The study area was divided into three major types on the basis LULC type (Dense forest, Moderate forest and Agriculture land). A total of 81 soil samples were collected from the study area (27 from each land use) through stratified random sampling and were transferred to the laboratory. The prepared soil samples were then tested for various physico-chemical properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, contents of organic matter, organic carbon, sand, silt, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, copper and zinc. Results showed that LULC significantly affected all soil parameters except electrical conductivity and potassium. For all the nutrients assessed, the enrichment ratio was greater than 1 which showed that the most fertile layer of the soil in the cropped areas was transported through soil erosion. In this study, time-series satellite images were used to determine the spatiotemporal changes in the LULC of Miandam valley of Swat, Pakistan, and the possible effect of LULC on soil properties was reported. The information generated on the soil properties as indicators of soil health could be used to inform the stakeholders about the effect of LULC change in the study area. Multi-temporal image acquired by Landsat sensors for the year 2018 was used for quantifying changes in the study area. The Landsat images for the year 2018 were classified into six land cover/land use classes. The increase in agricultural activities caused an increase in the land farming areas which led to an increase in the rate of deforestation in the valley. Thus, the present study results reveal that the use of the soil for agriculture instead of keeping them naturally or in other words changes in the land use land cover affects the soil physico-chemical properties and the overall nutrients availability. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Unfortunately, the forest-loss in this country is quite big, especially in Kalimantan and Sumatera. Therefore, a robust method for deforestation method has to be developed to monitor deforestation to minimize the forest-loss in this country. In this paper, we proposed a method for deforestation detection called Multitemporal Deforestation Detection (MDD). The basic idea of this method is to utilize the difference of reflectance values on the target image and original image. Band selection was used to select bands in developing the algorithm. To improve the accuracy of the results, NDVI and dNBR were combined to the algorithm. As a result, the MDD can detect deforestation from forest to heterogeneous land cover such as open land, land clearing for plantation, urban, road and small road, and burnt area accurately. The advantage of the MDD is that it does not interfere cloud and cloud shadow on the original image. As it is an automatic algorithm, it can support in detecting deforestation for a big dataset. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Over the past few years, owing to its powerful learning and expression ability, deep learning has been widely applied in the general field of image processing and has demonstrated remarkable potentials in performing change detection in images. However, a majority of the existing deep learning-based change detection mechanisms are modified from single-image semantic segmentation algorithms, without considering the temporal information contained within the images, thereby not always appropriate for real-world change detection. This paper proposes a High-Resolution Triplet Network (HRTNet) framework, including a dynamic inception module, to tackle such shortcomings in change detection. First, a novel triplet input network is introduced, which is capable of learning bi-temporal image features, extracting the temporal information reflecting the difference between images over time. Then, a network is employed to extract high-resolution image features, ensuring the learned features preserving high-resolution characteristics with minimal reduction of information. The paper also proposes a novel dynamic inception module, which helps improve the feature expression ability of HRTNet, enriching the multi-scale information of the features extracted. Finally, the distances between feature pairs are measured to generate a high-precision change map. The effectiveness and robustness of HRTNet are verified on three popular high-resolution remote sensing image datasets. Systematic experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Changes in the temperature, volume, pressure of the reservoir can culminate in surface deformation and in seismicity at the reservoir edges and/or near the production wells. Identifying the origin of the ground response enables controlled management of the reservoir and can help prevent damage to structures. Satellite remote sensing (InSAR) permits the study of the deformation at these sites with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, Central America has a dynamic atmosphere with considerable water vapour and constant growth of vegetation all year long, which leads to decorrelation between SAR images. Here we study the Dr. Alfredo Mainieri Protti geothermal field, located near Miravalles Volcano in the Northern Costa Rica volcanic arc. We measure the deformation associated with geothermal energy production using data from two satellites (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) between January 2015 and January 2017. The ALOS-2 data was used to obtain the extent of the affected area, and two StaMPS multi-temporal methods (Persistent Scatter (PS) InSAR, and Small Baselines(SB)) were applied to the Sentinel-1 data, to obtain the temporal pattern of the ground displacements. Results show a direct response of the ground to the extraction of fluids. The pattern of deformation obtained with ALOS-2 is spatially correlated with the geothermal field, and with the recorded seismicity. Between April 2015 to October 2016, periods of uplift and subsidence were observed with values between ~2.0 to 3.0 cm every 120 days, linked to changes in the amount of fluids extracted from the reservoir. The results also show the ability of the reservoir to recover rapidly following a decrease in extraction rate. This work has shown that even in this tropical region it is possible to monitor anthropogenic ground motion using InSAR. This is beneficial for the Central American region, as satellite images are becoming more frequently acquired and available, and can be used to boost the monitoring of seismic regions, volcanic activity and anthropogenic activities. © 2020","Costa Rica; Satellites; Trachinotus falcatus; Varanidae; Deformation; Extraction; Geothermal power plants; Indium compounds; Remote sensing; Reservoir management; Satellites; Seismology; Synthetic aperture radar; Volcanoes; Anthropogenic activity; Ground deformations; Ground displacement; Satellite remote sensing; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Surface deformation; Temporal pattern; Volcanic activities; ALOS; baseline conditions; caldera; deformation; geothermal energy; hydrocarbon reservoir; response analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis; Geothermal fields","Deformation time-series; Geothermal production; InSAR; Persistent scattering; Small baselines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096162443"

However, most of segmentation of land dataset were constructed based on various satellite images and samples that lack the number and diversity of existing datasets. These problems have brought challenges to the improvement and application of CNN based land parcel segmentation methods. This paper presented a large-scale high-resolution land dataset based on CNN analysis.

However, extracting urban boundaries from satellite images is still a great challenge, especially at a global scale and a fine resolution. In this study, we developed an automatic delineation framework to generate a multi-temporal dataset of global urban boundaries (GUB) using 30 m global artificial impervious area (GAIA) data. First, we delineated an initial urban boundary by filling inner non-urban areas of each city. A kernel density estimation approach and cellular-automata based urban growth modeling were jointly used in this step. Second, we improved the initial urban boundaries around urban fringe areas, using a morphological approach by dilating and eroding the derived urban extent. We implemented this delineation on the Google Earth Engine platform and generated a 30 m resolution global urban boundary dataset in seven representative years (i.e. 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018). Our extracted urban boundaries show a good agreement with results derived from nighttime light data and human interpretation, and they can well delineate the urban extent of cities when compared with high-resolution Google Earth images. The total area of 65 582 GUBs, each of which exceeds 1 km2, is 809 664 km2 in 2018. The impervious surface areas account for approximately 60% of the total. From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of impervious areas in delineated boundaries increased from 53% to 60%, suggesting a compact urban growth over the past decades. We found that the United States has the highest per capita urban area (i.e. more than 900 m2) among the top 10 most urbanized nations in 2018. This dataset provides a physical boundary of urban areas that can be used to study the impact of urbanization on food security, biodiversity, climate change, and urban health.

Usually, geological hazards caused by strong earthquakes will significantly increase and continue for a considerable period of time before they recover to the pre-earthquake level. Therefore, studying the evolution characteristics of landslides triggered by earthquake is particularly important for the prevention of geological disaster. In this paper, a 66km2 region in Yingxiu near the epicenter of the 2008 MS8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, which was strongly disturbed by the earthquake, was investigated. Firstly, one high-resolution satellite image before the earthquake(April, 2005)and five high-resolution satellite images after the earthquake(June, 2008; April, 2011; April, 2013; May, 2015; May, 2017)were used to interpret and catalog multi-temporal landslide inventories. Secondly, seven primary factors were analyzed in the GIS platform, including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, stratum, lithology, and the distance from the nearest water system and the distance from seismogenic faults. Finally, the evolution of the landslide triggered by earthquake in this region was analyzed by comparing the landslide activity intensity in different periods, using the methods of correlation analysis, regression analysis, and single-factor statistical analysis. It was found that the total area of landslides in the study region decreased sharply from 2008 to 2017, with the area of the co-seismic landslide reducing from 21.41km2 to 1.33km2. This indicates that the magnitude of the landslides has recovered or is close to the pre-earthquake level. Moreover, correlation analysis shows that the elevation has a strong positive correlation with the distance from the nearest water system, and a weak positive correlation with the area. Meanwhile, there is a weak negative correlation between the distance from the nearest water system and the distance from seismogenic faults. Overall, the degree of landslide activity in the study region decreased over time, as well as the number of reactivated landslides and new landslides. The region where the area of earthquake triggered landslides decreased mainly concentrated at an elevation of 1000m to 2100m, a slope of 30° to 55°, an aspect of 40° to 180°, and a curvature of -2 to 2. In addition, the lithology of the Pengguan complex in the Yingxiu study region is more conducive to the occurrence of landslides, while the sedimentary rock is more conducive to the landslide recovery. When the distance from the nearest water system is more than 1600m, the effect of the water system on the landslides gradually decreases. Also, the landslides triggered by Wenchuan earthquake in this area have the characteristics of the hanging wall effect, which means, the number of landslides in the northwestern region is much higher than that in the southeast side. © 2020, Editorial Office of Seismology and Geology.

Since 2013, the Landsat 7 mission has been affected by a well-known issue related to the malfunctioning of the Scan Line Corrector producing very characteristic strips of missing data in the imagery bands. Within the vast and interdisciplinary image reconstruction application field, many works have been presented in the last few decades to tackle the specific Landsat 7 gap-filling problem. This work proposes another contribution in this field presenting an original procedure based on a variational image segmentation model coupled with radiometric analysis to reconstruct damaged images acquired in a multi-temporal scenario, typical in satellite remote sensing. The key idea is to exploit some specific features of the Mumford–Shah variational model for image segmentation in order to ease the detection of homogeneous regions which will then be used to form a set of coherent data necessary for the radiometric reconstruction of damaged regions. Two reconstruction approaches are presented and applied to SLC-off Landsat 7 data. One approach is based on the well-known histogram matching transformation, the other approach is based on eigendecomposition of the bands covariance matrix and on the sampling from Gaussian distributions. The performance of the procedure is assessed by application to artificially damaged images for self-validation testing. Both of the proposed reconstruction approaches had led to remarkable results. An application to very high resolution WorldView-3 data shows how the procedure based on variational segmentation allows an effective reconstruction of images presenting a great level of geometric complexity. © 2021 by the authors.

To study the variation of surface temperature in the Yulong Snow Mountain area, a quantitative analysis method based on a three-dimensional (3D) surface temperature field is proposed in this paper. The digital surface model is constructed using high-resolution stereo mapping satellite images to provide accurate 3D terrain reference. Multi-temporal thermal infrared satellite image data are used to invert the surface temperature field model to provide a basis for the change of surface temperature. The digital surface model is combined with the multi-temporal surface temperature field model to analyze the spatio-temporal variation of surface temperature in detail. Based on Landsat satellite images acquired by same season from 1987 to 2018, a digital surface model is constructed by inversion of surface temperature and 3D images of the ZY3 satellite. The fourth order temperature interval was used to analyze the surface temperature variation in the Yulong Snow Mountain. The low temperature area and the sub-low temperature area are shrinking with a speed of 2.096 km2/a and 2.662 km2/a, respectively. The medium temperature area and the warm temperature area are expanding with a speed of 2.902 km2/a and 1.703 km2/a within the experimental area in recent years. The multi-temporal surface temperature changes in the Yulong Snow Mountain area are analyzed. The results show that the climate is warming around the Yulong Snow Mountain area, and could provide reference for global ecological environment change. © 2021 Science Press.

Demarcation and analyses of spatio-temporal characteristics of the urban bodies is one of the important criteria for their future planning and providing basic as well as specific amenities. To fulfil this, a systematic analysis of land use and land cover of different urban areas is required, which has not been done in the Indian context. So, the main aim of this paper is to calculate the built-up area and analysis of the trend of development of some major cities in West Bengal with the help of multi-temporal satellite images. After collecting freely available satellite images from the USGS, different types of remote sensing indices (RSI) have been calculated, namely, Normalised Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI) and Built-Up Index (BUI). Results show that the growths of built-up area were in unplanned manner and with resultant growth occurred due to a particular factor. In case of Kolkata, horizontal integration of this area is less than vertical integration, and new built-up area is extended towards the Salt Lake-Newtown. On the other hand, Durgapur city was spreading towards the western side, and it is expected that within a few years’ time, the span of the cities of Durgapur, Raniganj and Asansol will be expanding like the earlier cities. The huge growth was also noticed in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation area in the last decade. It is expected that this expansion may lead to create different socio-economic and environmental problems like distribution of basic amenities, public place i.e. parks, retail, transit, freshwater supply, etc. across the cities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","BUI; Built-up area; EBBI; NDBI; NDVI; Trend analysis; Urbanisation","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093982921"

For that, not only remote sensing images are needed, but also ground truth information, which is a key factor for the development and improvement of methodologies using remote sensing data. While a variety of images are current available, inclusive cost-free images, field reference data is scarcer. For agricultural applications, especially in tropical regions such as Brazil, where the agriculture is very dynamic and diverse (recent agricultural frontiers, crop rotations, multiple cropping systems, several management practices, etc.), and cultivated over a vast territory, this task is not trivial. One way of boosting the researches in agricultural remote sensing is to stimulate people to share their data, and to foster different groups to use the same dataset, so distinct methods can be properly compared.

The origin, formation process and sediment sources for TARs remain uncertain, but using high-resolution satellite images and studying terrestrial analogs are important tools for examining these features. TAR-like features in the Lut desert of Iran are excellent analogs for exploring the diversity and dimensions of TAR-like features, in order to shed light on the most likely origin of TARs on Mars. We used a semi-automatic mapping methodology to document TAR-like bedforms in the Lut desert. Morphometry of more than 2 million TAR-like features in the Lut study area were automatically extracted for this study, along with manual measurements of ~2000 features using photoclinometry in order to document heights. High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) digital terrain models (DTMs) were used to obtain measurements for ~2000 Martian TARs, in order to compare similar data sets for the morphometry of both Martian TARs and the Lut analogs. We analyzed measured physical attributes in order to explore physical conditions that may have contributed to their formation. A multi-temporal analysis of the Lut TAR-like features used satellite images spanning an 8-year time period.

Standard image interpolation-based technique for single image uses only the neighboring pixels information for restoration. The image restoration method based on image inpainting explores the local information of the entire image and propagates the same into the missing gaps. In this paper, the Navier–Stokes-based inpainting algorithm is being used for the restoration. The algorithm propagates the smoothness of the image via partial differential equations(PDEs) and at the same time preserves the edges at the boundary/features of the image. It is analyzed on different satellite images covering different types of terrains and the results show improved statistical characteristics for the restored images. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Computer vision; Edge detection; Image enhancement; Intelligent computing; Restoration; Image interpretation; Local information; Multi-temporal image; Optical satellite images; Partial Differential Equations (PDEs); Restoration methods; Satellite images; Statistical characteristics; Image reconstruction","Cloud occlusions; Image inpainting; Image restoration; Interpolation; Navier–Stokes; PDEs","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092173102"

However, traditional monitoring requires field works or surveys performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and sparse. Agriculture monitoring systems are looking for sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing on satellite data for cheap and timely paddy mapping. The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from low-Earth orbiting satellites, to differentiate crop areas from non-crop areas. However, such agriculture mapping framework poses unique challenges for satellite image processing, including the seasonal nature of crop, the complexity of spectral channels, and adversarial conditions such as cloud and solar radiance. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-temporal high-spatial resolution classification method with an advanced spatio-temporal–spectral deep neural network to locate paddy fields at the pixel level for a whole year long and for each temporal instance. Our method is built and tested on the case study of Landsat 8 data due to its high spatial resolution.

Land erosion–accretion is a very common phenomenon in this riverine country. This process extensively erodes huge productive landmasses at the river confluence zones every year. The main objective of this study was to understand the confluence morpho-dynamics and identify the vulnerable areas near the Padma–Meghna Confluence (PMC) and Ganges–Jamuna confluence (GJC) due to confluence shifting and erosion–accretion phenomenon of those rivers. The present study utilized multi-temporal Landsat satellite images from 1972 to 2019 approximately ten years of interval. Results showed that the PMC indicated frequent variation in migration trend towards NW from 1972 to 1980, SE from 1980 to 2010, and then reversed towards NW direction from 2010 to 2019. On the other hand, the GJC confluence point moved NW direction (2.37 km) from the year 1972 to 1980, but from 1980 to 2019, the confluence shifted towards the SE direction. Due to the migration dynamics, huge changes happened in width and sand bars area of both confluences. In PMC, confluence width increased remarkably indicating erosive flow during 1972–1980, then progressively shortened up to 2019, indicating accretion. In contrast, GJC shows a significant accretional trend over the 47 years. The sand bar area of the PMC increased about 147.09 km2 throughout the study period. But, GJC shows an opposite scenario where the total sand bar area decreased about 51.02 km2 in the same period. From the vulnerability study of erosion–accretion scenarios, it is predicted that Paturia Ferry Ghat area, Aricha Ferry Ghat area, Arua, Baruria, Dashkin Saljana, Bhadiakola, Masundia, Khanganj and Nyakandi areas near GJC and Chandpur sadar, Srimandi, Sakhua, Bilaspur and char Atra near PMC are highly vulnerable zones. The outputs of the study will enable policy makers to take necessary measures to reduce the erosional severity on both confluence zones and could also provide a basis for proper land management. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bangladesh; Ganges River; Jamuna River; Meghna River; accretion; confluence; erosion; fluvial geomorphology; Landsat; morphodynamics; river system; sandbar; satellite imagery; tributary","Bangladesh; Ganges–Jamuna; Geospatial techniques; Morpho-dynamics; Padma–Meghna; River confluence","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092134416"

Several threshold, multi-temporal and machine learning approaches have been developed for the separation of clouds in land and ocean applications, but this task still remains a challenge. Concerning deep water marine applications, the main difficulties are imposed in regions with high noise levels and sunglint. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different configurations are evaluated for the detection of clouds in Sentinel-2 images depicting deep water regions with several noise levels. The ANNs are trained on a manual public dataset and on a manual dataset created for the needs of this study, which authors intend to make publicly available. Results are compared with the cloud masks produced by three state-of-the-art algorithms: Fmask, MAJA, and Sen2Cor. It was shown that the ANNs trained on the second dataset perform very favourably, in contrast to the ANNs trained on the first dataset that fails to adequately represent the spectra of the noisy Sentinel-2 images. This study further reinforces the value of the ‘cirrus’ band and indicates the bands that mitigate the influence of noisy spectra, by defining and examining an index that characterizes the importance of the bands according to the weights produced by the ANNs. Finally, the possibility of improving results by making predictions using the feature scaling parameters of the test set instead of those of the training set is also investigated in cases where the test set cannot be adequately represented by the training set. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image processing; Neural networks; Optical data processing; Deepwater regions; Feature scaling; High noise levels; Image processing technique; Machine learning approaches; Optical satellite images; Public dataset; State-of-the-art algorithms; artificial neural network; data set; image processing; machine learning; parameterization; prediction; satellite imagery; Sentinel; Marine applications","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079105064"

In the present study, an impact of urbanisation on the creeks of Mumbai, India namely Thane, Malad and Manori creeks, has been addressed. Multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat for the years 1972, 1994 and 2016 are considered to perform the changes in the mudflat and growth of the mangrove, as well as the changes in creeks width apart from the Land use Land cover (LULC). Object-based image analysis using multi-spectral resolution confirmed that there is an overall increase in the spatial extent of mangroves and reduction in the width of all the creeks. Mangroves around Thane creek and Manori creek have increased from 50.7 km2 to 57.6 km2 and 8.4 km2 to 25.2 km2respectively. However, there is a decrease in mangroves around Malad Creek from13.3 km2 to 9.7 km2during 1972 to 2016. The relationship between the creek geometry and LULC was also explored, and it has been revealed that the creek width has reduced due to urbanisation. Life expectancy analysis projected a further reduction in the width of the creeks for the years 2025 and 2050. The study suggests that there must be stringent bye-laws for disposal of sewage into the creeks and development activity near the creek areas. Further, upper stretches of the creeks require cleaning and dredging so that the tidal water will be approached up to the upper portion to maintain the creek ecosystem. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","India; Maharashtra; Malad Creek; Manori Creek; Mumbai; Thane Creek; Rhizophoraceae; coastal landform; geometry; GIS; image analysis; land use change; mangrove; spatial analysis; urbanization","Creek; GIS; LULC; Mangroves; Mumbai; OBIA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077381794"

Among the change detection methods, the unsupervised change detection technique has the advantage of extracting rapidly the change area as a binary image. However, it is difficult to understand the changing pattern of land cover in binary images. This study used grid points generated from seamless digital map to evaluate the satellite image change detection results. The land cover change results were extracted using multi-temporal KOMPSAT-3A (K3A) data taken by Gimje Free Trade Zone and change detection algorithm used Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). Change detection results were presented as binary images using the methods Otsu, Kittler, Kapur, and Tsai among the automated threshold selection algorithms. To consider the seasonal change of vegetation in the change detection process, we used the threshold of Differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) through the probability density function. The experimental results showed the accuracy of the Otsu and Kapur was the highest at 58.16%, and the accuracy improved to 85.47% when the seasonal effects were removed through dNDVI. The algorithm generated based on this research is considered to be an effective method for accuracy assessment and identifying changes pattern when applied to unsupervised change detection. © 2020 Korean Journal of Remote Sensing.","","Automated threshold selection algorithms; Change detection; Grid points; KOMPSAT-3A; Spectral Angle Mapper","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106233833"

We also found appearance of new cluster of lakes at higher elevations. We collected here statistical evidences of regional morphodynamics and key controlling factors to stabilize lakes. The parameters, viz., spatio-temporal distribution of lakes, their domain wise variation, multi-temporal (Seasonal to long-term) changes, lake density, and stability index were estimated and mapped. Finally, we concluded that new lake formations at higher elevation were triggered by gradual increase in temperature, decrease in glacier surface velocity, slope and ice thickness.

The main objective of this study is to predict the intensity of Tehran’s heat island in the year 2033 based on historical changes of land cover and LST. For this purpose, Landsat satellite images were integrated with meteorological stations’ measurements from 1985 to 2017. The Cellular Automata-Markov (CA-Markov) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used to predict the land cover changes and to the modelling of the Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII), Surface Urban Heat Island Ratio Index (SUHRI) was used. Subsequently, using statistical analysis of the effect of historical land cover changes on LST variations, SUHII for 2033 was predicted. Our findings show that within this period, the built-up lands increased significantly from 39% in 1985 to 65% in 2017. The intensity of heat island increased with an increase in the value of SUHII from 0.02 to 0.19. Our predictive analysis reveals that the intensity of the Tehran’s heat island will increase to 0.32 by 2033.

To handle this type of remote sensing data, on the one side, unidimensional dynamical models have been considered, modeling each pixel separately along the time (pixel-based approach), and exploring the temporal correlation. On the other side, 2-D approaches have been considered to process each image at one date, exploring the spatial correlation. In this article, we propose a new 3-D autoregressive (AR) (3-D-AR) model useful for multitemporal image interpretation exploring the correlation in three dimensions altogether. The 3-D-AR model is statistically defined, and a robust parameter estimation method is discussed. The tools for filtering, forecasting, and detecting anomalies are also introduced.

The choice of the territory was caused by the high density of gullies established more than half a century ago, as well as by the availability of multi-temporal cartographic data about the gully network density obtained using a unified methodology. The current gully density was determined by visual interpretation of high and ultra-high resolution satellite images for 2010-2017. A geospatial database was created. For this purpose the system of interpretation features of gully forms was developed. Gully maps were developed based on their talweg type using slope, bank, and bottom characteristics as criteria. Two indicators were used to quantify gully erosion: total length per unit area and density of the gully network, where the basin approach was used as an operational territorial unit. Created geo database compiles gullies characteristics for 1674 basins. A total of 9142 gullies were identified in the study area with an average length of 74 meters. The density of the gully network is currently distributed irregularly over the area and averages 12 m/km2, reaching a maximum of 405 m/km2. The change in the number of gullies spatially coincides with the distribution of the density of the gully network, being on average 0.2 units/km2, the maximum being 5 units/km2. Among morpho-genetic types, slope gullies dominate (90%), with bank and bottom gullies representing 7% and 3%, respectively. The temporal dynamics of the areal shape and linear growth of active gullies mainly of the slope type was determined by combining each gully shape on two multi-temporal satellite images obtained over a relatively short period (2009-2016). The dynamics were determined for 304 gullies. The average linear growth of gullies is 0.6 m/year, and the average areal growth is 28 m2/year. The spatial and temporal dynamics of the gully density in the river basins was determined by comparing the data of mapping of the modern gully network with the results obtained by mapping gullies on aerial photographs of 1960-1970s. Overall, a significant decrease in gully density, indicating the slowing down of gully formation processes, was established. The average density of the gully network in all the basins decreased by 230 m/km2in the study area. Against the background of the general reduction, only in some basins there was a slight increase in gully density. Minimum values of gully density now correlate with the basins with high indices of grassing of the territory. Changes in hydro-climatic conditions (increased winter temperatures, reduced depth of soil freezing and surface snowmelt runoff), reduction in plowed area, gully evolution (transformation from gully to balka stage), planting of protective forest belts has determined the decreasing trend of gully development in the study area. © 2021 Russian Academy of Sciences.

In this paper, two separate geographical information system based models are proposed; one for surface and one for subsurface mine disasters. The multi-temporal (2004–2017) high-resolution pre and post-disaster satellite images were analyzed to assess the magnitude and spatial extent of the surface disaster. The explicit modeling technique was applied for mine subsidence using the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion under gravitational acceleration. For surface disaster, the weighted overlay model was applied by assigning weights to hydrological (rainfall, flow direction, accumulation, and density); geological (geology and lineaments) and geomorphological (slope, aspect, and curvature) causative factors. The mine subsidence modeling results showed a subsidence zone of 55 × 24 × 71 m due to a failure of a crown pillar, whereas, in reality, it was 60 × 30 × 80 m. The deformation results showed that the lamp room wherein the miners were trapped could have been displaced somewhere at or below level 5 but above level 6 towards the southwest direction. The output of surface disaster modeling was also satisfactory and reliable as the actual two slope failures, i.e. the western and southern landslides of the Lily gold mine, located in extreme risk zones as predicted by the model. The results of this study can be useful for future mine planning and the environmental improvements at the Lily gold mine. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","South Africa; Lilium; Disasters; Gold mines; Landslides; Subsidence; GIS modeling; Mine subsidences; Pit slopes; South Africa; Zero harm; GIS; gold mine; landslide; modeling; satellite imagery; slope failure; subsidence; Economic geology","GIS modeling; Landslide; Mine pit slope failure; Mine subsidence; Mining South Africa; Zero harm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064197749"

The advanced atmospheric corrections have achieved great progress in the removal of atmospheric effects by using complicated physical-based models. However, the process of image-by-image atmospheric correction may cause bias errors for multitemporal images, which produce temporal inconsistencies and discontinuities over the surface reflectance of invariant ground objects. In this study, a surface reflectance correction is proposed for multispectral and multitemporal satellite images. The surface reflectance correction is determined by using pseudoinvariant features instead of an entire image, and the correction is based on a harmonization technique with temporal-consistency and spectral-consistency constraints. With the constraints, the spectral signatures in multispectral images can be maintained, while the surface reflectance biases in multitemporal images can be removed during the image harmonization. In the method, the pseudoinvariant features are determined by using iterative reweighted multitemporal and multivariate alteration detection, called IRMMAD, which is an extension of IRMAD. The multispectral and multitemporal surface reflectance bias removal is formulated as an optimization problem, and a least-squares linear system is solved for optimal harmonization. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on six atmospheric corrections (AC) models multitemporal images have been conducted, and the methods are evaluated using the measurements of spectral and temporal consistencies. The experimental results show that the surface reflectance biases can be significantly removed while the spectral signatures can be preserved. In addition, the proposed method outperforms related harmonization methods in terms of consistency measurements. © ACRS 2021.All right reserved.","Iterative methods; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space applications; Space optics; Atmospheric corrections; Constrained image harmonization; Harmonisation; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Pseudo-invariant features; Spectral consistency; Spectral signature; Surface reflectance; Temporal consistency; Linear systems","constrained image harmonization; spectral consistency; Surface reflectance; temporal consistency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127373043"

Since high-resolution optical imagery is available due to the improvement of satellite sensor capabilities, small-scale structures and activities on multi-temporal satellite imagery have been investigated in a few decades. In analysing satellite images of nuclear-related sites, the concern remains that there are spacious sites required to examine carefully. This led to an automated process for examination, and consequentially, a series of temporal images has to be correctly registered prior to algorithm-based change detection. The angle of satellite sensors produces perspective (tilt) images, demanding high-resolution elevation model, which is hardly achievable for restricted access area. As a prerequisite of algorithm-based change detection, this work assesses the accuracy of image-to-image registration with a data set of multi-temporal satellite images in North Korea. A feature-based matching method, the speeded-up robust features (SURF) model, is applied, and location of matching points for registration is discussed according to the target of interest. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

In order to study the urbanisation process and its patterns, satellite images were used in the past to identify land-use changes and detect individual buildings and constructions. However, this approach involves the acquisition of high-resolution satellite images, the cost of which is increases according to the size of the area under study, as well as the time interval of the analysis. In this paper, we implemented a quick, automatic and low-cost exploration of large areas, for addressing this purpose, aiming to provide at a medium resolution of an overview of the landscape changes. This study focuses on using radar Sentinel-1 images to monitor and detect multi-temporal changes during the period 2015–2020 in Limassol, Cyprus. In addition, the big data cloud platform, Google Earth Engine, was used to process the data. Three different change detection methods were implemented in this platform as follow: (a) vertical transmit, vertical receive (VV) and vertical transmit, horizontal receive (VH) polarisations pseudo-colour composites; (b) the Rapid and Easy Change Detection in Radar Time-Series by Variation Coefficient (REACTIV) Google Earth Engine algorithm; and (c) a multi-temporal Wishart-based change detection algorithm. The overall findings are presented for the wider area of the Limassol city, with special focus on the archaeological site of “Amathus” and the city centre of Limassol. For validation purposes, satellite images from the multi-temporal archive from the Google Earth platform were used. The methods mentioned above were able to capture the urbanization process of the city that has been initiated during this period due to recent large construction projects. © 2021 by the author.

Coral communities are in great danger due to global climate change, direct commercial coral extraction and unplanned tourism around the island. The present study attempts to identify the coral zone and mapping of coral reefs from the period of 1980 to 2018. The study utilized five sets of multi-temporal Landsat satellite images to examine the changes of coral reefs in Saint Martin’s Island during the study timeframe. Geospatial and image processing software was used for spatial coral colony mapping and data analysis. Satellite images processed to remove water depth impacts and supervised classification technique using the maximum likelihood decision rule suggested the spatial change of coral colonies over time. The result of the study indicates that coral colonies decreased steadily throughout the study period. A total area of 0.9342 km2 of coral colonies disappeared during the study period from 1980 to 2018. Field observations around Saint Martin’s Island indicates that destruction of coral reef habitat was basically caused by anthropogenic activities like tourism and extraction of coral by fisherman. Analysis of the historical data regarding tourism, population and households, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) along with field observations of these parameter during 2018, suggests that anthropogenic factors are more significant than natural factors for causing coral reef degradation. It is very crucial to raise consciousness not only in the vicinity of Saint Martin’s Island but more widely regarding the significance of the biodiversity of the Island. © 2020, KSO, KIOST and Springer.","Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Saint Martin; Anthozoa; coral reef; degradation; image processing; Landsat; mapping; maximum likelihood analysis; satellite imagery; software; supervised classification","Bay of Bengal; coral reefs; geospatial techniques; Saint Martin’s Island; satellite images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090315109"

In the recent decade, Turag River has been exposed to severe threats due to anthropogenic activities. The present research deals with the evaluation of water quantity–quality, landuse and landcover (LULC), and land surface temperature (LST) of Turag River and its floodplain by using an integrated approach of field study, laboratory analysis, and geospatial techniques. LULC mapping of the study area has been done using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images by unsupervised method, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index indices (NDWI) approach. From LULC classification, the study shows that the average reduction of water bodies from 1989 to 2019 is about 60–66%, and the rate of reduction is about 14.25 ha per year. Due to anthropogenic activities and rapid urbanization, a large number of water bodies have been depleting. The average temperature of the river water from filed observed data is 30.23 °C and from image processed data is about 28.32 °C. The minimum and maximum values of pH, EC, TDS, and Eh are 6.87–8.44, 808–1192 μs/cm, 406–739 ppm, − 31 to – 150 mV, respectively.

By observing these, a most pressing concern is how much degradation occurred in the past, and what will be the scenarios in the future if they continue? To confirm the degradation status in the past decades and reveal the future trend, we took Sundarban Reserve Forest (SRF) as an example, and used satellite Earth observation historical Landsat imagery between 1989 and 2019 as existing data and primary data. Moreover, a geographic information system model was considered to estimate land cover (LC) change and spatial health quality of the SRF from 1989 to 2029 based on the large and small tree categories. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) technique was employed to classify the historical images with five different LC types, which were further considered for future projection (2029) including trends based on 2019 simulation results from 1989 and 2019 LC maps using the Markov-cellular automata model. The overall accuracy achieved was 82.30%~90.49% with a kappa value of 0.75~0.87. The historical result showed forest degradation in the past (1989-2019) of 4773.02 ha yr-1, considered as great forest degradation (GFD) and showed a declining status when moving with the projection (2019-2029) of 1508.53 ha yr-1 and overall there was a decline of 3956.90 ha yr-1 in the 1989-2029 time period. Moreover, the study also observed that dense forest was gradually degraded (good to bad) but, conversely, light forest was enhanced, which will continue in the future even to 2029 if no effective management is carried out. Therefore, by observing the GFD, through spatial forest health quality and forest degradation mapping and assessment, the study suggests a few policies that require the immediate attention of forest policy-makers to implement them immediately and ensure sustainable development in the SRF. © 2020 by the authors.","Bangladesh; Coverings; Data; Degradation; Forestry; Health; Projection; Robots; India; Sundarbans National Park; West Bengal; Cellular automata; Maximum likelihood; Robots; Satellite imagery; Cellular automata modeling; Earth observations; Effective management; Forest cover change; Forest degradation; Geographic information; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Overall accuracies; cellular automaton; deforestation; environmental quality; forest cover; land cover; Landsat; Markov chain; prediction; satellite data; sustainable development; Forestry","Bangladesh; Forest cover change; Forest degradation; Land cover; Markov-cellular automata model; Multi-temporal landsat satellite image; Spatial forest health quality; Sundarban reserve forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092452046"

The approach has been developed in the framework of the ESA SEOM - Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - S2-4Sci Land and Water project [1]. To focus only on agricultural areas, images are first filtered based on a land cover (LC) map that is generated by updating available old maps by means of recent images. Then S2 SITS are used to analyse agricultural areas. Two macro challenges are therefore considered: (i) automatic update of LC maps and generation of agricultural areas mask; and (ii) unsupervised multi-temporal (MT) fine characterization of land plots. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Agricultural robots; Precision agriculture; Time series analysis; Agricultural areas; Agriculture applications; Automatic updates; Large-scale applications; Operational mission; Satellite constellations; Satellite images; Scientific exploitation; Big data","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088503515"

In recent years, the abandonment of jujube fields has gradually emerged. It is critical to inventory the abandoned land soon after it is generated to adjust agricultural production better and prevent the negative impacts from the abandonment (such as outbreaks of diseases, insect pests, and fires). High-resolution multi-temporal satellite remote sensing images can be used to identify subtle differences among crops and provide a good tool for solving this problem. In this research, both field-based and pixel-based classification approaches using field boundaries were used to estimate the percentage of abandoned jujube fields with multi-temporal high spatial resolution satellite images (Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-6) and the Random Forest algorithm. The results showed that both approaches produced good classification results and similar distributions of abandoned fields. The overall accuracy was 91.1% for the field-based classification and 90.0% for the pixel-based classification, and the Kappa was 0.866 and 0.848 for the respective classifications. The areas of abandoned land detected in the field-based and pixel-based classification maps were 806.09 ha and 828.21 ha, respectively, accounting for 8.97% and 9.11% of the study area. In addition, feature importance evaluations of the two approaches showed that the overall importance of texture features was higher than that of vegetation indices and that 31 October and 10 November were important dates for abandoned land detection. The methodology proposed in this study will be useful for identifying abandoned jujube fields and have the potential for large-scale application. © 2021 by the authors.

A major reason for this is a lack of information about changes in habitat suitability across large areas and longer time periods. Here, we use a novel approach based on Landsat satellite image time series to map seasonal habitat suitability annually from 1986 to 2017. Our approach involves characterizing forest disturbance dynamics using Landsat-based metrics, harmonizing these metrics through a temporal segmentation algorithm, and then using them together with GPS telemetry data in habitat models. We apply this framework to assess how natural forest disturbances and post-disturbance salvage logging affect habitat suitability for two ungulates, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus), over 32 yr in a Central European forest landscape. We found that red and roe deer differed in their response to forest disturbances. Habitat suitability for red deer consistently improved after disturbances, whereas the suitability of disturbed sites was more variable for roe deer depending on season (lower during winter than summer) and disturbance agent (lower in windthrow vs. bark-beetle-affected stands). Salvage logging altered the suitability of bark beetle-affected stands for deer, having negative effects on red deer and mixed effects on roe deer, but generally did not have clear effects on habitat suitability in windthrows. Our results highlight long-lasting legacy effects of forest disturbances on deer habitat. For example, bark beetle disturbances improved red deer habitat suitability for at least 25 yr. The duration of disturbance impacts generally increased with elevation. Methodologically, our approach proved effective for improving the robustness of habitat reconstructions from Landsat time series: integrating multiyear telemetry data into single, multi-temporal habitat models improved model transferability in time. Likewise, temporally segmenting the Landsat-based metrics increased the temporal consistency of our habitat suitability maps. As the frequency of natural forest disturbances is increasing across the globe, their impacts on wildlife habitat should be considered in wildlife and forest management. Our approach offers a widely applicable method for monitoring habitat suitability changes caused by landscape dynamics such as forest disturbance. © 2020 The Authors.

Ground-based methods for detecting degradation require a lot of labor and time. Remote methods based on the analysis of vegetation indices can significantly reduce the volume of ground surveys. Currently, machine learning methods are increasingly being used to analyze remote sensing data. In this paper, the task is set to apply deep machine learning methods and methods of vegetation indices calculation to automate the detection of areas of soil degradation development on arable land. In the course of the work, a method was developed for determining the location of degraded areas of soil cover on arable fields. The method is based on the use of multi-temporal remote sensing data. The selection of suitable remote sensing data scenes is based on deep machine learning. Deep machine learning was based on an analysis of 1028 scenes of Landsats 4, 5, 7 and 8 on 530 agricultural fields. Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 was analyzed. Dataset was created manually for each pair of “Landsat scene”/“agricultural field number”(for each agricultural field, the suitability of each Landsat scene was assessed). Areas of soil degradation were calculated based on the frequency of occurrence of low NDVI values over 35 years. Low NDVI values were calculated separately for each suitable fragment of the satellite image within the boundaries of each agricultural field. NDVI values of one-third of the field area and lower than the other two-thirds were considered low. During testing, the method gave 12.5% of type I errors (false positive) and 3.8% of type II errors (false negative). Independent verification of the method was carried out on six agricultural fields on an area of 713.3 hectares. Humus content and thickness of the humus horizon were determined in 42 ground-based points. In arable land degradation areas identified by the proposed method, the probability of detecting soil degradation by field methods was 87.5%. The probability of detecting soil degradation by ground-based methods outside the predicted regions was 3.8%. The results indicate that deep machine learning is feasible for remote sensing data selection based on a binary dataset. This eliminates the need for intermediate filtering systems in the selection of satellite imagery (determination of clouds, shadows from clouds, open soil surface, etc.). Direct selection of Landsat scenes suitable for calculations has been made. It allows automating the process of constructing soil degradation maps. © 2021 by the authors.

Over the decades, remote sensing (RS) techniques offered great potential to extract paddy rice from the optical satellite images. Two main categories of paddy rice mapping methods were commonly utilized. The first one was the phenology-oriented methods by utilizing the distinctive phenology of paddy rice, and the machine learning-based approaches were the other mainstream for paddy rice extraction by being recognized as a classification task. However, neither of the above methods were actually applicable to automatically map paddy rice for the large cloudy areas. The phenological methods were subject to the availability of time-series cloud-free RS inputs due to cloud contamination, and machine learning-based methods were often confined to the availability of high-quality collected training samples. Therefore, this study proposed a new flexible framework to integrate the above two methods, in an attempt to achieve the goal of automatic paddy rice mapping for large cloudy area. Firstly, phenological paddy rice mapping was implemented for the areas with cloud-free time series satellite images available to generate the paddy rice potentials. Following that, the derived paddy rice potentials were purified through filtering operations. Finally, the machine learning classifier was trained using the purified samples, and spatially transferred to other regions for the extraction of paddy rice. Several experiments were carried out to assess our proposed framework and the subsequent mapping results. The experimental results were promising, indicating that our framework contributed to overcoming the strong reliance on training data for machine learning methods, and reducing the number of multi-temporal inputs for automated paddy rice mapping, which potentially provided a new paradigm for the purpose of paddy rice extraction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biology; Extraction; Food supply; Machine learning; Purification; Remote sensing; Time series; Classification tasks; Cloud contamination; Filtering operations; Flexible framework; Machine learning methods; Optical satellite images; Remote sensing techniques; Satellite images; automation; cloud cover; image analysis; machine learning; mapping method; paddy farming; paddy field; phenology; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; time series analysis; Mapping","Machine Learning; Multi-temporal analysis; Paddy rice mapping; Phenological metrics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100198611"

We carried out such measurements by analysis of a unique and homogeneous multi-temporal dataset of high-spatial resolution satellite optical images. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and orthophotos (with 1- and 0.5-m-pixel resolutions respectively) were extracted from six specifically tasked Pleiades tri-stereo pairs of Mt. Etna volcano, between 2011 and 2016. During this period, frequent effusive and explosive events formed lava flow fields and built up the new south-east crater pyroclastic cone. The volumes of lava fields and proximal pyroclastic deposits were measured by comparing the Pleiades DEMs with an aerial photogrammetric DEM updated in 2007. The volumes of all distal deposits were estimated using lava and tephra partitioning from the literature for an Etnean lava fountain. The dense rock equivalent volume of lava and tephra, calculated to be 248.4 ± 2.1 × 106 m3 in total, corresponds to an average output rate of 0.98 m3/s over the analysed 8-year period (May 2008–May 2016) and to a multi-event eruption rate of 5.53 m3/s for 520 days of activity. The multi-temporal analysis of high-spatial resolution satellite DEMs, here successfully applied to the well-monitored Etna volcano, demonstrated that the tasking of high-spatial resolution satellite images is crucial for fast and effective monitoring during intense volcanic activity (frequent and overlapping eruptive events).

After an earthquake, quick and accurate buildings damage identification for rescuing can reduce the number of fatalities.

This paper proposes a novel method, titled segment-by-segment comparison (SBSC), to generate buildings damage map using multi-temporal satellite images. The proposed method begins by extracting image-objects from pre- and post-earthquake images and equalizing them through segmentation intersection. After the extraction of various textural and spectral descriptors on pre- and post-event images, their differences are used as an input feature vector in a classification algorithm. Also, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimum descriptors in the classification process. The accuracy of the proposed method was tested on two different datasets from different sensors.

The main reasons of long-term catastrophic shallowing of the reservoir and the drop in its level to values less than the dead volume level (DVL) in the summer and autumn of 2020 were highlighted. The current situation was provoked by both natural and anthropogenic factors. The permanent natural factors of reservoir degradation include long-term accumulation of 95-98 % of the average annual sediment runoff from the main tributaries (about 6 million m3/year), episodic one is the coming of dry years with low precipitation. Anthropogenic reasons include constructive design errors, underestimation of the reservoir bowl siltation rate, decrease in the normal retaining level by 0.9 m in 1993, water consumption for household needs disproportionate to real conditions, etc. The combination of these factors against the background of a long dry period made conditional upon decrease in the volume of water in 2020 to 6-10 % of the total reservoir volume and drainage of shallow waters, which led to severe environmental consequences. Analysis of space information from the Sentinel-2 satellite, identification of the water mirror using the MNDWI index and determination of the reservoir area showed that its open water surface decreased by 58 % of the design value. It is noted that the documentary character of space information and its regular use make it possible timely recording changes of the reservoir condition, which should certainly be taken into account in the water management practice of the region for making realistic decisions. © 2021 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

CD is divided into pixel-based change detection (PBCD) and object-based change detection (OBCD). Although PBCD is more popular due to its simple algorithms and relatively easy quantitative analysis, applying this method in very high resolution (VHR) images often results in misdetection or noise. Because of this, researchers have focused on extending the PBCD results to the OBCD map in VHR images. In this paper, we present a proposed weighted Dempster-Shafer theory (wDST) fusion method to generate the OBCD by combining multiple PBCD results. The proposed wDST approach automatically calculates and assigns a certainty weight for each object of the PBCD result while considering the stability of the object. Moreover, the proposed wDST method can minimize the tendency of the number of changed objects to decrease or increase based on the ratio of changed pixels to the total pixels in the image when the PBCD result is extended to the OBCD result. First, we performed co-registration between the VHR multitemporal images to minimize the geometric dissimilarity. Then, we conducted the image segmentation of the co-registered pair of multitemporal VHR imagery. Three change intensity images were generated using change vector analysis (CVA), iteratively reweighted-multivariate alteration detection (IRMAD), and principal component analysis (PCA). These three intensity images were exploited to generate different binary PBCD maps, after which the maps were fused with the segmented image using the wDST to generate the OBCD map. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed CD technique was assessed by using a manually digitized map. Two VHR multitemporal datasets were used to test the proposed approach. Experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed method by comparing the existing PBCD methods and the OBCD method using the majority voting technique. © 2020 by the authors.

Understanding GLOF evolution, and their impacts, plays a fundamental role in GLOF hazard assessment and risk management. Reconstructing historical GLOFs is an important exercise because detailed case studies of such glacial hazards are rare, which hinders the capacity of glacial hazard practitioners to learn from these events. In this study, we reconstruct a historical GLOF from moraine-dammed Chongbaxia Tsho (89.745°E, 28.211°N) in the Eastern Himalaya, which is a unique case study because the outburst flood cascaded into two further lakes downstream. We employ a combination of i) multi-source and multi-temporal satellite imagery, ii) field investigation (including an unmanned aerial vehicle survey), iii) numerical dam breach and hydrodynamic modelling and, iv) qualitative and quantitative cryospheric and meteorological analysis, to investigate the evolution of the GLOF hazard, simulate moraine dam failure and GLOF propagation, and explore the role that long- and short-term climate trends played in providing the conditioning factors for the outburst. Chongbaxia Tsho expanded rapidly between 1987 until 2001 in response to glacier recession most likely caused by a regional warming trend of +0.37 °C per decade. Based on satellite image analysis we refine the outburst date to be 6 August 2001, instead of 6 August 2000, as previously reported, and attribute an ice avalanche into the glacial lake originating from the receding parent glacier as the most likely trigger for moraine dam failure. Through DEM differencing and lake level decrease, we estimate that a total water volume of 27.1 ± 1.6 × 106 m3 was released from the lake during the event, and using dam breach modelling we estimate that the peak discharge at the breach was >6600 m3 s−1. The GLOF flowed through downstream Chongbamang Tsho and Chongbayong Tsho, both of which served to attenuate the GLOF and reduce downstream losses; the latter stored an estimated 96% of the flood volume. Precipitation totals in the weeks preceding the GLOF exceeded the historical mean by up to 40%, and may have contributed to instability of the parent glacier, and generation of an ice avalanche with enough impact energy to cause lake water to overtop the moraine dam and initiate breach development. A future GLOF from Chongbaxia Tsho cannot be ruled out, but more field data, including detailed lake bathymetry, and information pertaining to the sedimentological and geotechnical characteristics of the moraine dam, are required for a more robust parameterization of a predictive GLOF model and quantification of the hazard posed by a future GLOF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","glacial debris; glacial deposit; glacial lake; hazard assessment; outburst","Climate change; Glaciers; GLOFs; Himalayas; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090187642"

A large channel bar was investigated using satellite remote sensing data during 1986–2017. A novel algorithm was proposed to select images acquired at the similar river stage. The bar was delineated from selected images and surface area, volume and centroid were quantified to examine bar morphodynamics. The results indicated a four-stage evolution process, including a steady extension (1986–1998), a quick shrinkage (1998–2002), a fluctuated shrinkage (2002–2012), and a fluctuated extension (2012–2017). The first stage was characterized by the steady growth at a rate of 0.087 km2/a, and a centroid translation towards the inner bend by 400 m. The second stage was the most dynamic episode, with the bar degradation at a rate of 0.71 km2/a, and a downstream migration by 850 m. In the third stage, the bar was eroded at a rate of 0.05 km2/a, and migrated towards the inner bend by about 80 m. In the fourth stage, the bar was deposited at a rate of 0.12 km2/a, and traveled upstream by around 400 m. The bar volume exhibited the similar trend. The analysis showed that the four stages were separated by the consecutive floods, the closure of Three Gorges Dam and the installation of two river engineering works. The results suggested that the bar evolved much more dynamic under the natural flow (1985–2003) than that of the regulated (2003–2012). The findings revealed that the evolution was largely governed by the flow and sediment supply while the human forcing can affect the process by altering these regimes. This study also demonstrated the great usefulness of combining multi-temporal imagery and river stage records in the assessment of bar morphodynamics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Hubei; Three Gorges Dam; Yangtze River; decadal variation; installation; morphodynamics; river channel; river engineering; satellite data; satellite imagery; sediment transport; shrinkage","Channel bar; Morphodynamic evolution; Satellite image; Three gorges dam; Yangtze river","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098747365"

Conventionally, Crop Cutting Survey (CCS) is an important tool to provide data for determining average paddy yield production in Malaysia. However, it is time - consuming and costly. Still, this tool is very crucial for national paddy development and plannin g purposes. Realizing that, Malaysia Space Agency (MYSA) with the Department of Agriculture Malaysia (DOA) have taken the initiative to develop the Geospatial Information System (MakGeoPadi) to identify precise and up-to-date areas of paddy granary all over Malaysia. The main objective of this study is to map potential CCS paddy lot sample map over IADA Barat Laut Selangor study area. For that purpose, data from high-resolution optical satellite such as Pleiades satellite, multi-temporal radar images, such as Radarsat-2 satellite and cadaster lot, have been used for analysis. High-resolution optical data were used to classify active paddy parcel, miscellaneo us paddy parcel and non-paddy parcel. Multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images together with cadaster lot were used to identify actual planted paddy area. Satellite image classification methods use algorithms that applied systematically the entire satellite image to group pixels into meaningful categories to determine actual paddy planting area. Paddy actual planted area in each lot can be analyzed using satellite image classification methods. Results indicate high-resolution optical data and Radarsat-2 time-series images were highly beneficial in identifying paddy planting area. Backscatter range (sigma naught) less than -11 can differentiate paddy from other crops. Potential paddy lot sample can be mapped to be used for CCS which is based on active paddy parcel and actual planted paddy area.

The increasing anthropogenic activities and climate change in the Siwalik and Lesser Himalayas have substantially experienced rapid change in the natural landscape; however, detailed investigation and documentation of such observed changes are limited. This study aims to assess the LULC changes along the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor located in the Lesser Himalayan region of Uttarakhand state of India using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) for the periods 2000-2010 and 2010-2019. The LULC maps were generated from multi-temporal satellite images of the Landsat -7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) series for 2000 and 2010, and the Linear Imaging Self-Scanning System IV (LISS IV) images from Resourcesat-1 for 2019. The extent of spatial landscape changes occurred in different LULC classes was performed through the cross-tabulation change matrix in the GIS module up to the individual village level. The results indicate that the forest cover of the area was intensively converted to open areas, sparse vegetation, and different land-use categories. These included agricultural land, built-up areas, and decreased from 47.27 % in 2000 to 36.66 % in 2019. During the same period, the open areas and agricultural areas were increased by 15.86 % and 4.49 %, respectively. Moreover, the built-up areas (both urban and rural settlements) were progressively increased from 0.33% in 2000 to 0.56 % in 2019. The conversion of forests and sparsely vegetative areas to agricultural land and rural settlements is closely associated with the increasing anthropogenic activities due to population growth, tourism, movement of heavy vehicles for mining and other economic activities. The changes in land-cover to land use classes are more prominent in Samalta Dadauli, Nithala, Bhugtari, and Udapalta villages located between Kalsi and Sahiya town. The reported maximum transition of forest areas into the open area, agricultural land, and sparse vegetation indicates the possible scarcity of water, which could link with the incidence of climatic or seasonal variation in the Lesser Himalayan terrain to the hydro-geomorphic and anthropogenic processes. The trend in LULC change at the village level gave the insight to help to prioritize future mitigation planning and sustainable development that are exceedingly convenient for the planners, policymakers, and local authorities for comprehensive forest management, biodiversity strategies, and necessary conservation. © 2020 Ujjwal Sur et al., published by Sciendo.","","change detection; GIS; Land-use and land-cover (LULC); Lesser Himalayas; remote sensing; village land-cover conversion","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098946340"

This study was carried out in Jewha watershed, which is found in the upper Awash River basin of central Ethiopia. The total catchment area is 502 km2. All climatic zones of Ethiopia, including lowland arid (‘Kola’), midland semi-arid (‘Woinadega’), humid highland (Dega) and afro alpine (‘Wurch’) can be found in the watershed. The study focused on LULC classification and change detection using GIS and remote sensing techniques by analyzing satellite images. The data preprocessing and post-process was done using multi-temporal spectral satellite data. The images were used to evaluate the temporal trends of the LULC class by considering the years 1984, 1995, 2005 and 2015. Accuracy assessment and change detection of the classification were undertaken by accounting these four years images. The land use types in the study area were categorized into six classes: natural forest, plantation forest, cultivated land, shrub land, grass land and bare land. The result shows the cover classes which has high environmental role such as forest and shrub has decreased dramatically through time with cultivated land increasing during the same period in the watershed. The forest cover in 1984 was about 6.5% of the total catchment area, and it had decreased to 4.2% in 2015. In contrast, cultivated land increased from 38.7% in 1984 to 51% in 2015. Shrub land decreased from 28 to 18% in the same period. Bare land increased due to high gully formation in the catchment. In 1984, it was 1.8% which turned to 0.6% in 1995 then increased in 2015 to 2.7%. Plantation forest was not detected in 1984. In 1995, it covers 1.5% which turned to be the same in 2015. The study clearly demonstrated that there are significant changes of land use and land cover in the catchment.

It is known that increase in temperature field of frozen soils is main factor contributing to activation of negative geocryological processes that affect the reliability of underground pipeline systems. Activation of geocryological processes, waterlogging of the territory of pipeline corridor causes a change in the state and type of vegetation, which can be fixed and observed by means of satellite information interpretation. We used multi-temporal images of Landsat satellite. Decoding was carried out on ENVI software package; to assess the change in vegetation state, vegetation index NDVI was used. Results of the research show that using vegetation index allows identifying and classifying different types of vegetation, assessing changes in vegetation cover and waterlogging of the territory using satellite images at different times, and thus tracking activation and attenuation of geocryological processes and indirectly assess condition of the pipeline. The use of satellite imagery is one of the stages of geotechnical monitoring and makes it possible to quickly receive information over a large area, which is important for extensive linear systems located in remote areas, and complements ground monitoring works well. © 2020 The Author(s).","","cryolithozone; decoding; geotechnical monitoring; industrial safety; satellite data; trunk pipeline; vegetation index NDVI","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081644765"

Long-term datasets are very useful to examine an area over a period and see what changes have occurred. It is not an easy task to develop satisfactory change detection algorithms due to the processing complexity and extraction of meaningful change pattern of interest. In an effort to find an appropriate approach for this challenge, this paper presents a harmonic model-based change detection method using time-series of satellite images. The proposed algorithm is based on the temporal profile over time for the long-term change rather than a temporary change. A harmonic model can characterize the temporal variability of land covers whose signatures exhibit seasonal trends since components of the harmonic function inherently contain temporal information about seasonal changes. Several experiments were conducted on a multi-temporal dataset of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Korean peninsula, in the time interval of 2012-2016. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a great potential for monitoring land cover condition and annual long-term landcover change over large regions. © 2019 ACM.","Harmonic analysis; Harmonic functions; Radiometers; Time series; Change detection algorithms; Land-cover change; Long term change; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Processing complexity; Temporal information; Temporal profile; Temporal variability; Image processing","Change Detection; Harmonic Model; Land Cover Classification; MODIS","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123040961"

This paper presents a new method based on the use of DST for mining bi-temporal remotely sensed images change. The main idea is based on the investigation, analysis and interpretation of different types of conflict between two bi-temporal mass distributions. The reasoning process is focused on the conflict significance and its “partial” causes. In fact, the global conflict that occurs during the joint exploitation of multi-temporal images gives general and non-sufficiently concise information. However, the partial conflict provides rich and important information with regards to the disagreement between knowledge sources. For computing the partial conflict between focal elements, the geometric representation of mass distributions is exploited. The obtained conflict measures, caused by change, are analyzed latter by a new algorithm for drifting binary change map and identifying change directions. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach are shown through experimentations on simulated changed images as well as using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images where qualitative criteria as well as quantitative measures are applied. The performances of the proposed approach, in terms of changed area recognition, are compared to three different and widely used conflict measures: the Empty-set mass, the Jousselme's distance and the Cosine measure. It is shown that the developed change detection approach outperforms these conflict measures. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Remote sensing techniques using multi-temporal and multi-sensor images for change detection purposes are important in this regard. This study used a combination of approaches to detect changes in the lake surface area of Lake Sibayi in relation to changes in past climates. Delineation of the study area is achieved using WR2012 endoreic maps and Landsat satellite images from 1992 to 2016. Using data from eight meteorological stations, past climate of the lake catchment was investigated. Thereafter, a multivariate correlation analysis is conducted to examine the relationship between the changes in the lake surface area and the changes in climatic (precipitation, temperature) variables and water levels. Results suggest that the lake surface area has decreased by 20% since 1992. There are significant changes in temperatures, while the annual rainfall totals declined significantly. The correlation between precipitation in the catchment and annual water level changes is 0.88. Statistically, significant increases in the water level and precipitation were experienced in 1993 and 2001. SPI analysis reveals that the study area is getting drier and the probability of recurrence of moderate dryness is 10%. The rate at which the lake is shrinking is not solely climatic related, as anthropogenic aspects are also responsible. To prevent further shrinkage of Lake Sibayi, it will be necessary to develop aggressive restoration policies and action plans aimed at maintaining inflows in the face of compounding climate change and water demand. Recommendations of the nature of further studies that can increase our understanding are included. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","KwaZulu-Natal; Lake Sibaya; South Africa; climate change; correlation; detection method; hydrological response; lake water; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sensor; temporal analysis; water level","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055554254"

Recent technological evolution provided very high spatial resolution (VHR) multitemporal optical satellite images showing high spatial correlation among pixels and requiring an effective modeling of spatial context to accurately capture change information. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised context-sensitive framework - deep change vector analysis (DCVA) - for CD in multitemporal VHR images that exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) features. To have an unsupervised system, DCVA starts from a suboptimal pretrained multilayered CNN for obtaining deep features that can model spatial relationship among neighboring pixels and thus complex objects. An automatic feature selection strategy is employed layerwise to select features emphasizing both high and low prior probability change information. Selected features from multiple layers are combined into a deep feature hypervector providing a multiscale scene representation. The use of the same pretrained CNN for semantic segmentation of single images enables us to obtain coherent multitemporal deep feature hypervectors that can be compared pixelwise to obtain deep change vectors that also model spatial context information. Deep change vectors are analyzed based on their magnitude to identify changed pixels. Then, deep change vectors corresponding to identified changed pixels are binarized to obtain a compressed binary deep change vectors that preserve information about the direction (kind) of change. Changed pixels are analyzed for multiple CD based on the binary features, thus implicitly using the spatial information. Experimental results on multitemporal data sets of Worldview-2, Pleiades, and Quickbird images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Optical correlation; Pixels; Remote sensing; Semantics; Vectors; Change detection; Change vector analysis; deep features; Multi-temporal image; Very high resolution (VHR) image; artificial neural network; detection method; image resolution; pixel; Pleiades; probability; QuickBird; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; segmentation; spatial resolution; WorldView; Image analysis","Change detection (CD); deep change vector analysis (DCVA); deep features; multitemporal images; remote sensing; very high-resolution images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066611732"

The process of urbanization is directly linked with land transformation which can be an effective way to monitor the spatio-temporal pattern of urban growth. New Delhi, the capital city of India has experienced a large-scale urban growth during the last decade. In order to identify the pattern of urban expansion in and around Delhi, the present study aims to assess the process of land transformation using multi-temporal Landsat datasets (1977–2014). The areas under various land use and land cover (LULC) extracted by support vector machine (SVM) hybrid classifier reveal asignificant change in the LULC pattern of the area. A good agreement was found between field-based information and maps generated using satellite images (kappa ≥ 0.84). Land transformation maps indicate rapid growth of few urban centres located outside Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT), like Gurgaon, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Faridabad and Ghaziabad. These centres have been remarkably expanded because of transformation of agricultural and vegetated lands. However, green patches within the city have not been affected by the consequences of urbanization. In tune with the rapid urbanization in the periurban centres of Delhi, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS)-derived land surface temperature (LST) images revealed significant change in the level of LST. The inter-relationship of impervious surface fraction (ISF) and LST proves a good agreement between them. The increasing trend observed in the long-term (1987–2011) summer temperature data obtained from India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicates the rise of mean summer temperature in the last few decades. Land transformation along with rapid urbanization especially in the periurban areas of Delhi NCT played a key role in the increasing trend of surface temperature. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agriculture; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; India; Satellite Imagery; Temperature; Urbanization; Delhi; India; New Delhi; Atmospheric temperature; Developing countries; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban growth; Field-based information; Inter-relationships; Land transformation; Land use and land cover; Periurban; Spatiotemporal patterns; Spectro-radiometers; Surface temperatures; land cover; land surface; land use; Landsat; periurban area; remote sensing; satellite data; support vector machine; surface temperature; urban growth; agricultural land; Article; environmental temperature; land use; landscape; population density; satellite imagery; support vector machine; urban area; urbanization; vegetation; agriculture; city; environmental monitoring; heat; India; procedures; temperature; urbanization; Land surface temperature","Land transformation; LST; Periurban remote sensing; Urban growth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070355555"

Recently, corals harbouring Symbiodinium thermophilum, a thermotolerant microalgae, were found to be prevalent among UAE reefs and were reported to endure extreme sea-surface temperatures. Late 2015–early 2016 was marked with the strongest El Niño on record worldwide, which caused massive coral bleaching (loss of symbiotic microalgae from reef-building corals). In September 2015, the waters flanking UAE coasts were identified to be among the areas facing a thermal stress reaching its highest level liable to cause massive coral bleaching. However, the effect of this thermal stress on UAE corals remained largely unknown. Here, multi-temporal DubaiSat-2 satellite images were used to show that changes in the reef environment of Dalma Island, UAE, between 2014 and 2016, occurred in macroalgae-dominant habitats, whereas live corals remained unaltered. Furthermore, extending the study to a larger area helped in discovering a continuum of live and pristine corals, which was not reported or studied before. While sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1°C were reported to significantly damage coral reefs around the world, the live coral habitat was observed to exhibit no-change despite four consecutive months of +2°C to 3°C anomalies reported during the study period. These findings point to the tolerance of UAE live corals faced with extreme climate conditions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","United Arab Emirates; Anthozoa; Symbiodinium; Algae; Atmospheric temperature; Bleaching; Cleaning; Coastal zones; Ecosystems; Microorganisms; Oceanography; Remote sensing; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Thermal stress; Change detection; Coral bleaching; Extreme climates; Satellite images; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sea surface temperature anomalies; Thermotolerant; United Arab Emirates; climate conditions; coral reef; detection method; El Nino; remote sensing; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; Reefs","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045048446"

Land cover changes can be monitored using multi-temporal satellite images at different scales. The commonly used method is the post-classification change detection which can figure out the replacement of a land cover by the others. However, the magnitude and dimension of the changes are not been always exploited. This study employs the mixture of categorical and radiometric change methods to investigate the relations between land cover classes and the change magnitude, the change direction of land covers. Applying the Change Vector Analysis (CVA) method and unsupervised classification for two Landsat images acquired at the same day of years in 2000 and in 2017 in Duy Tien district, the experimental results show that a low magnitude of change occurs in the largest area of direction I and direction IV regarding the increase of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), but the opposite trend of (Bare soil Index) BI in the rice field. Alternately, the high magnitude of change is seen in the build-up class which occupies the smallest area with 1700 ha. The characterized changes produced by the CVA method provide a picture of change dynamics of land cover over the period of 2000-2017 in the study area. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

While a number of algorithms were developed for filling these gaps, the majority of the suggested algorithms can only be applied on fairly homogeneous areas. The retrieving band aspect and element may be challenging if they are utilized to heterogeneous landscapes. In this study, we adopted the criterion of correlation between satellite images to determine spatially match between images. Three different multi temporal images were used in filling the gaps in a period not exceeding 48 days, and two algorithms are presented. In the first algorithm, we got one image free of gaps, when using three images of different times, for a period not exceeding 48 days, while in the second algorithm, we got images free of gaps within a period of time not exceeding 16 days depending on the images resulting from the first algorithm. Simulated and true SLC-off ETM+ bands have been used to examine the performance of the proposed method via comparing with the original data so as to examine the resulting bands from the first and the second algorithms which are based on the correlation model.

This study aims to determine the development of land cover in the Rawapening River catchment starting from 2000, 2010 and 2019 on the sedimentation rate that occurred in Rawapening Lake. This study applies a Spatial-ecological approach by using multi-temporal remote sensing image data accompanied by field surveys and secondary data from related agencies. The tools used in this study are image processing software and Global Positioning System (GPS), while the data used utilizes RBI maps, Landsat 7 Satellite Images in 2010 and Landsat 8 in 2019. The results showed an increase in the area of developed land by 1,520.54 ha in the period 2000 - 2010 and experienced an increase again in 2019 amounting to 1,330.96 ha. The increase in the area of land developed was due to land conversion, which was largely derived from vegetation cover in the water catchment area (DTA) of Rawapening, where the impact caused by the change in land cover increased the rate of sedimentation that occurred in Rawapening Lake. Therefore, it is necessary to limit the transfer of land functions in the DTA of Rawapening so that it does not cause siltation in Rawapening Lake in the future. © 2016. Int. J. of GEOMATE.

The use of multi-temporal satellite remote sensing has proven to be effective means to monitor forest conditions on global scale. The effectiveness of the utilization of remotely sensed images will depend on the analysis model and parameter selection procedure to provide information that meets the requirements of deforestation monitoring. Here we demonstrate the ability of semantic computing for analyzing satellite images that applied to interpreting tropical deforestation. The typical semantic computing works for interpreting numerical or textual data. It still remains challenging for utilizing remote sensing images for environmental monitoring in semantic computing since the data is presented in interval value. Therefore, we proposed interval matrix decomposition for automatically generate semantic projection that address uncertain value in environmental parameters. In this study, independent dimensions of Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery (Landsat-8) and The Phased Array Type L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2) were combined to create an integrated interpretation of environmental condition for a study area in the deforestation zone of global tropical forest. We proposed essential semantic interval-dimensions derived from heterogonous satellite images, combination of L-Band SAR and optical, namely: HV gamma-naught, red, green, blue, NIR, SWIR channel; and combinational features: Soil temperature, soil moisture, temporal change density, temporal change velocity, shape and texture. Afterward, semantic computing is employed as analysis model to explain significant knowledge of deforestation activity. The experimental result shows that integrated independent dimensions from both the optical and SAR domains, has potential for presenting for aspect-based deforestation assessment and to enable the design of robust forest monitoring systems. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

Recent multi-Temporal quantifications of ice mass loss at mountain range to regional scale are missing. However, this is fundamental information for future water resource planning and glacier change projections. In this study, we measure temporally consistent glacier area changes and geodetic mass balances throughout the Bolivian Cordillera Real and Tres Cruces based on multi-sensor remote-sensing data. By analyzing multi-spectral satellite images and interferometric SAR data, a glacier recession of 81 ± 18 km2 (29%; 5.1 ± 1.1 km2 a-1), a geodetic mass balance of-403 ± 78 kg m-2 a-1 and a total ice mass loss of 1.8 ± 0.5 Gt is derived for 2000-2016. In the period 2013-2016, ice mass loss was 21% above the average rate. A retreat rate of 15 ± 5 km2 a-1 and a mass budget of-487 ± 349 kg m-2 a-1 are found in this more recent period. These higher change rates can be attributed to the strong El Niño event in 2015/16. The analyses of individual glacier changes and topographic variables confirmed the dependency of the mass budget and glacier recession on glacier aspect and median elevation.

Otherwise, degradation in ecosystems can have negative consequences for different dimensions, such as biodiversity decline, over-consumption of resources and climate change. In this context, as a result of urbanization, the loss of surface water drainage areas, the interruption of the continuity of green corridors and the increase in the size of impermeable surfaces cause problems in terms of sustainable development. Therefore, the attempts to ensure urban spatial development in harmony with natural areas in coastal areas are one of the most important issues of the planning agenda. The aim of the study is to reveal the relationship between the urban development pattern and the natural areas in the context of sustainable urban development, in the case of Mersin a coastal city in southern of Turkey. For this purpose, an interdisciplinary approach by using geographic information systems and remote sensing has been applied to understand the urban spatial patterns of Mersin. A multi-temporal change by using a series of satellite images for the three periods of 1987-2000-2015 have been analyzed. Threshold values was employed to detect built-up land and non-built-up land on the images. The results revealed that Mersin has spatially grown more than 6 times since 1980. The spatial growth is observed to increase by 80 % between 1987 and 2000 and by 60 % between 2000 and 2015. Under these circumstances, the development in Mersin has resulted in critical problems about decreasing of natural area in size, disconnecting of green network and degradation of coastal ecosystem. The results of the paper highlight the importance of determining the measurable variables for analyzing problems of urban forms for the future development strategies of cities. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Information use; Network architecture; Planning; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Urban growth; Coastal ecosystems; Critical problems; Development strategies; Impermeable surface; Measurable variables; Spatial development; Surface-water drainage; Sustainable urban development; Ecosystems","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062420733"

Obtaining multi-temporal data via satellite images in different spatial domains with various scales is one of the key developments of monitoring spatial variability of soil salinity. In addition, geo-statistical methods have the capability of producing prediction surfaces from limited sample data. This study aims to map spatial distribution of soil salinity in the selected pilot area which is located in the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, by applying geo-statistical methods. A kriging based map and three different co-kriging based maps were produced using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements as primary variable and three different soil salinity index values as secondary variable. Three soil salinity indices were created by using Sentinel-2A image that were acquired in the same date of field measurements to generate 3 various soil salinity prediction maps. Salinity maps obtained from geo-statistical methods were compared and validated to understand the performance of these approaches for soil salinity prediction.

This paper proposes an automatic method of detection and monitoring of anarchic urban expansions starting from multi-sources and multi-temporal data (VHR satellite images and geographic information data). First, the illegal urban areas are extracted using an original SVM based technique integrating expert knowledge and auxiliary data by means of ontology construction. This leads to the formalization of the expert semantic information and the urban construction rules (often in sentences form) and their confrontation with the classification results. Secondly, a spatio-temporal regions' similarity framework is proposed using a novel matrix based on Multi-dimensional histograms Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). To this end, an explicit definition of a Spatio-Temporal Region (STR) is given in order to build its characteristic matrix called Multi-Temporal Region Matrix (MTRM). Afterwards, using this matrix, a Cross-STR Similarity Matrix (CSTRSM) is computed between STR of in order to reveal regions with similar temporal fingerprint.

The study area consists of 4 open pit mines surrounded by forestry area located in the Antalya province which is nearby the Mediterranean Sea known as one of the most popular holiday destinations in Turkey. Opposite to the expansion of the mine areas forestry area decreases in this region. To quantify the decrease in the forestry area multi-temporal satellite imageries were used for 4 open pit mines. Used data were Spot 5 and Spot 6 satellite images with spatial resolution of 5 m and 6 m respectively. Spatial change was determined by applying object-based classification method for all satellite images. Accuracy analyses were made by means of overall accuracy and kappa statistic values. The overall accuracy values of the classified imageries of 2011, 2014 and 2017 were respectively 94.81%, 94.0% and 97.1% with the kappa statistical values of 0.9212, 0.9070 and 0.9538. According to the results of these classifications, the area values covered by the mines in the study area were respectively 55.06, 77.02 and 103.10 hectares in 2011, 2014 and 2017. Additionally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used in one of the mine areas in order to realistic evaluation of an area by using orthophotos. Two orthophotos with the pixel sizes of 4 cm and 7 cm were produced from multi-temporal aerial photographs. As a result of the study, it can be said that remotely sensed imageries are the main data to temporal follow-up of the mine areas. In this context, UAVs have been shown to be a better option for monitoring the environmental effects of mining areas when criteria such as acquisition of the data, accuracy, speed and time are evaluated. The difficulty of finding an optimal satellite image in terms of cost and different types of resolutions such as spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal make the use of UAVs more prominent. © by PSP","Antalya [Turkey]; Mediterranean Sea; Turkey; aerial photograph; detection method; environmental effect; environmental impact; forest ecosystem; mining; open pit mine; orthophoto; photogrammetry; pixel; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; SPOT; unmanned vehicle","Change Detection; Classification; Forest; Mine; Photogrammetry; Spot; Uav","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075302337"

Topographic effects are induced by the imaging conditions and tend to be large in high mountainous regions. Therefore, image analysis on mountainous terrain such as estimation of wildfire damage assessment requires appropriate topographic normalization techniques to yield accurate image processing results. However, most of the previous studies focused on the evaluation of topographic normalization on satellite images with moderate-low spatial resolution. Thus, the alleviation of topographic effects on multi-temporal high-resolution images was not dealt enough. In this study, the evaluation of terrain normalization was performed for each band to select the optimal technical combinations for rapid and accurate wildfire damage assessment using PlanetScope images. PlanetScope has considerable potential in the disaster management field as it satisfies the rapid image acquisition by providing the 3 m resolution daily image with global coverage. For comparison of topographic normalization techniques, seven widely used methods were employed on both pre-fire and post-fire images. The analysis on bi-temporal images suggests the optimal combination of techniques which can be applied on images with different land-cover composition. Then, the vegetation index was calculated from the images after the topographic normalization with the proposed method. The wildfire damage detection results were obtained by thresholding the index and showed improvements in detection accuracy for both object-based and pixel-based image analysis.

In the Alps Perennial Snow Patches have been considered to protect permafrost from solar radiation and are used as an indicator for the occurrence of local permafrost. In this study perennial snow fields are detected and classified based on aerial and satellite images. Effects of climatic and topographic factors on the snow field occurrence are investigated aiming to provide insight into the distribution of local permafrost in northern Iceland. Multi-temporal optical satellite images (Landsat-5/-7/-8 and Sentinel-2, 1984–2017) have revealed a time-variable distribution of perennial snow patches as possible permafrost indicators on the Tröllaskagi Peninsula in northern Iceland. Calculated normal-ized difference snow index in combination with different threshold values at the end of summer season within six selected study areas show that several snow patches are present in a time period of over 30 years. Perennial snow patches in the study areas exhibit strong fluctuations in extent due to different local characteristics, e.g. elevation, aspect or topography (plateau/open slopes vs. valleys/cirques). In three of the six study areas snow patches have a high probability of occurrence and the pattern of the distribution is very similar in each time period. Comparison with climate data from nearby weather stations indicates that perennial snow patches can be used in combination with mean annual air temperatures as indicators for local permafrost distributions. © 2019, Iceland Glaciological Society.

The article briefly presents an analytical review of the key work of domestic and foreign scientists on the studied problem. The functional structure of the objects of the natural-ecological framework of the not built-up territories is presented. The method of automated identification of the structure of not built-up areas using satellite imagery is theoretically justified. The basis for identifying the structure of objects of the natural-ecological framework is the formation of an index image based on the near-IR, short-wave IR and red channels. This allows to concentrate in one image the greatest amount of spectral-reflective information about the objects of the natural-ecological framework. The main element of such objects is vegetation, therefore the combination of the indicated spectral channels of a multispectral image allows to obtain more information about the object being studied, its structure and state. The article presents a methodology for monitoring changes in the objects of the natural-ecological framework using an algorithm written in the programming language MATLAB. The method of monitoring the detection of changes in objects of the natural-ecological framework is based on the selection of their contours in a series of multi-temporal space images using an automated algorithm written in the MATLAB language. The choice of this approach is substantiated by the fact that most researchers use methods of controlled classification for such surveys, which do not give a high accuracy in isolating the contours of objects of the natural-ecological framework. The use of an automated algorithm in the specified programming language allows, based on the determination of the threshold values of the spectral-brightness characteristics of objects of the natural-ecological framework, to distinguish their contours with sufficiently high accuracy. The selection of contours is made for a series of multi-time satellite images, on the basis of which the resulting image is constructed using the spacing module. On the base of resulting images the author's original map of changes in objects of the natural-ecological framework is compiled. Experimental studies conducted on a test area to test the developed methods showed their effectiveness, correctness and representativeness of the results obtained, which, ultimately, allows to monitor the state of the land of not built-up areas with a sufficiently high level of detail. © 2019 Publishing House ""O- Kratkoe"".

It does not provide the in-season information for researchers and decision makers for both practical and scientific purposes. While satellite images have desirable spectral and spatial information for classification, the ability to extract temporal information in satellite data remains a challenge due to revisiting frequency and gaps in the time period of capturing the data. To circumvent this challenge and generate more accurate results for an in-season crop-type classification, we have used Rectified Linear Unit (RLU) approach based on the concept of deep neural networks for intelligent and scalable computation of the classification process. The work was carried out on Nanjangud Taluk located in Mysuru District, Karnataka state on a Landsat data (multi-temporal scene) from 2010 to 2015. The results indicate that RLU shows an improvement of 5% to 15% for overall classification accuracy at 3 classes over the traditional against support vector machine.

The aim of this study was to detect and predict LULC changes in the Arasbaran region using an integrated Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov Chain analysis. At the first step, multi-temporal Landsat images (1990, 2002 and 2014) were processed using ancillary data and were classified into seven LULC categories of high density forest, low-density forest, agriculture, grassland, barren land, water and urban area. Next, LULC changes were detected for three time profiles, 1990–2002, 2002–2014 and 1990–2014. A 2014 LULC map of the study area was further simulated (for model performance evaluation) applying 1990 and 2002 map layers. In addition, a collection of spatial variables was also used for modeling LULC change processes as driving forces. The actual and simulated 2014 LULC change maps were cross-tabulated and compared to ensure model simulation success and the results indicated an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 97.79% and 0.992, respectively. Having the model properly validated, LULC change was predicted up to the year 2025. The results demonstrated that 992 and 1592 ha of high and low-density forests were degraded during 1990–2014, respectively, while 422 ha were added to the extent of residential areas with a growth rate of 17.58 ha per year. The developed model predicted a considerable degradation trend for the forest categories through 2025, accounting for 489 and 531 ha of loss for high and low-density forests, respectively. By way of contrast, residential area and farmland categories will increase up to 211 and 427 ha, respectively. The integrated prediction model and customary area data can be used for practical management efforts by simulating vegetation dynamics and future LULC change trajectories. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Iran; agricultural land; artificial neural network; forest ecosystem; growth rate; integrated approach; land cover; land use; land use change; Markov chain; modeling; prediction; satellite imagery; vegetation dynamics","Artificial neural network; Land change modeler; Land use changes; Prediction; Satellite images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045883289"

Change detection can be divided into pixel-based change detection and object-based change detection. Although pixel-based change detection is traditional method which is mostly used because of its simple algorithms and relatively easy quantitative analysis, applying this method in VHR (Very High Resolution) images cause misdetection or noise. Because of this, pixel-based change detection is less utilized in VHR images. In addition, the sensor of acquisition or geographical characteristics bring registration noise even if co-registration is conducted. Registration noise is a barrier that reduces accuracy when extracting spatial information for utilizing VHR images. In this study object-based change detection of VHR images was performed considering registration noise. In this case, object-based change detection results were derived considering various pixel-based change detection methods, and the major voting technique was applied in the process with segmentation image.

Land use has undergone an awful transformation due to rapid urbanization and population growth, which in turn increased land surface temperature (LST) in district Peshawar, Pakistan. The current study tends to capture the influence of land use on LST and agricultural productivity by employing multi-temporal, multispectral satellite data and agricultural production data during the selected years, i.e., 1996, 2003, and 2016. The results demonstrated that barren land considerably decreased while the urban area increased over time in all three phases. Furthermore, significant LST difference was found in different land cover units; e.g., barren land and urban area have the maximum, while water bodies followed by vegetation retain minimum LST in all three phases, i.e., 1996, 2003, and 2016. Similarly, the results from agricultural production revealed that except for wheat crops, which decreased by 7.54% during 1999–2003, the production of all major food crops increased during the selected years. However, the production of sugar cane and barley experienced considerable reduction during the selected years, except for barley, which increased by 22.86% during 2003–2016.

Conventionally, monitoring was done by field survey required a lot of human resources, time consuming and coverage limitation. In this collaboration project, multi-temporal Radarsat-2 images within 11 to 14 days acquisition together with cadaster lot and paddy crop calendar were used to classify four (4) major paddy-planting stages such as ploughing, irrigating, planting and harvesting. Result indicate that Radarsat-2 time-series images were highly beneficial in differentiating paddy planting stages with an accuracy of 94.17%.

In particular, we assume that there is a large undiscovered potential in multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) for topographic mapping. In this study, automated change detection from multitemporal multispectral ALS data was tested for the first time. The results showed that direct comparisons between height and intensity data from different dates reveal even small changes related to the development of a suburban area. A major challenge in future work is to link the changes with objects that are interesting in map production. In order to effectively utilize multisource remotely sensed data in mapping in the future, we also investigated the potential of satellite images and ground-based data to complement multispectral ALS. A method for continuous change monitoring from a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed and tested. Finally, a high-density point cloud was acquired with terrestrial mobile laser scanning and automatically classified into four classes. The results were compared with the ALS data, and the possible roles of the different data sources in a future map updating process were discussed. © The Authors.

The sensor design and geometric calibration technologies have improved with the development and application of stereo mapping satellites (ZY-3). However, the imaging systems typically use the linear CCD imaging technology. The long focal length and narrow field angle causes the geometrical model to have 3D parallel projection characteristics, and the satellite images will still have residual system errors caused by the drift error of satellite-borne GPS/IMU and asynchrony between the pose and trace of the satellite, especially after the rigorous on-orbit geometry calibration. A block adjustment technique is still required to meet the requirements of remote sensing monitoring and mapping application. Therefore, satellite images-based accurate positioning without ground control point information is the precondition to obtain the global geographic and resource environmental information and monitoring changes in the global resource environment. The accuracy of "" ZY-3"" satellite image is improved to 15 m after calibration and its internal precision is better than 1 pixel. After the overall block adjustment without GCPs, the plane and elevation accuracy of the image can be improved to 5 m (medium error). In this study, on the basis of the widely used optimization method of solving the constraint problem in photogrammetry-alternating direction method (ADM) and RFM least-squares block adjustment, we propose a GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale domestic high-resolution optical satellite images-GCP-independent satellite imagery block adjustment (GISIBA) based on the geometric features of ZY-3 satellite images. The proposed method is highly efficient and easy to parallelize. GISIBA of satellite images can be considered as the overall block adjustment of the multi-source optical satellite imagery with specific constraints (distance, angle, etc.) when no ground control points are available. Most GCP-independent adjustments use a form of virtual control points. However, the precision of these virtual control points is low (varied system error), and the precision is inconsistent in the measurement area. Thus, the GCP-independent adjustment is a type of block adjustment under different precision controls. The law of error propagation of this approach is complex, and gross error detection and positioning are difficult to perform using this approach. This study presents an "" average"" virtual control point-based stereoscopic GCP-independent block adjustment method for large-scale satellite image GISIBA. On the basis of the automatic and reliable acquisition of uniformly distributed image tie points, the method comprehensively uses the "" ADM"" introduced from aerial photogrammetry and RFM-based least squares adjustment algorithm to realize the combined block adjustment of satellite images. First, the "" ADM"" is used to solve the initial values of the unknowns and to perform automatic detection and elimination of the above medium-scale gross error based on the parallel processing platform. All unknowns are assigned priori weights based on the results. Next, the RFM-based least square method is used to solve the large-scale reformation normal equation to obtain the orientation parameters with high-precision, which meets the production requirement of high-precision image products. Block adjustment by constructing virtual "" average"" control points addresses the "" rank"" problems in the GCP-independent adjustment and improves the state of normal equation of the block adjustment system, which benefits the stability and fast convergence of the block. Moreover, the method makes it convenient to analyze the relationship among the data coverage, imaging time interval, and satellite image GCP-independent block adjustment. In addition, parallel processing based on the OMP parallel method is used to realize the parallel processing of the "" ADM"" and multi-thread parallel computing based on least-squares adjustment to ensure the efficiency of block adjustment. We used multiple sets of the ZY-3 satellite image data in typical regions to verify our method. The following experiment results are summarized as follows: 1) On the basis of the widely used optimization method of constraint problem called the "" ADM"" and RFM least-squares block adjustment, the proposed GISIBA method is easy to parallelize and is highly efficient in terms of reliability, accuracy, and performance of the developed procedure. 2) In this method, virtual "" average"" control points are built to solve the rank defect problem and qualitative and quantitative analyses in block adjustment without control. Assuming the positioning accuracy is located on the same number order (such as 50 m), the final positioning accuracy of satellite image must be improved after GCP-independent block adjustment by using the virtual "" average"" control points. The final positional accuracy is stronger than the worst initial positioning accuracy of the original image. Furthermore, the increase on the coverage of satellite images does not consistently improve the overall positioning accuracy. However, the use of considerable high-resolution satellite images to cover the same area improves the positioning accuracy after the final block adjustment in the statistical sense. The horizontal and vertical accuracies of multi-covered and multi-temporal satellite images are greater than 6 m and 5 m, respectively. 3) The mosaic problem of adjacent areas in large area DOM production can be solved when third-party geographic information data are introduced as horizontal and vertical constraints. This approach is considered as weak-sense auxiliary control in the block adjustment process. © 2019, Science Press.

To investigate the efficiency of Chinese Gaofen satellite imagery, in this study the GF-1 and GF-2 of Moyu County south of the Tarim Basin were studied. Based on Chinese GF-1 and GF-2 satellite imagery features, this study has developed a comprehensive feature extraction and intercropping classification scheme. Textural features derived from a Gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and vegetation features derived from multi-temporal GF-1 and GF-2 satellites were introduced and combined into three different groups. The rotation forest method was then adopted based on a Support Vector Machine (RoF-SVM), which offers the advantage of using an SVM algorithm and that boosts the diversity of individual base classifiers by a rotation forest. The combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features achieved the best classification result. The results were compared with those of the maximum likelihood classifier, support vector machine and random forest method. It is shown that the RoF-SVM algorithm for the combined spectral-textural-multitemporal features can effectively classify an intercropping area (overall accuracy of 86.87% and kappa coefficient of 0.78), and the classification result effectively eliminated salt and pepper noise. Furthermore, the GF-1 and GF-2 satellite images combined with spectral, textural, and multi-temporal features can provide sufficient information on vegetation cover located in an extremely complex and diverse intercropping area. © 2019 by the authors.","","Classifier ensemble; GF-2; Intercropping classification; Rotation forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072079748"

This interaction triggers multiple processes, which lend specificity to their coasts. Intertidal environments called marshes are developed in estuarine littorals, which have been intensely modified in large urban metropolises. These environments dynamics have been extensively studied in the northern hemisphere, but scarce research has been performed in the southern hemisphere. In the present work a multitemporal study of a recent developed marsh is done in the coast of Punta Atalaya (district of Magdalena, Buenos Aires, Argentina), located along the intermediate sector of the Argentine coast of the Río de la Plata estuary, using the coastline as an indicator, considering it as the outer limit of this environment. The study was based on its identification in aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images during the 1929-2016 period. Using specialized software for the multi-temporal change analysis, field work and general and specific bibliography review, an explanatory approximation of the littoral dynamics of this territory was performed. It was determined that the coast of Punta Atalaya presents an accretional tendency during the last century, although changes in the temporal and spatial micro scale are detected throughout the period, responding to accretional and erosive dynamics that derive from the interaction of biological, sedimentary, meteorological and social processes. Each process can trigger multiple responses and have differential impacts in time and space. In this sense, the concepts of balance used in the classic coastal sedimentary balance investigations are questioned. The study area does not have a protected area category, so its environmental assessment in this sense must consider dynamical processes. © 2019 John Wiley and Sons Inc..

The DEM supports the modeling studies of sand-dune evolution using multi-temporal satellite images and ground truth data, obtained through the post-processed kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning. The study area is located at the border of three major neotropical ecosystems: the Amazonia, Caatinga, and Brazilian savanna. It is located in the northeastern state of Maranhão and encompasses the largest dune fields in the country. Wide shrubby areas (restingas, in Portuguese), lakes, mangroves, and a multitude off reshwater lagoons compose the park’s natural environments.

Geodetic techniques and precision mapping were employed to monitor the short-term coastal dynamics. The use of GNSS receivers is justified by the difficulty of mapping the dune’s features using conventional methods such as theodolite, level, and total station systems, due to their high cost, time restriction sand low data precision. Surface surveys were carried out annually between December 2015 and January 2017 to create a DEM.

This study aimed to assess the dynamics of cropland in West African cities over time and space, to identify key drivers, and to report the effects of changing cropland on farmers and farmers’ resilience strategies. Cities studied were Accra (Ghana), Bamako (Mali), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), and Bamenda (Cameroon). Methodology involved multi-temporal spatial analysis of satellite images and farmer surveys. Results showed that the share of urban land covered by cropland differed in these cities, with higher shares in Accra and Bamenda, which included rainfed cultivation. Over the past 15 years, Accra has lost large shares of its farming areas, both in the inner-urban areas as well as in the fringe, whereas loss in Bamenda has been less substantial. In Ouagadougou and Bamako, where only irrigated sites were captured, cropland has shifted to the fringes but increased overall. Key drivers influencing the direction of change were official support of urban farming (or lack thereof), population pressure, and the availability of public open spaces that are not suitable for construction. In cities with decreasing cropland, implications included diminishing individual farm sizes, intensification of remaining sites, cessation of farming in the city, and the shift to other sites, which—apart from the physical availability of land and related resources—depends on social relations and informal rules. © 2020 The Authors.

The results showed that from 1972 to 2016, glacier coverage decreased by 41.1 km2, leaving only 62.1 km2 extant in 2016. The mean rate of change in glacier surface elevation asl was −18.7 ± 1.2 m (−0.43 ± 0.03 m a−1) over the same period. In situ measured data from Ningchan No.1 Glacier (NC01), combined with meteorological records, were also employed to develop a spatially distributed degree-day model for the LLM glaciers. These two approaches yielded similar results, allowing the reconstruction of a consistent time series that detailed annual changes in glacier mass over the past 44 years. In addition, we calculated that the mean annual glacial meltwater-fed streamflow from 1972 to 2013 in the Jiutiaoling Basin (JTLB) northeast of the LLM was equivalent to 1.4 × 107 m3, or 4.6% of the area's total annual streamflow. It is remarkable that, in years when streamflow was relatively lower, such as 1972, 1991 and 2013, glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion (more than 8%) of the streamflow. © 2019","China; Qilian Mountains; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Glacial geology; Maps; Remote sensing; Stream flow; Degree-day method; Geodetic method; Glacier mass balance; Lenglongling Mountains; Surface elevations; digital elevation model; elevation; glacier mass balance; meltwater; modeling; mountain region; numerical method; satellite data; satellite imagery; streamflow; ZiYuan; Landforms","Degree-day method; Geodetic method; Glacier mass balance; Glacier surface elevation; Lenglongling Mountains","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070701181"

Satellite imagery are powerful and up-to-date data for estimation human impact on urban space. It is also highlighted the possibility of using those results in urban development studies according to adaptation cities to climate change.

They are used in an important ways in climate change studies and analysis and monitoring of ground state changes. In this study, we propose a land cover classification method by characterizing multi-temporal pattern in Modis and GOCI NDVI time series data. We applied it to the Modis and GOCI multi-temporal data over the Korean Peninsula and compared the classification results. Since many parts of the satellite image data are unobserved or have malicious information, data restoration process is essential to estimate the accurate temporal characteristics. In this paper, an adaptive reconstruction system is employed to reconstruct a series of NDVI time series at real-time intervals. Then, a harmonic analysis is applied to the reconstructed NDVI data for classification of the land covers. The vegetation type of the surface varies with time and has seasonal variation characteristics. The time series of vegetation with seasonal characteristics can be modeled by using harmonic function. In this study, multi-periodic harmonic models were used: the four cycles (1 year, 6 month, 3 month, 1 month cycle). Classification was carried out using the reconstructed NDVI data of MODIS and GOCI for 5 years from 2012 to 2016. The results show that the proposed methodology can be usefully employed for land cover classification and change detection over the Korean Peninsula using MODIS and GOCI time series data. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

In Turkey, wheat production is very important, and it is widely planted in Anatolia and in Southeastern Turkey. In this study, four different classification types were evaluated for wheat determination. As a study area, the region of Islahiye and Nurdagi counties of Gaziantep, Turkey was chosen. As satellite data, a Landsat 8 OLI image acquired on April 10, 2017 was used. The ground-truth points that were collected in surveying, and additionally field information taken from farmer registration system provided by local administrations were used as references. The application was done by classification of the satellite image using four different methods (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Condition-Based and Nearest Neighbor). After the results were obtained, the wheat classes obtained were transformed to vector format to overlay on the satellite image for visual analysis. The area of wheat class obtained from each method was presented and compared. The results were also evaluated by comparing with the data taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. All of the methods provided results close to the Turkish Statistical Institute records. Even the results were not significantly different from each other, wheat area determined using Support Vector Machine classification was better than others. The accuracy assessments were performed by calculating the total accuracy and KAPPA/KIA coefficient. The accuracy assessment analysis showed that the three supervised methods were better than the unsupervised one.

To minimize the negative impacts of mining on the environment, it is highly recommended to adopt sustainable mining practices along with proper and regular monitoring of mining activities. In this research study, 32 years of Landsat satellite data from 1984 to 2016 was used to map the spatiotemporal changes in coal mining activities of the World’s largest North Antelope Rochelle and Black Thunder coal fields of the United States of America. Digital image processing of satellite images was done and the Maximum Likelihood Classification algorithm was applied to quantify the land cover changes in the region. The most appropriate band selection was done for the identification of coal seams through satellite images. The results showed that the Shortwave Infrared-2, Near Infrared and Green bands of Landsat satellite, highlighted as Red, Green, and Blue respectively are proven to be very effective in the identification of areas of coal mining. The classification results showed that since 1984, coal mining has been expanded by 74,000 ha with an increase of more than 87% in thirty-two years. Whereas almost 94% decrease in the vegetation cover of the region was also observed during the same period of time.

They are aiding in filling in the gap between agricultural production and needs required to feed the increasing population. Availability of detailed accurate land resources information is quite necessary to support land reclamation, conservation and management. The current study is aimed to explain previous investments in Egyptian land resources mapping, using recent technologies of multi-temporal satellite images and geographic information systems. Moreover, a digital information platform will be opened to store further future expected resources information. A GIS database was created, where previously produced analogue soil maps, covering the whole inhabited areas at the Egyptian Nile basin, Northern coast and desert oases, were input in digital format. Available topographic survey maps, at a scale of 1:100,000 were also used to extract different thematic layers (i.e. roads, rail ways, irrigation and drainage canals and infrastructure networks). Multi-temporal LANDSAT, SPOT and SRTM satellite images were processed and classified to produce land use and DEM GIS layers and to detect temporal changes. It was found that 45% of the Nile Delta and 15.5% of the valley are characterized by high production capability. Urban encroachment was found often occurring at the expense of most fertile soils, classified as Typic Torrifluvents and Vertic Torrifluvents. The imbalance between irrigation and drain network lengths, of some areas, refers to its impact on accelerating land degradation, water logging and salinization. Creation of the database saved previous major projects outcome data and will still be opened to add further future expected georeferenced information. Its accurate integration nature makes it rather important for decision support and management of sustainable development plans. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","","Agriculture; Database; Egypt; GIS; Land resources; Nile Delta; Remote sensing; Satellite images","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055344629"

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a ""full optical"" approach, the ""combined"" method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Decision trees; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Space-based radar; Surveying; Synthetic aperture radar; Time series; Tracking radar; Water management; Crop mapping; Irrigated crops; LANDSAT; Random forests; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; Mapping","Irrigated crops; Landsat-8; Random Forest; Satellite image time series; Seasonal crop mapping; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060670633"

Recent research has demonstrated that the change detection methodologies using satellite images, such as multi-temporal visible light remote sensing image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, are particularly useful for damage assessment after various disasters, e.g., earthquakes, fires, floods, and landslides. The level set method, because of its implicit handling of topological changes and low sensitivity to noise, is one of the most effective unsupervised change detection techniques for satellite images. The signed pressure force function (SPF) improved the performances of conventional level set methods through including two grayscale parameters, i.e., the average pixel intensity inside and outside the contour, respectively. However, the mean of region pixel intensity is not a good indicator in case that the images are inhomogeneities grayscale, e.g., confused-edge objects in satellite images. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel model, denoted as dynamic SPF (D-SPF) model, which can dynamically learn a discriminative indicator for distinguishing the pixels inside or outside the contour. Specifically, the principle of maximizing entropy between the regions inside and outside the contour is used to learn the K distinguish parameters, which help to guide the segmentation contour to end on the object’s edge. The experiments are conducted on a public satellite image dataset, i.e., ERS, which contain 670 SAR and 670 optical images; each image covers approximately 150 m2 area including forests, lakes, and cities, etc. These images are challenging due to the inhomogeneities of landforms and unknown natural disasters. The experimental results demonstrate that D-SPF model reduces almost 30.4% missed detection rate on the optical images and 41.2% missed detection rate on the SAR images in comparison with SPF and obtains the best detection performances in ERS dataset. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Damage detection; Disasters; Drag reduction; Drop breakup; Geometrical optics; Level measurement; Numerical methods; Pixels; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Image change detection; Level Set method; Remote sensing images; Signed pressure forces; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; Unsupervised change detection; Visible-light remote sensing; Radar imaging","Change detection; Dynamic signed pressure force model; Level set method; Remote sensing image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081668928"

Estimation of wildfire damage provides the information on wildfire-induced ecological changes and supports the decision-making process for post-fire treatment activities. For accurate wildfire damage assessment, the discrimination between disaster-induced and natural changes is crucial because they usually coupled together. In this study, Sentinel-2 images were employed to assess the damage from a wildfire, which occurred in the coniferous forest of Gangneung, Gangwon Province, South Korea on April 2019. The images were captured from both Sentinel-2A and-2B, shortening the temporal interval of available pre-and post-fire images. Multi-temporal image analysis was performed in both object and pixel-based with two commonly used spectral indices, NDVI and NBR. Additional image pair from the same period of 2018 was used to distinguish the fire-affected regions from the naturally changed area and compared with the results from using only one pair of images from 2019. The experimental results showed that the change detection performance could be affected by the number of image pairs and spectral indices used to discriminate burned region from unburned region. Thus it verified the significance of adequately employing annual multi-pair satellite images for wildfire damage assessment. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Climate change; Decision making; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Ecology; Fires; Image analysis; Change detection; Multitemporal image analysis; OBIA; Sentinel-2; Wildfire damages; Damage detection","Change detection; Multi-temporal image analysis; OBIA; Sentinel-2; Wildfire damage assessment","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074298942"

The technique used relied on a two-stage hybrid classification process: the first stage applied a knowledge-driven learning scheme to provide a land cover map (LC), including deciduous vegetation and other classes, without the need of reference training data; the second stage exploited a data-driven classification to: (i) discriminate pixels of the invasive species found within the deciduous vegetation layer of the LC map; (ii) determine the most favourable seasons for such recognition. In the second stage, when a traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier was used, the results obtained with multi-temporal July and October WV-2 images, showed an output Overall Accuracy (OA) value of ≈91%. To increase such a value, first a low-pass median filtering was used with a resulting OA of 99.2%, then, a Support Vector Machine classifier was applied obtaining the best A. altissima User's Accuracy (UA) and OA values of 82.47% and 97.96%, respectively, without any filtering. When instead of the full multi-spectral bands set some spectral vegetation indices computed from the same months were used the UA and OA values decreased. The findings reported suggest that multi-temporal, very high resolution satellite imagery can be effective for A. altissima mapping, especially when airborne hyperspectral data are unavailable. Since training data are required only in the second stage to discriminate A. altissima from other deciduous plants, the use of the first stage LC mapping as pre-filter can render the hybrid technique proposed cost and time effective. Multi-temporal VHR data and the hybrid system suggested may offer new opportunities for invasive plant monitoring and follow up of management decision. © 2018 The Authors","Italy; Ailanthus altissima; Classification (of information); Decision support systems; Hybrid systems; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Median filters; Passive filters; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Alien species; Invasive species; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Novel ecosystems; Support vector machine classifiers; Very high resolution satellite imagery; Very high resolution satellite images; Worldview-2; accuracy assessment; airborne survey; deciduous tree; ecosystem dynamics; grassland; image classification; image resolution; introduced species; invasive species; land cover; maximum likelihood analysis; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; support vector machine; vegetation mapping; WorldView; Information management","Ailanthus altissima mapping; Alien species; Invasive species; multi-temporal WorldView-2 data; Novel ecosystems; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056756443"

As a result, a significant amount of land degradation and environmental change has occurred, particularly in the outskirts of the city. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute's (TUIK) report for 2018, Istanbul is the most populous city in Turkey, reaching to 15 million. For the rise of human needs, new transportation structures including roads, airports and bridges have been lately built in the city. Hence, the construction of built-up areas has led to an essential fluctuation in land use/land cover (LULC) in the region. The construction of the Istanbul Grand Airport (IGA) (2014-2018) and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge (2012-2016) have affected the wetlands and forests directly affecting ecological habitat. In this study, two satellite images acquired in July 2013 and April 2018 from Landsat 8 OLI/TIR were employed to investigate the LULC changes in the city. In this context, six main LULC classes namely, water, road, bare soil, urban area, forest and agriculture were determined. The five-year period of change detection of city was performed by using object-based image analysis (OBIA) using multi-resolution segmentation algorithm. The LULC types from the created image segments were determined by using spectral indices, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, brightness and maximum difference of spectral bands. In the classification phase, the nearest neighborhood classifier was applied for producing LULC thematic maps using the multi-temporal images. In parallel to the construction of the IGA (new Istanbul airport) and Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, a noteworthy increase in urbanization was observed. Particularly, the area of road class has vastly expanded on a spatial basis, almost doubled in size. Another important finding is that acreage of land water bodies decreased about 500 ha due to the construction of IGA on wetlands and marshlands. Results showed that the study site was subject to approximately 24% LULC change, and the highest change occurred between bare soil and forest classes, corresponding to 5% transition between these classes. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

At the end of the CPEC, the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea is being built quickly, providing an important economical route for the flow of Central Asia's natural resources to the world. Gwadar city is in a rapid urbanization process and will be developed as a modern, world-class port city in the near future. Therefore, monitoring the urbanization process of Gwadar at both high spatial and temporal resolution is vital for its urban planning, city ecosystem management, and the sustainable development of CPEC. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) is an essential quantitative indicator for the assessment of urban development. Through the integration of remote sensing images and ISP estimation models, ISP can be routinely and periodically estimated. However, due to clouds' influence and spatial-temporal resolution trade-offs in sensor design, it is difficult to estimate the ISP with both high spatial resolution and dense temporal frequency from only one satellite sensor. In recent years, China has launched a series of Earth resource satellites, such as the HJ (Huangjing, which means environment in Chinese)-1A/B constellation, showing great application potential for rapid Earth surface mapping. This study employs the Random Forest (RF) method for a long-term and fine-scale ISP estimation and analysis of the city of Gwadar, based on the density in temporal and multi-source Chinese satellite images. In the method, high spatial resolution ISP reference data partially covering Gwadar city was first extracted from the 1-2 meter (m) GF (GaoFen, which means high spatial resolution in Chinese)-1/2 fused images. An RF retrieval model was then built based on the training samples extracted from ISP reference data and multi-temporal 30-m HJ-1A/B satellite images. Lastly, the model was used to generate the 30-m time series ISP from 2009 to 2017 for the whole city area based on the HJ-1A/B images. Results showed that the mean absolute error of the estimated ISP was 6.1-8.1% and that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimation results was 12.82-15.03%, indicating the consistently high performance of the model. This study highlights the feasibility and potential of using multi-source Chinese satellite images and an RF model to generate long-term ISP estimations for monitoring the urbanization process of the key node city in the CPEC. © 2019 by the authors.","","China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); GF-1/2; HJ-1A/B constellation; Impervious surface; Random forest; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075519676"

This study aims to assess and monitor the transformation of pastoral land to agricultural land in the arid environment of the Feija Basin (Southeast of Morocco) and to find the key drivers and the issues resulting from this transformation. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to multi-temporal (1975–2017) and multi-sensor (i.e. Multi-spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper, and Operational Land Imager) Landsat satellite images, from which land use classifications were derived. The remote sensing data in combination with ground reference data (household level), groundwater and climate statistics were used to validate and explain the derived land use change maps. The results of the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural lands show two patterns of changes, a middle expansion from 1975 to 2007, and a rapid expansion from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the overall accuracy demonstrated a high accuracy of 94.4%. In 1975 and 1984, the agricultural lands in Feija covered 0.17 km2 and 1.32 km2, respectively, compared with 20.10 km2 in 2017. Since the adoption of the Green Morocco Plan in 2008, the number of watermelon farms and wells has increased rapidly in the study area, which induced a piezometric level drawdown. The results show that spectral mixture analysis yields high accuracies for agricultural lands extraction in arid dry lands and accounts for mixed pixels issues. Results of this study can be used by local administrators to prepare an effective environmental management plan of these fragile drylands. The proposed method can be replicated in other regions to analyse land transformation in similar arid conditions. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Morocco; agricultural land; GIS; land use; Landsat; monitoring; pixel; remote sensing; time series analysis","GIS; Land use monitoring; Landsat images; Linear-mixture analysis; Morocco; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070943151"

Heavy metal stress in crops poses a serious threat to crop quality and human health. However, differentiating between heavy metal and non-heavy metal stress presents a great challenge, since responses to environmental stress in crops are complex and uncertain, with different stressors possibly triggering similar canopy reflectance responses. This study aims to infer the occurrence probability of heavy metal stress (i.e., Cd stress) on a regional scale by integrating satellite-derived vegetation index and spatio-temporal characteristics of different stressors with a Bayesian method. The study area is located in the Hunan Province, China. Seven scenes of Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2016 to 2017 were collected, as well as Cd concentrations in the soil. First, the probability of rice being stressed was screened using the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE) at all the growth stages of rice. Further, the stressed rice was used as input, along with the coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from NDRE, for a Bayesian method to infer rice exposed to Cd pollution. The results demonstrated that NDRE was a sensitive indicator for assessing stress levels in rice crops. The CSTV with a threshold of 2.7 successfully detected rice under Cd as well as abrupt stress on a regional scale. A high map accuracy for Cd induced stress in rice was achieved with an accuracy of 81.57%. This study suggests that vegetation index obtained from satellite images can assist in capturing crop stress, and that the used Bayesian method can be very useful for distinguishing a specific stressor in crops by incorporating temporal-spatial characteristic of different stressors in crops into satellite-derived vegetation index. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bayes Theorem; China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Oryza; Satellite Imagery; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Stress, Physiological; Bayesian networks; Cadmium; Health risks; Satellites; Vegetation; cadmium; heavy metal; heavy metal; Bayesian methods; Heavy metal stress; Multi-temporal satellite images; Occurrence probability; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Temporal-spatial characteristics; Bayesian analysis; heavy metal; probability; rice; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial variation; temporal variation; vegetation index; accuracy; Article; Bayes theorem; biological monitoring; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental exposure; nonhuman; normalized difference red edge index; plant growth; plant stress; rice; satellite imagery; screening test; sensitivity analysis; soil chemistry; vegetation; analysis; Bayes theorem; crop; environmental monitoring; human; Oryza; physiological stress; physiology; pollution; procedures; soil; soil pollutant; statistics and numerical data; Crops","Bayesian method; Coefficients of spatio-temporal variation; Heavy metal stress; Sentinel-2 images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060544485"

In the current study, we aim to detect the accurate location of the ancient theater using archaeological prospection tools, data collected from the excavated sites, and testimonies of people of the modern city. For the first step of the approach, the approximate location of the ancient theater was determined using information derived by archived geospatial data (multi-temporal aerial photographs, satellite image, and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) of the area) as well as information regarding the neighboring excavated sites. For the in-depth study of the area of interest, a drone was used for the acquisition of high-resolution geospatial data. The generated orthorectified image (3 cm spatial resolution), DTM, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) allowed the determination of the potential location of the buried orchestra’s center using geometric rules for the design of ancient theaters.

Given this spatial complexity and temporal variability, the construction of reference maps useful for geo-engineering is a challenge. In order to improve the performance of geomorphic models, reliable multiscale and multi-temporal base maps and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are needed. The work presented in this paper addresses this issue using an inter-geo-disciplinary approach to optimize the processing of multisource and multi-temporal data and DEMs by using field surveys, conceptual model, and analytical computation on a test area. The data acquired with two surveying techniques were analyzed and compared: Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) and photogrammetry from stereo pairs of High-Resolution Satellite Images (HRSI). To assess the reliability of the DEMs produced from point clouds, the residuals between the point cloud and the interpolated filtered surface were identified and analyzed statistically. In addition to the contour maps, some feature maps such as slope, planar, and profile curvature maps were produced and analyzed. The frequency distribution of the slope and curvature values were compared with the diffusion, advection, and stream power model, revealing a good agreement with the past and present geomorphic processes acting on the different parts of the study area. Moreover, the integrated geomatics–geomorphic analysis of the outliers’ map showed a good correspondence (more than 75%) between the identified outliers and some specific geomorphological features, such as micro-landforms, which are significant for erosive and gravity-driven mechanisms. The different distribution of the above singularities by different data sources allowed us to attribute their spatial model to the temporal variation of the topography and, consequently, to the geomorphic changes, rather than to the different accuracy. For monitoring purposes and risk mitigation activities, the methodology adopted seems to meet the requirements to make a digital mapping of the coast analyzed, characterized by a rapid evolution of the surface, and can be extended to other stretches of coast with similar characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.

The radar backscattering coefficient sigma nought of the two polarization channels HH and VV was extracted from the satellite images. Subsequently, combinations of HH and VV polarizations were calculated (e.g. HH/VV, HH + VV, HH × VV) to establish relationships between SAR data and the fresh and dry biomass of each crop type using multiple stepwise regression. Additionally, the semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) was used to account for the effect of crop biomass on radar backscatter data. The potential of the Random Forest (RF) machine learning approach was also explored. The split sampling approach (i.e. 70% training and 30% testing) was carried out to validate the stepwise models, WCM and RF. The multiple stepwise regression method using dual-polarimetric data was capable to retrieve the biomass of the three crops, particularly for dry biomass, with R2 > 0.7, without any external input variable, such as information on the (actual) soil moisture. A comparison of the random forest technique with the WCM reveals that the RF technique remarkably outperformed the WCM in biomass estimation, especially for the fresh biomass. For example, the R2 > 0.68 for the fresh biomass estimation of different crop types using RF whereas WCM show R2 < 0.35 only. However, for the dry biomass, the results of both approaches resembled each other. © 2019, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Photogrammetrie, Fernerkundung und Geoinformation (DGPF) e.V.","agricultural land; backscatter; barley; biomass; canola; crop production; machine learning; model test; model validation; polarization; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil moisture; TerraSAR-X; vegetation cover; wheat","Agricultural crop; Biomass; DEMMIN; Random Forest; Stepwise regression; TerraSAR-X; Water cloud model (WCM)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074137730"

De-glinting in UAV image analysis may improve coral distribution mapping accuracy result compared with an uncorrected image classification technique. The objective of this research was to determine accuracy of coral reef habitat classification maps based on glint correction methods proposed by Lyzenga et al., Joyce, Hedley et al., and Goodman et al. The UAV imagery collected from the coral-dominated Pulau Bidong (Peninsular Malaysia) on 20 April 2016 was analyzed in this study. Images were pre-processed with the following two strategies: Strategy-1 was the glint removal technique applied to the whole image, while Strategy-2 used only the regions impacted by glint instead of the whole image. Accuracy measures for the glint corrected images showed that the method proposed by Lyzenga et al. following Strategy-2 could eliminate glints over the branching coral-Acropora (BC), tabulate coral-Acropora + Montipora (TC), patch coral (PC), coral rubble (R), and sand (S) with greater accuracy than the other four methods using Strategy-1. Tested in two different coral environments (Site-1: Pantai Pasir Cina and Site-2: Pantai Vietnam), the glint-removed UAV imagery produced reliable maps of coral habitat distribution with finer details. The proposed strategies can potentially be used to remove glint from UAV imagery and may improve usability of glint-affected imagery, for analyzing spatiotemporal changes of coral habitats from multi-temporal UAV imagery. © 2019 by the authors.","Antennas; Ecosystems; Image analysis; Mapping; Reefs; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Benthic habitats; Classification technique; Coral; Habitat classification; Habitat distribution; Malaysia; South China sea; Spatio-temporal changes; Image enhancement","Benthic habitat; Coral; Glint correction; Malaysia; South China Sea; UAV","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074190366"

The second technique applies canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on the combination of original multispectral bands and extracted local neighborhood information from all the bands. Next, the difference feature vectors obtained from individual techniques are fused to generate the final feature vectors. Furthermore, to get the binary change map, fuzzy c-means clustering is applied on final extracted features.

However, the environmental degradation that has accompanied urban development has raised considerable concern from the public in recent years. This research investigates the effects of urban development on urban sprawl, urban heat island (UHI), and metropolitan weather phenomena that are related to the quality of urban life in the period from 1999-2016. To achieve these objectives, remote sensing technologies were applied to satellite images at three time points (i.e., 1999, 2009, and 2016) that were associated with the meteorological dataset from ground-based stations. The spatial distribution evolution was examined for the land use/land cover changes while using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The increasing impact of urban sprawl on UHI intensity is determined based on the land surface temperature (LST) in multi-temporal forms. Increasing urbanization with the development of gradual outward and northward expansion from the city centre intensified the correlation analysis shows that the UHI. The potential formation of new UHI areas in the near future is also indicated. Furthermore, more than 30% of the metropolitan area is decaying in ecological quality according to an assessment of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI).With respect to metropolitan weather, the urbanization in Hanoi affected the observation of meteorological parameters revealed that the relative humidity, total rainfall, temperature, and wind speed over both urban and rural areas.

These threats have made priority in appraisal of shoreline dynamicity as part of sustainable management of coastal zones. The present study assessed the long- to short-term dynamicity of shoreline positions along the coast of Puri district, Odisha, India, during the past 25 years (1990–2015) using open-source multi-temporal satellite images (Landsat TM, ETM + , and OLI) and statistical-based methods (endpoint rate, linear regression rate and weighted linear regression). The long-term assessment during 1990–2015 shows that shoreline accredited at the rate of 0.3 m a−1 with estimated mean accretion and erosional rate of 1.18 m a−1 and 0.64 m a−1, respectively. A significant trend of coastal erosion is primarily observed on the northern side of Puri district coast. A cyclic pattern of accretion (during 1990–1995 and 2000–2004) and erosion (during 1995–2000 and 2009–2015) was observed during the assessment of short-term shoreline change. It exhibited significant correlation with the landfall of severe cyclones and identified cyclic phases after severe cyclonic storms, i.e., phase of erosion, phase of accretion and phase of stabilization. Overall, the natural processes specifically the landfall of tropical cyclones and anthropogenic activities such as the construction of coastal structures, encroachment and recent construction in the coastal regulatory zone, and construction of dams in upper catchment areas are the major factors accountable for shoreline changes. The output of the research undertaken is not only crucial for monitoring the dynamism of coastal ecosystem boundaries but to enable long- to short-term coastal zone management planning in response to recently reported high erosion along the Puri coast.

Considerable amount of experimental research, obtained by using primary scanning data from satellites (geodata), require the effective application of automated processing methods using GIS technologies and deep interpretation. This can significantly change the process of background monitoring of changes occurring in the territory of the NPP, which can be a test subregional object of the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. In protected areas, landscape changes can serve as indicators of the state and changes in geo-ecological situations. There are two key issues: the selection of representative objects and the indication of changes. To solve the problem of choosing local landscape units and indicating their changes, the authors used a large environmental protection test object - the Slobozhansky national natural park. It was created less than 10 years ago in the basin of the Merla River, a second-order tributary of the Dnieper River. The study used high-resolution processing of geodata obtained by scanning the territory from the satellite Sentinel-2. The research methodology is described, various methods of geodata processing are experimentally verified and compared. Their rational complex has been selected in the context of the purpose of the study. It is determined that the interpretation of satellite images can be effectively used to recognize landscape units through the identification of plant communities (as the most informative component of the landscape). For this purpose, combinations of spectral channels that were most effective for recognizing vegetation cover were selected experimentally. Under field conditions, a correspondence between vegetation cover and certain landscape stands was established. Spectral methods for comparing multi-temporal data were selected to establish seasonal differences and to track temporary (temporal) changes. Significant amount of experimental studies using primary satellite information in combination with automated processing with the use of GIS technologies made it possible to monitor and control the entire process of highly accurate information processing. As additional information, maps of the relief, soil cover, and wetlands were digitized, and then they were subjected to overlay analysis. At the most characteristic key points, the results of the interpretation were verified by the terrestrial landscape survey. The results of the complex were processed with the use of geo-information technologies and supplemented by the use of overlay analysis of the attribute data that had been displayed earlier on the relief maps, vegetation, and water bodies (primarily of lowland marshes). Thus, a landscape map-hypothesis of the facies level - the topologically smallest natural territorial complex of the complex landscape of the territory - was compiled. Founding on the research and analysis of world and domestic experience, the authors suggested using wetlands as an object of monitoring, and contours and condition (aspect) of their surface, recognized semi-automatically using GIS technologies, as indicators. © 2019, National Academy of Sciences.

However, in this milieu of cloud-computing platforms and open-source datasets, radar data analysis has become convenient and can now be performed for more exploratory researches. This study aims to perform multi-temporal analysis of radar backscatter to characterize dense and sparse forest from Sentinel-1 images. The area of study are reforested sites under the National Greening Program (NGP) of the Philippines. Ground data were collected: (1) in 2019, from a 1.35 ha-site in Brgy. Calula, Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay, (2) in 2019, from a 1.10 ha-site in Brgy. Cabatuanan, Basay, Negros Oriental, and (3) from PhilLiDAR 2-Project 3: FRExLS' 2.4 ha-validated site in Ubay, Bohol. SAR intensity values were derived from Sentinel-1 from Google Earth Engine, which is a cloud-based platform with a repository of satellite images and functionalities for data extraction and processing. The temporal variation in C-band radar backscatter from 2014 to 2018 were analyzed. The results show, for the whole period of analysis, that: in VH polarization, dense forest samples backscatter range from-11 to-18 dB in VH and-2 to-13 dB in VV; sparse forest samples range from-12 to-21 dB in VH and-7 to-14 dB in VV; ground samples range from-12 to-24 dB in VH and-6 to-15 dB in VV; and water samples range from-21 to-30 dB in VH and-11 to-26 dB in VV. Forest backscatter are expected to saturate over time, especially in dense forests. These variations are due to differences in forest species, landscape, environmental and climatic drivers, and phenomenon or interventions on the site. © 2020 Authors.","Backscattering; Data handling; Engines; Forestry; Open systems; Radar imaging; Cloud based platforms; Cloud computing platforms; Exploratory research; Forest; Google earths; Multi-temporal analysis; Radar data analysis; Sentinel-1; Synthetic aperture radar","Forest; Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-1A; Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081594754"

To analyze changes land cover maps produced using multi-temporal classification of Landsat satellite images of TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors, respectively for 1989, 2000 and 2013 years. Then derived maps used as input data in Land Change Modeler (LCM) to predict land cover changes on 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 based on a historical scenario. Results of classification and prediction were used to analyze landscape patterns and change processes. Five landscape pattern metrics as Normalized Entropy, Edge Density, Patch Area, Patch Compactness and Relative Richness were used to quantify landscape pattern and occurrence of ten landscape change processes as Attrition, Aggregation, Dissection, Creation, Shrinkage, Perforation, Shift, Deformation, Enlargement and Fragmentation were studied. Land cover maps showed great changes in central Zagros region in Lorestan province (Iran) whereas residential areas have destroyed about 5166.7 km2 of Zagros forests from 1989 to 2013. In this period residential areas are increased about 47.71 km2.

However, they are predominantly based on manually extracted training samples. In the present study, we use pre-disaster OpenStreetMap building data to automatically generate training samples to train the proposed deep learning approach after the co-registration of the map and the satellite images. The proposed deep learning framework is based on the U-net design with residual connections, which has been shown to be an effective method to increase the efficiency of CNN-based models. The ResUnet is followed by a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implementation to further refine the results.

Sinop Nuclear Power Plant, which will be built on Sinop Ä°nceburun peninsula at the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is one of the three different nuclear power plants planned to be built in Turkey. The Sinop Nuclear Power Plant consist of four different reactors. The construction of the first unit is expected to be completed by 2023, and the fourth unit is planned to be activated by 2028. On the other hand, the construction of the nuclear power plant will alter the land use at the actual plant site and its surroundings and hence may cause significant environmental changes. As an indicator, more than 650000 trees have been cut so far for the construction of nuclear power plant, and this can adversely affect the ecological balances of the region by endangering habitats and creating ecological damages. The aim of this study is to analyse the land use/land cover changes (LULC) in the forestry-dominated areas due to the construction of nuclear power plants using the multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images. For this purpose, different change detection methods such as SAR intensity image differencing, supervised image classification method (Support Vector Machine algorithm) were applied to Sentinel 1 satellite image datasets (2016-2019) to evaluate the annual changes due to construction. In addition, a correlation analysis was performed between the canopy structure and vegetation biomass using Sentinel 2 NDVI dataset (2016-2019) and calibrated Sentinel 1 backscatter values.

Images Co-registration is an important step before the change detection process, and although they are geo-referenced to each other they may not have the same spatial resolution. So, prior to the multi-temporal analysis, images should be similar in pixel size. Using optical sensors with different characteristics and resolutions to obtain the same geographical area may cause effects in change detection results.

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high performances comparable to or even better than widely used and adopted machine learning techniques. The aim of this study is to investigate the application of CNNs for land cover classification by using two-dimensional (2-D) spectral curve graphs from multispectral satellite images. The land cover classification was conducted in Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and South Korea by using multispectral images acquired from 30-m Landsat-8 and 500-m Geostationary Ocean Color Imager images. For the construction of input data specific to CNNs, two seasons (winter and summer) of multispectral bands were transformed into 2-D spectral curve graphs for each class. Land cover classification results of CNNs were compared with the results of support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest (RFs). The CNNs model showed higher performance than RFs and SVMs in both study sites. The examination of land cover classification maps demonstrates a good agreement with reference maps, Google Earth images, and existing global scale land cover map, especially for croplands. Using the spectral curve graph could incorporate the phenological cycles on classifying the land cover types. This study shows that the use of a new transformation of spectral bands into a 2-D form for application in CNNs can improve land cover classification performance. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Concord [Massachusetts]; Massachusetts; New Hampshire; South Korea; United States; Convolution; Decision trees; Geostationary satellites; Graph theory; Image classification; Image resolution; Neural networks; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Convolutional neural network; Land cover classification; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal; Ocean color; Phenological cycles; Spectral curves; artificial neural network; GOCI; graphical method; land classification; land cover; Landsat; machine learning; satellite imagery; Image enhancement","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI); land cover classification; Landsat-8; multitemporal; phenological cycle; spectral curve graph","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058126797"

We partition the difference image into small data blocks with non-overlapping and overlapping pixels and use these data blocks to justify the changing status of the contents. However, instead of building an eigen space from the orthonormal eigenvectors extracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the data blocks, we analyze the singular values and use only a small subset of the values. This eigen space with much smaller number of dimensions helped to significantly improve the efficiency of the change detection algorithm. The change detection is achieved by partitioning the feature vector space into two clusters using clustering algorithms. We utilize the designs of scalable and efficient parallel algorithms for many- core GPU devices using CUDA. Our algorithms expose sub- stantial fine-grained parallelism while maintaining minimal global communication.

Whereas many studies analysed changes on individual volcanoes, this study presents for the first time a comparison of glacier changes on active volcanoes on a continental scale. Glacier areas were mapped for 59 volcanoes across Latin America around 1986, 1999 and 2015 using a semi-automated band ratio method combined with manual editing using satellite images from Landsat 4/5/7/8 and Sentinel-2. Area changes were compared with the Smithsonian volcano database to analyse possible glacier-volcano interactions. Over the full period, the mapped area changed from 1399.3 ± 80 km2 to 1016.1 ± 34 km2 (-383.2 km2) or -27.4% (-0.92% a-1) in relative terms. Small glaciers, especially in tropical regions lost more of their area compared to large and extra-tropical glaciers. Interestingly, 46 out of 59 analysed glaciers (78%) showed a decelerating shrinkage rate in the second period (-1.20% a-1 before 1999 and -0.70% a-1 after 1999). We found a slightly higher (but statistically not significant) area loss rate (-1.03% a-1) for glaciers on volcanoes with eruptions than without (-0.86% a-1). © The Author(s) 2019.","Latin America; glacier dynamics; mapping method; remote sensing; satellite imagery; volcanic eruption; volcano","glacier area change; glacier mapping; glacier-volcano interaction; optical remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066414820"

Pixels are grouped using clustering and morphology based segmentation for region based spatial information. This is used to calculate the spatial features of the contiguous regions by classifying the region into the statistics of the pixel properties. In the proposed work, analysis of Google Earth images for identification of morphological patterns of the river flow is done for remote sensing image using graph-cuts. Multi-temporal satellite images acquired from Google Earth to identify the digital elevation is used to formulate the energy function from images to compare the displacement in pixel value using similarity measure. A method is proposed to solve non-rigid image transformation via graph-cuts algorithm by modeling the registration process as a discrete labeling problem. A displacement vector associated to each pixel in the source image indicates the corresponding position in the moving image. The transformation matrix produced from change in the intensity of the pixels for a region is then optimized for energy minimization by using the graph-cuts algorithm and demon registration technique. The proposed study enhances the advantages of regional segmentation in order to know homogeneous areas for optimal image segmentation and digital footprints for change in the river bed patterns by identifying the change in LANDSAT data from temporal satellite images. By applying the proposed multi-level registration method, the number of labels used in each level is greatly reduced due to lower image resolution being used in coarser levels. The results demonstrate that the lineament detection for better accuracy compared to traditional sources of lineament identification methods.

The absolute differences between pairs of contiguous binary images are used to construct a change map. The structural consistency map is generated by a method based on the structural patch decomposition. The evaluation results show that the proposed method is considerably better than a conventional method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering in terms of pixel error rate, correctness, and robustness against noise addition. For the pixel error rate and the correctness, the improvements are approximately 42.61% and 13.92%, respectively.

Coastal erosion is a tentative hazard for communities especially in coastal areas as it is extremely susceptible to increasing coastal disasters. The study has been conducted along the coast of Vishakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, India with the help of multi-temporal satellite images of 1991 2001, 2011 and 2018. The continuing coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Linear regression rate (LRR), End Point Rate (EPR) and Weighted Linear Regression (WLR) are used for calculating shoreline change rate. Based on calculations the district shoreline has been classified into five categories as high and low erosion, no change and high and low accretion. Out of 135 km, high erosion occupied 5.8 km of coast followed by moderate or low erosion 46.2 km. Almost 34.7 km coastal length showed little or no change. Moderate accretion is found along 30.5 km whereas high accretion trend found around 17.8 km. The outcome of shows that erosion is prevailing in Vishakhapatnam taluk, Ankapalli taluk, Yellamanchili taluk whereas most of the Bhemunipatnam coast is accreting. Natural and manmade activities and phenomena influence the coastal areas in terms of erosion and accretion. The study could be used for further planning and development and also for disaster management authority in the decision-making process in the study area. © 2020 The Author(s).

Then, the learned deep features are concatenated and output with Sigmoid probabilistic labeling predictions for similarity measure. Furthermore, matching and non-matching probabilistic maps are used to determine matches by integrating an iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm.

Random forests (RF) algorithm, one of the ML-based methods, was selected to construct the landslide susceptibility models. Different ratios of landslide and non-landslide samples were considered in the experiments. This study also employed a cost-sensitive analysis to adjust the decision boundary of the developed RF models with unbalanced sample ratios to improve the prediction results. Two strategies were investigated for model verification, namely space-and time-robustness. The space-robustness verification was designed for separating samples into training and examining data based on a single event or the same dataset. The time-robustness verification was designed for predicting subsequent landslide events by constructing a landslide susceptibility model based on a specific event or period. A total of 14 GIS-based landslide-related factors were used and derived from the spatial analyses. The developed landslide susceptibility models were tested in a watershed region in northern Taiwan with a landslide inventory of changes detected through multi-temporal satellite images and verified through field investigation. To further examine the developed models, the landslide susceptibility distributions of true occurrence samples and the generated landslide susceptibility maps were compared. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can provide more reasonable results, and the accuracies were found to be higher than 93% and 75% in most cases for space-and time-robustness verifications, respectively. In addition, the mapping results revealed that the multi-temporal models did not seem to be affected by the sample ratios included in the analyses. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, satellite images were used in mapping the landfill surface temperature (LFST) of Al Akeeder landfill site in Northern Jordan. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was developed to simulate and predict the LFST. Fifty-four Landsat satellite images on different dates covering the period 2000–2016 were collected and utilized after being subjected to correction of the thermal band. Multi-temporal thematic maps were developed for the landfill site and the LFST trends, patterns and magnitude were evaluated. Correlating LFST with the amount of the landfilled solid waste has resulted in a good correlation coefficient (r = 0.884), which implies that LFST can serve as an indicator of the amount of solid waste buried in the landfill. Solid waste amount, methane emitted as well as meteorological parameters, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and evaporation, were used to simulate and predict the value of landfill LFST using ANN. Validation of the ANN has resulted in a good correlation between the predicted and calculated values of the LFST. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Jordan; Atmospheric temperature; Forecasting; Maps; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Solid wastes; Surface properties; Wind; Artificial neural network models; Calculated values; Good correlations; Landfill operations; Landfill surface; LANDSAT satellite images; Meteorological parameters; Satellite images; artificial neural network; assessment method; landfill; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; surface temperature; Land fill","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067859980"

We propose in this work a novel pixel reconstruction method based on optimal transport. Our method first conducts an adaptive color transfer between multi-temporal images and then replaces cloud-contaminated pixels by transferred cloud-free pixels. The proposed method fully explores the potential of optimal transport to generate a more adaptive color transfer plan and thus ensure a high quality information transfer between images.

Block is an active tidal island of the Indian Sundarban. In this island, human-induced modification of the natural drainage system poses serious threats to the estuarine environment. It was started during the British colonial period through the construction of embankment to protect the reclaimed coastal land from saline water ingression. The rapid growth of population over the last few decades has triggered the changes in the drainage network and also altered the land use land cover of the study area. The human encroachment on the drainage area has hampered the sedimentation process as well as water circulation in the delta. As a result, the island is gradually transforming into saucer-shaped form, which aggravates various coastal threats like flood inundation, waterlogging and embankment breaching during extreme environmental events. To study the spatio-temporal change of the drainage network pattern from 1955 to 2018, different multi-temporal satellite images, US Army Toposheet, Census of India Report (2001 and 2011) and Human Development Report (2014) have been used as a source of secondary data for the analysis in ArcGIS environment. In addition to this, instrumental surveying has been done to measure the slope direction in relation to land use land cover and a questionnaire survey was conducted to understand the livelihood status of people influenced by various coastal threats and risks due to the drainage congestion. The study reveals that population density has gradually increased in recent decades and is negatively correlated with the drainage density on the island. The choking of the surface drainage canals has increased the problem of waterlogging in agricultural fields, which affected their productivity. Therefore, a strategy for management of the drainage network needs to be urgently implemented in order to protect the life and livelihood of rural people from various coastal threats. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

Normalization process reduces the radiometric differences caused by changes in the environmental conditions during the acquisition of multitemporal satellite images. In this paper, we proposed an efficient and automatic method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to find a set of subjectively chosen invariant pixels. A linear model, based on Error Ellipse, was then adjusted to normalize the subject image. The proposed method involves two main steps; in the first step, invariant pixels, which are known as most probable unchanged pixels, were obtained by analyzing image differences estimated by GMMs. Then, these pixels were used to model the relationship between two multitemporal images. To evaluate the proposed method in real analysis scenarios, three multitemporal datasets acquired by different satellite sensors such as Ikonos, Quickbird, SuperView-1, and Worldview-2 were analyzed. These images were collected before and after the 2011's Japan and the 2004's Indonesia Tsunamis, and the 2017's Iran-Iraq earthquake.

Long-term coastal erosion and accretion rate over a period of 42 years has calculated using Digital Shoreline Analysis System and prepared shoreline maps by using GIS-Software. End point rate (EPR) statistical method is applied to estimate the shoreline change rate. Various coastal parameters like sea level rise, geomorphology, elevation and coastal slope were used to find out the interactive relationship between the physical parameters and shoreline changes in the area. The study revealed that the coastal changes are more dominant in Krishna and Godavari Deltaic plain. The average erosion and accretion rate observed in the Krishna Godavari delta was 10.63 and 17.29 m per year respectively. The study indicated that, climatic changes and fluvial process are playing key role in changing shoreline positions.

Information on the proportion of broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models obtained from 3D photogrammetric point clouds. However, the broadleaf-conifer information cannot be obtained from photogrammetric point clouds alone. Furthermore, spectral information of aerial images is too inconsistent to be used for automatic broadleaf-conifer classification over larger areas. In this study we combined multi-temporal Sentinel 2 optical satellite images, 3D photogrammetric point clouds from digital aerial stereo photographs, and forest inventory plots representing an area of 35,751 km2 in south-west Germany for (1) modelling the percentage of broadleaf tree volume (BL%) using Sentinel 2 time series and (2) modelling timber volume per hectare using 3D photogrammetric point clouds. Forest inventory plots were surveyed in the same years and regions as stereo photographs were acquired (2013-2017), resulting in 11,554 plots. Sentinel 2 images from 2016 and 2017 were corrected for topographic and atmospheric influences and combined with the same forest inventory plots. Spectral variables from corrected multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images were calculated, and Support VectorMachine (SVM) regressions were fitted for each Sentinel 2 scene estimating the BL% for corresponding inventory plots. Variables from the photogrammetric point clouds were calculated for each inventory plot and a non-linear regression model predicting timber volume per hectare was fitted. Each SVMregression and the timber volume model were evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation (CV). The SVMregression models estimating the BL% per Sentinel 2 scene achieved overall accuracies of 68%-75% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 21.5-26.1. The timber volumemodel showed a RMSE% of 31.7%, amean bias of 0.2%, and a pseudo-R2 of 0.64. Application of the SVMregressions on Sentinel 2 scenes covering the state of Baden-Württemberg resulted in predictions of broadleaf tree percentages for the entire state. These predicted values were used as additional predictor in the timber volume model, allowing for predictions of timber volume for the same area. Spatially high-resolution information about growing stock is of great practical relevance for forest management planning, especially when the timber volume of a smaller unit is of interest, for example of a forest stand or a forest districtwhere not enough terrestrial inventory plots are available to make reliable estimations. Here, predictions from remote-sensing based models can be used. Furthermore, information about broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models and reduces model errors and, thereby, prediction uncertainties. © 2019 by the authors.","Air Craft; Forecasts; Forestry; Photogrammetry; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Coniferophyta; Aerial photography; Antennas; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Geometrical optics; Image enhancement; Mean square error; Photogrammetry; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Stereo image processing; Support vector machines; Timber; Time series; 3D point cloud; Forest inventory data; Forest management plans; Satellite images; Stereo-photographs; forest canopy; forest inventory; forest management; height determination; numerical model; photogrammetry; regression analysis; satellite imagery; Sentinel; time series analysis; Forestry","3D point clouds; Digital aerial stereo photographs; Forest inventory data; Forest management plans; Remote sensing; Satellite images; Time series; Tree genera classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072568303"

Feature stacking is the most commonly used method of data fusion but does not consider the heterogeneity of multimodal optical images and OSM data, which becomes its main drawback. The proposed framework processes two data sources separately and then combines them at the model level through two fusion models (the landuse fusion model and building fusion model) that aim to fuse optical images with landuse and buildings layers of OSM data, respectively. In addition, a new approach to detecting building incompleteness of OSM data is proposed. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the data from the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and further validated on one additional test (AT) set containing test samples that are manually labeled in Munich and New York. The experimental results have indicated that compared with the feature stacking-based baseline framework, the proposed framework is effective in fusing optical images with OSM data for the classification of LCZs with high generalization capability on a large scale. The classification accuracy of the proposed framework outperforms the baseline framework by more than 6% and 2% while testing on the test set of 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest and the AT set, respectively. In addition, the proposed framework is less sensitive to spectral diversities of optical satellite images and thus achieves more stable classification performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Bavaria; Germany; Munich; New York [United States]; United States; Computer software maintenance; Earth (planet); Geometrical optics; Image fusion; Satellites; Canonical correlations; Heterogeneous data; Local climate; OpenStreetMap (OSM); Satellite images; baseline survey; building; canonical analysis; correlation; EOS; heterogeneity; satellite imagery; software; Classification (of information)","Canonical correlation forest (CCF); heterogeneous data fusion; local climate zones (LCZs); OpenStreetMap (OSM); satellite images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067230834"

The proposed CD criterion amounts to a large-scale non-convex optimization, which is first reformulated using the convex relaxation trick with associated change map interpreted in the probability sense, followed by adopting an efficient convex solver known as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The resulted probabilistic change map would be more practical, and can be thresholded at 0.5 to yield the conventional binary-valued one.

In the summer of 2016, the lake level reached its maximum, and during the period from August 16 to August 25, a catastrophic outburst-flood occurred due to the floating of a glacier dam formed by the outlet glacier of the Semenov-Tyan-Shansky dome. Estimation of the lake area has been obtained as a result of interpretation of satellite images. The volume of the lake and the height of the glacier dam have been determined according to the data of processing of the multi-temporal digital relief models. The maximum water level in Spartakovskoye Lake was 122.9 m, while its area and volume were (6.63 ± 0.42) km2 and (404.3 ± 21.9) million m3, respectively. The minimum height of the iceshed of the dam before the lake drainage was about 137 m, which ensured its ascent with an average ice density of 0.875 g/cm3. The calculations based on the data of snow surveys and the amount of summer melting have revealed that the melting of seasonal snow cover, perennial snowfields and ice on the surface of glaciers in the catchment area of the lake gives a runoff value of 37.1 to 48.2 million m3 of water annually depending on average summer temperatures and precipitation. The lake basin is completely filled in about 10 years. The previous outburst-flood of the lake had occurred in the summer of 2006, and until 2016, the level of the lake was continuously rising. At the end of August 2019, the lake’s level reached 80 m, which was consistent with the calculations of runoff into the lake.

This issue can be accomplished by measuring the similarity among these images. Therefore, in this paper, a very simple and effective change detection technique based on mutual information (MI), which is used as a similarity measure tool between two variables in statistics, is proposed. Herein, spatial neighborhood information around each pixel is exploited to get the MI and corresponding features. Further, difference feature vectors are created in feature space that provides discriminant information for change detection task. These difference feature vectors from all bands of multispectral images are concatenated to get the final feature vectors. Finally, features are classified by applying hard and soft clustering techniques i.e. k-means and fuzzy c-means, respectively and the results by both the clustering algorithms are compared. Experiments are conducted on two bitemporal satellite images, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. © 2019 IEEE.","Satellites; Vector spaces; Change detection; Discriminant informations; Multi-temporal satellite images; Multispectral images; Mutual informations; Satellite images; Similarity measure; Spatial neighborhoods; K-means clustering","Change detection; fuzzy c-means clustering; k-means clustering; Mutual information (MI)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083073742"

This study proposes a fuzzy model for coastal zone human impact classification that integrates shoreline changes, NDVI, and settlement influences to enhance numerical-linguistic fuzzy classification through Geographical Information System (GIS)'s graphical visualization prowess. The model output representing scores are numbers ranging from zero to one, which are convertible into fuzzy linguistic classification variables; i.e., low, moderate, and high on the one hand. On the other hand, use of GIS through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) provides enhancement through graphic visualization. Using Itamaraca Island in Brazil as an example, multi-temporal satellite images are processed to provide all the required input variables. The resulting output divides the entire island into five sectors representing both quantitative and qualitative outcomes (i.e., fuzzy classification composed of both scores and maps), showcasing the capability of the proposed approach to complement shoreline change analysis through physical (map) interpretation in addition to the frequently used numbers. The proposed fuzzy model is validated using random in-situ samples and high resolution image data that has been classified by a coastal geomorphology specialist. The accuracy of the interpretation show 81% of matches are achievable compared to the results of the fuzzy model. The final results delivered by the proposed fuzzy approach show the complex behavior of the local dynamics, thereby adding useful and substantial information for environmental issues and Integrated Coastal Zone Management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","anthropogenic effect; coastal zone; fuzzy mathematics; landscape evolution; NDVI; remote sensing; shoreline change","Fuzzy; Human impact classification; Landscape evolution; NDVI; Remote sensing; Shoreline","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073325584"

In this paper, a thick cloud removal method based on stepwise radiometric adjustment and residual correction (SRARC) is proposed, which is aimed at effectively removing the clouds in high-resolution images for the generation of high-quality and spatially contiguous urban geographical maps. The basic idea of SRARC is that the complementary information in adjacent temporal satellite images can be utilized for the seamless recovery of cloud-contaminated areas in the target image after precise radiometric adjustment. To this end, the SRARC method first optimizes the given cloud mask of the target image based on superpixel segmentation, which is conducted to ensure that the labeled cloud boundaries go through homogeneous areas of the target image, to ensure a seamless reconstruction. Stepwise radiometric adjustment is then used to adjust the radiometric information of the complementary areas in the auxiliary image, step by step, and clouds in the target image can be removed by the replacement with the adjusted complementary areas. Finally, residual correction based on global optimization is used to further reduce the radiometric differences between the recovered areas and the cloud-free areas. The final cloud removal results are then generated. High-resolution images with different spatial resolutions and land-cover change patterns were used in both simulated and real-data cloud removal experiments. The results suggest that SRARC can achieve a better performance than the other compared methods, due to the superiority of the radiometric adjustment and spatial detail preservation. SRARC is thus a promising approach that has the potential for routine use, to support applications based on high-resolution satellite images. © 2019 by the authors.","Global optimization; Radiometry; Satellite imagery; Cloud removal; High resolution image; Multi-temporal; Residual correction; SRARC; Stepwise radiometric adjustment; Image segmentation","Cloud removal; High-resolution images; Multi-temporal; Residual correction; SRARC; Stepwise radiometric adjustment","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071546308"

This paper presents the spatio-temporal changes of morphological configuration of shorelines, river banks of deltaic Sagar Island situated in the mouth reaches of Hugli estuary in India. Passing through the western margin of Ganga delta the Hugli river is flowing to the Bay of Bengal in north south direction and it is dominated by strong tidal current. Being the largest island in Hugli estuary Sagar Island represent variety of inter tidal sub tidal sub-environment formed by estuarine erosional and depositional processes. The study aims to monitor and measure the quantitative changes of shorelines, island area, spatio-temporal variations of erosional and depositional processes and resultant landform assemblages by using shoreline change envelop (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM) and end point rate (EPR). With the help of multi-temporal maps and image (District map, Police station map of 1912–29, SoI Topographical sheets 1967–69 and IRS P6 LISS IV satellite image of 2014), GIS techniques, mathematical modeling of hydro morphological parameters the present study has given a fruitful result. Measurement of shoreline dynamics clearly shows that coastal shoreline and estuarine bank line erosional processes are very active along south eastern coastal tract, south western part of Sagar Island and exposed concave river banks along the north eastern part of Sagar respectively. Finally is has found that intensity of erosion in Sagar Island is strongly controlled by estuarine exposure, sediment composition, channel flow direction, near bank channel depth, orientation of thalweg line, wave form velocity, long shore velocity, direction of longshore current, episodic cyclonic events with mean high tidal ranges and disturbance in estuarine equilibrium condition. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","India; Sagar Island; West Bengal; coastal zone; estuarine environment; GIS; morphodynamics; quantitative analysis; shoreline change; spatiotemporal analysis","End point rate (EPR); Estuarine equilibrium; Net shoreline movement (NSM); Shoreline change envelop (SCE); Wave character","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051657973"

Historical admiralty charts were digitized and analyzed in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to provide quantitative estimates of underwater topography changes for exploring the accretion-erosion characteristics from 1960s to 2010s. Multi-temporal satellite images have been used to analyze the coastline developments. The results showed that the bathymetry and coastline of QZB changed dramatically in recent decades. The subaqueous area decreased by about 8% in the study area during the last 50 years, mainly due to coastal land reclamation. The average growth rate of the coastlines was 2.07 km/yr. between 1978 and 2013 with natural curvy coastlines being replaced by straighter artificial shorelines. During the period from 1960s to 1990s, the evolution of QZB was mainly governed by natural factors with slight deposition or erosion in the deep troughs. From 1990s to 2010s, intensive large-scale human activities, such as port building, channel dredging and artificial island construction became the main causes affecting morphological changes in the QZB. Approximately half of the underwater terrain had undergone significant changes (greater than ±0.5 m), and the proportion of deposition area accounting for 32.26% of the subaqueous area, about twice more than erosion area.

These variations mainly occur based on the incessant duel hydrodynamic impacts of both wave action and coastal currents. Several types of coastal measures have been applied substantially along the coastal stretch of Damietta to protect shoreline such as detached breakwaters, Jetties, groins, and seawalls. This study is essentially focused on the assessment of shoreline kinematics response due to the existence of these structures during the period from 1990 to 2015. In addition, the future changes of the shoreline at 2020, 2025 and 2035 are predicted using satellite images, Geo-spatial tools and Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) by the meaning of End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) methods. Four Landsat images at different periods; TM1990, TM 1999, ETM 2003 and ETM 2015 are used to detect shoreline changes. Three semi-automatic extraction techniques are initially tempted for Landsat ETM 2003 imagery namely; Iso cluster technique, threshold method, and onscreen digitizing method to select the optimal one. Iso cluster technique is used as the optimal technique which achieves the least errors with the corresponding field data in 2003 by value of 0.34. Furthermore, the extraction shoreline change for Damietta coast is extensively measured for three zones: zone (1) the western sector encompassing Damietta port with two jetties; zone (2) the central sector including detached breakwaters; zone (3) the eastern portion of Damietta estuary passing through a seawall. Verification analysis shows that the EPR is the optimum method for shoreline detection with a value of RMSE by 0.27. The results show that, for zone (1), the western shoreline of Damietta port is progressed by a rate of +10.0 m/year. On the other hand, the shoreline on the down drift side at zone (2) has retreated by a rate of -5.0 m/year. While the shoreline behind the detached breakwaters in the central sector has advanced by +12.0 m/year from 1999 to 2003, then decreased gradually until become stable in 2015. For zone (3), alongshore currents have derived the disassembled sandy soil from west to east leaving a highly eroded area by average rate of -78m/year. The results of this study give indication to shoreline trend of near future which should be under consideration in planning of Damietta coastal zone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Damietta; Egypt; Breakwaters; Coastal engineering; Extraction; Kinematics; Point contacts; Remote sensing; Retaining walls; Damietta Port; Detached breakwater; End points; Hydrodynamic impacts; Iso cluster technique; Multi-temporal satellite images; Shoreline change; Verification analysis; assessment method; coastal zone; Landsat; port; prediction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; shoreline change; statistical analysis; Jetties","Damietta Port; End Point Rate (EPR); Iso cluster technique; Remote sensing; Shoreline change","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056751343"

Traditional proposals usually identify the land cover classes from general related groups such as different tree species or different crop varieties. Additionally, these proposals commonly use information from a precise time span or season, not accounting for the variability of the data over the entire year, specially in regions with several seasons. In this work, we propose a multi-temporal classification system to identify and represent diverse land cover classes over any period of the entire year by using Sentinel-2 satellite image data. To this end, 526 representative samples were labelled from 5 complex and variable different land cover types over the Special Area of Conservation (SAC) Betanzos-Mandeo in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The method achieves a satisfactory mean accuracy value of 84.0% for the testing set using the best configuration with a radial Support Vector Machine classifier.

This paper proposes a new automatic method for estimating pylon height using shadow differences between GF-2 satellite images taken at different times. Initially, the spectral distribution features and triangular shape of pylon shadows are used for shadow detection to enhance the difference from other land objects using images taken at a greater sun elevation angle. Then, the difference in the shadows of the same pylon in images taken at different times and shadow-imaging principles are used to estimate the vertical of the pylon top to avoid interference from complex land objects. Finally, the height of the pylon is approximated using the distance from the vertical projection point to the shadow point of the pylon top and sun elevation angle. GF-2 images were selected and included five pylons in the target area. The average error of the estimated height was 1.56 m, and the relative error was only 2.74%. © 2019, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","automation; height; manmade structure; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; unmanned vehicle","GF-2; Height; Multi-temporal; Pylon; Shadow; Vertical projection point","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060554490"

Satellite images are nowadays massively used by archaeologists to systematically document sites affected by looting. In parallel, remote sensing scientists are increasingly developing processing methods with a certain degree of automation to quantify looting using satellite imagery. To capture the state-of-the-art of this growing field of remote sensing, in this work 47 peer-reviewed research publications and grey literature are reviewed, accounting for: (i) the type of satellite data used, i.e., optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR); (ii) properties of looting features utilized as proxies for damage assessment (e.g., shape, morphology, spectral signature); (iii) image processing workflows; and (iv) rationale for validation. Several scholars studied looting even prior to the conflicts recently affecting the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Regardless of the method used for looting feature identification (either visual/manual, or with the aid of image processing), they preferred very high resolution (VHR) optical imagery, mainly black-and-white panchromatic, or pansharpened multispectral, whereas SAR is being used more recently by specialist image analysts only. Yet the full potential of VHR and high resolution (HR) multispectral information in optical imagery is to be exploited, with limited research studies testing spectral indices. To fill this gap, a range of looted sites across the MENA region are presented in this work, i.e., Lisht, Dashur, and Abusir el Malik (Egypt), and Tell Qarqur, Tell Jifar, Sergiopolis, Apamea, Dura Europos, and Tell Hizareen (Syria). The aim is to highlight: (i) the complementarity of HR multispectral data and VHR SAR with VHR optical imagery, (ii) usefulness of spectral profiles in the visible and near-infrared bands, and (iii) applicability of methods for multi-temporal change detection. Satellite data used for the demonstration include: HR multispectral imagery from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 constellation, VHR X-band SAR data from the COSMO-SkyMed mission, VHR panchromatic and multispectral WorldView-2 imagery, and further VHR optical data acquired by GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3, available through Google Earth. Commonalities between the different image processing methods are examined, alongside a critical discussion about automation in looting assessment, current lack of common practices in image processing, achievements in managing the uncertainty in looting feature interpretation, and current needs for more dissemination and user uptake. Directions toward sharing and harmonization of methodologies are outlined, and some proposals are made with regard to the aspects that the community working with satellite images should consider, in order to define best practices of satellite-based looting assessment. © 2019 by the authors.","Damage detection; Feature extraction; Image processing; Infrared devices; Optical data processing; Pattern recognition; Processing; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Change detection; Cosmo skymed; Looting; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2; Radar imaging","Archaeological remote sensing; Change detection; COSMO-SkyMed; Feature extraction; Looting; Pattern recognition; SAR; Sentinel-2; VHR optical;WordView-2","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074207846"

Several previous research works focused on traditional practices such as spectral analysis, and statistical approaches for water region estimation. However, producing a consistent global scale water estimation results are still considered as relatively challenging task. On the other hand, in computer vision applications Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) emerged as greater tool for classification tasks. Recently, Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN) proposed for improved classification results. Therefore, inspired from R-CNN, this research proposes a Recurrent feedback Encoder-Decoder without max-pooling for global scale water region estimation using temporal Landsat-8 images. The proposed R-CNN uses three Landsat-8 images which consist of current observation (t0) to predict water region and two previous observation of the same location (t.. 1, t.. 2), and these three temporal observation of the same location were employed for training with the ground truth labelled data (water/non-water) from the current observation. Proposed R-CNN model uses temporal input data and results in multi-temporal output for water region estimation. Experiments show promising results especially while using concatenated recurrent feedback features. The model significantly outperforms baseline model and UNet (without recurrent and feedback structure). Detailed comparison study on temporal Landsat-8 images that highly aected by sunglint, cloud and other atmospheric conditions shows that the proposed model has a potential to produce reliable water region estimation where UNet, baseline model R-CNN single model fail. © 2019 SPIE.","Clouds; Convolution; Hydrophilicity; Image processing; Remote sensing; Spectrum analysis; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal; Recurrent-CNN; Sunglint; Water regions; Recurrent neural networks","Cloud; Landsat-8; Multi-temporal; Recurrent-CNN; Sunglint; Water region estimation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078174963"

This method has been successfully applied to several pattern analysis tasks such as image-to-text mapping and view-invariant object/action recognition. However, this success is highly dependent on the quality of data pairing (i.e., alignments) and mispairing adversely affects the generalization ability of the learned CCA representations. In this paper, we address the issue of alignment errors using a new variant of canonical correlation analysis referred to as alignment-agnostic (AA) CCA. Starting from erroneously paired data taken from different views, this CCA finds transformation matrices by optimizing a constrained maximization problem that mixes a data correlation term with context regularization; the particular design of these two terms mitigates the effect of alignment errors when learning the CCA transformations. Experiments conducted on multi-view tasks, including multi-temporal satellite image change detection, show that our AA CCA method is highly effective and resilient to mispairing errors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Alignment; Character recognition; Computer vision; Constrained optimization; Correlation methods; Errors; Linear transformations; Canonical correlation analysis; Change detection; Compact representation; Generalization ability; Misalignment resilience; Multi-temporal satellite images; Statistical learning methods; Transformation matrices; Metadata","Canonical correlation analysis; Change detection; Learning compact representations; Misalignment resilience","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061725471"

Field survey indicates that the estimated landslide volume is approximately 35000 m3. The landslide is a typical dualistic soil-rock structural landslide with bedding planes. The sliding surface is located in a thin layer of limestone which is characterized by the X-shaped conjugate joint planes. The steep slope has been cut and transformed by human disturbances, which have influenced the slope stability and the drainage of precipitation along the slope. Many factors, including the regional geological structure, stratum lithology, slope topography, landform morphology, and precipitation, have contributed to the Xuyong landslide during the pre-disaster phase. Post-disaster emergency observation revealed that subsequent deformation was located mainly along the back edge of the landslide, where the maximum surficial deformation reached only 18 mm/day over a small area, reflecting the low probability of a secondary landslide hazard.

Another alternative is the multitemporal analysis, which detects changes from one image already classified to another, corresponding to the same surface on different dates. The common denominator applies both techniques separately in order to take advantage of the characteristics of a classified image. Therefore, the current study aims to combine multi-temporality and different indexes to integrate both characteristics and facilitate the identification of burned areas. The study area is located in southern Chile with the corresponding dates from January 15 to 30,2017, where fires consumed much of the endemic forestation of the area. The methodology applied has been based on obtaining and correcting Landsat 8 satellite images prior and after the event. Following this, the different indexes have been calculated to apply the change detection. Thereafter, the results have been integrated to make a multitemporal RGB combination of the new bands where, in the red quill corresponds to the indexes before the event, the green quill to the indexes after the event and the blue quill to the multitemporal difference. As a result of the multi-temporal index combinations, the outstanding index is the SAVI-Multitemporal, which allows 93% visual discrimination of the areas affected by the fires, unlike the SAVI, BAI, GEMI, BAI indexes -Multitemporal and GEMI-Multitemporal with a percentage of discrimination of about 73.33%, 66.67%, 80%, 20% and 86.67%, respectively. Finally, we identified that 157,116,173 hectares of forest have been affected by the fires that occurred in Chile in the studied time period. © 2019 IEEE.","Deforestation; Image classification; Mapping; Maps; Change detection; Common denominators; Images; Index; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal analysis; Satellite images; Visual discrimination; Fires","Cartography; Fire; Images; Index; Multitemporal","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068369303"

In this study, a mapping method for shallow water bathymetry was developed, using random forest machine learning and multi-temporal satellite images to create a generalized depth estimation model. A total of 135 Landsat-8 images, and a large amount of training bathymetry data for five areas were analyzed with the Google Earth Engine. The accuracy of SDB was evaluated by comparison with reference bathymetry data.

Located in Sardinia (Italy) and Crete (Greek), respectively, Mulargia and Aposelemis represent vital resources to supply drinking water in downstream valleys. A total of 400 cloud-free satellite images were turned into information on water quality by using an image processing chain implementing physically based methods for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), turbidity, Secchi disk depth (SDD) and surface water temperature. These estimates have been successfully validated (the lower Pearson correlation r was 0.88 for Chl-a) with 23 match-ups of in situ and satellite data. Results of the multi-temporal analyses showed a decrease of SDD due to the increase of Chl-a in Aposelemis or an increase of turbidity in Mulargia. For both freshwater reservoirs, the satellite-derived trophic state index assigned both lakes to mesotrophic conditions.

Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) at 90-m resolution has been used to delineate the terrain characteristics such as aspect, slope, and altitude. The study is focused on two major objectives, first is to assess the snow cover variation with a time series analysis and second one is the snow cover changes with respect to the changes in terrain parameters mainly at avalanche prone regions. Study area has 60 registered avalanche sites; most of these avalanches trigger during the winter months when snow deposition takes place in the steep slopes due to successive snowfall spells. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) method is used to monitor the snow cover of the study area from the satellite image. The multi-temporal analysis of the snow cover derived from the AVHRR data shows that the binary snow cover in the study area increases with time from November to March due to successive snowfalls. After that, the snow cover starts to deplete from the mid-March onwards due to rise in temperature. Maximum snow cover area (SCA) has been found 85.67% and minimum is at 14.33% respectively. An attempt has been made to understand the influence of terrain parameters by extracting the major terrain and snow parameters for each of the avalanche site and correlating it with occurrences of the avalanches. The study suggests that the sites having terrain characteristics of slope 25–45°, aspect 26.45%, and altitude 2500–3500 m has more occurrences of avalanches. © 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","avalanche; AVHRR; complex terrain; Shuttle Radar Topography Mission; snow cover; statistical analysis; statistical data; temporal variation; time series analysis","Avalanche; AVHRR; Snow cover; Temporal variation; Terrain","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070820221"

In this study, we used a multi-temporal approach (1986, 2011 and 2016), to analyze the patterns of habitat fragmentation and to identify critical zones for the maintenance of habitat connectivity of two focal pine species (Pinus pseudostrobus and P. montezumae) with the broadest distribution and highest economic importance in the temperate forests of the Meseta Purépecha, in Michoacán, Mexico. This eco-region is currently one of the most threatened in terms of habitat degradation and extinction of forest communities. From a supervised classification of satellite images, land use coverage classes were selected and used as a basis to analyze the degree of landscape fragmentation using configuration and composition metrics and landscape connectivity based on the graph-theory approach. The fragmentation metrics suggested an increase in agricultural coverage (10.81%; fruits crop, mainly avocado), while the coverage of the forest showed a reduction (15.06%) and fragmentation throughout the study period. The landscape connectivity is lower (16.3% on average) and showed two highly important zones (Uruapan and Tancítaro) and one zone of high importance (Pátzcuaro) to maintain connectivity, considering three different dispersion distances (0.5, 5.0 and 10 km) for the species analyzed. We propose these three zones as potential habitat stepping stones to promote overall landscape connectivity, offering primary habitats and possible ecological resilience for this important forest ecosystem. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","","Conservation; Habitat patches; Land use; Management; Micro-region; Pinus","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065447770"

However, most relative radiometric normalization methods assume a linear relationship and they cannot take into account nonlinear properties, such as the distribution of the earth's surface or phenological differences that are caused by the growth of vegetation. Thus, this paper proposes a novel method that assumes a nonlinear relationship and it uses a representative nonlinear regression model-multilayer perceptron (MLP). The proposed method performs radiometric resolution compression while considering both the complexity and time cost, and radiometric control set samples are extracted based on a no-change set method. Subsequently, the spectral index is selected for each band to compensate for the phenological properties, phenological normalization is performed based on MLP, and the global radiometric properties are adjusted through postprocessing. Finally, a performance evaluation is conducted by comparing the results herein with those from conventional relative radiometric normalization algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in terms of both visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. In other words, the applicability of the proposed method to the normalization of multi-temporal images with nonlinear properties is confirmed. © 2019 by the authors.","","Multilayer perceptron; Nonlinear; Phenological normalization; Radiometric resolution compression; Relative radiometric normalization; Spectral index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075250405"

If multiple satellite scenes cover the study area, it is difficult to compare and process the images for change detection and long-term trend analysis of the same day and/or seasons from different satellites or sensors. Moreover, the validation of all the past images is a challenge due to unavailability of past ground truth datasets. The proposed calibration paradigm in this study is based on radiance normalization in the spatial and spectral domain to ease the alignment of multiple images into an identical radiometric foundation. In this study, an intuitive radiometric correction technique (at a daily, monthly and yearly scale) was proposed, aimed at all Landsat sensors' datasets for long-term Land Use Land Cover (LULC) trend analysis for a dry semi-arid river basin in western India, facing drought conditions. The post-calibration mosaiced images were smooth, and meaningful LULC classification results could be obtained easily for all the years. The LULC change dynamics were analyzed and compared for the years 1972, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 in Shivna River Basin. During these study periods, wasteland was found to be the most altered class, followed by agricultural land and forest. The spatial extent of agricultural land was found to decrease linearly, while forest cover showed an exponential decrease; a linear increase was observed in wasteland. Though during the 44 years study period (1972–2016), 241.48 km                             2                              area was converted to agricultural land from wasteland, but more than double that land was converted to wasteland from agricultural land; alarmingly, 5.18% (8.12% in 1972 and 2.94% in 2016) forest cover decreased. The existing forest cover in 2016 is approximately one-third compared to 1972. The present work provides a generic framework for the calibration of multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite images for long-term LULC trend analysis, which can be adopted for other satellite datasets.                          © 2019","","Environmental science; Geophysics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064461675"

The present micro-level study focuses on the shoreline dynamics and associated landscape alteration rate of different land use/land cover patterns over 2.24 km2 area, along about 3 km coastline at low-lying (1.45 m) fragile land-shorefront stretch of the Sagar Island, India using multi-temporal satellite images of pre-Aila (2006) and post-Aila (2010 and 2017) periods. The embankment and shoreline shifting trends and predicted positions are estimated through the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) considering multiple shoreline/embankment positions over the period of 2006 to 2017. About 0.64 km2 area of productive land is exposed to marine action due to the rapid rate of shoreline retreat (28.48 m/y) within the decade. The coastal vulnerability index (CVI) is estimated after considering the 14 parameters from physical and socioeconomic variables. The result reveals that the shorefront zones (3 and 5) are highly vulnerable with CVI of 1 and 0.494 than the interior zones (2 and 4). The estimated vulnerability divulges that in the near future, the entire area will ruin due to high rate of land erosion with triggered effects of the local sea level rise (SLR) and associated hazards. The adopted multi-criterion CVI estimation method can also be applied over a large area in the other coastal stretch of the tropical regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","","Coastal vulnerability assessment; Fragile coastal environment; Post-Aila landscape alteration; Sagar Island; Shoreline/embankment shifting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074299611"

When analyzing multi-temporal satellite images, it is crucial to distinguish viewpoint or color variations of an identical object from actual changes. Especially in urban areas, the registration difficulty due to high-rise buildings makes conventional change detection techniques unreliable, if they are not combined with preprocessing schemes using digital surface models or multi-spectral information. We design three encoder-decoder-structured CNNs, which yield change maps from an input pair of RGB satellite images. For the supervised learning of these CNNs, we construct a large fully-labeled dataset using Google Earth images taken in different years and seasons. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained CNNs detect actual changes successfully, even though image pairs are neither perfectly registered nor color-corrected. Furthermore, an ensemble of the three CNNs provides excellent performance, outperforming each individual CNN. © 2018 APSIPA organization.","Convolution; Large dataset; Neural networks; Tall buildings; Change detection algorithms; Convolutional neural network; Digital surface models; High resolution satellite images; High rise building; Multi-temporal satellite images; Ortho-rectification; Preprocessing scheme; Satellites","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063456307"

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring.Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale. In this paper, a novel and optimal deep learning model for pixel-based LC&CC is developed and implemented based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using multi-temporal sentinel-2 imagery of central north part of Italy, which has diverse agricultural system dominated by economic crop types. The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study. We also tested other widely used traditional machine learning algorithms for comparison such as support vector machine SVM, random forest (RF), Kernal SVM, and gradient boosting machine, also called XGBoost.

For this study, Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) was used, and the proposed model was evaluated on test sites in Yeongam and Jindo, South Korea. The proposed DNN model was able to consider the variations of atmospheric condition and successfully learn the complex meteorological patterns by using multi-temporal COMS satellite images stacked with historical PV data.

In this study, we proposed a superpixel-based prediction transformation-fusion (SPTF) time-series reconstruction method for cloud/shadow-covered optical images. Central to this approach is the incorporation between intrinsic tendency from multi-temporal optical images and sequential transformation information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, through autoencoder networks (AE). First, a modified superpixel algorithm was applied on multi-temporal optical images with their manually delineated cloud/shadow masks to generate superpixels. Second, multi-temporal optical images and SAR data were overlaid onto superpixels to produce superpixel-wise time-series curves with missing values. Third, these superpixel-wise time series were clustered by an AE-LSTM (long short-term memory) unsupervised method into multiple clusters (searching similar superpixels). Four, for each superpixel-wise cluster, a prediction-transformation-based reconstruction model was established to restore missing values in optical time series. Finally, reconstructed data were merged with cloud-free regions to produce cloud-free time-series images. The proposed method was verified on two datasets of multi-temporal cloud/shadow-covered Landsat OLI images and Sentinel-1A SAR data. The reconstruction results, showing an improvement of greater than 20% in normalized mean square error compared to three state-of-the-art methods (including a spatially and temporally weighted regression method, a spectral–temporal patch-based method, and a patch-based contextualized AE method), demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in time-series reconstruction for multi-temporal optical images. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","image analysis; Landsat; machine learning; pixel; radar imagery; satellite imagery; Sentinel; synthetic aperture radar; time series analysis","cloud and shadow; deep learning; Landsat image; Sentinel-1 SAR; superpixel; Time-series reconstruction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095769926"

PDR goes beyond physical reconstruction (physical recovery) and includes relevant processes such as economic and social (functional recovery) processes. Knowing the size and location of the places that positively or negatively recovered is important to effectively support policymakers to help readjust planning and resource allocation to rebuild better. Disasters and the subsequent recovery are mainly expressed through unique land cover and land use changes (LCLUCs). Although LCLUCs have been widely studied in remote sensing, their value for recovery assessment has not yet been explored, which is the focus of this paper. An RS-based methodology was created for PDR assessment based on multi-temporal, very high-resolution satellite images. Different trajectories of change were analyzed and evaluated, i.e., transition patterns (TPs) that signal positive or negative recovery. Experimental analysis was carried out on three WorldView-2 images acquired over Tacloban city, Philippines, which was heavily affected by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Support vector machine, a robust machine learning algorithm, was employed with texture features extracted from the grey level co-occurrence matrix and local binary patterns. Although classification results for the images before and four years after the typhoon show high accuracy, substantial uncertainties mark the results for the immediate post-event image. All land cover (LC) and land use (LU) classified maps were stacked, and only changes related to TPs were extracted. The final products are LC and LU recovery maps that quantify the PDR process at the pixel level. It was found that physical and functional recovery can be mainly explained through the LCLUC information. In addition, LC and LU-based recovery maps support a general and a detailed recovery understanding, respectively. It is therefore suggested to use the LC and LU-based recovery maps to monitor and support the short and the long-term recovery, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Disasters; Hurricanes; Land use; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Textures; Land cover; Philippines; Post disasters; Super typhoon haiyan; Worldview-2; Recovery","Land cover and land use based recovery maps; Machine learning; Multi-temporal worldview-2 imagery; Post-disaster recovery assessment; Super typhoon haiyan; SVM; The Philippines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066744412"

The initial disaster response activity is evaluation of the damages, i.e. creation of a detailed damage estimation for different object types throughout the affected area. First responders and government stakeholders require the damage information to plan rescue operations and later on to guide the recovery process. Remote sensing, due to its agile data acquisition capability, synoptic coverage and low cost, has long been used as a vital tool to collect information after a disaster and conduct damage assessment. To detect damages from remote sensing imagery (both UAV and satellite images) structural rubble/debris has been employed as a proxy to detect damaged buildings/areas. However, disaster debris often includes vegetation, sediments and relocated personal property in addition to structural rubble, i.e. items that are wind-or waterborne and not necessarily associated with the closest building. Traditionally, land cover classification-based damage detection has been categorizing debris as damaged areas. However, in particular in waterborne disaster such as tsunamis or storm surges, vast areas end up being debris covered, effectively hindering actual building damage to be detected, and leading to an overestimation of damaged area. Therefore, to perform a precise damage assessment, and consequently recovery assessment that relies on a clear damage benchmark, it is crucial to separate actual structural rubble from ephemeral debris. In this study two approaches were investigated for two types of data (i.e., UAV images, and multi-temporal satellite images). To do so, three textural analysis, i.e., Gabor filters, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Histogram of the Oriented Gradients (HOG), were implemented on mosaic UAV images, and the relation between debris type and their time of removal was investigated using very high-resolution satellite images. The results showed that the HOG features, among other texture features, have the potential to be used for debris identification. In addition, multi-temporal satellite image analysis showed that debris removal time needs to be investigated using daily images, because the removal time of debris may change based on the type of disaster and its location. © Authors 2019.","Data acquisition; Debris; Disasters; Gabor filters; Image analysis; Recovery; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Shape optimization; Textures; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Damage assessments; Land cover classification; Local binary patterns; Multi-temporal satellite images; Oriented gradients; Remote sensing imagery; Satellite images; Very high resolution satellite images; Damage detection","damage assessment; Debris identification; recovery; satellite images; UAV","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067438372"

Study area was located on Sanlmrfa province, Turkey/which hosts huge amount of agricultural production of cotton and maize in spring-summer season with its suitable and effective irrigation system. The Landsat 8 OLI multi-temporal images acquired with 16-day interval were used to identify cultivated areas in the study area. Image acquisition dates from 30 April 2015 to 21 September 2015 completely covers the phenological development period of cultivated crop types. Terrain corrected images were radiometncally calibrated to produce Top of Atmosphere (ToA) reflectance images, in order to reduce the atmospheric and illumination effects, thus providing efficient multi-temporal analysis. ToA reflectance images were then used in vegetation index (VI) production. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Transformed Difference Vegetation Index (TDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) were used in this research as vegetation suppression and data dimension reduction methods. Then VI image stacks were classified with pixel based Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and results were compared with statistical production database to evaluate the effectiveness of broadband Vis in cultivated area and crop pattern detection. Results of the analysis provided that, GNDVI based dataset provided highest accuracies according to areal comparison and point based accuracy assessment. NDVI and TDVI based datasets were ranked as the second with similar accuracy results, while EVI based dataset was in the last place when compared to remaining VI datasets.

Maximum likelihood algorithm of supervised classification was applied for each Landsat satellite images to generate land use and land cover map of the study area using ERDAS Imagine software. The levels of accuracy of these classifications were evaluated using confusion matrix to derive the overall accuracy. The finding of this study indicated that in the base year (1985), the largest LULC was occupied by agriculture covered, 60% of the entire area in 1985, 48% in 2000 and 38% in 2015, while the urban area increased by 10%, 19% and 39% in 1985, 2000 and 2015, respectively. The decline of the agricultural area was the fast conversion of the agricultural land into the urban areas. The vegetated area was 19% in 1985, 16% in 2000 and 20% in 2015, and also barren lands were possessed 11% in 1985, 17% in 2000 and 3% in 2015 of the entire study area. Even though many changes have observed among the LULC in the year between 1985 and 2015, the highest rate of changes was observed in urban land which increased by 9.9% in every year and vegetated areas by 0.1% per year. Besides, agricultural and barren lands are also decreased in size by 1.18% and 2.38%, respectively, in 2015 when compared with 1985.

Over the years, a wide range of methods have been developed for analyzing remote sensing data and newer methods are still being developed. Timely and accurate change detection of Earth’s surface features provides the basis for evaluating the relationships and interactions between human and natural phenomena for the better management of resources. In general, change detection applies multi-temporal datasets to quantitatively analyse the temporal effects of the phenomenon.

With the development of remote sensing, abundant data sources strongly guarantee that researchers can identify crop types and map their spatial distributions. However, to date, only a few studies have been conducted to identify vineyards using satellite image data. In this study, a vineyard is identified using satellite images, and a new approach is proposed that integrates the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the original time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) are reconstructed by applying an iterated Savitzky-Golay (S-G) method to form a daily time series for a full year; then, the CWT is applied to three reconstructed time series to generate corresponding scalograms; and finally, CNN technology is used to identify vineyards based on the stacked scalograms. In addition to our approach, a traditional and common approach that uses a random forest (RF) to identify crop types based on multi-temporal images is selected as the control group. The experimental results demonstrated the following: (i) the proposed approach was comprehensively superior to the RF approach; it improved the overall accuracy by 9.87% (up to 89.66%); (ii) the CWT had a stable and effective influence on the reconstructed time series, and the scalograms fully represented the unique time-related frequency pattern of each of the planting conditions; and (iii) the convolution and max pooling processing of the CNN captured the unique and subtle distribution patterns of the scalograms to distinguish vineyards from other crops. Additionally, the proposed approach is considered as able to be applied to other practical scenarios, such as using time series data to identify crop types, map landcover/land use, and is recommended to be tested in future practical applications. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Crops; Decision trees; Identification (control systems); Neural networks; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Vegetation; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Continuous wavelet transforms; Convolutional neural network; Distribution patterns; Enhanced vegetation index; Normalized difference vegetation index; Sentinel-2; Vineyard; Wavelet transforms","CNN; CWT; Identification; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Vineyard","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075368323"

Besides, several conventional techniques for controlling and monitoring anarchic urban expansion have been initiated but they remain not sufficient to overcome this issue.This paper proposes an automatic method of detection and monitoring of anarchic urban expansions starting from multi-sources and multi-temporal data (VHR satellite images and geographic information data). First, the illegal urban areas are extracted using an original SVM based technique integrating expert knowledge and auxiliary data by means of ontology construction. This leads to the formalization of the expert semantic information and the urban construction rules (often in sentences form) and their confrontation with the classification results.Secondly, the SITS classified images are modeled using Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs (SOTAG) constructed for each region of the first image. These graphs are then classified using a Marginalized Graph Kernel (MGK) SVM based classification in order to extract regions with similar temporal evolution. We are focusing mainly on monitoring legal and illegal urban expansions. The resulted spatio-temporal map describes urban areas types and their changes over time. © 2019 IEEE.","Audio signal processing; Classification (of information); Crime; Ontology; Satellites; Semantics; Speech communication; Support vector machines; Time series analysis; concepts; Conventional techniques; Geographic information; Ontology construction; Semantic information; SOTAG; SVM classification; VHR images; Image classification","concepts; etc; MGK; ontology; SITIS monitoring; SOTAG; SVM classification; VHR images","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068980919"

Our model significantly expedites the generation of satellite imagery-based flood maps, crucial for first responders and local authorities in the early stages of flood events. By incorporating multitemporal satellite imagery, our model allows for rapid and accurate post-disaster damage assessment and can be used by governments to better coordinate medium- and long-term financial assistance programs for affected areas. The network consists of multiple streams of encoder-decoder architectures that extract spatiotemporal information from medium-resolution images and spatial information from high-resolution images before fusing the resulting representations into a single medium-resolution segmentation map of flooded buildings. We compare our model to state-of-the-art methods for building footprint segmentation as well as to alternative fusion approaches for the segmentation of flooded buildings and find that our model performs best on both tasks. We also demonstrate that our model produces highly accurate segmentation maps of flooded buildings using only publicly available medium-resolution data instead of significantly more detailed but sparsely available very high-resolution data.

Very high resolution (VHR) multitemporal images are useful in CD on the Earth's surface and have abundant information sources, enabling more precise CD analysis. The CD is largely divided into pixel-based change detection (PBCD) and object-based change detection (OBCD). In this study, various PBCD methods were combined with a segmentation result to conduct the OBCD of VHR images. The used PBCD techniques in this study are change vector analysis (CVA), iteratively reweighted-multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD), and principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering from which the binary CD results (i.e., change and no-change) were derived. In order to expand PBCD to OBCD, major voting technique was applied to binary CD results within each object of segmented image that was created using eCognition software. In this process, registration noise (RN) was combined to further improve CD accuracy. The accuracy evaluation of the proposed CD method was conducted using manually digitized reference map. According to the accuracy evaluation, OBCD results that were made by combining all PBCD were the most accurate with 0.393 f1-score. The OBCD results generated by CVA on the side showed the lowest accuracy with 0.301 f1-score. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

Four regression methods are selected to carry out the transformation: Gaussian processes, support vector machines, random forests, and a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate not only potentials and limitations of our framework, but also the pros and cons of each regression method, we perform experiments on two data sets.

In the current study, multispectral Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, and Landsat-5 TM satellite imagery data has used in the Haridwar region for investigating the utility and possibility of remote sensing (RS) in LU/LC change assessment. After ensuring a ground survey with GPS, discussions with the individuals, and satisfactory literature-review, it has been found that RS can play a vital character in assessing the timely temporary changes in LU/LC of the Haridwar region. The satellite data of the different years 1996, 2003, 2010 and 2017 downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer. The satellite images of the selected study areas are categorized into seven different land use classes, viz. orchards, vegetation, agricultural land, rangeland, urban land, water bodies, and watershed. The pixel-based supervised classification method has performed 81.55%, 86.86%, 80.67%, and 93.00% accuracy using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The result of change detection of the LU/LC proved that the orchards area has been decreased very rapidly by 11806.65 ha (9.82%) and converted permanently in urban and agricultural land due to urbanization and industrialization in Haridwar region from 1996 to 2017 year. While the remaining area of land use such as urban land, rangeland, and watershed have increased up to 3022.11 ha (2.51%), 10088.82 ha (8.39%), and 5191.47 ha (4.32%). The vegetation land and water body have been decreasing since 1996 up to 12856.41 ha (10.70%) and 802.63 ha (0.66%) respectively in 21 years (1996-2017).

There are three types of registration namely multi-view, multimodal and multi-temporal. In multi-view based registration, the images of the same scene taken at different viewpoints are analyzed and modeled for the requirement. Hence stereoscopic image sequences of the same view are acquired, and accurate comparison for the image classification is essential. This paper presents a robust method which has three steps. The first phase includes obtaining hyper spectral (satellite) images and preprocessing of them, the second period subdivides into image blocks for alignment, and the final step focuses on classification based on hyper graph structure using deep learning approach. For processing of satellite images, a new method linear iterative clustering and deep neural network classification are employed. Previous works in remote sensing applications involve training samples and hence prior knowledge of image sets which incurs more computational time. The implementation of this method shows an automatic, achieving better accuracy and dynamic reconfigurable image registration in reduced complexity. The mathematical model used is hidden markov chain model for clustering which provides region-wise feature construction for evaluating region shape and contextual information. The work yields classification accuracy of 94.12% which is far better than past outcomes in this engaged field of research.

A precondition to make automatic monitoring of fields for this purpose possible is that the object geometric boundary is correct. This precondition can be addressed to some extent by performing image time series analysis to identify changes. Accurate object change detection in agricultural fields on satellite images requires separating object class changes such as new ditches, buildings, or roads from other changes, such as crop development, crop management practices, seasonal variation, or shadows from adjacent objects. In this paper we present an approach to identify unchanged agricultural fields using Deep Neural Networks. We propose a combination of CNNs for semantic segmentation and ConvLSTMs for change detection, applied to multitemporal satellite image time-series of arbitrary length. The neural networks were trained on images acquired over the Netherlands in 2017 by the TripleSat and PlanetScope constellations (0.8 and 3.5m resolution respectively) with RGB and NIR bands. We introduce techniques to create artificial change training data, reducing the need for real training data. The results demonstrate that (1) a neural network is not required to be deep to achieve usable semantic segmentation performance for satellite images for this application, that (2) ConvLSTMs can to some extent compensate imperfect image alignment and pixel misclassification, that (3) longer time series significantly increase the performance of the change detection and that (4) expanding and densifying the time series with lower resolution imagery does not improve accuracy in this particular configuration. © 2019 SPIE.","Crops; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Object detection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Time series analysis; Automatic monitoring; Change detection; ConvLSTM; Crop management practices; Geometric boundaries; High resolution satellite images; Multi-temporal satellite images; Semantic segmentation; Image enhancement","Change detection; CNN; ConvLSTM; Deep learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078159665"

Urbanization progress that occurs due to population expansion and migration results in important changes in the land cover characteristics of a city. These changes mostly affect natural habitats and the ecosystem in a negative manner. Hence, urbanization-related changes should be monitored regularly, and land cover maps should be updated to reflect the current situation. This research presents a comparative evaluation of two classification algorithms, pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) classification and decision-tree-oriented geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) classification, in producing a dynamic land cover map of the Istanbul metropolitan city in Turkey between 2013 and 2017 using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multi-temporal satellite images. Additionally, the efficiencies of the two data dimension reduction methods are evaluated as part of this research. For dimension reduction, built-up index (BUI) and principal component analysis (PCA) data were calculated for five images during the mentioned period, and the classification algorithms were applied on data stacks for each dimension reduction method. The classification results indicate that the GEOBIA classification of the BUI data set provided the highest accuracy, with a 91.60% overall accuracy and 0.91 kappa value. This combination was followed by the GEOBIA classification of the PCA data set, which highlights the overall efficiency of the GEOBIA over the SVM method. On the other hand, the BUI data set provided more reliable and consistent results for urban expansion classes due to representing physical responses of the surface when compared to the data set of the PCA, which is a spectral transformation method. © 2019 by the author.","","Built-up index; Land cover mapping; Object-based decision tree classification; Principal component analysis; Support vector machine classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063688175"

It contains thousands of ancient, yet in use, man-made structures. Owing to its geographic location, and episodic catastrophic floods from the Kaveri and Kollidam Rivers, the region has been inundated frequently leading to the burial of many smaller structures. Thematic maps of geomorphology, vegetation index, land use, digital elevation model, slope, etc., have been generated through multi-temporal remote sensing satellite images. A compilation of historic (stone inscriptions, temple documents) and literature data followed by detailed survey of the region using vertical electrical sounding (VES) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) through 200 and 400 MHz shielded antennas has led to the discovery of several buried manmade structures at various depths ranging from 0.54 to 3.55 m below ground level (b.g.l.) that were known only in the literature, hearsay and folklore. The VES, GPR and field surveys delineated four major soil/sediment horizons below the ground surface. Sedimentological characteristics of a massive river sand bed found overlying a weathered zone suggest deposition during a major catastrophic flood. The occurrence of flood deposits burying historic structures especially adjoining the regional tectonic structure indicate episodically active climatic and tectonic processes that played a significant role in the burial of ancient-historic land surface and manmade structures that were under desolation after invasion and desecration by war-lords of yore. This study demonstrates the potential of combining traditional knowledge and modern technologies to gain insights to locate historic/archaeological sites and discover buried structures. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","","buried sites; catastrophic floods; geoarchaeology; geophysical exploration; ground-penetrating radar; India; Kaveri River","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055269650"

However, conventional topography and remote sensing methods pose several challenges. Fieldwork in remote areas could be insecure or be hard to conduct due to physical barriers. Remote sensing satellite images, in turn, may lack the temporal resolution for monitoring topography changes or be covered by clouds and shadows that reduce their usefulness. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) provide high-resolution imagery from remote areas and may give a greater insight into land surface changes. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of the Normalized Difference Elevation Index (NDEI), derived from UAV surveys, to map changes in topography in different environments, including a quarry zone of sand mines in Colombia, and in the North Pole Ice Cap. As the NDEI is a metric capable to reveal topography disturbances, it could be exploited for rapid assessments of mass movements occurrence. For this research, a fine temporal resolution dataset of monthly NDEI values were used to explore their utility as a mass wasting identification technique. NDEI was used to map changes in the land surface in a quarry zone affected by landslides and mudflows. NDEI values were obtained from the multi-temporal analysis of digital surface models generated from UAV images and processed using Structure from motion (SfM) techniques. Main components of the proposed method are: (i)UAVbased imagery data capture, (ii)data processing using SfM techniques, (iii)NDEI calculation, and (iv)mass movement identification. Results illustrate the feasibility of using UAV-based imagery data to increase the accuracy of land changes information and produce rapid assessments of mass movements occurrence. Results show that the NDEI approach may increase the accuracy of land surface changes assessment and mapping, as well as enable the design of new methodologies to identify natural hazards and risks. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.","Antennas; Data handling; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Hazards; Landslides; Mapping; Quarries; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Surface measurement; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Geomorphological studies; High resolution imagery; Identification techniques; Land surface change; Multi-temporal analysis; NDEI; Normalized differences; Remote sensing satellites; Topography","DEM; Land surface changes; NDEI; Remote sensing; UAV","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074247370"

Based on the integrated GIS, it was possible to reconstruct an ancient grid of 4- and 6-heca-togygos blocks linked to the terrain, separated by roads. The creation of plans for intra-unit land surveying was carried out on the basis of the analysis of multi-temporal aerial and satellite imagery in the ArcGIS geographic information environment. It was carried out by creating and further processing a group of vector layers, the main of which included a grid of roads, the rest - dividing blocks into plots and single hector modules. The analysis in the GIS of the mutual arrangement of the elements of this grid made it possible to determine the sequence of development and delimitation of the territory of the Heraclean Peninsula in the 4th century BC. The study of the internal surveying of blocks by mosaic of aerial photographs of 1941-1944, integrated into the GIS, made it possible to trace the dynamics of changes in the 3rd century BC of internal division of blocs from individual civil plots (hectators) to large land holdings, sometimes reaching and even exceeding the size of the whole block.

The main object of research is the forests of the Karelian basement lake-taiga plain (eastern part of the Baltic crystalline shield). A quantitative analysis of changes in the species composition of forests in historical time was carried out for the first time. Retrospective, cartographic, comparative, historical and geographical sections of the methods were used to carry out the study. The relevance of the study is to create a new methodology of historical-geo-ecological orientation, using GIS - technologies. To carry out this survey, it is necessary to have the results of historical and geographical periodization and regionalization in the specified region, which were prepared by us earlier. The study included five main stages: 1) a scheme of historical and geographical zoning of the Karelian region was created on the basis of historical and geographical periodization; 2) multi-temporal maps of the vegetation cover: restored vegetation (by a time slice about 1000 years ago), a map of the vegetation cover 50 years ago (1970-80s); a map of modern vegetation was compiled for a part of the Onega Lake basin by means of decoding satellite images of 2013; they were prepared for overlay; 3) the scheme of historical and geographical zoning was superimposed on each of the listed vegetation maps; 4) the nature of the distribution of the species composition of forest vegetation over a specific chronological section and their presentation in the form of bar charts was established for each historical and geographical province; 5) analysis of the diagrams of changes in the species composition of vegetation by provinces and regions, made it possible to quantify the size of the loss of coniferous forest area over historical time. Quantitative data on the degree to which a person transforms the forest landscapes of the Karelian region by three time sections - 1000 years ago, 50 years ago and on a modern chronological section, using geographic information systems made it possible to judge the period of the largest anthropogenic load on specific development cores within the Onega Lake basin for historical time.

Due to the ultra-high spatial resolution of UAV images, spatial contextual information such as texture is often used for crop classification. From a data availability viewpoint, it is not always possible to acquire time-series UAV images due to limited accessibility to the study area. Thus, it is necessary to improve classification performance for situations when a single or minimum number of UAV images are available for crop classification. In this study, we investigate the potential of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based texture information for crop classification with time-series UAV images and machine learning classifiers including random forest and support vector machine. In particular, the impact of combining texture and spectral information on the classification performance is evaluated for cases that use only one UAV image or multi-temporal images as input. A case study of crop classification in Anbandegi of Korea was conducted for the above comparisons. The best classification accuracy was achieved when multi-temporal UAV images which can fully account for the growth cycles of crops were combined with GLCM-based texture features. However, the impact of the utilization of texture information was not significant. In contrast, when one August UAV image was used for crop classification, the utilization of texture information significantly affected the classification performance. Classification using texture features extracted from GLCM with larger kernel size significantly improved classification accuracy, an improvement of 7.72%p in overall accuracy for the support vector machine classifier, compared with classification based solely on spectral information. These results indicate the usefulness of texture information for classification of ultra-high-spatial-resolution UAV images, particularly when acquisition of time-series UAV images is difficult and only one UAV image is used for crop classification. © 2019 by the authors.","","Crop; Gray-level co-occurrence matrix; Machine learning; Texture; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061603571"

In this work, we propose a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) based unsupervised multiple-change detection approach that simultaneously accounts for the high spatial correlation among pixels in Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) images and the differences in multisensor images. We accomplish this by learning in an unsupervised way a transcoding between multisensor multitemporal data by exploiting a cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) that consists of two generator CNN networks. After unsupervised training, one generator of the CycleGAN is used to mitigate multisensor differences, while the other is used as a feature extractor that enables the computation of multitemporal deep features. These features are then compared pixelwise to generate a change detection map. Changed pixels are then further analyzed based on multitemporal deep features for identifying different kind of changes (multiple-change detection). Results obtained on multisensor multitemporal dataset consisting of Quickbird and Pleiades images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ©2019 IEEE","Convolutional neural networks; Feature extraction; Pixels; Remote sensing; Adversarial networks; Feature extractor; Multi sensor images; Multi-temporal data; Multi-temporal satellite images; Spatial correlations; Unsupervised training; Very-high spatial resolutions; Deep learning","Change detection; Deep Change Vector Analysis; Deep learning; Generative Adversarial Network; Multisensor images; Multitemporal images; Very High Resolution","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091066032"

The Scrivia River is among the most relevant right-bank tributaries of the Po River; it is about 90 km long and origins from the Ligurian-Piedmontese Appennines. The study reach is about 16 km long, close to the Po River, and generally shows a single-thread, sinuous and deep-incised channel. Nowadays the lower Scrivia River presents many bank retreat processes that involve surrounding areas, creating serious management issues. The aim of this research is to outline in detail the active-channel morphological evolution over the last 100-150 years, and characterize channelization and riverscape changes, with a specific focus on the occupation of the areas of fluvial pertinence. A quantitative multi-temporal analysis supported by field surveys and based on historical maps, aerial photographs and satellite images was performed in a GIS environment through automated and semi-automated procedures. The active channel experienced a well-defined sequence of morphological evolutionary phases. They were substantially characterized by a gradual increase of the active-channel stability and a reduction of the active-channel width, up to the end of the 20th century. Since the 2000s, morphological evolutionary trends have changed. Anthropic pressures on the river system, and in particular bank protections, are documented to have played a key role in driving the active-channel changes, and consequently, the near-riverbed land-property and land-use changes. In this respect, on the basis of cadastral data, the past legal framework is also identified as a relevant conditioning factor of the river-corridor morphological evolution. The ongoing dynamics most probably represent the morphological response to the documented, severe anthropic alterations, and are currently raising serious management issues. © 2019 WIT Press.","Italy; Liguria; Piedmont [Italy]; Po River; Antennas; Automation; Bank protection; Geographic information systems; Land use; Laws and legislation; Automated procedures; Channel planform; Channelization; Morphological evolution; Morphological response; Multi-temporal analysis; Regulations; River corridor; aerial photography; basin evolution; cadastre; channel morphology; channelization; environmental issue; GIS; land management; land use change; legislation; regulatory approach; river; river bank; river channel; river management; satellite imagery; Rivers","Bank protection; Channel planform changes; Channelization; Gis; Italian rivers; Land property; Land use; Regulations; River corridor; Scrivia River","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068890168"

Satellite images can capture the ground surface conditions and give a huge amount of information in a single image. In recent days, with the availability of multi-temporal satellite data, monitoring of flood events have become pretty easy. It gives accurate and real time flood information. Flood is one of the most disastrous natural disasters in Assam, India. It is necessary to predict or monitor flood events to minimise the overall damage caused due to floods. There are many scientific approaches which have been made operational in flood monitoring related activities. However Deep Learning based approaches are not yet fully exploited so far to monitor and predict flood events. We propose flood detection in real-time with the help of multispectral images and SAR data using Deep Learning technique Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The satellite images are from Sentinel-2 and the SAR data are from Sentinel-1. The CNN was trained with 100 images for 100 iterations. CNN has shown excellent performance in image-oriented tasks like classification, segmentation and feature extraction. Recently Deep learning techniques are used extensively on remote sensing data due to their high resolution and the former’s extensive computing capability. The study area comprises of 2 districts namely Barpeta and Kamrup of Assam, India. We have obtained an accuracy of 80% in detecting flood.

It is exposed to a complex interaction of natural phenomena, oil and gas activities, fishing and navigational activities and these are potential sources of oil slicks and seeps. This work is primarily aimed at characterizing oil on water events and their association to oil and gas activities utilizing space synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The primary dataset being multi temporal Sentinel – 1A data acquired between 2015 and 2018. The analysis involved derivation of backscatter coefficients of the SAR images used, in order to identify dark regions. A novel approach applying gamma augmentation to the SAR datasets for the purpose of optimized characterization of the detected dark regions. Enhanced discrimination of dark regions using gamma, aided inference on the nature of weathering, thickness and behaviour of the detected oil anomaly. Geometric, textural and radiometric parameters of areas of detected anomalies were extracted and computed for the purpose of anomaly characterization. An anomaly confidence estimation algorithm was utilized, incorporating four key parameters in confidence estimation. These parameters are Homogeneity - uniformity in dark pixels of anomaly, Association - relationship of anomaly with a possible source, Signature - geometry of anomaly and contrast with respect to the ocean and Detectability - Ocean and satellite parameters such as wind speed and satellite incident angle. The quantitative extraction of these confidence estimating parameters was instrumental in the numerical computation of confidence levels using the HADS (Homogeneity Association Detectability Signature algorithm) computational method. Detected high confidence oil anomaly were strongly related to Otuo offshore oil and gas infrastructure, and these validated using optical satellite images: Landsat - 8 and Sentinel - 2. The results derived from this study establishes that SAR is a practical and effective tool in detecting oil on water within offshore oil mining leases, in addition to confirmation that oil spills occur as a result of oil and gas activities within this mining lease. © 2021 International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering.

Several strategies can be used for soil mapping, from a tacit knowledge to mathematical modeling. However, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding how to optimize subsurface mapping. This work aimed to quantify subsurface soil attributes using satellite spectral reflectance and geographically weighted regression (GWR) techniques. The study was carried out in São Paulo, Brazil, in an area spanning 47,882 ha. Multitemporal satellite images (Landsat-5) were initially processed in order to retrieve spectral reflectance from the bare soil surface. Based on a toposequence method, 328 points were then distributed across the area (at depths between 0 and 20 cm and 80 and 100 cm) and analyzed for their soil chemical and physical attributes (including the reflectance spectra (400 to 2500 nm)) in the laboratory. We achieved 67.72% of bare soil for the whole study area, with the remaining 32.28% of the unmapped surface being filled by kriging interpolation. All 328 samples were modeled using surface (Landsat-5 TM spectral reflectance) and subsurface (acquired in the laboratory) data, reaching up to 0.72 R                             2                                                          adj                             .

The satellite soil surface reflectance allowed the estimation of soil subsurface attributes. These results demonstrate that diagnostic soil attributes can be quantified based on spectral pedotransfer (SPEDO) functions to assist digital soil mapping and soil monitoring. Despite our efforts to determine soil subsurface properties using digital soil mapping approach, this task still need considerable refinement.

However, these three issues have not been simultaneously considered by the existing methods. This article presents a comprehensive radiometric normalization method for multitemporal HRSI using a radiometric block adjustment without master images. Pseudoinvariant features (PIFs) extracted from image pairs using the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection are used as the corresponding pixel observations and organized to form radiometric tie points according to the corresponding horizontal space coordinates. Radiometric error equations are subsequently constructed, and the linear radiometric transformation parameters are solved by a global adjustment. The time-invariant PIFs generally represent the true corresponding features and naturally avoid the cloud, water, and land changes, which can eliminate the effects of outliers. Furthermore, the pixel values of tie points calculated from the weighted average of the corresponding pixel observations are used as virtual radiometric control points to eliminate the dependency on master images. Moreover, a global optimum can be achieved by the global adjustment, effectively overcoming the error accumulation, which is severe in large datasets. Four groups of HRSI datasets from various satellites are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms two state-of-the-art methods and has good applicability and stability, considering both visual effects and quantitative performance.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Errors; Iterative methods; Large dataset; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Pixels; Satellites; Statistics; Alteration detections; Error accumulation; High resolution satellite images; Multi-temporal satellite images; Pseudo-invariant features; Radiometric normalization; Transformation parameters; Weighted averages; image processing; multivariate analysis; pixel; radiometer; satellite imagery; Radiometry","Global radiometric block adjustment; multitemporal satellite images; multivariate alteration detection (MAD); radiometric normalization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094127691"

However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoacán, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images.

In this study, we used a multi-temporal approach (1986, 2011 and 2016), to analyze the patterns of habitat fragmentation and to identify critical zones for the maintenance of habitat connectivity of two focal pine species (Pinus pseudostrobus and P. montezumae) with the broadest distribution and highest economic importance in the temperate forests of the Meseta Purépecha, in Michoacán, Mexico. This eco-region is currently one of the most threatened in terms of habitat degradation and extinction of forest communities. From a supervised classification of satellite images, land use coverage classes were selected and used as a basis to analyze the degree of landscape fragmentation using configuration and composition metrics and landscape connectivity based on the graph-theory approach. The fragmentation metrics suggested an increase in agricultural coverage (10.81%; fruits crop, mainly avocado), while the coverage of the forest showed a reduction (15.06%) and fragmentation throughout the study period. The landscape connectivity is lower (16.3% on average) and showed two highly important zones (Uruapan and Tancítaro) and one zone of high importance (Pátzcuaro) to maintain connectivity, considering three different dispersion distances (0.5, 5.0 and 10 km) for the species analyzed.

The nature of the conflict between the changing wetland and agriculture landscape in the altered hydrological state in post-dam period is investigated and illustrated. Agriculture and wetland maps are prepared from multi-temporal satellite images using frequency approach. The result clearly exhibited that agriculture land is increased substantially (4316.95–8047.53 km2) and wetland is declined (1098.25–592.88 km2) in the post-dam state. Out of the lost, 268.33 km2 of wetland area is transformed into agricultural land and the transformation rate is high from low-frequency water presence (wetland with irregular water appearance) wetland to agricultural land. The consistency and stability of agriculture land are gradually increased over time when it is decreased in case of wetland. Extension and perforation of agricultural practices toward wetland areas are caused for wetland loss and fragmentation of wetland. It causes physical and ecological vulnerability of the same. Increasing number of wetland patches (25,839–31,769), decreasing frequency of agriculture patches (94,280–16,296), dwindling of large core wetland area (656.10–212.04 km2), doubling of large core agriculture land (2270.87–3822.88 km2), etc., are some of the evidences signifying growing conflict between wetland and agriculture land.

The evaluation of the trend, rate and magnitude changes was the objectives of this study. Five Landsat satellite images of different dates, i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1984, 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2015 with spatial resolution ranging from 15, 30 and 60metres were obtained from National Aeronautics Space Administration(NASA),United State Geological Survey Website and GIS facility of Sioux Falls Website and quantify the changes over a period of thirty-one (31) years. Supervised classification methodology was applied to the acquired multi-band raster imageries using maximum livelihood technique in ERDAS Imagine 9.3. The images of the study area were classified into three (3) classes namely; vegetation, water body and built-up area and were overlay with vector maps of the study area generated in ArcGIS 10. The results show that for the period of 31years (1984-2015), vegetation which covered 76.20% of the total area has decreased to 39.29%, water body decreases from 6.63% to 1.89% while the built –up area which initially was 17.14% as at 1984 increased to 58.82%. The study, however, recommended that there is a need for a timely Land use/ Land cover mapping of the entire Abeokuta and its environs in order to reduce the effects of undiscrimate land utilization in the area. This will also facilitate necessary Land use planning and forestall the rising sprawl not only in Abeokuta but also in other urban centres. © 2019 by the authors.","","Abeokuta; Change detection,; GIS,; Land use/ Land cover,; Remote Sensing,","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072330245"

The authors emphasize that the current ecological situation in the southern Far East requires recording and analysis of data on man-made pollution and environmental sustainability, which is impossible without modern information technologies. The mining and environmental monitoring methods based on the Earth remote sensing technologies become especially relevant. The proposed method is based on the computer GIS applications. The authors of the article have chosen a free GIS—QGIS (Quantum GIS) in combination with GRASS GIS as the main working tool. Satellite images from Landsat 5, 7, 8, Terra and others were obtained thanks to the resources of United States Geological Survey (USGS). In assessing the natural environment, single-channel and multichannel raster layers were used. In order to identify an effective and reliable method for areas disturbed by mining, first of all, the most informative image channels were considered, allowing maximum accurate identification of production-induced areas. The object of monitoring are the operating and closed mines their impact on the environment components. In this respect, the types of monitoring and and their implementation methods were selected. For instance, monitoring of air pollution was carried out by decoding satellite images for the winter period, with estimation of snow cover contamination. The basis for vegetation monitoring in zone of dust pollution from tailing ponds and self-overgrowing coal dumps was based on the NDVI vegetation index. The size and and spatial–temporal history of the impact were assessed by joint analysis of multi-temporal images and digital elevation models. As a result, the paths and behavior of pollutant flows from decommissioned tailings ponds were adjusted. The process of natural restoration of mined-out areas was also assessed. The state of vegetation can be considered as an indicator of the level of anthropogenic pressure on the environment in the study area. Recovery of vegetation characteristics from the remote sensing data allows obtaining certain numerical characteristics of the biomass volume, which can serve as restoration indictor for disturbed lands.

As digital change detection may be a difficult task to perform, this study proposes a simple and logical technique to display land cover changes using Landsat imagery. Open source geoprocessing tools were used to acquire information for mapping changes on the land surface. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from satellite images of four dates between 1984 and 2016 were used in RGB composites. The method was used to map gains and losses of vegetation cover and liquid water content in a spatiotemporal scale. The results indicate that this change detection method can effectively reflect the variations occurred over the years. Although both indices have similar responses, NDWI may provide opposite information to NDVI in certain areas, such as in wetlands and riparian zones, presenting wetness losses even in places that exhibit gains in vegetation.

The methodology is based on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite images acquired after the sowing and before the harvest of the crop throughout four successive agricultural seasons, the reflectance constituting the input variables of a statistical algorithm (random forest). The best performances are obtained when the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is combined with the yield maps collected during the crop rotation, the agricultural season 2014 showing the lower level of performances with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.44 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.13 quintals by hectare (q.h−1) (corresponding to a relative error of 12.9%), the three other years being associated with values of R2 close or upper to 0.60 and RMSE lower than 7 q.h−1 (corresponding to a relative error inferior to 11.3%).

Natural circumstances are basically due to climate change effects remarkably sensed within the past decades. However, human-induced activities in some cases dominate over natural events due to demand of water particularly for irrigation and domestic needs. This study investigates the changes that have occurred on the water surfaces of 3 significant water bodies located in the Konya Closed Basin of Turkey. Geographically inner Anatolia region of Turkey receives half of the annual average precipitation of the overall country; on the contrary, the region is known to be an important agricultural area. The majority of fertile arable land is spared to wet agriculture necessitating vast amounts of water. As expected, all the 3 water bodies have incredibly lost their water within years. In the multi-temporal analysis of the study area, Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI satellite images belonging to every 10-years interval between 1987 and 2017, and corresponding meteorological data were used. Water losses in the 3 ecosystems, one is a salt production lake, Tuz (Salt) Lake, the other is a Ramsar Site (Meke Maar), and the last one is an internationally recognized wetland (Akgol), are detected. Resultantly, it is observed that only Tuz Lake has been artificially fed in the last decade as its economic value is higher than the other two systems. Meke Maar and Akgol Wetland have high ecological value; however, their original functions vanished as they have almost lost their water. It is important to state that humans’ need of water is essential; but, unconscious utilization and wrong irrigation applications lead to water scarcity. On the other hand, climate change accelerates the reduction of water resources. Satellite data coupled with ground truth measurements are accepted as modern technological tools to detect short and long term temporal changes in the water surfaces of such vulnerable water systems especially for attracting the attention of decision-makers responsible of sustainable management of water resources. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","","Akgol; Meke; Remote sensing; Turkey; Tuz lake; Wetlands","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079808642"

Generally, relative radiometric normalization, which is an image-based method, is performed, and histogram matching is a representative method for normalizing the non-linear properties. However, since it utilizes global statistical information only, local information is not considered at all. Thus, this paper proposes a histogram matching method considering local information. The proposed method divides histograms based on density, mean, and standard deviation of image intensities, and performs histogram matching locally on the sub-histogram. The matched histogram is then further partitioned and this process is performed again, iteratively, controlled with the wasserstein distance. Finally, the proposed method is compared to global histogram matching. The experimental results show that the proposed method is visually and quantitatively superior to the conventional method, which indicates the applicability of the proposed method to the radiometric normalization of multi-temporal images with non-linear properties. © 2019 Korean Society of Surveying.

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is not suitable for detection and monitoring of floods during rainy seasons with clouds in the sky due to non-penetrating capability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surface from the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and is characterised by near all-weather / day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surface areas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in the microwave spectrum and act as specular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from spaceborne SAR sensors resulting into dark pixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding areas of the Earth surface. Change detection techniques using multi-temporal SAR images based on the behaviour of backscattered signals for threshold value for detecting the flood between nonflooding and flooding periods provide information related to the status of water surface of river systems. Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of spaceborne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors due its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the Earth surface depending upon the repeat orbit and SAR payloads on the satellites. Spaceborne SAR payloads can be placed in the orbit into fully active or semi-active configuration based on both transmit and receive capability of signals. In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi- static space-borne SAR sensors is described for the development of real time space-borne SAR surveillance system for monitoring of various characteristics of river basins and detection of floods using threshold / change detection techniques. Furthermore, the concept for the development of constellation of multi-static SAR satellite imaging receivers in LEO and geostationary radar illuminating system is described for real time detection and monitoring of floods. © 2019, Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence.","","Bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors; Detection and monitoring of floods; Radar backscattering coefficient; Rain drop size distribution (RDSD); Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072771355"

Although multi-temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi-sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved δNDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data. © 2019 The Authors","Deep learning; Hazards; Image acquisition; Image enhancement; Independent component analysis; Landslides; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Magnetorheological fluids; Mapping; Markov processes; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Change detection; Landslide inventories; Markov Random Fields; Multi sensor; NDVI; data set; detection method; earthquake trigger; hazard assessment; image resolution; landslide; machine learning; mapping method; principal component analysis; remote sensing; risk assessment; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Principal component analysis","Change detection; Independent component analysis; Landslide inventory mapping; Markov random field (MRF); Multi-sensor; NDVI; Principal component analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067615144"

However, considering the long revisit time of most optical and radar sensors orbiting the Earth, multi-temporal disasters monitoring remains a very challenging task. In this paper, a multimodal, multitemporal approach for fusing optical and radar images in the context of flooded areas extraction is introduced. First, potential flooded pixels contained in pre-and post-disaster images are extracted based on the Structural Feature Set (SFS) texture measurement and a modified water index. Then, Attribute Filters (AF) are applied to the resulting images in order to filter out small-sized objects and retain high probability flooded areas. Finally, homogeneous regions resulting from the previous step are used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier used later to classify optical or radar images of the event into flooded and unflooded areas. In order to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, our methodology was applied to time-series optical and radar images acquired before and during three different flooding events: 1) Rockhampton, Australia in 2017; 2) Texas, USA in 2017; and 3) Kerala, India in 2018. Experiments show that our approach gives very promising results and demonstrate the potential of fusing multimodal and multitemporal images. © 2019 IEEE.","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Floods; Geology; Image texture; Neural networks; Orbits; Radar; Remote sensing; Textures; Time series; Attribute filters; Flood monitoring; Imaging capabilities; Multi-modal approach; Multi-modal image; Multi-temporal image; Sources of informations; Texture analysis; Radar imaging","attribute filters; flood monitoring; Multimodal images; texture analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077687233"

Second, Shannon's entropy was used to investigate Dubai's growth toward compact or sprawl city based on two city centers and a major highway. Finally, CA-Markov, associated with the digital elevation model and road map of Dubai, was used to simulate the urban change for 2030, 2050, and 2100. With more than 90% overall accuracy, the statistical analysis for LULC percentages and Shannons entropy values indicated that Dubai experienced a considerable increase in urban fabric while maintaining a compact growth. CA-Markov model estimated 3% urban growth by 2030, which would result in potential loss of green areas and open spaces. This study could be used in improving planning and management methods to achieve sustainable urban growth. © 2019 SPIE.","Entropy; Highway administration; Image analysis; Image classification; Land use; Markov processes; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Smart city; Classification algorithm; Environmental structure; Integrated technologies; Land use/land cover; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal satellite images; Spatiotemporal analysis; sprawl analysis; Urban growth","image classification; land Use/land Cover; Landsat; Shannons entropy; Spatiotemporal analysis; sprawl analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076886207"

In this work, images from Landsat-7 satellites of 1999 and Sentinel-2B in 2017 were used to study the changes in the fi rst decades of the 21st century. A pre-map was obtained for them showing the land formation areas at the water site (sediment accumulation) and appearing water instead of land (erosion of the coast). Small areas of these changes can’t be displayed on observing maps, but the characteristics of the accumulation and erosion intensity is possible, corresponding to the average annual velocity of the coastline moving. Such maps, compiled in the scale of 1: 200 000, are presented in the article for the main areas of the delta. The maps show that at the beginning of the XXI century the trend of the delta development changed, from a weak increase to erosion, the area of which exceeded the accumulation areas by 9 times for 18 years. The erosion encompasses both the sea edge of the delta and the coasts of the main branches. The observed changes are quite consistent with the ones expected during the climate warming. © 2020, Center of Geodesy, Cartography and SDI, FSBI.

Radar sensors are capable of imaging Earth's surface independently of the weather conditions, local time of day, penetrating of waves through clouds, and containing spatial information on agricultural crop types. Based on these characteristics, the main goal sought in this research is to reveal the SAR imaging data capability in recognizing various agricultural crops in the main growth season in a more clarified and detailed way by using a deep-learning-based method. In the present research, the multi-temporal C-band Sentinel 1 images were used to classify 14 major classes of agricultural crops plus background in Denmark. By considering the capability of a deep learning method in analyzing satellite images, a novel, optimal, and lightweight network structure was developed and implemented based on a combination of a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. The average pixel-based accuracy and Intersection over Union obtained from the proposed network were 86% and 0.64, respectively. Winter rapeseed, winter barley, winter wheat, spring barley, and sugar beet had the highest pixel-based accuracies of 95%, 94%, 93%, 90%, and 90%; respectively. The pixel-based accuracies for eight crop types and the background class were more than 84%. The network prediction showed that in field borders the classification confidence was lower than the center regions of the fields. However, the proposed structure has been able to identify different crops in multi-temporal Sentinel 1 data of a large area of around 254 thousand hectares with high performance. © 2019 by the authors.","Brain; Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Long short-term memory; Pixels; Remote sensing; Sugar beets; Synthetic aperture radar; Classification confidence; Convolutional networks; Crop classification; Learning-based methods; Multi-temporal data; Network structures; Sentinel; Spatial informations; Radar imaging","Crop classification; Fully convolutional network; Long-short term memory; Multi-temporal data; Sentinel; Sequential network","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065037054"

Regarding cloud/shadow areas as missing information, low-rank matrix/tensor completion based methods are popular to recover information undergoing cloud/shadow degradation. However, existing methods required to determine the cloud/shadow locations in advance and failed to completely use the latent information in cloud/shadow areas. In this study, we propose a blind cloud/shadow removal method for time-series remote sensing images by unifying cloud/shadow detection and removal together. First, we decompose the degraded image into low-rank clean image (surface-reflected) component and sparse (cloud/shadow) component, which can simultaneously and completely use the underlying characteristics of these two components. Meanwhile, the spatial-spectral total variation regularization is introduced to promote the spatial-spectral continuity of the cloud/shadow component. Second, the cloud/shadow locations are detected from the sparse component using a threshold method. Finally, we adopt the cloud/shadow detection results to guide the information compensation from the original observed images to better preserve the information in cloud/shadow-free locations. The problem of the proposed model is efficiently addressed using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Both simulated and real datasets are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for cloud/shadow detection and removal when compared with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

To understand the influence of human interventions on the natural environmental conditions, including the problems mentioned above, it is essential to critically examine the changes in land use/cover over these years. The objective of this study is to assess land use/cover change in the Bharathapuzha river basin, Kerala during the period 1990–2017 using LANDSAT series satellite images. The dynamics of land use/cover change were quantified and mapped using geospatial techniques. The multi-temporal LANDSAT images were classified by supervised maximum likelihood method to generate the corresponding land use/cover maps; changes in land use/cover in the river basin were subsequently detected by the post-classification technique. Results of the study revealed a drastic change in land use/cover in the period 1990–2017; the primary causes of this were deforestation and urbanization. The near- and long-term future land use/cover maps of the basin for 2020 and 2035 were generated from the historically retrieved land use/cover change pattern. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and Markov chain techniques were used to generate future land use/cover maps. These maps reveal that the predominant land use/cover class in the basin will be barren land and about 46.13% of the existing (in 2017) dense vegetation will diminish by 2035. The efficiency of sustainable watershed management activities in the river basin can be improved based on the critical observations from this study. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; India; Rivers; Urbanization; Bharathapuzha River; India; Kerala; Deforestation; Markov processes; Maximum likelihood; Network layers; Rivers; Soil conservation; Vegetation; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Bharathapuzha river basins; Land use/cover; Land use/cover change; Multi-layer perceptron neural networks; Supervised classification; anthropogenic effect; artificial neural network; classification; land cover; land use change; Landsat; Markov chain; maximum likelihood analysis; prediction; river basin; satellite imagery; article; deforestation; human; India; land use; Markov chain; maximum likelihood method; perceptron; prediction; quantitative analysis; river basin; satellite imagery; urbanization; vegetation; watershed management; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; India; procedures; river; statistics and numerical data; trends; Land use","Bharathapuzha river basin; Land use/cover change; Land use/cover prediction; Markov chain; Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network; Supervised classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065577185"

However, it also has a great impact on the regional climate and ecological environment. More importantly, it often leads to unexpected soil pollution due to fine plastic residuals. Therefore, accurately and timely monitoring of the temporal and spatial distribution of plastic mulch practice in large areas is of great interest to assess its impacts. However, existing plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) detecting efforts are limited to either small areas with high-resolution images or coarse resolution images of large areas. In this study, we examined the potential of cloud computing and multi-temporal, multi-sensor satellite images for detecting PMF in large areas. We first built the plastic-mulched farmland mapping algorithm (PFMA) rules through analyzing its spectral, temporal, and auxiliary features in remote sensing imagery with the classification and regression tree (CART).We then applied the PFMA in the dry region of Xinjiang, China, where a water resource is very scarce and thus plastic mulch has been intensively used and its usage is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The experimental results demonstrated that the PFMA reached an overall accuracy of 92.2% with a producer's accuracy of 97.6% and a user's accuracy of 86.7%, and the F-score was 0.914 for the PMF class. We further monitored and analyzed the dynamics of plastic mulch practiced in Xinjiang by applying the PFMA to the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The general pattern of plastic mulch usage dynamic in Xinjiang during the period from 2000 to 2015 was well captured by our multi-temporal analysis. © 2019 by the authors.","Conformal mapping; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Farms; Photomapping; Soil pollution; Trees (mathematics); Water resources; Agricultural plastics; Classification and regression tree; Decision tree classification; Ecological environments; Facility agricultures; Multi-sensor satellite images; Oasis agricultures; Temporal and spatial distribution; Remote sensing","Agricultural plastic waste; Decision tree classification; Facility agriculture; Oasis agriculture; Plastic-mulched farmland","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072642056"

Extracting crop type using remote sensing is not easy because multiple crops are usually planted into small parcels with limited availability of satellite images due to weather conditions. In this research, we aim at producing crop maps for areas with abundant rainfall and small-sized parcels by making full use of Landsat 8 and HJ-1 charge-coupled device (CCD) data. We masked out non-vegetation areas by using Landsat 8 images and then extracted a crop map from a long-term time-series of HJ-1 CCD satellite images acquired at 30-m spatial resolution and two-day temporal resolution. To increase accuracy, four key phenological metrics of crops were extracted from time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index curves plotted from the HJ-1 CCD images. These phenological metrics were used to further identify each of the crop types with less, but easier to access, ancillary field survey data. We used crop area data from the Jingzhou statistical yearbook and 5.8-m spatial resolution ZY-3 satellite images to perform an accuracy assessment.

Soil quality must be maintained to ensure sustainable production of food and conservation of natural resources. In this context, soil mapping is important to provide spatial information, which can be performed using remote sensing (RS) techniques. Modeling through use of satellite data is uncertain regarding the amplitude of replicability of the models. The aim of this study was to develop a quantification model for soil texture based on reflectance information from a continuum of bare soils, obtained by overlapping multi-temporal satellite images, and apply this model to an unknown region to evaluate its applicability. Spectral data were extracted from two Landsat TM 7 satellite images containing only bare soil, representing two distinct regions in Brazil (Area 1 and Area 2). The spectral data (obtained from six bands) and laboratory data (particle size from the 0.00-0.20 m layer) of Area 1 were modeled and extrapolated to Area 2. The bare soil images differentiated textural classes as sandy, sandy loam, clayey loam, clayey, and very clayey soil. The coefficients of determination between the determined and estimated values were higher than 0.5 and errors lower than 13 % for Area 1 and 30 % for Area 2, indicating applicability of the model to unknown areas. © 2018 Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

The purpose is to provide guidance on how to train a powerful learning machine for change detection in SAR images and to contribute to a better understanding of potentials and limitations of supervised change detection approaches. This becomes particularly important on the background of a rapidly growing demand for SAR change detection to support rapid situation awareness in case of natural disasters. The application environment of this study thus focuses on detecting changes caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, where single polarized TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR intensity images are used as input. An unprecedented reference dataset of more than 18,000 buildings that have been visually inspected by local authorities for damages after the disaster forms a solid statistical population for the performance experiments. Several critical choices commonly made during the training stage of a learning machine are being assessed for their influence on the change detection performance, including sampling approach, location and number of training samples, classification scheme, change feature space and the acquisition dates of the satellite images. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning approach is compared with the widely used change image thresholding. The study concludes that a well-trained and tuned SVM can provide highly accurate change detections that outperform change image thresholding. While good performance is achieved in the binary change detection case, a distinction between multiple change classes in terms of damage grades leads to poor performance in the tested experimental setting. The major drawback of a machine learning approach is related to the high costs of training. The outcomes of this study, however, indicate that given dynamic parameter tuning, feature selection and an appropriate sampling approach, already small training samples (100 samples per class) are sufficient to produce high change detection rates. Moreover, the experiments show a good generalization ability of SVM which allows transfer and reuse of trained learning machines. © 2016 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Damage detection; Disasters; Earthquakes; Feature extraction; Geophysics; Learning systems; Population statistics; Radar; Radar signal processing; Sampling; Space-based radar; Support vector machines; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunamis; 2011 tohoku earthquakes; Application environment; Change detection; Earthquake and tsunamis; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Machine learning approaches; Performance experiment; Supervised change detection; Radar imaging","Change detection; Earthquake; Machine learning; Synthetic aperture radar; Tsunami","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017640549"

In particular, transportation infrastructure is a key indicator of growth in the city since transportation is the backbone of economic development and prosperity. Recent advances in satellite imagery, in terms of improved spatial and temporal resolutions, enable efficient identification of change patterns and prediction of built-up areas. In this study, two approaches were adopted to quantify and assess the pattern of urbanization. The first approach relied on extracting linear features (buildings and roads) from multi-temporal satellite images, where image-to-image registration was utilized based on linear features with Modified Iterated Hough Transform as matching criteria. The second approach relied on extracting linear features from vector (digitized) data. The latter approach complemented the first one by distinguishing between roads and buildings. The proposed methodology was then applied to Sharjah City, United Arab Emirates, as a case study. Results show that the urbanized area of the city almost quadrupled during 1976–2016. Growth in buildings and roads was generally consistent until 2005, after that the spatial growth witnessed a steep increase due to vertical expansion. To assess the accuracy of the utilized edge images and change detection, error matrices were prepared for the case study. An overall accuracy of more than 84% was achieved.

The Apuseni Mountains area records one of the highest percentages of protected areas among Romanian mountains, exceeding 50%, characterised by high biodiversity with faunal and floral endemics and rare species across distinctive karstic landscapes. Habitat type maps were derived from Landsat satellite images acquired in 1986, 1993, 2000, 2007 and 2015 using an object-based classification. Based on habitat type maps, 18 landscape metrics at the class level and 16 metrics at the landscape level have been derived to quantify the structure, composition and spatial pattern of the landscape, correlating them with habitat type area changes. Results indicate that in the last 30 years, the deciduous and coniferous forests continuously improved in the Apuseni-Vlădeasa Mountains, but surprisingly deteriorated after the site was declared a Special Protection Area (SPA) in 2007. The mixed forest habitat type has recorded a tendency of deterioration since 1986, however, this trend stopped in 2007, probably due to the decrease of human interventions. In this site, the pastures and meadows habitat type deteriorated until 2000 due to agriculture development (before 1993) and natural growth of vegetation, improving considerably after that with a surprising atenuation after 2007. The deciduous forests habitats within the Defileul Mureşului Inferior – Dealurile Lipovei site deteriorated until 2007, but it appears that human interventions have diminished after the site was declared a SPA, while within the Drocea-Zarand site the deciduous forests have not suffered deterioration. In these two sites, pastures recorded a constant deterioration in the last three decades, mainly due to land abandonment.

In this research, four Rapideye satellite images and eight RGB images acquired from UAV were used from early June to the end of July, 2015 covering two experimental winter wheat fields, in order to monitor wheat canopy growth status and analyze the correlation among satellite images based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with UAV’s RGB images based visible-band difference vegetation index (VDVI) and ground variable of sampled grain protein contents. Firstly, through image interpretation of UAV’s multi-temporal RGB images with fine spatial resolution, the wheat canopy color changes could be intuitively and clearly monitored. Subsequently, by monitoring changes of satellite images based NDVI as well as VDVI values and UAV’s RGB images based VDVI values, the conclusions were made that these three vegetation indices demonstrated same and synchronized trend of increasing at early stage of wheat growth season, reaching up to peak values at the same timing, and starting to decrease since then. The results of correlation analysis between NDVI of satellite images and sampled grain protein contents showed that NDVI has good predicative capability for mapping grain protein content before ripening growth stage around June7, 2015, while the reliability of using satellite image based NDVI to predict grain protein contents becomes worse as ripening stage approaches. The regression analysis between UAV’s RGB image based VDVI and satellite image based VDVI as well as NDVI showed good coefficients of determination. It was concluded that it is feasible and practical to temporally complement satellite remote sensing by using UAV’s RGB images based vegetation indices to monitor wheat growth status and to map within-field spatial variations of grain protein contents for small scale farmlands. © 2017, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

This study presents an unsupervised change detection method based on the image fusion of multi-temporal images. The main objective of this study is to improve the accuracy of unsupervised change detection from high-resolution multi-temporal images. Our method effectively reduces change detection errors, since spatial displacement and spectral differences between multi-temporal images are evaluated. To this end, a total of four cross-fused images are generated with multi-temporal images, and the iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) method-a measure for the spectral distortion of change information-is applied to the fused images. In this experiment, the land cover change maps were extracted using multi-temporal IKONOS-2,WorldView-3, and GF-1 satellite images. The effectiveness of the proposed method compared with other unsupervised change detection methods is demonstrated through experimentation. The proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 80.51% and 97.87% for cases 1 and 2, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method performed better when differentiating the water area from the vegetation area compared to the existing change detection methods. Although the water area beneath moderate and sparse vegetation canopy was captured, vegetation cover and paved regions of the water body were the main sources of omission error, and commission errors occurred primarily in pixels of mixed land use and along the water body edge. Nevertheless, the proposed method, in conjunction with high-resolution satellite imagery, offers a robust and flexible approach to land cover change mapping that requires no ancillary data for rapid implementation. © 2017 by the authors.","Errors; Image analysis; Image fusion; Iterative methods; Land use; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Vegetation; Alteration detections; Change detection; Government management; High resolution image; High resolution satellite imagery; High resolution satellite images; Land cover; Unsupervised change detection; Mapping","Change detection; High resolution image; Image analysis; Image fusion; Land cover","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028327092"

The processing of the data of the high resolution Satellite images allowed us to discover that in the karst environment, like the one in which Burnum was established, the areas with a higher humidity and vegetation concentration are the results of the anthropic action due to frequentation in the Roman Age. The infrastructure and buildings, the earth moving conducted to raise the original natural surface levels, and the subsequent collapse of buildings during the stage when the site was abandoned, determined the formation of a signifiant substrate in the area. Thanks to the results of the surveys and data, the positive responses of the image analysis through the Band Ratio and the enhancement procedures highlighted the differences in the soil's patterns/weaving. This method of investigation, the results of which will be verifid by carrying out targeted surveys, suggests the presence of residential infrastructure (canabae) in the area surrounding the Roman site and especially along the main roads. Therefore, the archaeological site of Burnum, today corresponding to approximately 8 ha, could be doubled, adding even further to the importance of the role that the city had in this part of the Roman province of Dalmatia. © 2017 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

In this manuscript, we propose a new geometric frame for analysing the geometric error of a stereo HRSI, in which the geolocation error can be divided into three parts: the epipolar direction, cross base direction, and height direction. With this frame, we proved that the height error of three line cameras (TLCs) is independent of nadir images, and that the terrain effect has a limited impact on the geolocation errors. For ZY-3 error sources, the drift error in both the pitch and roll angle and its influence on the geolocation accuracy are analysed. Epipolar and common tie-point constraints are proposed to study the bundle adjustment of HRSIs. Epipolar constraints explain that the relative orientation can reduce the number of compensation parameters in the cross base direction and have a limited impact on the height accuracy. The common tie points adjust the pitch-angle errors to be consistent with each other for TLCs. Therefore, free-net bundle adjustment of a single strip cannot significantly improve the geolocation accuracy. Furthermore, the epipolar and common tie-point constraints cause the error to propagate into the adjacent strip when multiple strips are involved in the bundle adjustment, which results in the same attitude uncertainty throughout the whole block. Two adjacent strips—Orbit 305 and Orbit 381, covering 7 and 12 standard scenes separately—and 308 ground control points (GCPs) were used for the experiments. The experiments validate the aforementioned theory. The planimetric and height root mean square errors were 2.09 and 1.28 m, respectively, when two GCPs were settled at the beginning and end of the block. © 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Using satellite image time series data should achieve high-accuracy land cover classification. However, most satellite image time-series classification methods do not fully exploit the available data for mining the effective features to identify different land cover types. Therefore, a classification method that can take full advantage of the rich information provided by time-series data to improve the accuracy of land cover classification is needed. In this paper, a novel method for time-series land cover classification using spectral, temporal, and spatial information at an annual scale was introduced. Based on all the available data from time-series remote sensing images, a refined nonlinear dimensionality reduction method was used to extract the spectral and temporal features, and a modified graph segmentation method was used to extract the spatial features. The proposed classification method was applied in three study areas with land cover complexity, including Illinois, South Dakota, and Texas. All the Landsat time series data in 2014 were used, and different study areas have different amounts of invalid data. A series of comparative experiments were conducted on the annual time-series images using training data generated from Cropland Data Layer. The results demonstrated higher overall and per-class classification accuracies and kappa index values using the proposed spectral-temporal-spatial method compared to spectral-temporal classification methods.

Taking into account the availability for free of high resolution (10 to 30 meter) optical and SAR data from different satellite, the most resource consuming task is ground data collecting. That is why the proper time of ground surveys and crop classification maps developing is very important. In the study we propose to build three crop classification maps for JECAM Ukraine test site in Kyiv region during the vegetation season. The first one is built in the middle of May to classify winter cereals and rapeseeds. The next crop classification map is developing in July to discriminate major summer crops (spring cereals, maize, soybeans, sunflowers). The final crop map is built in autumn to refine summer crops and sugar beet discrimination. Time series of multi-temporal satellite images with restored missing (clouded and shadowed) data are classified using neural network approach, in particular ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). It is shown, that addition of satellite data from the end of previous year to the spring imagery allows to significantly improve the accuracy of winter crops classification. In July it is possible to deliver the map with major summer crops with overall accuracy higher than 87%, and the overall accuracy of final map at the end of the season is 94%. © 2016 IEEE.","","crop map; Early season classification; neural network; satellite data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007433730"

The present study addresses the monitoring changes in and around the lake and its consequent effect on the lake water ecology. For this, satellite images of the years 1976, 1981, 1997, and 2013 are analyzed for land use land cover classes. Significant reduction in the water body is observed in contrast with the increase in salt pan around the periphery of lake and wetland classes. Further, the extent of water body and algae in the lake are delineated as per normalized difference water index and normalized difference vegetation index. Rainfall data do not indicate any major change in the pattern, but drastic decrease in the extent of water body and significant increase in algal bloom are serious concerns for the lake’s existence. This may be due to surrounding anthropogenic activities and construction of check dams and anicuts in the lake catchment which curtail the runoff into the lake and provide favorable growth of algae. Sambhar Lake, being declared as a wetland according to the Ramsar Convention, is necessary to protect and conserve the ecological importance of the lake through sustainable planning and management. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Eutrophication; India; Lakes; Satellite Imagery; Wetlands; India; Rajasthan; Sambhar Lake; algae; Algae; Catchments; Ecology; Land use; Vegetation; Wetlands; rain; sodium chloride; water; Anthropogenic activity; Land use/ land covers; LULC; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI; NDWI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; algal bloom; environmental assessment; estimation method; human activity; lake water; land use change; NDVI; Ramsar Convention; salt water; satellite imagery; temporal analysis; algal bloom; Article; catchment; dam (barrier); environmental change; environmental monitoring; India; lake; land use; nonhuman; satellite imagery; vegetation; wetland; eutrophication; Lakes","Algae; Anthropogenic activities; LULC; NDVI; NDWI; Sambhar Lake","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981239981"

The long-term morphodynamics of bars have been intensively investigated. However, relatively little is known about the response of channel bars to a major river flood, which is considered to be the predominant force in shaping bar morphology. This is especially the case for the monsoon-affected Yangtze River, where fluvial geomorphic work is largely carried out during monsoon floods. In this study, multi-temporal satellite images and river stage data were used to examine the morphodynamics of four large channel bars in the middle Yangtze River in response to a major monsoon flood in 2002. Based on bar surface areas estimated with Landsat images at different river stages, a rating curve was developed for each of the four bars, which was used to estimate bar volume through an integral process. Our study shows that two of the bars tended to be stable, while the other two experienced severe erosion during the flood. The results reveal that the flood caused a total bar surface area decrease of 1,655,100 m2 (or 8.30%), and a total bar volume decline of 5.89 × 106 m3 (or 6.10%) between the river stages of 20.81 m and 25.75 m. The volume decrease is equivalent to a sediment loss of approximately 8.25 × 106 metric tons, based on an average bulk density of 1.4 metric tons per cubic meter. The results imply that channel bars in the middle Yangtze River can also be large sediment sources rather than depositional areas during the flood. The decrease of sediment load in the middle of Yangtze River was found to be responsible for the dramatic morphodynamics of channel bars, which could last for a long period of time, depending on the operation of the Three Gorges Dam, which opened in 2003. Hence, we suggest making management efforts to protect the bars from further erosion. © 2018 by the authors.","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bars (metal); Deposition; Erosion; Floods; Sediments; Depositional areas; Management efforts; Morphodynamics; Multi-temporal satellite images; Satellite images; Sediment sources; Three Gorges Dam; Yangtze River; Rivers","Channel bars; Flood; Morphodynamics; Satellite images; Three Gorges Dam; Yangtze River","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051622356"

The accurate monitoring of powdery mildew is important for crop management and production. Satellite-based remote sensing monitoring has been proven as an efficient tool for regional disease detection and monitoring. However, the information provided by single-date satellite scene is hard to achieve acceptable accuracy for powdery mildew disease, and incorporation of early period contextual information of winter wheat can improve this situation. In this study, a multi-temporal satellite data based powdery mildew detecting approach had been developed for regional disease mapping. Firstly, the Lansat-8 scenes that covered six winter wheat growth periods (expressed in chronological order as periods 1 to 6) were collected to calculate typical vegetation indices (VIs), which include disease water stress index (DSWI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI). A multi-temporal VIs-based k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach was then developed to produce the regional disease distribution. Meanwhile, a backward stepwise elimination method was used to confirm the optimal multi-temporal combination for KNN monitoring model. A classification and regression tree (CART) and back propagation neural networks (BPNN) approaches were used for comparison and validation of initial results. VIs of all periods except 1 and 3 provided the best multi-temporal data set for winter wheat powdery mildew monitoring. Compared with the traditional single-date (period 6) image, the multi-temporal images based KNN approach provided more disease information during the disease development, and had an accuracy of 84.6%. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the proposed approach had 11.5% and 3.8% higher than the multi-temporal images-based CART and BPNN models’, respectively. These results suggest that the use of satellite images for early critical disease infection periods is essential for improving the accuracy of monitoring models. Additionally, satellite imagery also assists in monitoring powdery mildew in late wheat growth periods. © 2018 by the authors.

Classification techniques often require multi-temporal images. However, most of these techniques assume that the cultural cycle occurs at the same dates across plots or for a given crop and do not take into account the sensitivity to initial conditions of the dynamical behaviors. Such hypotheses are not well adapted when a wide diversity of practices is observed for the same crops from one crop field to another, which is often the case in tropical context. To cope with these difficulties, a new classification technique based on the global modeling technique is introduced in this paper. It is first applied to a case study based on chaotic oscillators. It is then tested on crop classification observed from satellite data. The Berambadi watershed (South India) is taken as a case study to test this new classification approach. Crop classification is a difficult problem in Southern India where optical satellite images are scarce during the monsoon season due to cloud cover, and where crop land is divided in parcels (i.e. crop fields) of very small sizes with diversified crops. The Landsat-8 images were used to monitor an ensemble of 104 parcels of ten different crops (irrigated and non-irrigated). Using global modeling, a bank of crop models was first obtained for the ten crops considered in the study. A metric is introduced to compare the observed signal to the obtained crop-models used as reference for each crop dynamic. Based on this metric, the possibility to use global models as references for distinguishing crops is investigated. The results provide a good proof-of-concept and show promising potential for crop classification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circuit oscillations; Classification (of information); Forestry; Land use; Mapping; Remote sensing; Time series; Classification approach; Classification technique; Crop identification; Crop phenology; Global modeling; Land use and land cover mapping; Optical satellite images; Sensitivity to initial conditions; Crops","Classification; Crop identification; Crop phenology; Global modeling; Land use; Time series","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038214781"

The undertaken processing techniques have distinguished all the natural low-lying closed depressions from the artificial errors induced by the interpolation of the DEM. The local subsidence of these depressions from their surroundings reaches a maximum depth of 2.5 m. The regional subsidence of the Nile Delta has developed inverted topography, where the tracts occupied by the contemporary distributary channels are standing at higher elevations than the areas in between. This inversion could be related to the differences in the hydrological and sedimentological properties of underlying sediments, as the channels are underlain by water-saturated sands while the successions of clay and silt on flood plains are prone to compaction. Furthermore, the analysis of remote sensing and topographic data clearly show significant changes in the land cover and land use, particularly in the northern lagoons and adjacent sabkhas, which are dominated by numerous low subsiding depressions. The areas covered by water logging and ponds are increasing on the expense of agricultural areas, and aquaculture have been practiced instead. The precise estimation of subsidence rates and distribution should be worked out to evaluate probable changes in land cover and land use. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Egypt; Nile Delta; digital elevation model; geomorphological response; GIS; land use; landform evolution; neotectonics; satellite imagery; subsidence; topography","Depressions; GIS; Land use; Landforms; Neo-tectonic; Nile river","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006783298"

This significant social and economic phenomenon has brought about much debate in the past twenty years. Understanding its dynamics and patterns is important to develop appropriate policies and make more informed planning decisions. Many dimensions to the urban land growth have been identified in related literature, including drivers, relationship with other factors, such as population, impacts, and methods of measurement. In this study, urban growth in the Edwardsville/glen carbon, Illinois is analyzed spatiotemporally using remote sensing and population change data from 1990 to 2015. The objectives of this study are to (a) identify the major land use changes in the Edwardsville area; (b) analyze the rate of urban growth and its relationship to population change in the study area; and (c) identify the spatial pattern of urban growth in the study area. Using multi-temporal satellite images to classify and derive changes in land cover classes, the results show that the land cover classes with major changes are the urban/built-up land and agricultural/grassland, with a steady increase in the former and steady decrease in the later. Also, landscape expansion index calculation for each study period shows that outlying growth type is the dominant pattern. © 2018, © 2018 Applied Geography Conferences.","","Edwardsville; Illinois; landscape expansion index; population change; remote sensing; Urban growth","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066479051"

The suggested methodology consists of a sequence of image processing techniques that include supervised and unsupervised classification. Subsequently, the classified images were utilized to quantify the urbanization of the City.

Sometimes we are capable of describing the changes of land cover with a probability distribution. However, we need sufficient knowledge about the natural variability of these changes, which is not always possible. In general, uncertainties can be subdivided into aleatory and epistemic. The main problem is that classical probability theory does not make a clear distinction between aleatory and epistemic uncertainties in the way they are represented, i.e., both of them are described with a probability distribution. The aim of this paper is to propagate the aleatory and epistemic uncertainty associated with both input parameters (features extracted from satellite image object) and model structure of LCC prediction process using belief function theory. This will help reducing in a significant way the uncertainty about future changes of land cover. In this study, the changes prediction of land cover in Cairo region, Egypt for next 16 years (2030) is anticipated using multi-temporal Landsat TM5 satellite images in 1987 and 2014. The LCC prediction model results indicated that 15% of the agriculture and 6.5% of the desert will be urbanized in 2030. We conclude that our method based on belief function theory has a potential to reduce uncertainty and improve the prediction accuracy and is applicable in LCC analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; agricultural land; correlation; estimation method; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; numerical model; remote sensing; satellite imagery; uncertainty analysis","Aleatory-epistemic uncertainty; Correlation analysis; Input parameters uncertainty; LCC prediction; Model structure uncertainty; Parameter estimation; Parameter modeling; Uncertainty propagation.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002244002"

Compared with multi-temporal change detection methods, temporally highly resolved SITS methods provide more information in a single analysis, for instance on the type and consistency of change. In particular, SITS decomposition methods show a great potential in extracting various components from non-stationary time series, which allows for an improved interpretation of the temporal variability. Even though many case studies have applied SITS decomposition methods, a systematic comparison of common algorithms is still missing. In this study, the seasonal trend loess (STL), breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) and multi-resolution analysis-wavelet transform (MRA-WT) were explored in order to evaluate their performance in modelling, monitoring and detecting land-cover changes with pronounced seasonal variations from simulated normal difference vegetation index time series. The selected methods have all proven their ability to characterize the non-stationary vegetation dynamics along with different physical processes driving the vegetation dynamics. Our results indicated that BFAST is the most accurate method for the examined simulated dataset in terms of RMSE, whereas MRA-WT showed a great potential for the extraction of multi-level vegetation dynamics.

In previous years, high infestations have cost the industry up to $40 million. However, identifying damage in the field is difficult due to the often impenetrable nature of the sugarcane crop. Satellite imagery offers a feasible means of achieving this by examining the visual characteristics of stool tipping, changed leaf color, and exposure of soil in damaged areas. The objective of this study was to use geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) and high-spatial resolution GeoEye-1 satellite imagery for three years to map canegrub damage and develop two mapping approaches suitable for risk mapping. The GEOBIA mapping approach for canegrub damage detection was evaluated over three selected study sites in Queensland, covering a total of 254 km2 and included five main steps developed in the eCognition Developer software. These included: (1) initial segmentation of sugarcane block boundaries; (2) classification and subsequent omission of fallow/harvested fields, tracks, and other non-sugarcane features within the block boundaries; (3) identification of likely canegrub-damaged areas with low NDVI values and high levels of image texture within each block; (4) the further refining of canegrub damaged areas to low, medium, and high likelihood; and (5) risk classification. The validation based on field observations of canegrub damage at the time of the satellite image capture yielded producer’s accuracies between 75% and 98.7%, depending on the study site. Error of commission occurred in some cases due to sprawling, drainage issues, wind, weed, and pig damage. The two developed risk mapping approaches were based on the results of the canegrub damage detection.

Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images are often used to estimate a given soil attribute (i.e., clay), but have the potential to model many other attributes, providing input for soil mapping applications. In this paper, we aim to evaluate a Bare Soil Composite Image (BSCI) from the state of São Paulo, Brazil, calculated from a multi-temporal dataset, and study its relationship with topsoil properties, such as soil class and geology. The method presented detects bare soil in satellite images in a time series of 16 years, based on Landsat 5 TM observations. The compilation derived a BSCI for the agricultural sites (242,000 hectare area) characterized by very complex geology. Soil properties were analyzed to calibrate prediction models using 740 soil samples (0-20 cm) collected of the area. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on the BSCI spectral dataset was performed to quantify soil attributes. The method identified that a single image represents 7 to 20% of bare soil while the compilation of the multi-temporal dataset increases to 53%. Clay content had the best soil attribute prediction estimates (R2 = 0.75, root mean square error (RMSE) = 89.84 g kg-1, and accuracy = 74%). Soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity and sandy soils also achieved moderate predictions. The BSCI demonstrates a strong relationship with legacy geological maps detecting variations in soils. From a single composite image, it was possible to use spectroscopy to evaluate several environmental parameters. This technique could greatly improve soil mapping and consequently aid several applications, such as land use planning, environmental monitoring, and prevention of land degradation, updating legacy surveys and digital soil mapping. © 2018 by the authors.","Agriculture; Food supply; Forecasting; Geology; Land use; Least squares approximations; Mean square error; Photomapping; Satellites; Soil surveys; Bare soils; Digital soil mappings; Food security; LANDSAT TM; Soil attributes; Spectral sensing; Soils","Bare soil; Digital soil mapping; Landsat TM; Satellite; Soil and food security; Soil attribute mapping; Spectral sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055431613"

A novel method of cloud and cloud shadow removal called Multitemporal Cloud Removal (MCR) is proposed in this paper. The method has main steps: (1) radiometric correction, (2) cloud and cloud shadow detection, and (3) image reconstruction. Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiometric correction converts digital number values to TOA reflectance for Landsat 8 OLI was first completed. In the second step, Multi-temporal Cloud Masking (MCM) was used to detect cloud and cloud shadow. This method uses a target image which has cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels and a reference image which is clear. The aim is to obtain the difference in reflectance values in visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared bands between target and reference images. These values can be used to detect cloud and cloud shadow in Landsat 8 images. The Landsat 8 cirrus band is used to detect thin cirrus cloud in this method. We use target image and reference image from a sequence acquisition dates of Landsat 8 images to avoid the significant land cover change. In the last step, we use multitemporal images to reconstruct pixels which are contaminated by cloud and cloud shadow. Cloud and cloud shadow contaminated pixels on the target image are replaced by pixels from the reference image. Landsat 8 images which have heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types are chosen in the experiments to prove that MCR is robust method for removing cloud and cloud shadow and can be used for image that has heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types. We use visual and statistical assessments to evaluate the results. As results show, cloud and cloud shadow can be removed by MCR. In visual evaluation, the corrected images are similar to the reference image. In statistical assessments between corrected and references images, the correlation coefficient for each band is quite high (>0.9) for the thick cloud case and equal to 1 for thin cloud case. Within band tandard deviations in the reference image and the corrected image were higher in the corrected image compared to the the reference image and original image. Although not comprehensive, the visual and statistical assessments, provide some indication that th MCR method was robust method for removing cloud and cloud shadow in Landsat 8 images examined in this work. The advantage of this appoach is that original reflectance values can be retained as long as they are not contaminated by cloud and cloud shadow. In addition, as we use a sequence acquisition date of Landsat 8 images, we can produce free cloud and cloud shadow images. © 2017 IEEE.","Clouds; Contamination; Image reconstruction; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Pixels; Radiometry; Reflection; Remote sensing; Time series analysis; Cloud removal; Cloud shadows; Correlation coefficient; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal image; Radiometric corrections; Short wave infrared bands; Statistical assessment; Image processing","cloud; cloud shadow; Landsat 8; multitemporal cloud removal; multitemporal images","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032832812"

A plan to reduce landslide problem requires studying of landslide inventory on relevant types of land use in Laplae district, Uttaradit province from the past to the present. Such plan can also be applied for land use managing in steep areas and land administration that match conditions of the areas. This area was selected as the case study because it is a highly steep area and encountered two obvious landslides in 2006 and 2011 in nearly the same spot. Remote sensing technology can support this planning with wide-scale spatial data, and it can be used for monitoring land use change after a landslide. This study used multi-temporal satellite images to analyze land use change in a landslide area. The main objective aims to interpret land use from satellite images and examine land use changes induce in recurrence of the landslides that implemented image classification and GIS based analysis techniques. The results of analysis reveal that the 2006 and 2011 landslides occurred mostly in forest area, which accounted for 176 acre and 16 acre. Regarding the result of land use change during 2006-2011 found that the forest area was changed mostly into fruit orchards about 53 acre, followed by fruit orchard area was changed into forest area about 9 acre. When the landslide inventories cross with the land use change data, it was found that the fruit orchard areas had the greatest rate of landslide recurrence, which accounted for 22% of landslide areas. The final analysis result classified fruit orchard as high susceptibility zone for landslide, so it should be considered other parameters such as slope and aspect for the further analysis. © 2017 ACRS.

However, most radiometric normalization methods are linear, and they cannot eliminate the regular nonlinear spectral differences. Here we introduce the well-established kernel canonical correlation analysis (kCCA) into radiometric normalization for the first time to overcome this problem, which leads to a new kernel method. It can maximally reduce the image differences among multi-temporal images regardless of the imaging conditions and the reflectivity difference. It also perfectly eliminates the impact of nonlinear changes caused by seasonal variation of natural objects. Comparisons with the multivariate alteration detection (CCA-based) normalization and the histogram matching, on Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data, indicate that the kCCA-based normalization can preserve more similarity and better correlation between an image-pair and effectively avoid the color error propagation. The proposed method not only builds the common scale or reference to make the radiometric consistency among GF-1 image sequences, but also highlights the interesting spectral changes while eliminates less interesting spectral changes. Our method enables the application of GF-1 data for change detection, land-use, land-cover change detection etc. © 2018 by the authors.","Color matching; Correlation methods; Land use; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Alteration detections; Canonical correlation analysis; Invariant features; Kernel canonical correlation analysis; Multi-temporal image; Multi-temporal satellite images; Radiometric normalization; Spectral differences; Radiometry","Gaofen-1 satellite; Kernel version of canonical correlation analysis; Nonlinear invariant features; Radiometric normalization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044232808"

It is an important preprocessing for multi-temporal images analysis as well as multi-source data fusion. Orthorectification and co-registration are two different methods in geometric correction. The orthorectification establishes mapping function between 2D image space and 3D object space while the co-registration adopts a global or a local image-to-image transformation. This two methods can be integrated sequentially for precise mapping. Due to the development of geospatial big data analysis, the growing satellite image archive requires automatic and precise georeferencing framework to handle time-series satellite images.

The open geospatial data for correction of terrain relief are 30m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data and EGM96 Geoid data. In order to perform automatic georeferencing, a predefined orthoimage is selected as a reference image to find corresponding points between reference orthoimage and Formosat-2 satellite image. The geospatial open source software in used includes OpenCV (http://opencv.org/), Orfeo ToolBox (https://www.orfeotoolbox.org/) (Christophe et al., 2008), and Arosics (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/arosics) (Scheffler et al., 2017). The main idea is to refine the satellite image using different approaches in different stages. The proposed framework includes four major stages: preprocessing, coarse-registration, fine-registration and color fusion. The preprocessing stage uses OpenCV Library to construct an image pyramid-matching scheme in refinement of rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). This stage effectively refines the metadata of input Formosat-2 image (i.e. RPCs) from pyramid images. A Speeded-up-robust-features (SURF) matching (Bay et al., 2008) is applied to extract registration points between orthoimage and Formosat-2 image. The height of registration points can be obtained from digital elevation model (DEM). Then, the extracted registration points is applied to improve the positioning accuracy of RPCs (Teo, 2011). The second stage is coarse-registration by refined RPCs and reference orthoimage. Several tools from Orfeo Toolbox are composed to build up an iterative refinement scheme in automatic coarse-registration. The automatic coarse-registration divides input image into different blocks and each block preforms SURF matching to find registration points. So, the registration points are equally distributed to cover the whole scene. The RFM is refined by additional parameters with outlier detection. This stage resamples the Formosat-2 level 1A image into initial geocoded image based on RFM, registration points and DEM. This coarse-registration might include geometrical discrepancy between initial geocoded image and reference orthoimage. Therefore, fine-registration is needed. The third stage is an image-to-image registration using local transformation. The Arosics is selected to do the fine-registration between initial geocoded image and reference orthoimage. As the initial geocoded image is similar to reference orthoimage, the phase-shift image matching method is applied in fine-registration. The fine-registration also divides input image into different blocks and perform image matching iteratively. Finally, a high pass filter (HPF) color fusion method (Gangkofner et al., 2008) is applied to generate pan-sharping image from panchromatic and multispectral images. The challenges of the proposed automatic scheme are cloud and terrain effects. Therefore, this study select a mountain area in different cloud conditions. The experiment utilized a set of Formosat-2 level 1A satellite images (28 panchromatic images and 28 multispectral image) with different cloud coverages (e.g. 0% to 40%) in year 2014. The reference orthoimage was also a 2m Formosat-2 image in year 2014. The proposed georeferencing framework automatically rectified satellite images and fused the panchromatic and corresponding multispectral images into timeseries pan-sharping images. This study selected 14 cloud free panchromatic images in accuracy analysis. The geometric accuracies before registration were ranged from -169.29m to 267.28m. After co-registration, the geometric accuracies improved to -4.17m to 3.13m. In summary, the geolocation accuracy of proposed scheme was improved from hundred meters to 5 meters level accuracy. One of the limitation for the proposed scheme is image quality (e.g. the percentage of homogeneous area). The future study will focus on excluding homogeneous area to improve the quality of georeferencing image. © 2017 ACRS.

The steep terrain and persistent cloud cover pose challenges to robust vegetation and land use mapping. Our objective is to develop satellite image classification techniques that can reliably map forest cover and land use while minimizing the cloud and terrain issues, and provide the basis for long-term monitoring. Multi-seasonal Landsat image composites and elevation ancillary layers effectively minimize the persistent cloud cover and terrain issues. Spectral vegetation index (SVI) products and shade/illumination normalization approaches yield significantly higher mapping accuracies, compared to non-normalized spectral bands. Advanced machine learning image classification routines are implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. Optimal classifier parameters (e.g., number of trees and number of features for random forest classifiers) were achieved by using tuning techniques. Accuracy assessment results indicate consistent and effective overall classification (i.e., above 70% mapping accuracies) can be achieved using multi-temporal SVI composites with simple illumination normalization and elevation ancillary data, despite the fact limited training and reference data are available.

The aim is to partition the difference images acquired from multitemporal satellite images into changed and unchanged regions. Level set method is a promising way for remote sensing images change detection among the existed methods. Unfortunately, re-initialization, a necessary step in classical level set methods is known a complex and time-consuming process, which may limits their practical application in remote sensing images change detection. In this paper, we present an unsupervised change detection approach for remote sensing image based on an improved region-based active contour model without re-initialization. In order to eliminate the process for re-initialization and reduce the numerical errors caused by re-initialization, we describe an improving level set method for remote sensing images change detection. The proposed method introduced a distance regularization term into the energy function which could maintain a desired shape of the level set function and keep a signed distance profile near the zero level set.

In this paper, an approach to fine registration between VHR multi-temporal images by considering local distribution of RN is proposed. Since the dominant RN mainly exists along boundaries of objects, we use edge information in high frequency regions to identify it. In order to validate the proposed approach, datasets are built from VHR multi-temporal images acquired by optical satellite sensors.

The study area is abandoned Kizel coal basin, which is located in the Perm region, Russia. For the last 15-20 years, the acid mine drainage (AMD) and mine tailings leachate have caused extreme contamination of rivers with iron, alumini-um and heavy metals. Multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 images for 1987‒2017 and the results of hydrochemical monitoring of surface water bodies for 2006‒2013 are used as initial data. The Acid Mine Water Index (AMWI) is proposed to estimate the AMD-induced river contamination. This index is based on the reflectance values in blue and red spectral bands of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. The AMWI values are compared with the iron concentration measurements in several streams flowing through of Kizel coal basin. The statistically significant correlation between the AMWI values and iron concentration is found for Yayva river. We have analyzed the temporal changes of AMWI for 1987‒2017, and found that AMWI values for Yayva and Kos'va rivers varied sometime in different directions. These variations can be explained by the difference of AMD regime. Also we outlined some areas (around 20 ha) of degraded soil and vegetation cover from high-resolution images. The largest areas of degraded soil and vegetation occurred in 2006‒2010 in association with the change of AMD regime. After 2010, the degradation process slowed down. © 2018 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

To achieve this, firstly, a preprocessing strategy is used to remove illumination artifacts and results in less false detection than traditional threshold-based algorithms. Then, we use the corrected input data to define a new fitness function based on the difference image. The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i.e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images.

Due to global warming and its thermal and wind-wave effects, there is a tendency of increase in coastal erosion rates. Understanding of the interaction between permafrost and sea is important to disclose the background of active development of natural resources in the Arctic coastal zone (construction of coastal facilities, offshore pipelines, etc). In the present study, coastal dynamics of the Western Russian Arctic coasts are studied, including Varandey (Pechora Sea), Ural and Yamal coasts near the underwater gas pipeline “Bovanenkovo-Ukhta” across Baydaratskaya Bay (Kara Sea). Kara Sea key-sites are characterized by continuous permafrost, with annual ground temperature of-4…-6 ºC and permafrost thickness of up to 50-100 m. Varandey key-site is located in the zone of sporadic permafrost. Estimations of coastal retreat rates were based on high resolution multitemporal space imagery analysis together with data of airborne surveys. All satellite images were orthorectified to decrease uncertainties. During fieldwork, DGPS mapping of some points with the constant position were made for accurate coastal erosion rates estimations. The study revealed that long-term (1960s-2010s) average annual retreat rates for coasts of different key-sites ranged from 0.5 to 2 m per year: at Varandey – 2.2 m/a; Ural coast of Baydaratskaya Bay – 2 m/a, and Yamal – 0.4 m/a. Coastal erosion rates were calculated for different time intervals, they depend on coastal morphology (cliff height, beach presence), slope exposure, permafrost features (sediment composition, ice content, etc). Studies on coastal dynamics and understanding their various aspects are very important for the attractive Arctic region under the conditions of climate change. The obtained results allow for a better understanding of coastal retreat processes and forecasting of Russian Arctic coastal dynamics in the future. © SGEM2018.","Antennas; Dynamics; Erosion; Global warming; Offshore oil well production; Permafrost; Surveys; Wave effects; Coastal erosion; Coastal morphology; Ground temperature; Russian Arctic; Sediment composition; Space imagery; Sporadic permafrosts; Wind wave effects; Offshore pipelines","Aerial and space imagery; Coastal erosion; Permafrost; Russian Arctic","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058886550"

The aim of this paper is to determine the rapid changes in land use/land cover (LULC) pattern due to agriculture expansion, environmental calamities such as flood and government policies over Upper Narmada basin, India. Multi-temporal Landsat satellite images for years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2015 were used to analyze and monitor the changes in LULC with an overall accuracy of more than 85%. Results revealed a potential decrease in natural vegetation (− 9.52%) due to the expansion of settlement (+ 0.52%) and cropland (+ 9.43%) from 1990 to 2015. In the present study, Cellular Automata and Markov (CA–Markov), an integrated tool was used to project the short-term LULC map of year 2030.

The multi-temporal vegetation index data of Formosat-2 have been used which covers the whole phenology of wheat crop. The additional sensor Landsat-8 OLI imagery has been filled the crucial gap of Formosat-2 temporal datasets. Nine types of proposed kernels based PCM classifier have been applied on three temporal datasets (four, five and six date combinations) to classify two classes early sown and late sown wheat crop.

However, the reproducibility of remote sensing methods for discriminating and mapping mangrove habitats is often overstated due to the lack of temporal observations. Here, we investigated the potential use of temporal series of high-resolution multispectral satellite images to discriminate and map four typical Asian ZMS. This study was based on the analysis of eight images acquired between 2001 and 2014 over the mangrove area of Nusa Lembongan, Bali, Indonesia. Variations between years in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance signatures were examined as functions of the acquisition angles. We also applied maximum likelihood supervised classification to all of the images and determined the variability in the classification errors. We found that the distinction between spectral signatures of ZMS characterized by a close canopy was fairly independent of the season and sensor characteristics. By contrast, the variability in the multispectral signatures of ZMS with open canopies and associated classification errors could be attributed to variability in ground surface scattering. In both cases, sun-viewing geometry could alter the separability between ZMS classes in near-nadir viewing or frontward sun-viewing configurations, thereby explaining why the overall accuracy of ZMS classification might vary from 65% to 80%. Thus, multitemporal analysis is an important stage in the development of robust methods for ZMS mapping. It must be supported by physical-based research aiming to quantify the influences of canopy structure, species composition, ground surface properties, and viewing geometry parameters on ZMS multispectral signatures. © 2016 IEEE.","Bali; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Nusa Lembongan; Sunda Isles; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Surface scattering; Classification errors; High spatial resolution; Maximum likelihood supervised classifications; Multi-temporal analysis; Multispectral satellite image; Optical satellite imagery; Sensor characteristics; Species composition; biodiversity; ecosystem function; image classification; mangrove; mapping; maximum likelihood analysis; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; temporal analysis; Satellite imagery","High-resolution image; mangrove biodiversity; multispectral analysis; species discrimination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84966440610"

The areas reclaimed from estuarine tidal flats show high spatial heterogeneity in soil salinity conditions. There are three typical vegetation types for which the distribution is restricted by the soil conditions. A halophyte-dominated vegetation is located in a high saline area, grass vegetation is found in a mid- or low saline area, and reed/small-reed vegetation is situated in a low saline area. Multi-temporal satellite images were used to classify the vegetation types. Landsat images were downscaled to take into account spatial heterogeneity using cokriging. A random forest classifier was used for the classification, with downscaled Landsat and RapidEye images. Classification with RapidEye images alone demonstrated a lower level of accuracy than when combined with multi-temporal downscaled images. The results demonstrate the usefulness of a downscaling technique for mapping. This approach can provide a framework which is able to maintain low costs whilst producing richer images for the monitoring of a large and heterogeneous ecosystem. © 2017 by the authors.","Decision trees; Mapping; Reclamation; Vegetation; Co-Kriging; Down-scaling; Multi-temporal image; Random forests; Saemangeum; Vegetation classification; Image classification","Cokriging; Downscaling; Multi-temporal image; Random forest; Saemangeum; Vegetation classification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019391264"

Secondly, detected buildings are merged again with the Sentinel-2 classification so as to extract the artificialized areas; the building labels from the regularization step are dilated in order to connect the building objects; a binary classification is derived from the original Sentinel-2 classification before being reintroduced in a fusion and contrast sensitive regularization process so as to eventually retrieve the urban footprint.

The high temporal revisit of current and forthcoming missions and the scarcity of labeled data force us to cast cloud screening as an unsupervised change detection problem in the temporal domain. We introduce a cloud screening method based on detecting abrupt changes along the time dimension. The main assumption is that image time series follow smooth variations over land (background) and abrupt changes will be mainly due to the presence of clouds. The method estimates the background surface changes using the information in the time series. In particular, we propose linear and nonlinear least squares regression algorithms that minimize both the prediction and the estimation error simultaneously. Then, significant differences in the image of interest with respect to the estimated background are identified as clouds. The use of kernel methods allows the generalization of the algorithm to account for higher-order (nonlinear) feature relations. After the proposed cloud masking and cloud removal, cloud-free time series at high spatial resolution can be used to obtain a better monitoring of land cover dynamics and to generate more elaborated products. The method is tested in a dataset with 5-day revisit time series from SPOT-4 at high resolution and with Landsat-8 time series. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields more accurate cloud masks when confronted with state-of-the-art approaches typically used in operational settings. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform, which allows us to access the full Landsat-8 catalog and work in a parallel distributed platform to extend its applicability to a global planetary scale. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Data handling; Engines; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Time series; Change detection; Cloud masking; Google earths; Image time-series; Kernel ridge regressions; Multi-temporal analysis; Time series analysis","change detection; cloud masking; Google Earth Engine; image time series; kernel ridge regression; multitemporal analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009343981"

Inter-or intra-sensoral misregistration will negatively affect any subsequent image analysis, specifically when processing multi-sensoral or multi-temporal data. In recent decades, many algorithms have been developed to enable manual, semi- or fully automatic displacement correction. Especially in the context of big data processing and the development of automated processing chains that aim to be applicable to different remote sensing systems, there is a strong need for efficient, accurate and generally usable co-registration. Here, we present AROSICS (Automated and Robust Open-Source Image Co-Registration Software), a Python-based open-source software including an easy-to-use user interface for automatic detection and correction of sub-pixel misalignments between various remote sensing datasets. It is independent of spatial or spectral characteristics and robust against high degrees of cloud coverage and spectral and temporal land cover dynamics. The co-registration is based on phase correlation for sub-pixel shift estimation in the frequency domain utilizing the Fourier shift theorem in a moving-window manner. A dense grid of spatial shift vectors can be created and automatically filtered by combining various validation and quality estimation metrics. Additionally, the software supports the masking of, e.g., clouds and cloud shadows to exclude such areas from spatial shift detection. The software has been tested on more than 9000 satellite images acquired by different sensors. The results are evaluated exemplarily for two inter-sensoral and two intra-sensoral use cases and show registration results in the sub-pixel range with root mean square error fits around 0.3 pixels and better. © 2017 by the authors.","Automation; Big data; Computer software; Data handling; Frequency estimation; High level languages; Image coding; Mean square error; Open source software; Optical correlation; Pixels; Radar; Remote sensing; Software testing; User interfaces; Fourier; Image co-registration; Optical; Phase correlation; Pre-processing; Python; Sub pixels; Image processing","Fourier shift theorem; Geometric pre-processing; Image co-registration; Inter-sensor; Intra-sensor; Optical; Phase correlation; Python; Radar; Sub-pixel","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022346414"

Agricultural use of the affected land is impeded both by the irreversible loss of topsoil and the morphological dissection of the terrain. In various badland regions around the world, a solution to the latter problem is attempted by infilling of gullies and levelling of badland topography in order restore a morphology suitable for agricultural cultivation. Gully and badland levelling for agricultural reclamation has been conducted for decades in the large ravine lands of India. This study aims at analysing the distribution and dynamics of land levelling within the Chambal badlands in Morena district, Madhya Pradesh, between 1971 and 2015. Using high to medium resolution satellite images from the Corona, Landsat, Aster and RapidEye missions and a multi-temporal classification approach, we have mapped and quantified areas that were newly levelled within eight observation periods. We analysed the spatial relation of levelled land to several physical and socio-economic factors that potentially influence the choice of reclamation site by employing geographic information system (GIS) analysis methods and results from focus-group discussions in selected villages. Results show that nearly 38 km2 or 23% of the badlands in the study area have been levelled within 45 years. The levelling rate generally increases during the observation period, but the annual variability is high. We have found spatial relationships to badland morphology, vicinity of existing cropland and proximity to villages and drainage lines. From a socio-economic point of view, availability of financial and technical means, access rights to the badland and ownership issues play an important role. Considering studies on soil degradation caused by levelling of badlands in other regions, the sustainability of the newly reclaimed fields in the Chambal badlands is questionable.

It is typically demonstrated by the expansion of a city's infrastructure, mainly development of its roads and buildings. Uncontrolled urban Growth in cities has been responsible for several problems that include living environment, drinking water, noise and air pollution, waste management, traffic congestion and hydraulic processes. Accurate identification of urban growth is of great importance for urban planning and water/land management. Recent advances in satellite imagery, in terms of improved spatial and temporal resolutions, allows for efficient identification of change patterns and the prediction of built-up areas. In this study, two approaches were adapted to quantify and assess the pattern of urbanization, in Ajman City at UAE, during the last three decades. The first approach relies on image processing techniques and multi-temporal Landsat satellite images with ground resolution varying between 15 to 60 meters. In this approach, the derived edge images (roads and buildings) were used as the basis of change detection. The second approach relies on digitizing features from high-resolution images captured at different years. The latest approach was adopted, as a reference and ground truth, to calibrate extracted edges from Landsat images. It has been found that urbanized area almost increased by 12 folds during the period 1975-2015 where the growth of buildings and roads were almost parallel until 2005 when the roads spatial expansion witnessed a steep increase due to the vertical expansion of the City. Extracted Edges features, were successfully used for change detection and quantification in term of buildings and roads. © Authors 2018.

The Remote sensing data has become a heart of change detection technique because of its high temporal frequency, digital computation, synoptic view and wider selection of spatial and spectral resolution. The general objectives of change detection in remote sensing include recognizing the geographical location and type of changes, quantifying the changes, and assessing the accuracy of change detection results. In this paper analyses the various change detection techniques using satellite images. Three remote sensing techniques, including Image Differencing, Principal Component Analysis and Change Vector Analysis used to detect the changes. To carry out these techniques, Landsat8 satellite images were used to recognize changes in study area. The efficiency of these method in study area were compared using post classification method and carry out accuracy assessment. The results shows that change vector analysis perform better for change detection to other methods. © 2015 IEEE.","Image analysis; Image classification; Information science; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal detection; Accuracy assessment; Change vector analysis; Image differencing; Landsat8 images; Post classification; Pre-processing image; Principal component analysis","Accuracy assessment; change vector analysis; image differencing; Landsat8 images; Post classification; Preprocessing images; principal component analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979240884"

The aim is to recursively maximize the posterior marginal at each pixel, which associates the most probable class label given the entire input information.

In this paper, an enhanced dictionary-based sparse representation (EDSR) is proposed for multitemporal image fusion. Multitemporal remote satellite images acquired on the same geographical area at different acquisition dates are merged to obtain a fused image for further analysis. Sparse representation of the image is employed in the approximation and representation of the target image. In order to improve the performance of the fusion process, a locally adaptive dictionary is created such that the dictionary contains patches extracted from both source images. The reconstruction of the image is performed using maximum absolute coefficients through the learned dictionary. The proposed EDSR technique has been compared quantitatively and qualitatively with the existing techniques, such as PCA, DWT, SWT, Ehlers, and sparse representation (SR), to evaluate its performance. The EDSR performs well in mutual information (MI) with 3.4742 and feature mutual information (FMI) with 0.4790 and provides better results in the case of degree of distortion, UIQI, and ERGAS for dataset 1 than the existing fusion methods.

When comparing two images taken at different times of day or in different seasons for change detection, the variation of topographic shades and shadows caused by the change of sunlight angle can be so significant that it overwhelms the real object and environmental changes, making automatic detection unreliable. An effective change detection algorithm therefore has to be robust to the illumination variation. This paper presents our research on developing and testing an Illumination Invariant Change Detection (IICD) method based on the robustness of phase correlation (PC) to the variation of solar illumination for image matching. The IICD is based on two key functions: i) initial change detection based on a saliency map derived from pixel-wise dense PC matching and ii) change quantization which combines change type identification, motion estimation and precise appearance change identification. Experiment using multi-temporal Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images, Rapid eye satellite images and Mars HiRiSE images demonstrate that our frequency based image matching method can reach sub-pixel accuracy and thus the proposed IICD method can effectively detect and precisely segment large scale change such as landslide as well as small object change such as Mars rover, under daily and seasonal sunlight changes. © Authors 2018.

In this study, the city of Erzincan was selected as the sample case. The analyses of change were conducted by using the optical satellite images from LANSAT TM dated 1987 and the LANDSAT ETM+ dated 2006, besides the night images from 1998, 2006 and 2010. Spatial change maps were created for the qualitative analysis, and change matrixes were formed for the quantitative assessment of these changes. The outcomes of these change analyses were then evaluated and interpreted in the light of the demographics of the population living in the area. The results obtained from the Landsat satellite images indicate that the area of the city expanded at the annual average rate of 1.65% in 1987–2006. Night images indicate that the city area grew at an annual average rate of 4.04% in 1998–2006, while this rate was 20.28% in the period of 2006–2010.

That issue is important when performing spatiotemporal analyses to determine ecosystems' productivity. In this study, three correction methods were applied to satellite images for the period 2010-2014. These methods were Atmospheric Correction for Flat Terrain 2 (ATCOR2), Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH), and Dark Object Substract 1 (DOS1). The images included 12 sub-scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The images corresponded to three Permanent Monitoring Sites (PMS) of grasslands, 'Teseachi', 'Eden', and 'El Sitio', located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. After the corrections were applied to the images, they were evaluated in terms of their precision for biomass estimation. For that, biomass production was measured during the study period at the three PMS to calibrate production models developed with simple and multiple linear regression (SLR and MLR) techniques. When the estimations were made with MLR, DOS1 obtained an R2 of 0.97 (p < 0.05) for 2012 and values greater than 0.70 (p < 0.05) during 2013-2014. The rest of the algorithms did not show significant results and DOS1, which is the simplest algorithm, resulted in the best biomass estimator. Thus, in the multitemporal analysis of grassland based on spectral information, it is not necessary to apply complex correction procedures. The maps of biomass production, elaborated from images corrected with DOS1, can be used as a reference point for the assessment of the grassland condition, as well as to determine the grazing capacity and thus the potential animal production in such ecosystems. © 2018 by the authors.","Biomass; Ecology; Ecosystems; Estimation; Forestry; Linear regression; Productivity; Radiometry; ATCOR2; DOS1; LANDSAT; Multi-temporal analysis; Multiple linear regressions; Radiometric corrections; Spatio temporal; Spatiotemporal analysis; Satellite imagery","ATCOR2; DOS1; FLAASH: spatio temporal; Landsat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042540975"

The results observed by analysis of multi-temporal satellite images show an extreme temporal change in the growth of ISA in the city.

However, there are few systematic studies considering the error source characteristics or the improvement of the deformation field accuracy obtained by Landsat 8 image. In this study, we utilize the 2013 Mw 7.7 Balochistan, Pakistan earthquake to analyze error spatio-temporal characteristics and elaborate how to mitigate error sources in the deformation field extracted from multi-temporal Landsat 8 images. We found that the stripe artifacts and the topographic shadowing artifacts are two major error components in the deformation field, which currently lack overall understanding and an effective mitigation strategy. For the stripe artifacts, we propose a small spatial baseline (< 200 m) method to avoid the stripe artifacts effect on the deformation field. We also propose a small radiometric baseline method to reduce the topographic shadowing artifacts and radiometric decorrelation noises. Those performances and accuracy evaluation show that these two methods are effective in improving the precision of deformation field. This study provides the possibility to detect subtle ground movement with higher precision caused by earthquake, melting glaciers, landslides, etc., with Landsat 8 images.

This feasibility study presents an application of high-resolution optical images from operational satellites, which have become more available in polar regions, for sea ice motion and deformation measurements. The sea ice motion, i.e., Lagrangian vector, is measured by using a maximum cross-correlation (MCC) technique and multi-temporal high-resolution images acquired on 14-15 August 2014 from multiple spaceborne sensors on board Korea Multi-Purpose Satellites (KOMPSATs) with short acquisition time intervals. The sea ice motion extracted from the six image pairs of the spatial resolutions were resampled to 4 m and 15 m yields with vector length measurements of 57.7 m root mean square error (RMSE) and -11.4 m bias and 60.7 m RMSE and -13.5 m bias, respectively, compared with buoy location records. The errors from both resolutions indicate more accurate measurements than from conventional sea ice motion datasets from passive microwave and radar data in ice and water mixed surface conditions. In the results of sea ice deformation caused by interaction of individual ice floes, while free drift patterns of ice floes were delineated from the 4 m spatial resolution images, the deformation was less revealing in the 15 m spatial resolution image pairs due to emphasized discretization uncertainty from coarser pixel sizes. The results demonstrate that using multi-temporal high-resolution optical satellite images enabled precise image block matching in the melting season, thus this approach could be used for expanding sea ice motion and deformation dataset, with an advantage of frequent image acquisition capability in multiple areas by means of many operational satellites. © 2017 by the authors.

Morphologic monitoring of tidal flats has become increasingly important with respect to achieving sustainable development targets. Remote sensing is an established technique for the measurement of topography over tidal flats; of the available methods, the waterline method is particularly effective for constructing a digital elevation model (DEM) of intertidal areas. However, application of the waterline method is more limited in large-scale, shifting tidal flats areas, where the tides are not synchronized and the waterline is not a quasi-contour line. For this study, a topographical map of the intertidal regions within the Radial Sand Ridges (RSR) along the Jiangsu Coast, China, was generated using an iterative approach on the waterline method. A series of 21 multi-temporal satellite images (18 HJ-1A/B CCD and three Landsat TM/OLI) of the RSR area collected at different water levels within a five month period (31 December 2013–28 May 2014) was used to extract waterlines based on feature extraction techniques and artificial further modification. These ‘remotely-sensed waterlines’ were combined with the corresponding water levels from the ‘model waterlines’ simulated by a hydrodynamic model with an initial generalized DEM of exposed tidal flats. Based on the 21 heighted ‘remotely-sensed waterlines’, a DEM was constructed using the ANUDEM interpolation method. Using this new DEM as the input data, it was re-entered into the hydrodynamic model, and a new round of water level assignment of waterlines was performed. A third and final output DEM was generated covering an area of approximately 1900 km2 of tidal flats in the RSR. The water level simulation accuracy of the hydrodynamic model was within 0.15 m based on five real-time tide stations, and the height accuracy (root mean square error) of the final DEM was 0.182 m based on six transects of measured data. This study aimed at construction of an accurate DEM for a large-scale, high-variable zone within a short timespan based on an iterative way of the waterline method. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Jiangsu; digital elevation model; ecosystem function; hydrodynamics; integrated approach; interpolation; Landsat; remote sensing; sand ridge; satellite imagery; shoreline; sustainable development; tidal flat; topographic mapping","Hydrodynamic modeling; Radial sand ridges; Remote sensing; Tidal flats; Topography; Waterline","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016161974"

Conventional geometric calibration, which uses high-accuracy ground control data to accurately calibrate the orientation parameters of a satellite, heavily relies on the control data of the calibration fields and may not be applicable in emergencies where urgent and accurate positioning is needed. The constant calibration of satellites is also difficult owing to the lack of permanent calibration fields. This paper presents a geometric cross-calibration method for the rapid and accurate calibration of satellites. The conjugate points from the multitemporal images of one satellite or multi-satellite images are first automatically extracted; then, the interior orientation parameters of the satellite requiring calibration can be precisely recovered according to the positioning consistency constraint of the conjugate points. In contrast to the conventional method, the proposed method can accurately calibrate the orientation parameters without using high-accuracy control data of the calibration fields. Therefore, the proposed method aids in the constant calibration of satellites to ensure the positioning accuracy, even without sufficient permanent calibration fields. The multitemporal images of the Yaogan-4 satellite and the images of the ZY3-01 and ZY02C satellites were considered for verifying this method. Finally, accuracies of approximately 0.7 and 0.6 pixels were achieved by the proposed and conventional methods, respectively.

Growing urbanization is one of the anthropic causes of UHI. The UHI phenomenon has a negative impact on the life quality of the local population (thermal discomfort, summer thermal shock, etc.), thus investigations and analyses on this topic are really useful and important for correct and sustainable urban planning; this study is included in this context. A multi-temporal analysis was performed in the municipality of Modena (Italy) to identify and estimate the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI, strictly correlated to the UHI phenomenon) from 2014 to 2017. For this purpose, Landsat-8 satellite images were processed with Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) to obtain the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For every pixel, LST and NDVI values of three regions of interest (ROI, i.e., Countryside, Suburbs, and City Center) were extracted and their correlations were investigated. A maximum variation of 6.4 °C in the LST values between City Center and Countryside was highlighted, confirming the presence of the SUHI phenomenon even in a medium-sized municipality like Modena. The implemented procedure demonstrates that satellite data are suitable for SUHI identification and estimation, therefore it could be a useful tool for public administration for urban planning policies. © 2018 by the authors.","Emilia-Romagna; Italy; Modena; air temperature; GIS; global warming; heat island; land surface; NDVI; public administration; remote sensing; rural area; satellite data; satellite imagery; software; surface temperature; urban planning; urban policy; urbanization","Global warming; Land surface temperature; Landsat-8; QGIS; Remote sensing; Semi-automatic classification plugin; Urban heat island; Urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047270024"

This study seeks to use multi-temporal satellite images and other data from various sources to analyze spatiotemporal changes from 1932 to 2005, and applied a quantitative methodology named intensity analysis in the time scale of decades at three levels: time interval, category, and transition. The findings of the case study are as follows: 1) the interval level of intensity analysis revealed that the annual rate of overall change was relatively fast in 1932–1954 and 1954–1976 time intervals. 2) The category level showed that arable land experienced less intensively gains and losses if the overall change was to have been distributed uniformly across the landscape while the gains and losses of forest land, grassland, water, settlement, wetland and other unused land were not consistent and stationary across the four time intervals. 3) The transition level illustrated that arable land expanded at the expense of grassland before 2000 while it gained intensively from wetland from 2000 to 2005. Settlement targets arable land and avoids grassland, water, wetland and other unused land. Besides, the loss of grassland was intensively targeted by arable land, forest land and wetland in the study period while the loss of wetland was targeted by water except for the time interval of 1976–2000. 4) During the early reclamation period, land use change of the study area was mainly affected by the policy, institutional and political factors, followed by the natural disasters. © 2017, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","China; Jilin; Zhenlai; ecotone; grassland; image analysis; land cover; land use change; pastoralism; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis","driving forces; intensity analysis; land use and land cover change; Northeast China; pattern","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021191003"

However, fully automatic solutions reach their limitation; on the one hand, it is difficult to design general decision criteria able to select area of changes for images under various acquisition conditions, and on the other hand, the relevance of changes may differ from one user to another. In this letter, we introduce an alternative change detection method based on relevance feedback. The proposed algorithm is iterative and based on a query and answer model that: 1) asks the user questions about the relevance of his targeted changes and 2) according to these answers, updates change detection results. Our method is also based on a new formulation of canonical correlation analysis (CCA), referred to as context-aware CCA, that learns transformations, which map data from different input spaces (related to multitemporal satellite images) into a common latent space, which is sensitive to relevant changes while being resilient to irrelevant ones. These CCA transformations correspond to the optimum of a particular constrained maximization problem that mixes an alignment term with a context-based regularization criterion. The particularity of this novel CCA approach resides in its ability to exploit spatial geometric context resulting into better performances compared with other CCA approaches, as shown in experiments. © 2017 IEEE.","Correlation methods; Iterative methods; Query processing; Remote sensing; Automatic change detection; Canonical correlation analysis; Decision criterions; Maximization problem; Multi-temporal satellite images; Relevance feedback; Remote sensing applications; Satellite images; Image analysis","Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); context; relevance feedback (RF); resilience; satellite image change detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015635910"

Multi-temporal satellite images are a natural data source to survey ice on lakes. In this paper, we describe a method for lake ice monitoring, which uses low spatial resolution (250 m-1000 m) satellite images to determine whether a lake is frozen or not. We report results on four selected lakes in Switzerland: Sihl, Sils, Silvaplana and St. Moritz. These lakes have different properties regarding area, altitude, surrounding topography and freezing frequency, describing cases of medium to high difficulty. Digitized Open Street Map (OSM) lake outlines are back-projected on to the image space after generalization. As a pre-processing step, the absolute geolocation error of the lake outlines is corrected by matching the projected outlines to the images. We define the lake ice detection as a two-class (frozen, non-frozen) semantic segmentation problem. Several spectral channels of the multi-spectral satellite data are used, both reflective and emissive (thermal). Only the cloud-free (clean) pixels which lie completely inside the lake are analyzed. The most useful channels to solve the problem are selected with xgboost and visual analysis of histograms of reference data, while the classification is done with non-linear support vector machine (SVM). We show experimentally that this straight-forward approach works well with both MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery. Moreover, we show that the algorithm produces consistent results when tested on data from multiple winters. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.

Medium spatial resolution (≥250m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (≤30m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining NDVI series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5m-resolution) and the SPOT5 Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach. We then compared results with phenology retrieved from four years of 30 m Landsat 8 OLI data, and single-year 100 m Proba-V and 250 m MODIS temporal composites of the same period. Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and MODIS phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We implemented BRDF extraction for typical ground objects in Xiamen, China using multi-temporal HJ-1A/B satellite images in conjunction with the common Roujean kernel-driven model (RKDM). Ground objects were automatically recognized in post-processed images, and six typical ones (buildings, woods, water, farmland, roads, and sand) were extracted. We then extracted the land surface reflectance and imaging angles of the same sample points for each typical ground object from four images taken over a six-week period. We estimated the BRDF of the six ground objects using the RKDM, and analyzed the precision of the model. This led to generally accurate BRDF estimation of typical ground objects. Furthermore, we systematically analyzed BRDF availability in the validation of the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI). Although it was necessary to bring geometric BRDF imaging normalization into NDVI validation, problems were associated with this. Because the RKDM is statistical in nature, it cannot describe the essential characteristics of the spatial distribution of land surface reflectance, and may generate other uncertainties for NDVI validation.

On the other hands, combining various satellite images acquired on different dates is a promising approach to obtain a more accurate classified map compared to the map obtained by single-date satellite imagery.

There is a need to maintain the homogeneity of radiometric and phenological conditions to ensure accuracy in change detection, but images to assess long-term changes in time-series data that satisfy such conditions are difficult to obtain. For this reason, image normalization is essential. In particular, the normalizing compositive conditions require nonlinear modeling, and random forest (RF) techniques can be utilized for this normalization. This study employed Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper satellite images with temporal, radiometric and phenological differences, and obtained Radiometric Control Set Samples by selecting no-change pixels between the subject image and reference image using scattergrams. In the obtained no-change regions, RF regression was modeled, and normalized images were obtained. Next, normalization performance was evaluated by comparing the results against the following conventional linear regression methods: mean-standard deviation regression, simple regression, and no-change regression. The normalization performance of RF regression was much higher. In addition, for an additional usefulness evaluation in normalization, the normalization performance was compared with other nonlinear ensemble regressions, i.e. Adaptive Boosting regression and Stochastic Gradient Boosting regression, which confirmed that the normalization performance of RF regression was significantly higher. In other words, it was found to be highly useful for normalization when compared to other nonlinear ensemble regressions. Finally, as a result of performing change detection, normalized subject images generated by RF regression showed the highest accuracy, which indicated that the proposed method (where the image was normalized using RF regression) may be useful in change detection between multi-temporal image datasets. © 2017 by the authors.","Decision trees; Radiometry; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Stochastic systems; Change detection; Nonlinear; Random forests; Relative radiometric normalization; Scattergram; Regression analysis","Change detection; Nonlinear; Random forest regression; Relative radiometric normalization; Scattergram","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034768865"

Loss of agricultural lands, in many cases, worsens poverty levels of smallholder farmers who depend on subsistence farming – an issue that Sustainable Development Goal number one seeks to address. Land use and land cover (LULC) change studies are widely used to monitor human-induced changes in the environment. This study used multi-temporal satellite images and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes in Sekondi-Takoradi, over a 30-year period (1986–2016), to understand how recent historical events and economic policies may have contributed to such changes. Our results suggest that the size of urban land area has nearly doubled through the study period to accommodate the constantly increasing population in the metropolis. This has led to a significant reduction in agricultural lands and an almost complete obliteration of standing forest. Policies enacted during the era of structural adjustment program and the current oil industry seem to have been the main drivers of LULC changes in Sekondi-Takoradi. With the prevailing antagonism between urban expansion and agricultural land use activities, our study asserts the need to control urban sprawl. This will be important to prevent loss of lands dedicated to subsistence farming, if complete eradication of poverty as stipulated by Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number one will be a realistic goal for the people of Sekondi-Takoradi. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ghana; Sekondi-Takoradi; Western Region; agricultural ecosystem; deforestation; economic policy; GIS; land cover; land use change; neoliberalism; oil industry; remote sensing; structural adjustment; sustainable development; urbanization","Agricultural ecosystems; Deforestation; Land use and land cover change; Oil industry; Structural Adjustment Program (SAP); Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042173032"

There are concerns that this DEM is not accurate enough for this purpose, especially over mountainous regions like in Austria. In this study, we investigate the height accuracy of PlanetDEM in Austria by comparing it with a reference DEM that is derived from airborne laser scanning. Afterwards, we predict the errors in the Sentinel orthophotos that are caused by these DEM errors: 99.8% of all pixels have a PlanetDEM-induced displacement between ±10 m (i.e. one Sentinel-2 pixel) for all investigated four satellite tracks over Austria. Still, at a few spots, the location errors can reach 60 m. ESA’s goal is to achieve a multi-temporal geo-registration quality (for Level-1C products) of 3 m (95.5% confidence) once the Global Reference Image is established. If we assume that this error budget consists partly of a georeferencing and partly of a DEM-induced error and both are equal, then the DEM-induced error may only amount to 2 m. In this case, PlanetDEM would not allow for this accuracy in the mountainous regions, because there, according to the predictions of this study, 95.5% of the errors are between ±3.8 m. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis.","Austria; Budget control; Error analysis; Errors; Image registration; Photogrammetry; Pixels; Airborne Laser scanning; Digital elevation model; European Space Agency; Geo-registration; Mountainous regions; Ortho-rectification; Satellite images; simulation; accuracy assessment; digital elevation model; elevation; error analysis; image processing; laser method; model; mountain region; orthophoto; photogrammetry; pixel; satellite imagery; Sentinel; simulation; Surveying","digital elevation models; error analysis; image registration; Orthorectification; photogrammetry; simulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049854345"

The proposed technique is based on the local binary similarity pattern (LBSP) concept. In this binary descriptor, inter-LBSP is used to detect the changes. In this approach, the main challenge is to calculate the threshold which is used to generate the binary feature vectors. Here, an effective solution has been found, where the neighbourhood information is used for calculation of threshold. Both images are partitioned into overlapping image blocks which are used to calculate the threshold. This calculated threshold is used to obtain binary feature vectors for each pixel of both images. To get the binary feature vectors, difference between neighbouring pixels and center pixel of each block is compared with the calculated threshold. Hamming distance is used as a similarity metric to compare the binary vectors of each image for each pixel position which gives the binary change map of changed and unchanged region. To obtain this binary change map, calculated hamming distance is compared with empirically chosen minimum similarity value. Optical satellite images acquired by Landsat satellite are used to perform the experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides better results compared to earlier reported techniques like expectation maximization and kernel k-means methods. © 2017 IEEE.","Hamming distance; Maximum principle; Satellites; Signal processing; Vectors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Change detection; Expectation - maximizations; Kernel k-means methods; Multi-temporal satellite images; Optical satellite images; Similarity patterns; Unsupervised change detection; Unsupervised techniques; Pixels","binary change map; Change detection; local binary similarity pattern (LBSP); multitemporal satellite image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046375037"

Their area-wide mapping and monitoring in mountainous terrain, however, is still challenging. The growing archives of optical remote sensing images offer great potential for the operational detection and monitoring of surface motion in such areas. This study proposes a multiple pairwise image correlation (MPIC) technique to obtain a series of redundant horizontal displacement fields, and different multi-temporal indicators for a more accurate detection and quantification of surface displacement. The technique is developed and tested on a series of monoscopic and stereoscopic Pléiades satellite images at a test site in the South French Alps. Empirical tests confirm that MPIC significantly increased detection accuracy (F − measure = 0.85) and that the measurement error can be reduced by averaging velocities from all pair combinations covering a given time-step (i.e. when stereo-pairs are available for at least one date). The derived inventory and displacement fields of 169 slow-moving landslides show a positive relationship between the landslide size and velocities, as well as a seasonal acceleration of the largest landslides in response to an increase in effective precipitation.

The image time series, as results of the satellite revisiting period, gives you insights not only on a certain area, but also on its representation at different moments of time. In order to limit the issues that might arise due to irregular time sampling of multispectral data, the authors propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series for analysis. To this point, the main goal is to mine the satellite image time series (SITS) for understanding the temporal behaviour of an area in terms of evolution and persistency. The paper introduces an analytical approach, combining coherent and no coherent analysis of SAR SITS content. We propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract categories of evolution from the SAR SITS and techniques which study statistical and coherent proprieties of the targets to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic characteristics over time, named Persistent Scatterers (PS). The obtained results indicate an evolutionary character hidden inside the persistent class.

Therefore, reliable up-to-date information is always called upon. In this study, we developed a new approach for land cover mapping based on the information of vegetation phenology. The main objective of this approach was to generate a land cover map of large cropland dominated area with high classification accuracy. Our approach consisted of two steps: first, we divided the study area into three land use groups depending on the phenology trend of cereals. Second, we applied a supervised classification for each group using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier and multi-date satellite images. Recent multi-temporal Landsat 8 images and field survey data were used for the classification process. To assess the robustness of this approach, a conventional supervised classification was performed using single date and multi-date images. Results indicated that the proposed approach is able to discriminate between different land cover types which have a similar spectral reflectance such as cereals, vegetables and pasture with high accuracy. The accuracy assessment showed very promising results with an overall accuracy of 86 % and a Kappa of 0.85 (good agreement) as compared to the single date (54–55 %) and the multi-date approach (78 %). Indeed, the application of this method provides accurate information for ecologists, hydrologists and the land development decision-makers. It can also improve the accuracy of environmental models that require high resolution land cover maps as input data. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Cropland dominated area; High accuracy; Land cover mapping; Landsat 8; Vegetation phenology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027522126"

Remote sensing is an effective method for detecting the impact of anthropogenic activities on the surface area of a lagoon such as Manzala Lake. The techniques used in this study include unsupervised classification, Mahalanobis distance supervised classification, minimum distance supervised classification, maximum likelihood supervised classification, and normalized difference water index. Data extracted from satellite images are used to predict the future temporal change in each class, using a statistical regression model and considering calibration, validation, and prediction phases. It was found that the maximum likelihood classification technique has the highest overall accuracy of 93.33%. This technique is selected to observe the changes in the surface area of the lake for the period from 1984 to 2015.

Traditional approaches in this field mainly face to limited labelled samples and spectral drift of image information. With spatial resolution improvement, ""pepper and salt"" appears and classification results will be effected when the pixelwise classification algorithms are applied to highresolution satellite images, in which the spatial relationship among the pixels is ignored. For classifying the multi-temporal high resolution images with limited labelled samples, spectral drift and ""pepper and salt"" problem, an object-based manifold alignment method is proposed. Firstly, multi-temporal multispectral images are cut to superpixels by simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) respectively. Secondly, some features obtained from superpixels are formed as vector. Thirdly, a majority voting manifold alignment method aiming at solving high resolution problem is proposed and mapping the vector data to alignment space. At last, all the data in the alignment space are classified by using KNN method. Multi-temporal images from different areas or the same area are both considered in this paper.

Nonetheless the existence is under serious threat due to unsustainable human activities that often exacerbated by extreme weather events. Monitoring and understanding health of tropical peat forest can help to determine correct measures to tackle any adverse impacts resulted from degraded tropical peat forest as well as mitigate and prevent continuing degradation of the ecosystems itself. This research applies remote sensing and Geographical Information System for investigating historical land cover changes in Sebubus Forest through analysis of Landsat images during period 1995 until 2016. The purpose is to understand how land cover of the 'Productive Forest', as it is classified by Indonesian Regulations on forestry, has been changing over time and the times when its dramatic transformation were happened. A matrix derived from multitemporal satellite image analysis is presented to understand land cover transitions and intensity. This investigation found that the forest were trees' covered until 2005 when some dramatic land cover changes began. Even though protected by regulation, Sebubus Forest area is not safe from adverse impact of human activities. By 2016 it is likely only less then 12% of the total peat land area remains covered by forest. © 2016 IEEE.","Deforestation; Image analysis; Peat; Remote sensing; Tropics; Extreme weather events; Human activities; Land-cover change; Multi-temporal analysis; Multi-temporal satellite images; Satellite image datas; Social and environmental; Tropical Peat Forest; Forestry","Deforestation; Multi-temporal Analysis; Satellite Image Data; Tropical Peat Forest","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034055456"

Ocean color remote sensing is an efficient tool to monitor SPM spatio-temporal variability in coastal waters. However, near-shore satellite images are complex to correct for atmospheric effects due to the proximity of land and to the high level of reflectance caused by high SPM concentrations in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. The water reflectance signal (?w) tends to saturate at short visible wavelengths when the SPM concentration increases. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution satellite imagery and in situ SPM and water reflectance data, this study presents (i) an assessment of existing atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms developed for turbid coastal waters; and (ii) a switching method that automatically selects the most sensitive SPM vs. ?w relationship, to avoid saturation effects when computing the SPM concentration. The approach is applied to satellite data acquired by three medium-high spatial resolution sensors (Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite and Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) to map the SPM concentration in some of the most turbid areas of the European coastal ocean, namely the Gironde and Loire estuaries as well as Bourgneuf Bay on the French Atlantic coast. For all three sensors, AC methods based on the use of short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands were tested, and the consistency of the retrieved water reflectance was examined along transects from low- to high-turbidity waters. For OLI data, we also compared a SWIR-based AC (ACOLITE) with a method based on multi-temporal analyses of atmospheric constituents (MACCS). For the selected scenes, the ACOLITE-MACCS difference was lower than 7%. Despite some inaccuracies in ?w retrieval, we demonstrate that the SPM concentration can be reliably estimated using OLI, MODIS and VIIRS, regardless of their differences in spatial and spectral resolutions. Match-ups between the OLI-derived SPM concentration and autonomous field measurements from the Loire and Gironde estuaries' monitoring networks provided satisfactory results. The multi-sensor approach together with the multi-conditional algorithm presented here can be applied to the latest generation of ocean color sensors (namely Sentinel2/MSI and Sentinel3/OLCI) to study SPM dynamics in the coastal ocean at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Complex networks; Estuaries; Image matching; Image reconstruction; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Infrared radiation; Oceanography; Orbits; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sediment transport; Spectrometers; Suspended sediments; Thermography (imaging); Turbidity; Coastal waters; High resolution satellite imagery; High spatial resolution sensors; Infrared imaging radiometers; River plume; Sediment transport monitoring; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Suspended particulate matters; Remote sensing","Coastal waters; Multi-conditional algorithm; Remote sensing; River plumes; Suspended particulate matter","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010693142"

This location is also known with the term »Terra dei Fouchi» because in this area is particularly widespread the phenomenon of waste burning and, over the past decades, there have been many landfills of hazardous waste of industrial origin. In order to contrast this phenomenon, the government of the Campania Region organized some prevention, monitoring and repression activities. In particular, the monitoring activities are employed by periodic inspection of sites, which are often object of illegal deposits (former quarries, illegal dumps, as well as city and country roads). The periodic inspection is usually performed by patrols of the company SMA Campania (the in-house regional company, specialized in environmental protection), and law enforcement agencies. Since early warning of illegal and the quick characterization of the detected sites is a key factor for effective resource allocation in the fight against illegal waste dumping, as part of a project, the periodic monitoring inspections of the local environmental agency have been supported with multi-temporal satellite images. The detection has been performed via expert photo-interpretation in order to achieve a high level of accuracy and reliable maps. However, in order to reduce this time consuming task, a multi-features detection algorithm has been implemented. Detected sites have been then classified according to 4 major characteristics (type, state, location and activity) of the dumps. Moreover, a multi-temporal analysis has been performed and it allowed following the evolution of the phenomenon. This approach was effective in both finding new illegal spills (with associated macro classification) and to follow the evolution (in terms of extension and persistence) of landfills already found in the past. © 2018 SPIE.","Classification (of information); Crime; Environmental regulations; Geographic information systems; Incineration; Inspection; Land fill; Gis and remote sensing; Illegal dumps; Law-enforcement agencies; Monitoring activities; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal analysis; Multi-temporal satellite images; Optical satellite images; Remote sensing","Classification; GIS; Illegal dumps; Multitemporal; Remote sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057317930"

Various multi-temporal satellite images viz., MSS (1972), ETM+ (1999, 2011) and digital elevation model (CARTOSAT I, 2006) were used to analyse the urban expansion, land transformation, growth directions, and spatial segregations within the urban landscape to develop an understanding the nature of built-up growth in DUA. The urban area increased from 10.33 km2 to 46.70 km2 (352.08%) along with high rate of population growth (160.07%) during 1972–2011 exhibiting population densification in DUA. The study reveals that coal mining based city faced significant land use transformation converting vegetation (−41.33%) into built-up land (352.08%) exhibiting loss of productive lands for the expansion of impervious surface. The per year urban growth exhibited increasing urban growth from 0.4 km2/year to 1.51 km2/year during 1972–1999 and 1999–2011 periods with overall growth of 332.73%. The built-up growth on varied elevation zones exhibits that the elevation zones 150–200 m is the most preferred (79.01%) for urban development with high growth (541.74%). The gradient modeling represents that the percentage of land (built-up) gradually increased from 3.48% to 15.74% during 1972–2011. The result exhibited that the major growth took place in south-west direction followed by south direction in haphazard manner during 1971–99 period, whereas predominant built-up development was observed in north, south and south-west direction during 1999–2011 period, majorly within the municipal limits. The study provides an analytical method to evaluate the built-up growth patterns of an urban milieu combining geoinformatics and landscape matrix.

The main objective of this paper is to study the impact assessment of watershed management techniques towards the improvement in land use land cover change (LULC) in agriculture, wasteland and degraded forest areas using multi temporal remote sensing data and GIS. It includes LULC classification, post classification techniques to measure the change detection between 2005 and 2013. Increasing population from past several decades intensified land farming which has led to the rapid land use/land cover change. Among many causes agriculture expansion, natural climate changes and government policies play vital role for change in LULC. In this paper we attempted to analyse and monitor the changes using LISS III images from 2005 to 2013. Images were first classified using supervised classification by giving training pixels based on ground truth. Post classification comparison techniques were applied to analyse LULC change from satellite images and used to assess the accuracy of the classification results. Integration of ancillary data and supervised classification further improved the classification accuracy. The major changes at watershed level were increased area of both scrub forest/deciduous forest and water bodies. Also area reduced for wasteland and degraded forest classes. Even though the area is in semi-arid region showed significant increase in agriculture crops. The results indicate the overall positive impact due to watershed management programmes on the study area. © IAEME Publication.","","Change detection; GIS; Landover; Remote sensing; Supervised classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019131665"

The study exhibits that capital Himalayan cities experienced rapid growth (830.92%) with high population increase (333.45%) during the observation period (1972–2015). The significant urban growth was observed in the cities of western and middle Himalayan region viz., Srinagar (9.36 km2–142.19 km2), Kathmandu (11.38 km2–92.58 km2) and Dehradun (4.1 km2–50.09 km2) in the higher altitudes due to remarkable increase in the population (0.5–1 million persons) during 1972–2015. On the contrary, Itanagar (7.19 km2), Gangtok (7.09 km2), Shimla (3.04 km2) and Thimphu (2.93 km2) observed less urban growth with moderate to low population growth (i.e., 0.05 to 0.15 million persons). The Shannon entropy based study exhibits that the cities viz., Kathmandu, Gangtok and Itanagar observed comparatively more dispersed urban growth during later period (1991–2015) as compared to the previous period (1972–1991) whereas, the remaining cities observed comparatively less dispersed urban growth during later period. The temporal land consumption pattern exhibits low density urban growth in Srinagar, Dehradun and Kathmandu, as observed with decrease in population density and increasing land consumption during 1972–2015 as compared to other cities, wherein urban densification was evident with increase in population density and decrease in land consumption. The cities in central and western Himalayan region observed high urban growth as compared to cities in eastern Himalayan region. The result shows that the capital cities contributes insignificant proportion (0.5%; 314 km2) of urban area in Himalayan region and accommodating large (ca. 4 million) population during 2015. The study indicates unplanned and haphazard growth in all capital Himalayan cities, leading towards urban densification as well as dispersion in the periphery with varied pattern and intensity. The specific trends and patterns of urban and population growth are governed by geographical as well as socio-economic-political factors at local to regional scale. The high population pressure induced higher risk to the urban residents as well as constrained urban growth over higher vulnerable zones.

Estimates of the influence of the intraseasonal dynamics of lake areas on the accuracy of remote measurement of lake sizes obtained with the use of radar images are given.

A synthesized histogram of the lake distribution in a wide range of their sizes was constructed using the Landsat-8 images and ultra-high resolution images of QuickBird, GeoEye-1 and Resurs-P, taking into account all the lakes in the permafrost zone from the smallest to the largest sizes. For the construction of the histogram, data were obtained on the number and areas of small lakes from ultra-high resolution images at 37 test sites, located fairly evenly in the study area. The correspondence of the received empirical histogram to the lognormal distribution of lakes was established using the Pearson criterion.

The pre-processing phase corresponded to an accurate geometric correction, which is a requirement for applications of time series of satellite images such as the agricultural monitoring. Other steps in the analysis process were accomplished by a graphical interface to improve the interaction with the users. Approach validation was done using NDVI images of sugarcane fields because of their economic importance as source of ethanol and as effective alternative to replace fossil fuels and mitigate greenhouse gases emissions. According to the analysis done, the methodology allowed to identify areas with similar agricultural development patterns, also considering different growing seasons for the crops, covering monthly and annual periods.

Multitemporal satellite images suffer from illumination variation. In order to tackle this problem, a variant of a local binary similarity pattern (LBSP) descriptor, which has a good resistance to illumination variation, is proposed. The proposed technique consists of two steps: binary feature vector creation and generation of binary change map using Hamming distance as a similarity metric. To get the binary feature vectors, inter-LBSP, which utilizes the region information across images, is applied on both images. Before applying LBSP, both images are partitioned into overlapping patches. This letter proposes two methods taking different combinations of patches at each pixel position. First one uses the center of one image and neighborhood information of two images, whereas the second one uses the center of two images and neighborhood information of one image.

In many cases, existing approaches concentrate on single-time and multi- or hyper-spectral reflectance measurements observed by spaceborne and airborne sensors. However, land-cover classes, such as crops, change their reflective characteristics over time, thus complicating a classification at one particular observation time. Opposed to that, these characteristics change in a systematic and predictive manner, which should be utilized in a multi-temporal approach. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal characteristics from a sequence of SENTINEL 2A observations. We compared the performance of LSTM networks with other architectures and a support vector machine (SVM) baseline and show the effectiveness of dynamic temporal feature extraction. For our experiments, a large study area together with rich ground truth annotations provided by public authorities was used for training and evaluation. Our rather straightforward LSTM variant achieved state-of-the art classification performance, thus opening promising potential for further research. © 2017 IEEE.","Brain; Computer vision; Crops; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Air-borne sensors; Classification performance; Crop identification; Earth observations; Land cover classification; Multispectral satellite image; Public authorities; Temporal characteristics; Long short-term memory","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030215639"

The objective of this study was to diagnose and quantity the loss ot the native vegetation and its impacts on the landscape and reservoir occurred between 1984 and 2017, through digital processing and multi-temporal analysis of satellite images. In 1984 the region had 50.27% of Cerrado biome and after 10 years, was reduced to 9.25% reaching 18.23% in 2017. The results indicated that during the process of construction of the dam a significant withdrawal of native vegetation occurred, justifying the creation of the APA.

The study employed normal image classification, and developing models from ECe vs NDSI and thematic layers to map soil salinity, using geospatial tools. Multi-temporal Landsat TM images of 1984, 1995 and 2010 were used to detect salinity affected areas in the study area. Results of the study revealed that around 6 ha of the area gets moderately to strongly salinized per year. Empirical model developed from ECe vs NDSI of 2010 image using regression analysis revealed the coefficient of relation as 66%. The model was extended for the whole area, and revealed that 2.0% of the study area was strongly saline and 54.7% of the area was non-saline. Overlay model developed from water table, land form, land management type and land-cover has revealed that 11.2% of the study area was non-saline, whereas 47.2% and 3.0% was moderately and strongly saline, respectively. Validation of the models was made to test their predication capability and the overlay model has revealed better correlation coefficient of 67.3% to the measured ECe. Most of the salt affected areas were on shallow water table. Cambisols and fluvisols were greatly affected by salinity.

Kalinga monument in Dehradun, old cemetery in Roorkee) in Uttarakhand which are located in diverse geographic and economic conditions with different religious backgrounds. Multi-temporal high resolution satellite images viz., Landsat ETM+ (2000-2001), Cartosat-1 & LISS IV (2009-10) and other ancillary data have been used to monitor the development/expansion around the heritage sites within a specific buffer area encompassing its management zones viz., prohibited and regulated boundary. Landuse / Landcover (LU/LC) change analysis indicated changes in vegetation and built-up area categories, especially in the sites located within a city/town viz., Dehradun and Kashipur as compared to others located in remote areas, providing an important input for authorities for effective management. Evaluation of the tourism potential of these sites has been carried out to suggest planning strategies for overall area improvement including economic development. The tourism potential of the sites have been evaluated based on physical, social, and environmental parameters using weighted ranking method, a popular multi-criteria decision making tool. Based on the total tourist potential scores, the sites have been classified into four categories very high, high, medium and low potential and the planning strategies for improvement has been worked out. The methodology adopted in the study for monitoring can be extended to other nationally important monuments in Uttarakhand region for efficient management and conservation. The weighted ranking approach can be used to prepare a tourism developmental plan for improving the tourist inflows for other important heritage sites and monuments.

In this paper, a new automatic RRN method was developed based on regression theory comprising the following techniques: Automatic detection of unchanged pixels, Histogram modeling of subject images, and Calculation of linear transformation coefficients for various categories of pixels according to their gray values in each band. The proposed method applies a new idea for unchanged pixels selection which increases the accuracy and automation level of the detection process. Also, a new idea is proposed for categorizing pixels according to their gray values. In this method, the number and interval of the categories are determined automatically and independently based on the histogram of subject images for each band. Thus, divergent influences of effective parameters such as atmosphere on different gray values are modeled. The method was implemented on two images taken by the TM sensor. Normalization results acquired by the proposed method were compared with the six conventional methods including: histogram matching, haze correction, minimum-maximum, mean-standard deviation, simple regression, no-change and modified regression using unchanged pixels. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in the automatic detection of unchanged pixels and minimizing any imaging condition effects (i.e., atmosphere and other effective parameters). © 2015, SBMAC - Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.","Graphic methods; Linear transformations; Radiometry; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; Automatic Detection; Automatic relative radiometric normalization; Effective parameters; Grey values; Histogram models; Multi-temporal satellite images; Regression; Relative radiometric normalization; Thresholding; Unchanged pixels; Pixels","Automatic relative radiometric normalization; Histogram modeling; Multi-temporal satellite images; Regression; Thresholding","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018262495"

For most historical experiments, the associated atmospheric properties may be difficult to obtain even for planned acquisitions. Relative normalization is an alternative method whenever absolute reflectance properties are not required. The key to relative normalization is the selection of pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) in an image. PIFs of a bi-temporal image is a group of pixels which are statistically nearly-constant over the period of the bi-temporal image acquisitions. Several methods, such as manual selection, histogram matching, and principal component analysis, had been proposed for PIFs extraction. Yet, a change in pixel’s spectral signature before and after normalization, called spectral inconsistency, is detected whenever those PIFs extraction methods, associated with a regression process, are performed. To overcome this shortcoming, the commonly used PIFs selection, called multivariate alteration detection (MAD), is utilized as it considers the relationship among bands. Further, a constrained regression is adopted to enforce the normalized pixel’s spectral signature to be consistent as possible. This approach is applied to multi-temporal Landsat-8 imageries. Moreover, spectral distance and similarities are utilized for evaluating the consistency of the normalized pixel’s spectral signature. © 2017 ACRS.

Moreover, satellite images acquired from different sensors contain not only the uncertainties but also disparate relative spectral response. Given that radiometric calibration and correction of satellite images are difficult without ground measurements during data acquisition, this study addresses pseudoinvariant feature selection for relative radiometric normalization (RRN) that minimizes the radiometric differences among images caused by atmospheric and spectral band inconsistencies during data acquisition. The key to a successful RRN is the selection of pseudoinvariant features (PIFs) among bitemporal images. To select PIFs, multivariate alteration detection (MAD) algorithm is adopted with kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) instead of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). KCCA, which assumes that the relation between at-sensor radiance is spatially nonlinear, can obtain more appropriate PIFs for cross-sensor images than that of CCA, which assumes that the relation between the at-sensor radiances of bitemporal image is spatially linear. In addition, a regularization term is added to the optimization of KCCA to avoid trivial solutions and overfitting. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on bitemporal images acquired by Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus and Landsat-8 operational and imager sensors were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed KCCA-based MAD to the CCA-based MAD in terms of PIF selection, particularly for images containing significant cloud covers. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Correlation methods; Data acquisition; Feature extraction; Image acquisition; Multivariant analysis; Radiometry; Satellites; Alteration detections; Canonical correlation analysis; Kernel canonical correlation analysis; Multi-temporal satellite images; Pseudo-invariant features; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Relative radiometric normalization; Relative spectral response; Image enhancement","cross-sensor relative radiometric normalization; kernel canonical correlation analysis; multivariate alteration detection; pseudoinvariant feature selection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054958835"

Land cover changes were determined using four satellite images from 1986, 1992, 2002 and 2016. The results indicate that from 1986 to 2016 croplands and pasture increased by approximately 33,483 ha, but the most important change for croplands and pasture occurred between 2002 and 2016 with an increase of 31,607 ha; mixed forest land class occupied 16.49% in 1986, but an increase in the period from 1986 to 1992 reached 18.69% and decreased to 13.30% and 11.76% for 2002 and 2016, respectively. For the mixed rangeland covering 61.26% of the aquifer area, the major land cover in 1986 decreased substantially in 2016 reaching only 17.09% of total area. It was identified that the sites with a high recharge potential are located in the east and central-southeast and the medium recharge potential sites are located in the central part while the low potential sites are distributed to the north and southwest side of the aquifer. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","","GIS; Image classification; Land cover/land use; Multi-temporal analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020854523"

In this paper, aiming at the geometric features of optical satellite image, based on a widely used optimization method of constraint problem which is called Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and RFM least-squares block adjustment, we propose a GCP independent block adjustment method for the large-scale domestic high resolution optical satellite image - GISIBA (GCP-Independent Satellite Imagery Block Adjustment), which is easy to parallelize and highly efficient. In this method, the virtual ""average"" control points are built to solve the rank defect problem and qualitative and quantitative analysis in block adjustment without control. The test results prove that the horizontal and vertical accuracy of multi-covered and multi-temporal satellite images are better than 10m and 6m. Meanwhile the mosaic problem of the adjacent areas in large area DOM production can be solved if the public geographic information data is introduced as horizontal and vertical constraints in the block adjustment process. Finally, through the experiments by using GF-1 and ZY-3 satellite images over several typical test areas, the reliability, accuracy and performance of our developed procedure will be presented and studied in this paper. © Authors 2018.

In this study, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was selected for analysis on regional application potential of multiphase OLI data. In order to objectively obtain Ningxia rice area spatial distribution information, to lay a technical foundation for regional crop remote sensing monitoring, and according to the principle of spectral consistency, this paper divided the study area into 6 ground types of rice, sparse forest and shrub, dry land/woodland, abandoned land, wetland/water bodies, and others. The period before July 10, 2016 was taken as the early stage of rice growth. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), infrared reflectance (IR) and short waved index (SWI) were established by choosing the data of OLI carried by US LandSat-8 and using the images taken in the 6 periods of March 11th, April 12th, April 28th, May 30th, June 15th and July 1st. Based on the analysis of dynamic change of 3 indexes of NDVI, IR and SWI, especially on maximum NDVI, minimal IR, and minimal SWI, a decision tree was established, and the identification of rice types in the study area was conducted by using images between March 11 and July 1 of 2016. The basic processes of decision tree classification were: firstly the ground objects such as cities and towns and deserts were eliminated by using maximum NDVI from March to June; the sparse forest and shrubs were eliminated by using maximum NDVI from March to April; the dry land/woodlands were eliminated by using minimum IR from May to June; then wetland/water bodies were eliminated by using minimum IR from March to April; finally, the abandoned lands were eliminated by using minimum SWI from May to June. The remaining pixels were taken as rice. The accuracy verification was conducted by using the highly accurate GF-2 remote sensing (the resolution was 4 m) survey results of rice area background of this region. The extraction accuracy of GF-2 was as high as 99% above. The results showed that the planting area by GF-2 was 91 910 hm2 and the rice planting area was 88 030 hm2 by the OLI data. The total extraction error was only -4.22% with the Kappa coefficient of 0.83; the user's classification accuracy of rice spatial distribution was 85.11% with the mapping accuracy of 81.67%. Among the total rice area, the area in Pingluo, Helan, Yingchuan, Qingtunxia, Lingwu, Shapotou, Litong, Yongning, Zhongning, Dawukou and Huinong accounted for 27.71%, 16.76%, 13.69%, 11.87%, 9.93%, 6.72%, 5.34%, 3.27%, 2.24%, 1.60% and 0.87%, respectively. The rice was mostly distributed in the north of Yellow River Irrigation Area. The extraction area based on different phases was different. The rice area proportion of 129/033, 129/034 and 130/034 images was 60.41%, 32.88% and 6.71%, respectively. Compared with the user's accuracy of maximum likelihood supervised classification algorithm on the rice area extraction of 76.98% and the mapping accuracy of 61.66% in this area, the method used in this paper showed an increase of 8.13 percentage points in the user's accuracy, and an increase of even 20.01 percentage points in the mapping accuracy. The result shows that, the method proposed here of establishment of decision classifying tree by using the satellite images of early stage OLI remote sensing time series of rice growth before July 10, and based on the analysis of changing pattern of time series of staple crops can accurately extract the staple crop planting area, and it is a potential method for regional crop area remote sensing monitoring operations. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Then the waterline detection method (WDM) has the potential to investigate the morph-dynamics quantitatively by utilizing large archives of satellite images. The study explores the potential for using WDM with BJ-1 small satellite images to construct a digital elevation model (DEM) of a wide and grading mudflat. Three major conclusions of the study are as follows: (1) A new intelligent correlating model of waterline detection considering different tidal stages and local geographic conditions was explored. With this correlative algorithm waterline detection model, a series of waterlines were extracted from multi-temporal remotely sensing images collected over the period of a year. The model proved to detect waterlines more efficiently and exactly. (2)The spatial structure of elevation superimposing on the points of waterlines was firstly constructed and a more accurate hydrodynamic ocean tide grid model was used. By the newly constructed abnormal hydrology evaluation model, a more reasonable and reliable set of waterline points was acquired to construct a smoother TIN and GRID DEM. (3) DEM maps of Bohai Bay, with a spatial resolution of about 30 m and height accuracy of about 0.35m considering LiDAR and 0.19m considering RTK surveying were constructed over an area of about 266km2. Results show that remote sensing research in extremely turbid estuaries and tidal areas is possible and is an effective tool for monitoring the tidal flats. © Authors 2018.

Accurate detection of clouds and cloud shadows can help exclude these contaminated pixels in further applications. Existing cloud screening methods are challenged by cloudy regions where most of satellite images are contaminated by clouds. To solve this problem for landscapes where the typical frequency of cloud-free observations of a pixel is too small to use existing methods to mask clouds and shadows, this study presents a new Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA) method to screen clouds and cloud shadows in multi-temporal optical images. ATSA has five main steps: (1) calculate cloud and shadow indices to highlight cloud and cloud shadow information; (2) obtain initial cloud mask by unsupervised classifiers; (3) refine initial cloud mask by analyzing time series of a cloud index; (4) predict the potential shadow mask using geometric relationships; and (5) refine the potential shadow mask by analyzing time series of a shadow index. Compared with existing methods, ATSA needs fewer predefined parameters, does not require a thermal infrared band, and is more suitable for areas with persistent clouds. The performance of ATSA was tested with Landsat-8 OLI images, Landsat-4 MSS images, and Sentinel-2 images in three sites. The results were compared with a popular method, Function of Mask (Fmask), which has been adopted by USGS to produce Landsat cloud masks. These tests show that ATSA and Fmask can get comparable cloud and shadow masks in some of the tested images. However, ATSA can consistently obtain high accuracy in all images, while Fmask has large omission or commission errors in some images. The quantitative accuracy was assessed using manual cloud masks of 15 images. The average cloud producer's accuracy of these 15 images is as high as 0.959 and the average shadow producer's accuracy reaches 0.901. Given that it can be applied to old satellite sensors and it is capable for cloudy regions, ATSA is a valuable supplement to the existing cloud screening methods. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Geometrical optics; Masks; Pixels; Satellites; Time series; Cloud detection; Cloud shadows; Geometric relationships; Optical satellite images; Quantitative accuracy; Satellite images; Satellite sensors; Thermal infrared bands; accuracy assessment; algorithm; detection method; Landsat; numerical method; pixel; satellite imagery; satellite sensor; Sentinel; time series; Time series analysis","Cloud detection; Cloud shadow; Mask; Optical satellite images; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047476197"

In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013–2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters. © 2017 The Authors","Adriatic Sea; Italy; Italy; Mediterranean Sea; Po River; delta; discharge; Landsat; satellite imagery; sea surface temperature; sediment transport; spatiotemporal analysis; turbidity; water quality","Prodelta area; Sediment dispersion; Spatial pattern; SST; Turbidity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062804356"

This study investigates land use variations in the arid region with the help of multi-temporal images. Land use maps were employed for analysis of different classes using image classification tools in ArcGIS software. Multispectral satellite imagery data were used to create land cover variation maps and land use forecast maps for the study area. The land use classification change maps were produced from LISS-III satellite images and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (2008 and 2015) using supervised classification techniques. Land use was divided into five major classes, i.e. agricultural land, developed land, wasteland, water bodies, and forestland. We observed significant changes in agricultural and forestland as a result of many factors including population growth, drought conditions, road infrastructure development, flooding, and soil erosion in the arid area. The overall accuracy of the supervised classification was 94.10% for 2008 and 88.14% for 2015, using the kappa method, which was a satisfactory result.

Therefore, researchers have focused on detection of land cover–land use changes (LCLUC) with respect to monitoring and mitigating the potential soil erosion. This article aims to appraise the relationship between LCLUC and soil erosion in the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia) by using multitemporal satellite images and ancillary data. Land clearing and heavy rainfall events in the study area has resulted in increased soil loss. Moreover, unsustainable development and agricultural practices, mismanagement, and lack of land use policies increase the soil erosion rate. Hence, the main contribution of this study lies in the application of appropriate land management practices in relation to water erosion through identification and prediction of the impacts of LCLUC on the spatial distribution of potential soil loss in a region susceptible to natural hazards such as landslide. The LCLUC distribution within the study area was mapped for 2005, 2010, and 2015 by using SPOT-5 temporal satellite imagery and object-based image classification. A projected land cover–land use map was also produced for 2025 through integration of Markov chain and cellular automata models. An empirical-based approach (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) coupled with geographic information system was applied to measure soil loss and susceptibility to erosion over the study area for four periods (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2025). The model comprises five parameters, namely, rainfall factor, soil erodibility, topographical factor, conservation factor, and support practice factor. Results exhibited that the average amount of soil loss increased by 31.77 t ha−1 yr−1 from 2005 to 2015 and was predicted to dramatically increase in 2025. The results generated from this research recommends that awareness of spatial and temporal patterns of high soil loss risk areas can help deploy site-specific soil conservation measures and erosion mitigation processes and prevent unsystematic deforestation and urbanization by the authorities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cameron Highlands; Malaysia; Pahang; West Malaysia; Catchments; Deforestation; Erosion; Geographic information systems; Land use; Markov processes; Rain; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Satellite imagery; Sediment transport; Soils; Tropics; Cameron highlands; Land management practices; LCLUC; Multi-temporal satellite images; Object-based image classification; Revised universal soil loss equations; Soil loss; Spatial and temporal patterns; catchment; erosion rate; GIS; land cover; land degradation; land use change; remote sensing; Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation; satellite imagery; soil conservation; soil erosion; SPOT; tropical region; Soil conservation","Cameron Highlands; GIS; LCLUC; remote sensing; soil loss estimation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051729518"

A comprehensive accuracy assessment of the GLCF dataset was performed using a global, design-based sample of 27,988 independent, visually interpreted reference points collected through a two-stage, stratified sampling design wherein experts visually identified forest cover and change in each of the 3 epochs based on Landsat and high-resolution satellite images, vegetation index profiles, and field photos. Consistent across epochs, the overall accuracy of the static forest-cover layers was 91%, and the overall accuracy of forest-cover change was >88% -among the highest accuracies reported for recent global forest- and land-cover data products. Both commission error (CE) and omission error (OE) were low for static forest cover in each epoch and for the stable classes between epochs (CE < 3%, OE < 22%), but errors were larger for forest loss (45% ≤ CE < 62%, 47% < OE < 55%) and gain (66% ≤ CE < 85%, 61% < OE < 84%). Accuracy was lower in sparse forests and savannahs, i.e., where tree cover was at or near the 30% threshold used to discriminate forest from non-forest cover. Discrimination of forest had a low rate of commission error and slight negative bias, especially in areas with low tree cover. After adjusting global area estimates to reference data, 39.28 ± 1.34 million km2 and 38.81 ± 1.34 million km2 of forest were respectively identified in 2000 and 2005 globally, and 33.16 ± 1.36 million km2 of forest were estimated in the available coverage of Landsat data circa-1990. Forest loss and gain were estimated to have been 0.73 ± 0.38 and 0.28 ± 0.26 million km2 between 2000 and 2005, and 1.08 ± 0.53 and 0.53 ± 0.47 million km2 between 1990 and 2000. These estimates of accuracy are required for rigorous use of the data in the Earth sciences (e.g., ecology, economics, hydrology, climatology) as well as for fusion with other records of global change.

Analysis of multi-temporal satellite images and digital elevation models have revealed impressive details about the related changes (e.g., in glacier length, surface elevation and flow velocities) and considerably expanded the database of known surge-type glaciers. One glacier that has so far only been reported as impacted by surging tributaries, rather than surging itself, is the 50 km long main trunk of Hispar Glacier in the Hunza catchment. We here present the evolution of flow velocities and surface features from its 2015/16 surge as revealed from a dense time series of SAR and optical images along with an analysis of historic satellite images. We observed maximum flow velocities of up to 14 m d-1 (5 km a-1) in spring 2015, sudden drops in summer velocities, a second increase in winter 2015/16 and a total advance of the surge front of about 6 km. During a few months the surge front velocity was much higher (about 90 m d-1) than the maximum flow velocity. We assume that one of its northern tributary glaciers, Yutmaru, initiated the surge at the end of summer 2014 and that the variability in flow velocities was driven by changes in the basal hydrologic regime (Alaska-type surge). We further provide evidence that Hispar Glacier has surged before (around 1960) over a distance of about 10 km so that it can also be regarded as a surge-type glacier. © 2017 by the authors.

The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km2. The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the ‘true’ but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; C (programming language); Correlation methods; Data mining; Decision making; Filtration; Image enhancement; Land use; Mapping; Precision agriculture; Principal component analysis; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil surveys; Soils; Time series; Time series analysis; Bare soils; Digital mapping; Environment; LANDSAT; Satellite images; Soil monitoring; Topsoil; bare soil; data mining; database; digital mapping; geological mapping; infrared spectroscopy; Landsat; monitoring; pixel; precision agriculture; principal component analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; soil property; spatial analysis; topsoil; Soil conservation","Bare soil; Data mining; Digital mapping; Environment; Landsat; Precision agriculture; Satellite image; Soil monitoring; Soil security; Topsoil; VIS-NIR-SWIR spectroscopy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046680251"

It uses both spatial and spectral information on landslides, through spectral analysis, shape analysis, textural measurements using a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and fuzzy logic membership functionality. Following an initial segmentation step, particular combinations of various information layers were investigated to generate objects. This was achieved by applying multi-resolution segmentation to IRS-1D, SPOT-5, and ALOS satellite imagery in sequential steps of feature selection and object classification, and using slope and flow direction derivatives from a digital elevation model together with topographically-oriented gray level co-occurrence matrices. Fuzzy membership values were calculated for 11 different membership functions using 20 landslide objects from a landslide training data. Six fuzzy operators were used for the final classification and the accuracies of the resulting landslide maps were compared. A Fuzzy Synthetic Evaluation (FSE) approach was adapted for validation of the results and for an accuracy assessment using the landslide inventory database. The FSE approach revealed that the AND operator performed best with an accuracy of 93.87% for 2005 and 94.74% for 2011, closely followed by the MEAN Arithmetic operator, while the OR and AND (*) operators yielded relatively low accuracies. An object-based change detection was then applied to monitor landslide-related changes that occurred in northern Iran between 2005 and 2011. Knowledge rules to detect possible landslide-related changes were developed by evaluating all possible landslide-related objects for both time steps. © 2017 The Authors","Iran; ALOS; detection method; digital elevation model; environmental monitoring; fuzzy mathematics; image analysis; image classification; IRS (satellite); landslide; satellite imagery; segmentation; SPOT","Change detection; Environmental monitoring; Fuzzy rule based classification; Iran; Landslide delineation; Object-based image analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020829359"

Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) is the land subsidence measurement method by using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and it can accurately measure wide range of land subsidence. However, the estimated displacement is obtained only along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Therefore, it is expected to develop a method for measuring three dimensional (3D) displacements by combining multi-directional observation. In this work, we examine the fusion of the displacement results from SAR images observed on ascending- and descending-orbits. First, we estimate the displacement from the ascending- and descending-orbit SAR images, individually. Then, the vertical and horizontal land subsidence components are estimated from the two results. In experiments, we selected Kansai International Airport, located in the western Japan, as a study area because it is reported to show both vertical and horizontal displacements. We used 24 ALOS-PALSAR ascending images from 2006 to 2010 and 14 ALOS-PALSAR descending images from 2006 to 2010. We compared with the annual leveling data the vertical displacement estimated from the ascending-descending combination. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the velocities by ascending-descending combination analysis was 0.015 m/year. Further investigation is necessary to match pixels that represent the identical location among ascending- and descending- orbit SAR images, and to validate the estimated horizontal displacement. © 2017 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

In many situations, change detection techniques aids in detecting such changes being taking place. The changes can be noticed from different kinds of low- and high-resolution satellite images of multi-spectral and multi-temporal images. There are different kinds of change detection techniques to observe changes in the images, like principal component analysis method, spectral change vector analysis, post-classification method, kernel method, etc. Machine learning (post-classification) method based change detection provides better accuracy, because these methods are based on pixel comparison in multi-temporal satellite images. The change detection accuracy depends on the classifier used for classification of multi-temporal images. Any misclassification in either images leads to poor detection in change, hence classifier selection is very important in this case. In the recent past, the performance of classification techniques is improved by combining the advantages of some of the classifiers as ensemble methods. In this work, ensemble based classifier is explored for images classification. Different parameters are considered to estimate the performance of ensemble based classifier. Finally, the changed pixels in two temporal images are observed and listed. The images are also shown in zoomed for easy observation of changes in the images. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

So, it is imperative to study the effect of the industrial activities on the changes in temperatures especially in an arid area where such studies are limited. The objective of this study is to decipher the spatiotemporal variations in the temperatures of different land use/land cover types in Yanbu industrial city. Thermal bands of Landsat satellite images were used in the study. Multi-temporal images that spread over a period of 25 years between 1990 and 2015 were used to extract the land surface temperatures of the study area. Different land use/land cover categories in the study area were identified from IKONOS false color composite image (2012), and a correlation was sought out, between vegetationand surface temperature, using a vegetation index (NDVI). Normalized difference build index (NDBI) was derived in order to analyze the relationship between surface temperature and imperviousness. The results depict the thermal regimes of the area in different LULC types and their variations over time. The NDVI has an inverse relation with temperature whereas the NDBI has a positive relationship with the surface temperature, only in the residential and conservation areas.

The study is based on data collected over 32 fields of wheat distributed over a study area located in southwestern France, near Toulouse. Among the tested sensor configurations, several satellite data appear useful for the yield forecasting throughout the agricultural season (showing coefficient of determination (R2) larger than 0.60 and a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 9.1 quintals by hectare (q ha−1)): CVH, CHV, or the combined used of XHH and CHH, CHH and CHV, or green reflectance and CHH.

Ground surface change challenges feature point detection in amount and quality, which is a common dilemma faced by feature-based registration algorithms. Under severe appearance variation, detected feature points may contain a large proportion of outliers, whereas inliers may be inadequate and unevenly distributed. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature-based multi-temporal remote sensing image registration method with two key contributions: (i) we use a CNN to generate robust multi-scale feature descriptors and (ii) we design a gradually increasing selection of inliers to improve the robustness of feature point registration.

Conventionally, the monitoring of abandoned oil palm lands is tedious and time consuming, especially over large areas. Hence, in this article, the capability of high resolution satellite image via Satellite Pour I’Observation de la Terre-6 (SPOT-6) products to extract abandoned oil palm areas was explored, as was the use of multi-temporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery to develop the phenology of abandoned oil palm sites. Homogeneity measures derived through SPOT images played a more important role to identify abandoned oil palm than crop phenology characteristics extracted from high spectral resolution of Landsat images.

Furthermore, they constitute a natural water reservoir that can buffer the impact of meteorological droughts seasons on socioeconomic activities in the region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC (2013)) has concluded that glaciers have clearly shrunk at global scale. Nevertheless there is a need to quantify variations at a local-to-regional scale. In this interdisciplinary work we make use of the Geographic Information System tool in a climatic study with the purpose of visualizing spatial and temporal changes in glaciers’ extension through a multi-temporal analysis of satellite images in the period 1989–2015. Two glaciers in the Subtropical Central Andes region were selected: Alto del Plomo glacier (32.98°S–70.01°W) in the Plomo river basin and Volcán Maipo glacier (34.16°S–69.8°W). The accumulation zones for both glaciers are found at similar altitudes and distant only by less than 130 km, but they have different morphological characteristics and the Volcán Maipo glacier is located within a protected area in the natural reserve of Laguna del Diamante. The results of the analysis indicate a decrease in the total area (18%) of Alto del Plomo glacier that is especially evident in its glacier tongue. In contrast, the Volcán Maipo glacier presented almost no change in the 27-year period considered. The climate factors, temperature and nival precipitation, that affect the evolution of the areal extent of the glaciers do not seem to fully explain the different behavior seen in these two glaciers. It is suggested here that the environmental factors that surround them might explain the observed behavior. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","","Geographical Information System (GIS); Glaciers; Landsat; Snowfall trends; Subtropical Central Andes; Temperature trends","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034219026"

However, collecting this information over large areas is inherently costly. This paper investigates the possibility of applying multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite images to detect heavy metal-induced stress (i.e., Cd stress) in rice crops in four study areas in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. For this purpose, we compared seven Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 with in situ measured hyper-spectral data, chlorophyll content, rice leaf area index, and heavy metal concentrations in soil collected from 2014 to 2017. Vegetation indices (VIs) related to red edge bands were referred to as the sensitive indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice. The coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from the VIs allowed us to discriminate crops exposed to pollution from heavy metals as well as environmental stressors. The results indicate that (i) the red edge chlorophyll index, the red edge position index, and the normalized difference red edge 2 index derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images were good indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice; (ii) Rice under Cd stress remained stable with lower CSTV values of VIs overall growth stages in the experimental region, whereas rice under other stressors (i.e., pests and disease) showed abrupt changes at some growth stages and presented “hot spots” with greater CSTV values; and (iii) the proposed spatio-temporal anomaly detection method was successful at detecting rice under Cd stress; and CSTVs of rice VIs stabilized regardless of whether they were applied to consecutive growth stages or to two different crop years. This study suggests that regional heavy metal stress may be accurately detected using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images, using VIs sensitive to the spatio-temporal characteristics of crops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Metals, Heavy; Oryza; Satellite Imagery; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Stress, Physiological; China; Hunan; Zhuzhou [Hunan]; Chlorophyll; Crops; Diagnosis; Food supply; Forestry; Heavy metals; Plants (botany); Pollution; cadmium; chlorophyll; heavy metal; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Environmental stressors; Heavy metal concentration; Heavy metal pollution; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal characteristics; agricultural ecosystem; concentration (composition); crop production; food security; heavy metal; pollution effect; rice; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; Article; China; chlorophyll content; controlled study; leaf area; nonhuman; plant growth; plant stress; priority journal; rice; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; telecommunication; crop; drug effect; environmental monitoring; human; Oryza; physiological stress; physiology; procedures; satellite imagery; soil; soil pollutant; toxicity; Chemical contamination","Abrupt stress; Heavy metal pollution; Sentinel-2 images; Spatio-temporal anomaly detection; Stable stress","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046810051"

The accuracy of relative normalization depends on the quality of selected Pseudo Invariant Features (PIFs). PIFs represent the ground objects whose reflectance are constant during a period of time. In previous study, an algorithm, called Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD), was applied to statistically select no-changed pixels within bi-temporal satellite images. However, MAD is sensitive to cloud covers and some clouds may be misclassified as PIFs. For this reason, Iteratively Reweighted MAD (IR-MAD) was introduced to establish an increasingly better no-changed background using iterative scheme. Nonetheless, both MAD and IR-MAD only compute the linear combinations for bi-temporal images, and not applicable for multitemporal images with more than two images. In this study, a novel method called Weighted Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (WGCCA) is proposed for the selection of high-quality PIFs in multitemporal and multispectral images, which solves coefficients for the correlations of not only multivariable data but also multitemporal data. Specifically, the proposed method integrates the strengths of Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) and IR-MAD, and PIFs extraction from a sequence of satellite images is performed at the same time, which leads to a consistent feature extraction. Furthermore, when the high-quality PIFs are determined by the proposed method, the digital numbers of PIFs from multitemporal images are transformed into a predefined radiometric reference level. With this approach, the radiometric resolution of multitemporal images can be preserved, and a better radiometric normalization can be obtained. In experiment, SPOT-5 imagery was tested. Compared with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) which is used in MAD, the proposed method can discriminate no-changed pixels from changed more precisely.

Previous studies have reported abnormal behaviors of the glaciers in this region compared to the global trend of glacier retreat, so the region is of special interest for glacier-climatological studies. For this purpose, long-term monitoring of glaciers in this region is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the relationships between glacier changes and local climate variations. However, accurate historical and up-to-date glacier inventory data for the region are currently unavailable. For this reason, this study conducted glacier inventories for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2014 (i.e., a ~10-year interval) using multi-temporal remote sensing imagery. The remote sensing data used included Corona KH-4A/B (1965-1971), Hexagon KH-9 (1980), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) (1990/1993), Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) (2000/2001), and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) (2014/2015) multispectral satellite images, as well as digital elevation models (DEMs) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), DEMs generated from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images (2005-2014), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)World 3D 30 m mesh (AW3D30). In the year 2014, a total of 173 glaciers (including 121 debris-free glaciers) (> 0.5 km2), covering an area of 1478 ± 34 km2 (area of debris-free glaciers: 295 ± 7 km2) were mapped. The multi-temporal glacier inventory results indicated that total glacier area change between 1970-2014 was not significant. However, individual glacier changes showed significant variability. Comparisons of the changes in glacier terminus position indicated that 55 (32 debris-covered) glaciers experienced significant advances (~40-1400 m) between 1970-2014, and 74 (32 debris-covered) glaciers experienced significant advances (~40-1400 m) during the most recent period (2000-2014). Notably, small glaciers showed higher sensitivity to climate changes, and the glaciers located in the western part of the study site were exhibiting glacier area expansion compared to other parts of the Shaksgam Valley. Finally, regression analyses indicated that topographic parameters were not the main driver of glacier changes. On the contrary, local climate variability could explain the complex behavior of glaciers in this region. © 2018 by the authors.","Debris; Image enhancement; Infrared detectors; Landforms; Metamorphic rocks; Radar reflection; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Tracking radar; Corona; Glacier inventory; Hexagon; Karakoram; LANDSAT; Landsat TM/ETM; Shaksgam Valley; Climate change","Corona; Glacier Inventory; Hexagon; Karakoram; Landsat OLI/TIRS; Landsat TM/ETM+; Shaksgam Valley","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051674032"

Among the natural factors of soil salinization, parent materials including high amount of salts and minerals in soil structure, known as primary salinization, can be addressed. Conventional irrigation techniques and poor drainage systems are predominant human-induced activities that result in secondary salinization. Countries with especially dryland environment, face difficulty in providing adequate food for their rapidly increasing population since each year lots of cultivated land are abandoned due to adverse effects of primary and secondary soil salinization. Therefore, monitoring, mapping and predicting soil salinization is of utmost importance regarding lessening and/or preventing further increase in soil salinity through some protective measures. The subject of concern becomes even more pronounced particularly in agricultural lands as is the case in the vicinity of Tuz (Salt) Lake Region in Turkey. This research focuses mainly on multi-temporal monitoring of Tuz Lake Region in order to track changes in areas of salty spots in years 1990, 2002, 2006, 2011 and 2015. A total number of 25 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 images obtained between 1990 and 2015 were analysed in this study. Field electrical conductivity (EC) measurements for 322 soil samples in year 2002 were checked; and 28 of these samples were selected for generating salinity maps representing areas in the vicinity of the lake. All satellite images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected prior to classification. Following the pre-processing step, five soil salinity indices were applied on all satellite images. 28 soil samples were then overlaid on images in order to extract the exact index values related to soil samples and regression approach was used to relate satellite image-derived salinity indices and field measurements. Linear and exponential regression analyses were conducted separately as the next step for all indices based on data gathered in 2002. Salinity index (SI) 1 = B1*B3 showed the best result with R2 value of 0.93 and 0.83 for exponential and linear regression analysis, respectively. Salinity maps for years 1990, 2006, 2011 and 2015 were further produced utilizing the exponential and linear regression expressions attained for year 2002. Besides, this study detected land cover changes in the area from year 2000–2006, and from 2006 to 2012 by using CORINE land cover data to analyse the possible relationships between land cover change and salinity changes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Turkey; Tuz Lake; Agriculture; Image processing; Lakes; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Saline water; Satellites; Soils; Arid and semi-arid regions; Electrical conductivity; Exponential regression; Regression expressions; Remote sensing technology; Salinity indices; Soil salinity; Turkey; agriculture; electrical conductivity; environmental monitoring; index method; land cover; Landsat thematic mapper; regression analysis; remote sensing; saline soil; salinity; salinization; satellite imagery; Soil surveys","Agriculture; Remote sensing; Salinity indices; Soil salinity; Turkey; Tuz lake","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85003811054"

However, applying well-known matching methods, such as scale-invariant feature transform and speeded up robust features for VHR multi-temporal images, has limitations. First, they cannot be used for matching an optical image to heterogeneous non-optical data for georegistration. Second, they produce a local misalignment induced by differences in acquisition conditions, such as acquisition platform stability, the sensor’s off-nadir angle, and relief displacement of the considered scene. Therefore, this study addresses the problem by proposing an automated geo/co-registration framework for full-scene multi-temporal images acquired from a VHR optical satellite sensor. The proposed method comprises two primary steps: (1) a global georegistration process, followed by (2) a fine co-registration process. During the first step, two-dimensional multi-temporal satellite images are matched to three-dimensional topographic maps to assign the map coordinates. During the second step, a local analysis of registration noise pixels extracted between the multi-temporal images that have been mapped to the map coordinates is conducted to extract a large number of well-distributed corresponding points (CPs). The CPs are finally used to construct a non-rigid transformation function that enables minimization of the local misalignment existing among the images.

Yet their role in changing the relief is local, incomparable in the volume of the removed deposits to other destructive cryogenic processes. However, the relief-forming role of GECs is not limited to the appearance of the crater itself, but also results in positive and negative microforms as well. Negative microforms are rounded hollows, surrounded by piles of ejected or extruded deposits. Hypotheses related to the origin of these forms are put forward and supported by an analysis of multi-temporal satellite images, field observations and photographs of GECs. Remote sensing data specifically was used for interpretation of landform origin, measuring distances and density of material scattering, identifying scattered material through analysis of repeated imagery. Remote-sensing and field data reliably substantiate an impact nature of the hollows around GECs. It is found that scattering of frozen blocks at a distance of up to 293 m from a GEC is capable of creating an impact hollow. These data indicate the influence of GEC on the relief through the formation of a microrelief within a radius of 15-20 times the radius of the crater itself.

Analysis of multi-temporal images showed that the selected reach of the Padma River has undergone significant morphological changes since 1973. The mean width of the river has almost doubled, having increased from 5458 m in 1973 to 10,638 m in 2014. Bank erosion, totalling 281 km2, was more than double the accretion (123 km2), and the left bank experienced higher levels of erosion than the right bank. Analysis of the stratigraphy of the bar head, middle and tail sections revealed that erosion occurred in the head section, but that the middle section seemed to be stable, whereas accretion was estimated to be high in the tail section of the bar. Sedimentary facies analysis indicated that bar evolution is largely influenced by the variation of both water and sediment flows, as bar areas tend to accrete substantially following large floods. However, the erosion–accretion process of both bars and river banks appeared to be stable during the periods when the river experiences no major flooding. The relationship between bank erosion and bar area expansion showed a moderately positive correlation (r2 = 0.64, p = 0.016), while a strong correlation was observed (r2 = 0.80; p = 0.008) between channel width and area of the bar, suggesting that river width is highly influenced by bank erosion. This implies that the growth of bars within the reach is largely determined by materials flowing from bank failure.. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bangladesh; Ganges River; Nelumbo nucifera; Erosion; Floods; Stratigraphy; LANDSAT; Morphological changes; Multi-temporal image; Positive correlations; River channels; Sedimentary facies; Stratigraphic records; Strong correlation; bank erosion; bar; channel change; evolution; facies analysis; flood; flooding; landscape evolution; river bank; river channel; satellite data; satellite imagery; stratigraphy; Rivers","Bar formation; Landsat; Padma River; River channel; Stratigraphy","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041440869"

Over-exploitation of the groundwater substantially depletes the natural water table and has negative impacts on the water resource availability. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify the historical evolution of irrigated cropland for the post-monsoon (rabi) and summer cropping seasons in the Berambadi watershed (Area = 89 km2) of Kabini River basin, southern India. Approximately five-year interval irrigated area maps were generated using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite images for the period from 1990 to 2016. The potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM) was assessed to discriminate irrigated and non-irrigated croplands. Three indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Spatially distributed intensive ground observations were collected for training and validation of the SVM models. The irrigated and non-irrigated croplands were estimated with high classification accuracy (kappa coefficient greater than 0.9). At the watershed scale, this approach allowed highlighting the contrasted evolution of multiple-cropping (two successive crops in rabi and summer seasons that often imply dual irrigation) with a steady increase in the upstream and a recent decrease in the downstream of the watershed. Moreover, the multiple-cropping was found to be much more frequent in the valleys. These intensive practices were found to have significant impacts on the water resources, with a drastic decline in the water table level (more than 50 m). It also impacted the ecosystem: Groundwater level decline was more pronounced in the valleys and the rivers are no more fed by the base flow. © 2018 by the authors.","Agricultural machinery; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Image enhancement; Irrigation; Satellite imagery; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Watersheds; Classification accuracy; Enhanced vegetation index; Groundwater irrigation; Irrigated cropland; LANDSAT satellite images; Normalized difference moisture indices; Normalized difference vegetation index; Optical indices; Rivers","Groundwater irrigation; Irrigated cropland; Landsat satellite images; Optical indices; Support vector machine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048975449"

This work was carried out in the Alto Paraná Department, eastern Paraguay, South America.

In this study, we generate five new DEMs of the Mont-Blanc area from TanDEM-X interferometric pairs acquired in 2012/2013. We conducted a multitemporal analysis of the DEMs in comparison with two high-resolution DEMs obtained from Pléiades stereo satellite images in 2012 and 2013. A vertical precision of 1-3 m of the radar DEMs is estimated over ice and snow free areas and slopes less than 40°. DEM-derived elevation changes are compared with outputs of the snowpack model Crocus and snow accumulation measurements. The results show that at altitudes below ∼2500-m a.s.l., the radar penetration is negligible in our study area. The DEM-derived elevation changes agree, within uncertainty, with the modeled and field snow height. At higher altitudes, the comparison between the radar and optical DEMs acquired only a few weeks apart allows estimating the interferometric bias of the X-band DEM in the dry snowpack. At 4000-m a.s.l, it reaches 4 m on average in October and February. A geodetic glacier mass balance calculated using the October radar DEM would be biased.

The polygonal representation of the landslides allows for characterization of the landslide geometry and determination of further landslide attributes in a way that accounts for the diversity of conditions within the landslide, e.g., at the landslide main scarp opposed to its toe.

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum isnot suitable for detection and monitoring of flood during rainy season and clouds in the sky due to non-penetratingcapability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensorsin optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)Sensor is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surfacefrom the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and characterized by near all-weather/day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surfaceareas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in microwave spectrum and acts asspecular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from space borne SAR sensors resulting into darkpixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding area of earth surface. The change detection techniques using multitemporal SAR images based on the behavior of back-scattered signals for threshold value for detecting the floodbetween non-flooding and flooding period, and provide information related the status of water surface of river system.Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of space-borne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensorsdue its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the earth surface depending uponthe repeat orbit and SAR payloads on satellite. Space-borne SAR payloads can be placed in the orbit into fully active orsemi-active configuration based on both transmits and receives capability of signals.In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi-static space-borne SAR sensors has been described for developmentof real time space-borne SAR surveillance system for monitoring of various characteristics of river basins and detectionof flood using threshold/change detection techniques. Further, the concept for the development of constellation ofmulti-static SAR satellite imaging receiver in low earth orbit and geostationary radar illuminating system have beendescribed for real time surveillance of flood detection and management of flood detection, monitoring and disastermanagement. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018.

During the study period, the population increased by approximately 14-fold with about a 4-fold increase in built areas. Being in a hot, dry region with average rainfall of about 100 mm/year, the city did not invest in a comprehensive drainage infrastructure. As a result, the frequency, extent and risk associated with urban floods increased significantly. The expansion of built areas progressively increased the impervious land cover in the city, decreasing the minimum precipitation required to generate runoffby approximately 32% and significantly increasing the runoffcoefficient. In parallel to rapid urbanization, the urban rainwater harvesting potential significantly increased over 1976-2016. Urban flood maps were generated using three thematic factors: excess rain, land elevation and land slope. The flood maps were confirmed by locating urban flood locations in the field using GPS. This study demonstrates the impact of urbanization through assessing the relationship between urbanization, runoff, local floods and rainwater harvesting potential in Sharjah and provides a basis for developing sustainable urban storm water management practices for the city and similar cities. © 2018 by the authors.","Sharjah [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates; Floods; Harvesting; Storms; Urban growth; Water conservation; Water management; Flood mapping; Multi-temporal satellite images; Rain water harvesting; Storm-water managements; urbanization; arid region; flood; flooding; GPS; land cover; management practice; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; rainwater; runoff; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; suburbanization; urban area; urbanization; water management; Rain","Flood mapping; Multi-temporal satellite images; Storm water management; Urban rainwater harvesting; urbanization","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046850996"

The lake was drained by an artificial spillway within one month after the earthquake to minimize the potential dam-breach flooding risk. However, on September 5, 2016, this landslide was reactivated and dammed the river again, creating a 20-m high dam at the same location and resulting in the formation of a barrier lake with a volume of 0.6 million m3. The day after the event we carried out a field investigation of the landslide and obtained a high-resolution image and DEM using UAV. The satellite images from 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2015 were also collected to analyze the evolution of the landslide. Together with multi-temporal DEMs, the geometry and volumes of the displaced mass and the landslide dams and barrier lakes were calculated using image interpretation and 3D spatial analysis with GIS. This landslide is of great scientific interest, as it presents a good example of multiple reactivation of a pre-historical giant landslide under different triggering conditions: a reactivation of an older landslide during the Wenchuan earthquake, and a second reactivation during a rainfall event several years later. Meanwhile from the hazard assessment and prevention perspective, it is also representative as it dammed the river twice in 2008 and 2016, posing threats to both upstream and downstream areas. We infer that the successive landslides in this region could be caused by the strong tectonic activities: including earthquakes and high average uplifting rate. The results of landslide volume analysis using multi-temporal DEMs, contribute to the landslide mechanism analysis, and suggest that the landslide volume estimation is effected by the landslide type, landslide rupture surface location, and resolution of DEM. We also compare the performance of different empirical models of landslide stability and dam-breach flood parameters and discuss their application during the quick assessment of the potential hazard of the landslide dams. Generally, the successive landslide dams at the Tangjiawan site are caused by the successive landslide reactivations on an anti-dip slope controlled by strong tectonic activity and river erosion, involve with a mass of loose materials of previous landslide deposition, and possess high flood risk to the downstream area. The experience gained in this work can be used to assist the hazard assessment and the planning of the emergency measures for similar landslide dams in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Beichuan; China; Sichuan; Dams; Earthquakes; Floods; Hazards; Image analysis; Lakes; Rivers; Tectonics; Emergency response; Evolution; Hazard Assessment; Landslide dam; Wenchuan Earthquake; earthquake trigger; hazard assessment; hazard management; landslide; seismic hazard; Sichuan earthquake 2008; trigger mechanism; Landslides","Emergency response; Evolution; Hazard assessment; Landslide dams; Wenchuan earthquake","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049857670"

However, it is difficult to detect wetland changes in multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI satellite images due to the mixed composition of vegetation, soil, and water. The main objective of this study is to quantify change to wetland cover by an image-to-image comparison change detection method based on the image fusion of multitemporal images. Spectral distortion is regarded as candidate change information, which is generated by the spectral and spatial differences between multitemporal images during the process of image cross-fusion. Meanwhile, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) were extracted from the cross-fused image as a normalized index image to enhance and increase the information about vegetation and water. Then, the modified iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) is applied to the generally fused images and normalized difference index images, providing a good evaluation of spectral distortion. The experimental results show that the proposed method performed better to reduce the detection errors due to the complicated areas under different ground types, especially in cultivated areas and forests. Moreover, the proposed method was tested and quantitatively assessed and achieved an overall accuracy of 96.67% and 93.06% for the interannual and seasonal datasets, respectively. Our method can be a tool to monitor changes in wetlands and provide effective technical support for wetland conservation. © 2018 Yan Gao et al.","Earth (planet); Floods; Image fusion; Iterative methods; Vegetation; Wetlands; Alteration detections; Multi-temporal image; Normalized difference indices; Normalized difference vegetation index; Normalized difference water index; Spectral distortions; Wetland change detections; Wetland conservation; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059148193"

It is a species threatened mainly due to habitat loss and its ecology is largely unknown. Here we performed a potential distribution analysis, providing data about its distribution and ecology. This work was carried out in the Alto Parana Department, eastern Paraguay, South America. We analyzed satellite images, in conjunction with a multi-temporal analysis using the sensors Landsat l-MSS,5-TM,8-OLI, of the years 2002, 2012 and 2013; and a posterior visual interpretation of an ASTER ASTGTM2 radar image. The final step was an in situ visual verification. We registered 27 potential sites of distribution for Butia marmorii, finding it present in four sites, two of them with limited anthropogenic impacts. We found a density of 0.0054 to 0.11 individuals/m2, and associations with the congener S. paraguayensis. These new Paraguayan populations of Butia marmorii provide verifiable data demonstrating that anthropogenic impact is the principal threat to the species. Here we found that the situation of B. marmorii is even worse than supposed before, and hence we consider the species to be Critically Endangered. Copyright: © Gauto et al. 2017.

(2) The positive correlations were found between the damage of C. medinalis and the discrepancy of characteristic parameters in these two experimental fields. (3) Quantitative correlation analyses showed that DNIR and folding leaf rate had a highly significant correlation (PO.01), and DEVI and folding leaf rate had a significant correlation (PO.05). While there was not significant between DNDVI and folding leaf rate. Therefore, it was feasible to using HJ satellite images to monitor and warn the outbreak and development of C. medinalis, which provided a new possible method to monitor dynamically the damage of C. medinalis. © 2018 Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Agrometeorology.

It's of practical value to quickly assess the leaf area index (LAI) of sugarcane and evaluate its growing state. Field-based or in situ measurements are very labor intensive and time consuming, while satellite images are relatively coarse and unsuitable for real-time crop monitoring, not to mention the cloud-prone climate in south China. In this study, an automatic image processing technique is proposed for the estimation of sugarcane LAI using digital images. The test site is a sugarcane plantation in Guangxi province, southern China. In our experiment, a digital video camera was fixed on a 6.0 m pole to acquire sugarcane images during the entire sugarcane growing season. Reference data were also collected through field-based LAI measurement using a portable handheld leaf area meter. The daily acquired sugarcane images were processed in a MATLAB environment and the different color vegetation indices were extracted from the time series digital images. The linear relationship between different color vegetation indices and field-measured sugarcane LAI values were established. The color vegetation indices with the highest correlation coefficients with field-measured LAI were chosen to fit and test the model against the ground-measured LAI values. Based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination R2 between field-measured LAI and model-predicted LAI, we concluded that the most suitable color index for sugarcane LAI estimation during the complete growth period was G-B, and the most appropriate image shooting time for use in the construction of the estimation model for sugarcane LAI was confirmed and also proposed for further studies. © 2016 IEEE.","Color; Computer graphics; Crops; Image acquisition; Mean square error; Molasses; Multimedia systems; Sugar cane; Vegetation; Video cameras; Automatic image processing; Coefficient of determination; Correlation coefficient; Digital image; Digital video cameras; Estimation models; Root mean square errors; Vegetation index; Image processing","color vegetation indices; digital image; Estimation model; LAI; sugarcane","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994104382"

The proposed approach covers a new fusion method (using data from multiple sources) and a new Markov random field (MRF) defined on connected components along with a multilevel application (two-level MRF). Our method allows the detection of roads with different characteristics and decreases by around 30% the size of the used graph model. Results for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and optical images obtained using the TerraSAR-X and Quickbird sensors, respectively, are presented demonstrating the improvement brought by the proposed approach. In a second part, an analysis of different types of data fusion combining optical/radar images, radar/radar images, and multitemporal SAR (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) images is described.

Six multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (L1-5 MMS), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (L7 ETM+), and Operational Land Imager Sensors (L8 OLI), covering the period between 17 June 1975 and 15 July 2016, were used to monitor shoreline positions and estimate change rates along the coastal zone. After pre-possessing routines, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), and supervised classification techniques were utilized to extract six different shorelines. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), a toolbox that enables transect-based computations of shoreline displacement, was used to compute historical shoreline change rates. The average rate of shoreline change for the entire cost was 2.7 m/year of progradation with an uncertainty of 0.2 m/year. While the great part of the lake shoreline remained stable, the study concluded that the easterly and westerly coasts and deltaic coasts are more vulnerable to shoreline displacements over the last four decades. The study also reveals that anthropogenic activities, more specifically over extraction of freshwater from the lake, cyclic variation in rainfall, and deposition of sediment transported by the surrounding creeks dominantly control spatiotemporal shoreline changes in the region. Monitoring shoreline changes using multi-temporal satellite images is a significant component for the coastal decision-making and management. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Geographic Information Systems; Lakes; Satellite Imagery; Turkey; Water Supply; Sapanca Lake; Turkey; Coastal zones; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Satellites; fresh water; rain; Coastal management; DSAS; Lake Sapanca; Landsat imagery; Shoreline change; assessment method; coastal zone management; detection method; GIS; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite imagery; shoreline change; Article; classification; coastal waters; environmental change; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; geographic information system; normalized difference water index; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seashore; sediment; analysis; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; lake; procedures; Turkey; water supply; Lakes","Coastal management; DSAS; Lake Sapanca; Landsat imagery; Shoreline change detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021960554"

To develop and apply any plans to survive the lake, qualitative and quantitative analysis and any modeling, deriving physical information such as volume, area and their changes are very crucial. The objectives of this study were therefore, intended firstly, to study the bathymetry of Urmia Lake with a more satisfactory approach using Landsat- LDCM satellite image and in situ measurement data. The polynomial model was developed to predict the water depth in Urmia Lake area. This model was developed with the input series of reflectance values from blue, green, red and NIR bands in the Landsat- LDCM satellite imagery for Urmia Lake taken on 12 April 2013 of the sampling sites from actual depth measured were taken on the same date. Also, using a large archive of Landsat imagery (TM, ETM+ and LDCM), a counter of equivalent elevation were established for deriving the bathymetry of desiccated areas by mapping the edges of the lake and finally assembled with bathymetry derived from polynomial model. In-situ depth measurements were used to evaluate resultant derived bathymetric map. This comparison shows reasonable agreement between the Landsat-derived depths and those measured in the field with RMSE of 0.27 cm and R2 = 0.91. The maximum and mean depths measured were 4.9 and 11 m respectively. The maximum depth measured was located at the upper part of the lake. As well as, developed multi-regression equation used for deriving another bathymetry map using Landsat- LDCM satellite image taken on Sep. 2015 for salt deposition monitoring. Results indicates that about 64 cm salt deposition has occurred during the last two years. Secondly, to make stage curves of lake, multi-temporal changes of water body have been derived from Landsat, MODIS and AVHRR satellite images sets since 1972. In this regard, the area of Urmia Lake at different level was estimated base on object oriented and pixel base classification using 78 satellite images. Finally, stage curve (volume- area- level relations) was derived from bathymetry map. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Iran; Lake Urmia; Bathymetry; Corrosion; Deposition; Hydrographic surveys; Lakes; Maps; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Water levels; Equivalent elevations; In-situ measurement; Physical information; Polynomial modeling; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Reflectance values; Remote sensing data; Water depth; bathymetry; in situ measurement; lake; remote sensing; satellite imagery; water depth; water level; Satellite imagery","Bathymetry; In situ measurements; Remote sensing; Urmia Lake; Water depth; Water level","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84984863530"

These parameters have been targeted since they are considered key parameters to derive some important agronomical or physical indicators of the crop (i.e. grain yield, leaf nitrogen concentration, radiation interception). This study is based on the Multispectral Crop Monitoring experimental campaign conducted by the CESBIO laboratory in 2010 (MCM’10) for an agricultural region located in southwestern France. From sunflower emergence to harvest, satellite images were regularly acquired by TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2, Alos, Formosat-2, and Spot-4/5, quasi-synchronously with in situ measurements (combining soil and vegetation observations). The time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images demonstrate a wide range of configurations, with different frequencies, polarization states (XHH, CHH/VV/VH/HV, and LHH), and incidence angles (from 24 to 53°). The first results have shown that the angular radar sensitivity is greater in the C-band than in the X-band for the co-polarized signals (HH or VV) and for low normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI < 0.4), and decreases with the increase of vegetation (from 0.4 dB/degree for bare soils to 0.05 dB/degree for fully vegetated fields). Among the wide ranges of compared frequency and polarization states, the best results were obtained with the CHH and LHH satellite signals for LAI estimates (coefficient of determination or R2 > 0.82, relative root mean square error or rRMSE < 13%), and with CHH, LHH, and NDVI for CH retrieval (R2 > 0.75, rRMSE < 15%). Further analyses are needed to confirm the promising results observed in the L-band.

The differential-algebraic method (subtraction) was used on 12 remote sensing variables obtained at different fixed periods. Before applying the differentiations on remote sensing data, a geometric correction and a radiometric normalization of satellite images were carried out to allow images comparison. Differentiation of individual bands (TM4 and TM5), ratios (TM4/TM5 and TM7/TM5), indexes (NDVI and NDMI), Tasseled Cap differentiation (e.g. TCB [Brightness], TCG [Greenness] and TCW [Wetness]) and finally the differentiation of the first three ACPs (ACP1, APC2 and ACP3) were carried out in order to select the best data for the detection of changes. Many radiometric thresholds were tested (11 values) to identify which ones had the ability to determine the best changes in the different studied periods. The most significant values of global precision (GP) (greater than 72% for the four studied periods) obtained in the error matrices were those of the NDVI variable using 0.9δ (δ = standard deviation) at the mean. This allowed the calculation of NDVI changes and the positive, negative and stable proportions for each period. The use of recent very high resolution spatial images for validation allowed us to highlight the causes of changes and the impact of silvicultural works during the period of forest management. © 2018, Copyright © CASI.","Algebra; Forestry; Radiometry; Satellite imagery; Detection of changes; Differential-algebraic method; Geometric correction; Multi-temporal imageries; Radiometric normalization; Remote sensing data; Standard deviation; Very high resolution; Remote sensing","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058712307"

The process of land degradation in Sri Lanka has increased rapidly specially in districts like Nuwara Eliya. Taking advantages of the hyperspectral imagery and developing methods such as spectral mixture analysis (SMA) are recently much recommended methods for vegetation studies in arid, semiarid as well as tropical lands.Three cloud free Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI-TIRS scenes covering Nuwara Eliya district were selected for the study. Imageries were acquired in dry season in the study area (January and February) in years 2001, 2007 and 2016, respectively. A linear mixture model (LMM) was adopted using the endmembers derived from the image. Principle component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the dimensionality of the data and to derive three pure endmembers. Fraction images of endmembers were used to identify regrowing and degraded areas. It was done by the visual interpretation and secondly change vector analysis (CVA) was applied to determine and analyse land cover change map and evaluate the degradation process in the study area. The CVA result shows that there is 500.98 km2 area under regrowing class and 110.27 km2 area under degraded class in the period of 2001 to 2007. In the period of 2007 to 2016 there is 153.82 km2 area under regrowing class and 343.80 km2 area under degraded class and clearly shows the degradation process undergoing in the study area. © 2018 Asian Association on Remote Sensing.

For optical satellite images, the classification is usually based on the spectral reflectance characteristics of the objects. However, optical data is affected by clouds and weather conditions. Radar remote sensing data is less affected by weather conditions but the information on SAR images is only backscatter of roughness of objects. Integration of Sentinel-1A and Landsat data has the main advantages of combining the all-weather capability of the radar sensor, rich spectral information in the visible-near infrared spectrum, with the short revisit period of both satellites. In this paper, a method of integrating multi-temporal Sentinel-1A data and Landsat data were proposed to classify LULC mapping. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) andEnhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI) were combinated with the standard deviation, the average of backscatter value of multi-temporal Sentinel-1A and phenology of double-cropped rice.

This study aims to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of dense rainforests using remote sensing data. Many previous studies have attempted to determine the area of forest cover in Côte d'Ivoire ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Most of these studies were conducted from either aerial photographs or satellite images of low spatial resolutions such as NOAA / AVHRR [8]. However, through these studies, methods of estimates of the area of forest cover generally vary from one author to another, thus causing an inconsistency in the results [9]. Remote sensing allows a better assessment of the scope and scale of the problem of deforestation. Using multi-temporal data, one can better detect and analyze changes in the forest cover. By comparing images of previous years with recent scenes, it becomes possible to effectively measure the differences in the extent of deforestation and loss of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire ([10] and [11]). In a first phase, the country's dense forest cover of the 1960s was determined from the digitization of existing vegetation map. In a second phase, the dense forest cover of the 1980s and 2000s were obtained by processing of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images. First the geometric correction of the satellite images was performed. Then, series of supervised classifications based on the maximum likelihood method were done to generate maps of land cover, with overall accuracies of 90%. From these land cover maps, the class of dense forests was extracted and converted into a map layer in vector format. By crossing dense forests covers of the 1980s and 2000 with those of the 1960s, the specific characterizations of those forests were derived (Figure 1, 2, 3). The results show a dense humid forest cover of about 8.4 million ha in 1960, with the presence of large blocks. The 1980s and 2000s have dense forest cover of 2.6 million ha and 1.35 million ha, respectively (Tables 1, 2, 3). These latter periods are characterized by high loss and fragmentation of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, since its independence, the country has lost more than 80% of its forest cover. The results of this study show that clearing associated with industrial agriculture mainly cocoa, coffee and rubber farming as well as demographic pressure and abusive exploitation of valuable wood species for export are the main causes of deforestation in Cote D'Ivoire. This study advocates the restoration of forests through the implementation of an awareness policy and reforestation one hand, and an efficient monitoring and protection of national protected areas and parks. © 2016 IEEE.","","five; four; image classification; multitemporal monitoring; three; Tropical forest","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007425325"

However, most relative radiometric normalization methods assume a linear relationship between the two images, and nonlinear spectral characteristics such as phenological differences are not considered. Therefore, this study proposes a relative radiometric normalization which assumes nonlinear relationships that can perform compositive normalization of radiometric and phenological characteristics. The proposed method selects the subject and reference images, and then extracts the radiometric control set samples through the no-change method. In addition, spectral indexes as well as pixel values are extracted in order to consider sufficient information, and modeling of nonlinear relationships is performed through multilayer perceptron.

The AdaBoost algorithm is known to be highly efficient due to its feature selection mechanism. Our change detection scheme begins with the independent classification of multi-Temporal satellite images acquired at two different instances. For stable classification of man-made structures. 3D features were employed. A 3D co-occurrence feature was used with a 2D co-occurrence feature and a Harr-like feature. The AdaBoost classifier was implemented to classify a land cover by four classes: roads, grass/bare-ground, foliage and buildings. After the supervised classification using the AdaBoost algorithm, we performed the change detection. We carried out a simple comparison between segmented images based on the AdaBoost classification. The consistency test was then carried out to eliminate false alarms. The idea of the consistency test is based on the fact that the unchanged region has a consistency in the difference of its image intensity values. Experimental results showed 94.5% of the classification rate for the AdaBoost classifier, which was much higher than the conventional Artificial Neural Network classifier. The final change detection experiment confirmed that false alarms for the changed area were significantly reduced and newly developed areas were efficiently detected by our change detection scheme. ©2016 International Information Institute.","","Adaboost; Change detection; Co-occurrence feature; Post-classification; Satellite image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995945038"

Located near the Andaman trench and over a subduction zone, it is the only active volcano in India. It comprises a prominent caldera within which there is a polygenetic intra-caldera cinder cone system, with a record of eruptive events which date back to eighteenth century (1787–1832). Major eruptions occurred in 1991, 1994–1995, 2005 and, since 2008, the volcano has been showing near continuous activity with periodic eruptions. We used coarse spatial resolution “fire” products (Band I4) from Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite to detect days of eruption during the January–February 2017 period. Moderate spatial resolution (23.5 m) short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) data of Resourcesat-2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor–III available for specific days during this period were used to verify signatures of volcanic eruption. Thermal infrared band data from the Landsat series over the 2005–2017 periods were used to estimate the brightness temperature and location of the active vent within the polygenetic cinder cone field. High-spatial resolution images (1–5.8 m) in the visible bands (Resourcesat-2 LISS-IV, Cartosat-1 and 2) were used to delineate the changes in overall morphology of the volcano and to identify an inner crater ring fault, new paths of lava flow and the formation of a new cinder cone on the old crater. These multi-temporal data sets show significant changes in the paths of lava flows from 2005 to 2017. The observations also document periodic shifts in the location of effusive vents. Morphogenetic changes in recent eruptive phases of the Barren Island volcano were successfully delineated using a combination of multi-temporal and multi-resolution satellite images in visible, SWIR and thermal infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Andamans; Andamans and Nicobars; Barren Island; India; aa lava; caldera; cinder cone; crater; lava flow; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; volcanic ash; volcanic eruption","'a'ā lava; Andaman; Ash plume; Crater; Satellite images; Vent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042775976"

Multitemporal approaches to cloud detection are usually more powerful than their single scene counterparts since the presence of clouds varies greatly from one acquisition to another whereas surface can be assumed stationary in a broad sense.

The proposed methodology is tested for the Landsat-8 mission over a large collection of manually labeled cloud masks from the Biome dataset. The quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance compared with mono-temporal standard approaches, such as FMask and ACCA algorithms, yielding improvements between 4-5% in classification accuracy and 3-10% in commission errors.

In the Jiulong River Estuary of Fujian Province, China, many mangroves have been lost largely due to human activities and so artificial planting has been implemented. However, the spatial and temporal dynamics of mangrove forests are still largely unknown at this location. This study aimed to identify changes to mangrove distribution and aboveground biomass (AGB) in three periods (1995–2004, 2004–2014 and 1995–2014) in order to influence mangrove management. Landsat satellite imagery and the threshold value method were used to classify mangroves. Landsat satellite imagery, field-based biomass investigations, elevation data and an allometric biomass equation were employed to develop an AGB model using a multiple linear regression method. Both mangrove area and AGB increased from 1995 to 2014 with an increase rate of 5.5% and 7.2% for mangrove area and AGB, respectively. Mangrove expansion was the main cause for AGB and area increase. In addition, AGB increase due to the growth of mangroves without extending the area also has great potential in AGB increase. Similar to AGB, above-ground carbon increased from 57 t C/ha in 1995 to 79 t C/ha in 2014, which demonstrated that mangroves in this region can help to mitigate climate warming. However, a large-scale continuous decrease of mangrove forest in the JRE was observed, likely caused by growing human activities. Moreover, tidal range change during 2004–2014 resulted in a more adverse impact on mangroves. © 2018","China; Fujian; Jiulong Estuary; Rhizophoraceae; aboveground biomass; allometry; assessment method; coastal zone; human activity; Landsat; mangrove; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis","Above-ground biomass; Jiulong river estuary; Mangrove forest; Remote sensing; Spatial-temporal dynamics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046357593"

The state of glacier dynamics is considered a significant indicator of glacier health. Surface ice velocity (SIV) is one of the important parameters which determines the glacier dynamics. The SIV is driven by several factors which include changes in hypsometry and slope, mass load, orientation of the glacier, basal sliding, debris cover and the variation in meteorological parameters. Further, as remote and inaccessible location of mountain glaciers inhibits their field based monitoring, remote sensing with repeat and synoptic coverage offers the best alternative. In present study, we have used multi-temporal satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhance Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for past two decades (1993/94 - 2016/17) to ascertain the variations in the SIV of the Pensilungpa glacier, Suru sub-basin, western Himalaya. For estimation of glacier velocity, the standard procedures using image to image cross-correlation technique have been employed. Results reveal that the mean glacier wide SIVs in the accumulation zone (ACZ) of the glacier have been decreasing, those in the upper ablation zone (ABZ) have been stable and even increasing, while the lower ABZ exhibits a slowdown. This slowdown may be linked with consistent increase (~ 40% in past 23 years) in the supraglacial debris cover extents on the glacier. The spatio-temporal pattern of fluctuations in the SIV of the glacier seem to be controlled primarily by variations in the regional meteorology, glacier mass balance and debris cover extent.

Landslide inventory maps are essential for evaluating landslide hazard, vulnerability and risk, and for studying the evolution of landscapes dominated by mass-wasting processes. Landslide maps, including geomorphological, event, seasonal, and multi-temporal inventory maps, can be prepared using different techniques.

Erosion and Accretion were observed and detected on Multi-temporal satellite Images along the area of interest from 1972 - 2016. Landsat Images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected before using for analysis. Coastline delineation for each Landsat image was performed by MNDWI method before digitized for quantitative shoreline change analysis. DSAS was performed for quantitative analysis of Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and End Point Rate (EPR). The results indicate that in the study area accretion and abrasion was occurred, but overall abrasion was dominated than accretion. The remarkable shoreline changes were observed in the entire region. The highest abrasion area was occurred in Ngemboh village. From 1972 to 2016, coastline was retreat 242.56 meter to the land and the rate of movement was -5.54m/yr. In contrast, Campurejo area was relatively stable due to the introduction of manmade structure, i.e. Jetty and Groin. The Shoreline movement and the rate of movement in this area were -6.11m and -0.12 m/yr respectively.

The main objective of this paper is to exploit the temporal correlation between the images. The recent image will be predicted from the historical image that is already available to the user. This will substantially reduce the load in transmitting the images. This paper actually emphasis on the process of increasing temporal correlation, which consequently improves the compression gain. In sequential transmission, the transmitted data will be used in future as a reference.

Thus, the use of a cloud detection method that discriminates cloud and clear-sky pixels in images is necessary in remote sensing applications. With the aid of radiometric correction/normalization, previous methods utilized temporal and spectral information as well as cloud-free reference images to develop threshold-based cloud detection filters. Although this strategy can effectively identify cloud pixels, the detection accuracy mainly relies on the successful radiometric correction/normalization and reference image quality. Relative radiometric normalization generally suffers from cloud covers, while multi-temporal cloud detection is sensitive to the radiometric normalization quality. Thus, the current study proposes a method based on weighted invariant pixels for both processes. A set of invariant pixels is extracted from a time series of cloud-contaminated images by using the proposed weighted principle component analysis, after which multi-temporal images are normalized with the selected invariant pixels. In addition, a reference image is generated for each cloud-contaminated image using invariant pixels with a weighting scheme. In the experiments, image sequences acquired by the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus sensor are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate the proposed method.

Fourier texture features fromvery high spatial resolution passive optical data have shown good potential as non-saturating proxies for stand parameters, including above-ground biomass,within required standards of precision and accuracy. These proxies are, however, sensitive to acquisition geometry (sun-view angles), even for acquisition geometries usually in use in VHR sensors, hampering regional or multi-temporal studies combining multiple acquisitions. Our aim was to improve the understanding of this variation formalized in the bidirectional texture function (BTF), and find ways to mitigate it.We used simulated bstands and the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model, as well as a collection of Ikonos images over a forest site near Santarem (Para, Brazil). BTF proved dependent on forest structure and displayed strong anisotropy with respect to forward vs. backward scattering modes. But it remained approximately constant over a large range of angular configurations in forward mode, thereby allowing operational use without any correction. This range could be broadened by correcting bias using empirical BTF fitting or (more practically) by inter-calibrating Fourier spectra when some overlap area is available between images. Prediction of a forest structure parameter (Dmax, the estimatedmaximumtrunk diameter class) using images in varying configurations then remained unbiased and below15% relative RMSE except in the vicinity (±10° in the principal bidirectional plane) of the hotspot direction. Near hotspot directions need to be proscribed, as the absence of visible shadows impedes textural description. These results, and the increasing availability of large swath VHR sensor constellations (e.g. SPOT 6-7), open the way to operational broad scale applications for forest characterization, above-groundbiomass mapping and multitemporal degradation monitoring. © 2015.","Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Santarem [Para]; Anisotropy; Carbon; Deforestation; Fourier transforms; Image resolution; Image texture; Mapping; Radiative transfer; Satellite imagery; Textures; Tropics; Bidirectional texture functions; Optical imagery; Radiative transfer model; Tropical forest; Very high spatial resolutions; anisotropy; deforestation; forest canopy; Fourier transform; geometry; IKONOS; image analysis; pixel; radiative transfer; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; tropical forest; vegetation mapping; Forestry","Bidirectional texture function; Fourier transform; Passive optical imagery; Radiative transfer model; Texture; Tropical forest; Very high spatial resolution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946415545"

However, most change detection methods aim to capture a snapshot of land cover, for instance on an annual scale, which do not describe changes that occurred between the annual time points. In this study, we present a sub-annual change detection (SCD) approach to detect change dates from dense satellite time series. SCD estimates change dates by analyzing differences between two consecutive annual segments in two steps. To validate the proposed method, SCD was applied to real and simulated time series of MODIS 16-day NDVI from 2000 to 2012 for MODIS tile h11v05 and a sub-area in southeast Ohio, USA. The results show that SCD can successfully detect from dense time series the dates of changes representing land-cover transitions among various vegetated land covers. In addition, SCD can achieve comparable accuracy on the date of abrupt land-cover changes for the real time series tested in the study area when compared with the trend and seasonal changes identified by a Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method. Future effort will be given to apply the proposed approach to various remotely sensed time series for other areas with extreme climates. © 2015 by the authors.","Algorithms; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Signal detection; Change detection; Land cover; MODIS; NDVI; Sub-annual; Time series","Change detection; Land cover; MODIS; NDVI; Sub-annual; Time series","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937916075"

Continuous monitoring of shorelines are needed to understand the causes and consequences of recent changes and to assess the long term impact of tsunami waves. Assessment of the shoreline and coastal morphological changes due to tsunami in Katchal Island have been lacking due to obstacles in the field data acquisition owing to their remote location. As access to the ground information is limited, the only possibility is the monitoring of shorelines from multi-temporal satellite images. In this study, we demonstrate the methods used in extracting shorelines and analyzing their changes using the data from Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites, the EO1-ALI and Landsat images in a GIS environment. Eight satellite images acquired between 2004 and 2014 where used for the shoreline change and coastal morphology analysis in the Katchal Island. The results showed that the island experienced extensive erosion and significant loss in land area of about 20 km2. Erosion has been more prevalent than accretion at an average linear regression rate of ~ −13 m/year between 2004 and 2010. Net shoreline movement of more than 4 km landward has been observed at the western coast of the island. Regions of high net shoreline movements were associated with bay-mouth areas, and regions linked with coastal inlets. This study demonstrates the strong potential of archived satellite images for detecting shoreline movements in far-off islands. The results will likewise help in understanding the response and recovery of shorelines in Indian Ocean regions after the 2004 tsunami. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","","2004 tsunami; Andaman and Nicobar; Erosion; Recovery; Remote sensing","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077014459"

Seagrass information was extracted from the multi-temporal satellite datasets following a two-step procedure: (i) retrieval of substrate-leaving radiances; and (ii) estimation of seagrass total aboveground biomass (STAGB). Firstly, the substrate leaving radiances is determined by compensating the water column correction of the pre-processed data because of the inherent errors associated with the geometric and radiometric fidelities including atmospheric perturbations. Secondly, the seagrass leaving radiances were correlated to the corresponding in situ STAGB to predict seagrass biomass. The relationship between STAGB and cover percentage was then established for seagrass meadows occurring in Merambong, Straits of Johor, Malaysia. By applying the above-mentioned approach on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired in 2009 and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data acquired in 2013, the resulting maps indicated that submerged STAGB in less clear water can be successfully quantified empirically from Landsat data, and can be utilized in STAGB change detection over time. Data validation showed a good agreement between in situ STAGB and Landsat TM (R2 = 0.977, p < 0.001) and OLI (R2 = 0.975, p < 0.001) derived water leaving radiances for the studied seagrass meadows. The STAGB was estimated as 803 ± 0.47 kg in 2009, while it was 752.3 ± 0.34 kg in 2013, suggesting a decrease of 50.7 kg within the four-year interval. This could be mainly due to land reclamation in the intertidal mudflat areas performed, with a view to increase port facilities and coastal landscape development. Statistics on dugong sightings also supports changes in STAGB. © 2016 by the authors.","Biomass; Coastal zones; Land reclamation; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal detection; Atmospheric perturbations; Changes detections; LANDSAT; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Multi-temporal satellite images; Satellite remote sensing; Seagrasses; Water column correction; Plants (botany)","Biomass; Changes detection; Landsat 8 OLI; Seagrass","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962572533"

The features detected are invariant to image rotations, translations, scaling and also to changes in illumination, brightness and 3-dimensional viewpoint. Afterwards, each feature of the reference image is matched with one in the sensed image if, and only if, the distance between them multiplied by a threshold is shorter than the distances between the point and all the other points in the sensed image. Then, the matched features are used to compute the parameters of the homography that transforms the coordinate system of the sensed image to the coordinate system of the reference image. The Delaunay triangulations of each feature set for each image are computed. The isomorphism of the Delaunay triangulations is determined to guarantee the quality of the image matching. The algorithm is implemented in Matlab and tested on World-View 2, SPOT6 and TerraSAR-X image patches.","","Automated image matching; Delaunay triangulation; graph isomorphism; multi-sensor image matching; multi-temporal image matching; SIFT algorithm","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044041729"

The development of efficient and simple classification methods is needed for more accurate mapping, monitoring, and analysis of land-use categories. Multi-seasonal aggregated statistical variables of Tasseled-Cap (TC) bands (brightness (B), greenness (G), and wetness (W)) obtained from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite (Landsat 7 ETM+) covering cropped areas in the catchments of the Ica and Grande Rivers of Peru were evaluated to assess the performance of random forest (RF) classifiers in identifying crop type. The effects of various TC band combinations on the classification results were also examined. Seventeen crops (asparagus, cotton, grape, maize, mango, and so on) were included. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient analyses showed that the three-band combination of B–G–W, using multi-seasonal data, led to more accurate classification than did other combinations, yielding values of 86% and 0.81, respectively. The results indicate that employing aggregated statistical variables of TC bands in conjunction with RF classification techniques by using freely available multi-temporal satellite image data is not only a useful but also more economical and computationally efficient method for crop classification than the current one. © 2016, Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

Early estimation of the defoliation can provide crucial support to mitigate the socio-economic impact on vulnerable forests. Remote sensing techniques are suitable to investigate the affected regions that usually consist of large and inaccessible forestry areas. Using satellite images, surface reflectance values at two or more wavelengths are combined to generate vegetation indices (VIs), revealing a relative abundance of features of interest. Forest health analysis based on VIs is considered as one of the primary information sources for monitoring vegetation conditions. Especially the spectral resolution of Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery used in this study allows for a detailed examination of the red to near-infrared portion of the spectrum to identify areas of stressed vegetation. Several narrow-band vegetation indices are used to indicate the overall amount and quality of photosynthetic material and moisture content in vegetation. By integrating the information from VIs that focus on different aspects of overall health and vigour in forested areas, the study aims at detecting defoliated condition in a forested region in the Province of Quebec, Canada. In June and August of 2014 two Hyperion images were acquired by NASA's EO-1 satellite for this study. Changes in vegetation health and vigour are observed and quantitatively compared using the multi-temporal remote sensing images. The experimental results suggest that the VI- based forest health analysis is effective in estimating SBW defoliation in the study area.","Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Abies; Choristoneura fumiferana; Forestry; Health; Image reconstruction; Infrared devices; NASA; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Spectrometers; Vegetation; Hyperspectral satellite; Information sources; Multi-temporal remote sensing; Narrow band vegetation indices; Remote sensing techniques; Socio-economic impacts; Surface reflectance; Vegetation condition; coastal zone; coniferous forest; forest health; Hyperion; moisture content; moth; relative abundance; remote sensing; satellite imagery; socioeconomic impact; spectral resolution; surface reflectance; vegetation index; Remote sensing","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977266659"

The main objective of research was to determine the dynamics and volume of sea shore changes along the selected part of coast in the period of 1951-2004, and to assess the tendencies of shore development in that area. For each of the six annual data sets, the following were determined: front dune base line, water line and the beach width. The location of the dune base line, which reflects the course of the shoreline in a given year was reconstructed based on stereoscopic study of images from each annual set. Unidirectional changes in the period of 1951-2004 occurred only within 10% of the examined shore section length. The examined shore is marked by a high and considerable dynamics of changes. Almost half of the shore, in particular the middle coast shows big changes, in excess of 2 m/year. The limits of shoreline changes ranged from 120 to -90 m, and their velocity from 0 to 11 m/year, save that the middle and west parts of the examined coast section were subjected to definitely more intense shore transformations. Research based on the analysis of multitemporal aerial images made it possible to reconstruct the intermediate conditions of the Baltic Sea shoreline and determine the volume and rate of changes in the location of dune base line in the examined period of 53 years, and to find out tendencies of shore development and dynamics.","Dynamics; Geographic information systems; Image reconstruction; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Stereo image processing; Airborne orthophotomap; Baltic sea; Change detection; Coastal area; Multi-temporal data; Image processing","Airborne orthophotomap; Baltic sea; Change detection; Coastal area; Multitemporal data","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981244748"

Since SAR sensors can capture images not only at daytime but also at nighttime and under cloud-cover, they are useful for damage mapping. In this study, we used multi-temporal high-resolution ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images to detect the affected areas in Katmandu, which was severely affected by the April 25, 2015 Nepal (Gorkha) Earthquake. ALOS-2 images obtained before and after the earthquake were utilized for calculating the difference and correlation coefficient of the SAR backscatter. The affected areas were identified by high values of the difference and low values of the correlation coefficient. The pre- and post-event high-resolution optical satellite images were employed as ground truth data to verify the extraction results.

If the surface ice velocity is high in upper zone (accumulation zone) of the glacier, more ice is brought to the lower zone (ablation zone) of the glacier where it melts more rapidly. The surface ice velocity depends on multiple factors like geomorphology of a glacier and glacier valley, ice load, orientation of the glacier, slope and debris cover. In this study, we have used latest multi-temporal Landsat-8 satellite images to calculate the surface ice velocity of different glaciers from the Himalayan region and a relationship of velocity and geomorphology and geo-morphometry of the glacier has been studied. The standard procedure has been implied to estimate the glacial velocity using image to image correlation technique. The geo-morphometric parameters of the glacier surface have been derived using SRTM 90 m global DEM. It has been observed that the slope of the glacier is one of the main factors on which the velocity is dependent i.e. higher the slope higher is the velocity and more ice is brought by the glacier to the ablation zone. The debris cover over the glacier and at the terminus also affects the velocity of the glacier by restricting ice flow. Thus, observations suggest that the geomorphology and geo-morphometry of the glacier has a considerable control on the surface ice velocity of the glacier. © 2016 SPIE.","Ablation; Debris; Geomorphology; Ice control; Landforms; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Velocity; Glacier dynamics; Ice velocity; Image correlation techniques; Morphometric analysis; Morphometric parameters; Morphometry; Satellite images; Standard procedures; Ice","Debris cover; Geo-morphometry; Glacier dynamics; Surface ice velocity","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006873780"

Satellite images are important for obtaining quick information for large areas. However, mapping extensive areas of bare soil using a single image is difficult since most areas are usually covered by vegetation. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a strategy to determine bare soil areas by fusing multi-temporal satellite images and classifying them according to soil textures. Three different areas located in two states in Brazil, with a total of 65,000 ha, were evaluated. Landsat images of a specific dry month (September) over five consecutive years were collected, processed, and subjected to atmospheric correction (values in surface reflectance). Non-vegetated areas were discriminated from vegetated ones using the Linear Spectral Mixture Model (LSMM) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Thus, we were able to fuse images with only bare soil. Field samples were taken from bare soil pixel areas. Pixels of soils with different textures (soil texture classifications) were used for supervised classification in which all areas with exposed soil were classified. Single images reached an average of 36 % bare soil, where the mapper could only ""see"" these points. After using the proposed methodology, we reached a maximum of 85 % in bare areas; therefore, a pedologist would have proper conditions for generating a continuous map of spatial variations in soil properties. In addition, we mapped soil textural classes with accuracy up to 86.7 % for clayey soils. Overall accuracy was 63.8 %. The method was tested in an unknown area to validate the accuracy of our classification method. Our strategy allowed us to discriminate and categorize different soil textures in the field with 90 % accuracy using images. This method can assist several professionals in soil science, from pedologists to mappers of soil properties, in soil management activities. © 2016, Revista Brasileira de Ciencia do Solo.

First, initial building height estimates are extracted from WorldView-2 stereo images and multitemporal SAR images. These initial results are then combined using a novel object-based fusion approach, in which the heights of points for the same building footprint are retrieved and integrated.

In general, imperfection in land cover change (LCC) prediction proceb can be categorized as both aleatory and epistemic. This imperfection, which can be subdivided into parameter and structural model imperfection, is recognized to have an important impact on results. On the other hand, correlation of input system parameters is often neglected when modeling this system. However, correlation of parameters often blurs the model imperfection and makes it difficult to determine parameter imperfection. Several studies in literature depicts that evidence theory can be applied to model aleatory and epistemic imperfection and to solve multidimensional problems, with consideration of the correlation among parameters. The effective contribution of this paper is to propagate the imperfection abociated with both correlated input parameters and LCC prediction model itself using the evidence theory. The proposed approach is divided into two main steps: 1) imperfection identification step is used to identify the types of imperfection (aleatory and/or epistemic), the sources of imperfections, and the correlations of the uncertain input parameters and the used LCC prediction model, and 2) imperfection propagation step is used to propagate aleatory and epistemic imperfection of correlated input parameters and model structure using the evidence theory. The results show the importance to propagate both parameter and model structure imperfection and to consider correlation among input parameters in LCC prediction model.

The proposed change analysis is based on binary descriptors and uses the Hamming distance as a similarity metric. In order to render a completely unsupervised solution, the obtained distances are further classified using vector quantization methods (i.e., Lloyd's algorithm for optimal quantization). The ultimate goal in the change analysis chain is to build change intensity maps that provide an overview of the severeness of changes in the area under analysis. In addition, the proposed analysis technique can be easily adapted for change detection by selecting only two levels for quantization. This discriminative method (i.e., between changed/unchanged zones) is compared with other previously developed techniques that use principal component analysis or Bayes theory as starting points for their analysis.

The employment of Hyper Spectral Image (HSI) by capturing the electromechanical energy variations from the Earth's surface in the various spectral bands offers the significant contribution to the remote sensing applications. The clear image analysis depends on the spectral response. The capture of response in HSI in narrow bandwidth causes the less performance. Hence, the number of bands over the various time periods are the important requirement in clear image analysis. The multi-temporal images contain more information than RGB image since more bands are available in it. The absence of frames update leads to accuracy degradation. This study focuses on multi-temporal images for better isolation of normal and noise region and provides the clear image analysis compared to HSI. This study proposes the cellular automata-based noise filtering technique with the changes in noise prediction structure to eradicate the noise components, thereby better isolation is achieved. This study overcomes the update and accuracy limitations by an employment of image fusion to each band to eliminate the cloud and provide the necessary updated frames. The classification of normalized images from the fused images by using Tree Bagger algorithm with Neural Network (NN) formation (TBANN) predicts the cluster label for the color features of specific band results in the reduction of the atmospheric and signal dependent noise. The comparative analysis between the proposed TBANN with the existing methods regarding the accuracy, Kappa coefficient and the number of pixels count assures the effectiveness of TBANN in remote sensing applications. © Medwell Journals, 2016.","","Cloud elimination; Hyper spectral image (HSI); Image fusion; Neural network (NN); Preprocessing; Tree bagger algorithm","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007583413"

These dunes are located either in association with the major valleys, adjacent to mountain fronts, or as individual small dunes scattered over the wide coastal plain. To determine the magnitudes, directions, and the spatial variabilities of dune migration in the study area, two SPOT 4 panchromatic satellite images have been acquired in April 8, 2010 and August 16, 2010 for the master and the slave images, respectively. The COSICorr technology has been used to precisely ortho-rectify and co-register the acquired satellite images for eventual correlation using fast Fourier transform correlation engine to produce east-west and north-west displacement bands. Both bands were used to produce the net pixel displacement and vector displacement field that demonstrates the direction of the migration. The highest net displacement values were limited to the areas occupied by sand dunes and ranged from 0.0 to 17.9 m/month with an average of 1.30 m/month. The produced net displacement map indicated high spatial variabilities of the magnitudes of dunes migration rates throughout the study area. The migration rates of individual barchan dunes over the coastal plain ranged from 1.5 to 12.3 m/month with an average of 4.7 m/month. In a small barchan dunes adjacent to a mountain front, the migration rates of barchan dunes decreases which ranged from 0.5 to 1.7 m/month with an average of 1.0 m/month. In a small field of transverse dunes, the migration rates ranged from 0.9 to 3.9 m/month with an average of 4.5 m/month. Along with the determination of the migration rates, the directions of dune migration have been determined as well. The vector displacement field indicated that the principal directions of dunes migration are E and SE directions referring to the influence of the prevailing wind directions in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Studying the relationship between the magnitude and direction of dune migration and the spatial locations of the various landuse elements indicated that many of these elements are under a direct risk of dune migration. © Saudi Society for Geosciences 2015.","Saudi Arabia; accumulation rate; barchan; coastal plain; displacement; engine; land use change; panchromatic image; remote sensing; risk assessment; sand; satellite imagery; spatial variation; wind direction","Al-Lith; COSI-Corr; Optical remote sensing images; Sand dune; SPOT","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949102159"

Previous flood that occurred in 2009 was one the most tragic natural disaster in the history of Saudi Arabia, which caused death for more than one hundred people. On 17th of November 2015, Jeddah turned into a disaster zone again due to heavy rainfall and the lack of drainage system. The objectives of the study are (1) To illustrate the hazard areas in the City of Jeddah that need an urgent drainage system; and (2) To evaluate the threats that the City of Jeddah is facing by simulating the floods. In this context, two multi-temporal Landsat 8 images (before and after the flood), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and rainfall data sets have been analyzed and used to simulate the floods in the City of Jeddah. The study integrates different techniques from remote sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS) and hydrological modelling for flood estimation. All information extracted from the Landsat satellite images, DEM, and rainfall data sets are imported into an existing hydrological model built in Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) software. The designed storm data obtained from the SCS (U.S. Soil Conservation Service) type II is used in SWMM software to calculate the runoff water. The results from the model are used to estimate the amount of water to be collected by the drainage system and further estimate any potential flood hazard based on the topography and the designed drainage water system.

Identification and characterization of vegetation formations is generally conducted at a fine scale using ecological ground surveys, which are limited to small areas. While optical remotely sensed imagery is limited to cloud-free periods, SAR time-series are used more extensively for wetland mapping and characterization using the relationship between distribution of vegetation formations and flood duration. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number and key dates of SAR images to be classified to map wetland vegetation formations at a 1:10,000 scale. A series of eight dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images (HH/VV) was acquired in 2013 during dry and wet seasons in temperate climate conditions. One polarimetric parameter was extracted first, the Shannon entropy, which varies with wetland flooding status and vegetation roughness. Classification runs of all the possible combinations of SAR images using different k (number of images) subsets were performed to determine the best combinations of the Shannon entropy images to identify wetland vegetation formations. The classification runs were performed using Support Vector Machine techniques and were then analyzed using the McNemar test to investigate significant differences in the accuracy of all classification runs based on the different image subsets. The results highlight the relevant periods (i.e. late winter, spring and beginning of summer) for mapping vegetation formations, in accordance with ecological studies. They also indicate that a relationship can be established between vegetation formations and hydrodynamic processes with a short time-series of satellite images (i.e. 5 dates). This study introduces a new approach for herbaceous wetland monitoring using SAR polarimetric imagery. This approach estimates the number and key dates required for wetland management (e.g. restoration) and biodiversity studies using remote sensing data. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this study, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the area surrounding the Gobi Desert in North Asia was multi-temporally interpreted by analyzing time-series Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) Vegetation (VGT) data, over a roughly nine-year period from January 1999 to November 2007. The study area was classified into eight classes, and compared to classified Moderate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land-cover data to select desertification-sensitive areas. The study focused on three classes (barren land, open shrubland, grassland) due to their high sensitivity to climate change. The results showed significant extension of the barren land class from 1992 to 1999, with 47.8% of the open shrubland transformed into barren land. Among five terms (1999–2003, 2003–2005, 2005–2007, 1999–2005, 1999–2007) which are carefully selected from variations of the annual NDVI mean for each class over nine years, significant changes were observed for barren land from 1999–2003, and for open shrubland and grassland from 2005–2007. An analysis of the positive change (the change from sparse vegetation to dense vegetation) and negative change (or desertification) was conducted over the study period; the number of pixels corresponding to a positive change for barren land was similar to the number of negative change pixels. Human activity and afforestation over the study area were also captured in multitemporal satellite imagery. For open shrubland and grassland, the negative change area was bigger than the positive change area. Precipitation data over the nine-year period exhibited a pattern similar to that for the vegetation data, as expected. © 2015, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","","Change detection; desertification; land-cover; NDVI; SPOT Vegetation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934875706"

Land cover/land use change dynamics are derived from moderate to high spatial resolution (Landsat and SPOT) satellite imagery in six time intervals ranging from 1973 to 2011. Multi-temporal satellite images were collected, georeferenced, classified using per-pixel method, validated, and compared in post classification for the land use/land cover change detection in decades. Seven major land cover/land use classes were obtained, including cultivated lands, aquaculture ponds, mangrove forest, melaleuca forest, built up areas, bare lands, and natural water bodies. The accuracies of the land cover/land use maps for 1973, 1979, 1989, 1995, 2004, and 2011 were 81%, 82%, 86%, 87%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. The results show that the area of cultivated lands reduced over the period 1973-2011, however, it still represents the dominant land use in the case study. Aquaculture ponds were almost absent in 1973 but greatly increased from 1995 to 2004, to represent 20% of the land surface in 2011. Overall, from 1973 to 2011, bare lands, cultivated lands, mangrove forest, and melaleuca forest decreased by 104 km2, 77 km2, 61 km2, and 5 km2, respectively. In contrast, aquaculture lands and built up areas increased by 123 km2 and 120 km2, respectively. Temporal analysis highlights that these changes took place mostly between 1995 and 2004.

This unique ecosystem in the world with high ecological diversity is highly threatened by various factors such as pollutants, sedimentation, unauthorized development of urban infrastructure, over-harvesting of wetland resources, land use changes, and invasive species. Among which, one of the most challenging destructive factors, land use change, was scrutinized in this study. For this, remotely sensed data and Geographical Information System (GIS) were used to detect land changes and corresponding impacts on the study area over a 38-year period from 1975 to 2013. Changes in the study area were traced in five dominant land-use classes at four time intervals of 1975, 1989, 2007, and 2013. Accordingly, changes in different categories were quantified using satellite images. The methodology adopted in this study includes an integrated approach of supervised classification, zonal and object-oriented image analyses. According to the Kappa coefficient of 0.84 for the land use map of 2013, the overall accuracy of the method was estimated at 89 %, which indicated that this method can be useful for monitoring and behavior analysis of other Iranian wetlands. The obtained results revealed extensive land use changes over the study period. As the results suggest, between the years 1975 to 2013, approximately 6500 ha (∼69 %) rangeland area degraded.

Its characteristics are distinguished by different varieties of climatic conditions in comparison with those of less built-up areas. The alterations lead to ""Urban Heat Island"", in which temperature in urban places is higher than surrounding environment. This happens not only in mega cities but also in less urbanized sites. The results determine the change of land use/cover and land surface temperature in Danang city by using multi-temporal Landsat and ASTER data for the period of 1990-2009. Based on the supervised classification method of maximum likelihood algorithm, satellite images in 1990, 2003, 2009 were classified into five classes: water, forest, shrub, agriculture, barren land and built-up area. For accuracy assessment, the error metric tabulations of mapped classes and reference classes were made. The Kappa statistics, derived from error matrices, were over 80% for all of land use maps. An comparison change detection algorithm was made in three intervals, 1990-2003, 2003-2009 and 1990-2009. The results showed that built-up area increased from 8.95% to 17.87% between 1990 and 2009, while agriculture, shrub and barren decreased from 12.98% to 7.53%, 15.72% to 9.89% and 3.88% to 1.77% due to urbanization that resulted from increasing of urban population and economic development, respectively. Land surface temperature (LST) maps were retrieved from thermal infrared bands of Landsat and ASTER data. The result indicated that the temperature in study area increased from 39°C to 41°C for the period of 1990-2009. Our analysis showed that built-up area had the highest LST values, whereas water bodies had the least LST. This study is expected to be useful for decision makers to make an appropriate land use planning which can mitigate the effect to urban climate.","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Decision making; Error statistics; Land surface temperature; Land use; Maximum likelihood; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Urban growth; Change detection; Change detection algorithms; Danang; Supervised classification; Surrounding environment; Thermal infrared bands; Urban climates; Urbanization; Atmospheric temperature","Change detection; Danang; Urban climate; Urbanization","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930392205"

This approach is based on three steps. Firstly, the difference image between two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of the same area taken at two different times is obtained using the standard log-ratio operator. Secondly, a preprocessing step of anisotropic diffusion is applied to the difference image. Thirdly, Gaussian Mixture Model is used for segmentation of the difference image in which the parameters are estimated using Expectation algorithm. The standard GMM considers each pixel as independent and hence the segmentation is sensitive to speckle noise present in the SAR images. To incorporate the spatial information in segmentation, anisotropic preprocessing is done and also the posterior probability computed in the M step is weighted with the mean filter. The proposed method is tested on four sets of multi-temporal images. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in obtaining higher change detection accuracies compared to the related methods. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).","","Expectation maximization; Gaussian mixture model; SAR image change detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930146210"

Precipitation must be held back in reservoirs to provide and regulate sufficient water supply. Balancing the irregular precipitation and increasing water demands generates tremendous pressure on water resources management for the water stored in the Shihmen Reservoir, which is the major unitary water supply system in the Greater Taoyuan Area. Such pressure will be significantly enlarged due to the huge 17 billion USD Taoyuan Aerotropolis Project. In earlier days many small artificial ponds (a common terminology in this article), including irrigation ponds, fishery ponds and others, were built to cope with water shortages in Taoyuan County. These small storage ponds provided a solution that resolved seasonal precipitation shortages. Unfortunately, these ponds have been vanishing one after another one due to regional industrialization and urbanization in recent decades and less than 40% of them still remain today. There is great urgency and importance to investigating the link between vanishing ponds and water resources management. Remote sensing technology was used in this study to monitor the environmental consequences in the Taoyuan area by conducting multi-temporal analysis on the changes in water bodies, i.e., ponds. SPOT satellite images taken in 1993, 2003, and 2010 were utilized to analyze and assess the importance of small-scale ponds as water conservation facilities. It was found that, during the seventeen years from 1993 - 2010, the number of irrigation ponds decreased by 35.94%. These ponds can reduce the burden on the major reservoir and increase the water recycling rate if they are properly conserved. They can also improve rainfall interception and surface detention capabilities, and provide another planning advantage for regional water management.","Shihmen Reservoir; Taiwan; Taoyuan [Taiwan]; pond; remote sensing; water demand; water management; water planning; water resource; water supply","Ponds; Remote sensing technology; Water body changes; Water resource","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983551798"

While the land use/cover change has accelerated land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change in the region, few studies exist on the drivers and implications of land use/cover dynamics in the basin. The study quantified the historical land use/cover changes beginning from 1984 to 2011 and predicted future changes using multi-level data-sets. We also examined population growth and government policies as they relate to land cover/use change. Data-sets from disparate sources consisting of multi-temporal satellite images, digital elevation model, population, and relevant ancillary data were used in the study. A combination of post-classification change detection method, intensity analysis, and Markov chain models were used to analyze and evaluate historical land use/cover changes and predict future change scenarios. We observed a major expansion of agriculture land at the loss of woodland savanna. Overall, change is more pronounced and fast during the period 1984-1994 and relatively slow during 1994-2011. Category and transition intensities were more pronounced in 1984-1994 than 1994-2011. These changes suggest policy intervention from government and individual response during the period 1994-2011. In addition, the study identified population growth, settlement expansion, and local policies as key drivers of land use/cover change. Future scenarios indicate: (1) increase in agriculture land use, (2) loss in woodland savanna and forest cover, and (3) significant wetland loss to agriculture. © 2014 The African Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers.","","Kagera basin; land use/land cover; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942363581"

In particular, image matching of satellite stereo images with great difference between acquisition dates is very difficult for the high-precision DSM generation in the field of satellite photogrammetry. Therefore, illumination normalization is one of the greatest application technology to eliminate radiometric difference for image matching and other image applications. In this paper, we proposed a novel method of object-based illumination normalization to improve image matching of different temporal satellite stereo images in urban area. Our proposed method include two main steps: 1) the object extraction 2) multi-level illumination normalization. Firstly, we proposed a object extraction method for the same objects extraction among the multi-temporal satellite images, which can keep the object structural attribute. Moreover, the multi-level illumination normalization is proposed by combining gradient domain method and singular value decomposition (SVD) according to characteristic information of relevant objects. Our proposed method has great improvement for the illumination of object area to be benefit for image matching in urban area with multiple objects. And the histogram similarity parameter and matching rate are used for illumination consistency quantitative evaluation. The experiments have been conducted on different satellite images with different acquisition dates in the same urban area to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In this paper, a new approach to classification of multi-temporal optical satellite imagery with missing data due to clouds and shadows is proposed. First, self-organizing Kohonen maps (SOMs) are used to restore missing pixel values in a time series of satellite imagery. SOMs are trained for each spectral band separately using nonmissing values. Missing values are restored through a special procedure that substitutes input sample's missing components with neuron's weight coefficients. After missing data restoration, a supervised classification is performed for multi-temporal satellite images. An ensemble of neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is proposed. Ensembling of neural networks is done by the technique of average committee, i.e. to calculate the average class probability over classifiers and select the class with the highest average posterior probability for the given input sample. The proposed approach is applied for regional scale crop classification using multi temporal Landsat-8 images for the JECAM test site in Ukraine in 2013. It is shown that ensemble of MLPs provides better performance than a single neural network in terms of overall classification accuracy, kappa coefficient, and producer's and user's accuracies for separate classes. The overall accuracy more than 85% is achieved. The obtained classification map is also validated through estimated crop areas and comparison to official statistics.","Crops; Geometrical optics; Image reconstruction; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Restoration; Satellite imagery; Self organizing maps; Crop classification; Ensemble; LANDSAT; Missing data; Ukraine; Multilayer neural networks","Crop classification; Ensemble; Landsat-8; Missing data; Neural networks; Ukraine","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930397174"

This methodology has been applied for the first time for the detection, classification and characterisation of upstanding, flattened and buried archaeological sites and various off-site ancient landscape features in the plain of Karditsa, western Thessaly. Although Thessaly has been the focus of prehistoric, and especially Neolithic, research in Greece, since the beginning of the 20th century, western Thessaly has not received as much archaeological attention and its archaeological record remains rather scanty. Moreover, an extensive land reclamation project implemented in the western Thessalian plain during the early 1970s resulted in the flattening of habitation tells and funerary sites of all periods. Thus, recognition of archaeological sites and relict landscape features becomes extremely difficult, whereas standard landscape analysis and application of mainstream Remote Sensing (RS) techniques based on multispectral satellite images are problematic. Digital photogrammetric reconstruction techniques and the subsequent GIS-based treatment of the results allowed overcoming these challenging limitations: the combined use of pre-1970s aerial photographs with later imagery provided a powerful means to reconstruct the landscape before the land reclamation process, using a workflow designed to highlight photogrammetry-derived topographic differences and multi-temporal imagery analysis. Hundreds of previously unknown mounded archaeological sites, as well as other ancient landscape traits such as roads, city grids and field systems were detected. More importantly, invaluable insights into the type and character of these archaeological features were gained, which would have been impossible to obtain by conventional RS techniques. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Greece; Karditsa; Thessaly; archaeology; cultural landscape; GIS; land reclamation; Neolithic; photogrammetry; prehistoric; reconstruction; remote sensing; twentieth century","Ancient landscape reconstruction; Central Greece; GIS; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Thessaly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945580343"

In the present work, various techniques of multi-sensor, multi-resolution and multi-temporal data fusion are applied to multi-spectral satellite image data of MODIS-AQUA, MODIS-TERRA and VIIRS sensors, in order to detect 'fronts' of chlorophyll concentration and temperature on the sea surface. According to the physical model of the phenomena, these fronts are generated by the upwelling of cold waters rich of nutrients (phytoplankton) which correspond to areas with a high concentration of pelagic fish and are characterized by high values of local gradients of SST and CHL with anti-parallel orientation. An automatic procedure has been developed to calibrate and validate the production in near-real time of daily maps of expected good fishing grounds to be provided to the FEDERPESCA fleet.

For this, the effects of different combinations of vineyard organisations on multi-Temporal high and very high spatial resolution SAR and optical data have been analysed. The study area is located in Mendoza (Argentina). All the ground data were acquired during an experimental campaign performed in 2014-2015 over 153 vineyards (around 400ha). The data of the perennial practices were recorded over each of the 153 vineyards. The schedule of the annual practices were also provided over the all site. The grapevine phenological cycle was finally monitored on 14 fields through GLAI (Green Leaf Area index) estimation using hemispherical images and grapevine canopy height measurements. The satellite images dataset is composed of 6 Dual-Pol TerraSAR-X images, 5 Pleiades images, and 6 Landsat-8 images. After calibrating the images, backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters were extracted from Terrasar-X images (entropy and alpha angle) and the NDVI from optical images. The analysis of the temporal signatures regarding perennial practices revealed a strong impact of the inter-row spacing management. Ranges of values of backscattering coefficients differ with the type of management but their temporal variation seems to be linked to soil moisture changes. Depending on the roughness of the inter-row spacing the alpha angle evolution is linked to grapevine growth in the case of a chemically weeded inter-row spacing. But it remains at high values when the inter-row spacing is ploughed or grassed. In those cases, the entropy increases along the growth cycle. The vegetation indexes series are increasing with the grapevine growth depending on canopy width and soil management. Thus this work highlighted the variability of the SAR and optical signals due to heterogeneities in vineyard organisation and management. © 2016 SPIE.","Agriculture; Agronomy; Backscattering; Ecology; Ecosystems; Entropy; Geometrical optics; Hydrology; Optical sensors; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Soil moisture; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Experimental campaign; Grapevine; Polarimetric parameters; Temporal signatures; Very high spatial resolutions; Viticultural landscapes; Viticultural practices; Space-based radar","Grapevine; Optical sensors; Synthetic Aperture Radar; Temporal signatures; Viticultural practices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011019594"

The goal of this study was to develop remote sensing-based models for estimating ET and the biophysical parameters canopy conductance (gc), upper-canopy temperature, and soil moisture for a mature loblolly pine forest (Pinus taeda L.) in the Parker Tract in eastern North Carolina. To validate the remote sensing approach, we acquired long-term on-site eddy flux measurements, including micrometeorological variables and water and energy fluxes. Other measured and derived ET-associated parameters include forest gc, leaf area index, canopy absorbed radiation, canopy temperature, and soil moisture. Multi-temporal cloud-free (le;10% cloud cover) Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images from 2006-2012 were acquired. Field data for the 2 h (12:00 noon to 2:00 p.m.) means were used in the model, coinciding with the image acquisition time. Individual Landsat bands (1 through 7) and developed image vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, and VVI) for the study site were obtained through automated geospatial models and were correlated to measured ET flux and related parameters. An excellent coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.93, n = 42) was obtained for the upper-canopy temperature versus band 6 (thermal infrared) model. However, a low correlation (R2 = 0.36, n = 6) was obtained for gc versus band 5 (mid-infrared) model. The correlation for soil moisture versus band 7 was poor (R2 = 0.05, n = 42), perhaps due to heavy canopy and pine litter ground cover. However, the ET estimation model with multiple image information variables, such as bands 5 and 7, provided a good correlation (R2 = 0.55, n = 35) with less spatial and temporal variation in the datasets, along with no data mining application in model building. Therefore, this study suggests that the remote sensing approach is promising for estimating ET with good accuracy (average model prediction residual error = 25.46 W m-2, 6.18% of the average ET values used in the analysis) for a mature homogenous pine forest. Further work is needed to develop robust remote sensing-based ET models by including spatial variability, sound data mining, high-resolution imagery, and advanced image processing to account for potential modeling uncertainties. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","North Carolina; United States; Pinus taeda; Cost effectiveness; Data mining; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Image acquisition; Image processing; Moisture; Soil moisture; Soils; Uncertainty analysis; Canopy conductance; Canopy temperature; Model builders; NDVI; Python script; SAVI; Spatial analysis; canopy exchange; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; data acquisition; estimation method; evapotranspiration; image processing; Landsat; micrometeorology; model validation; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite imagery; software; soil moisture; spatial analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; Remote sensing","Canopy conductance; Canopy temperature; Evapotranspiration; Model builder; NDVI; Python script; SAVI; Soil moisture; Spatial analysis; VVI","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964774220"

The reason a strong emphasis is placed on landscape change information is that it serves as an ecological and geographical basis for preparing and implementing development plans in a more sustainable manner. Multi-temporal analysis of LU/LC changes on the Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey revealed that there is a marked preference for these areas primarily for building development. This paper demonstrates a methodology that relies on quantitative analysis techniques for assessing spatiotemporal changes in LU/LC in the case of the eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. In this respect, satellite image datasets (SPOT panchromatic, Landsat TM) acquired in 1989, 1995, 2001 and 2007 were enhanced. Resulting images were classified and compared to detect coastal urbanization and development trends. Post-classification change analyses were employed to quantify land cover conversions in three periods from 1985 to 1995, from 1995 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2007.

The spatial pattern and temporal evolution of snow cover extent on ice-free areas can be monitored using multi-temporal coherence images. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence is used to map glacier extent of land-terminating glaciers with an average accuracy of 25 m. Multi-temporal SAR colour composites identify the position of the late summer snow line at ~220 m a.s.l. Glacier surface velocities are obtained from intensity feature-tracking. Surface velocities near the calving front of Fourcade Glacier were up to 1.8±0.01 m d-1. Using an intercept theorem based on fundamental geometric principles together with differential GPS field measurements, the ice discharge of Fourcade Glacier was estimated at 20 700±5500 m3 d-1 (corresponding to ~19±5 kt d-1).

The current study quantified these impacts in the Puttalam lagoon, an area of the country that has experienced some of the most destructive development. Land use change was analysed using a multi-temporal set of aerial and satellite images taken in 1992/1994 (aerial photographs), 2007 (SPOT 5) and 2012 (Pleiades). The area of shrimp farms increased by 2777% over this 19-year period, with salt pans expanding by 60%. Mangroves declined in area by 34% and coconut groves increased by 17%. Because of problems with disease many intensive shrimp farms are abandoned after a few years, leaving denuded and unproductive landscapes; here a large majority of farms (90% of the total area of shrimp aquaculture) were found to be abandoned. The loss of carbon sequestration and storage services caused by this unsustainable recent history of shrimp farming was calculated as one measure of environmental impact. The documented land use changes in Puttalam lagoon resulted in an estimated net carbon loss of 191584tC. This was mainly due to conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms, making up 75.5% of the total carbon loss.

Furthermore, model validation based on multi-temporal images in different Environmental management issues and geophysical problems such as climate change effects demand more precise imagery-processing in remote sensing discipline. This study intends to develop a methodology based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to achieve the automatic extraction of small footprints from these high resolution images in order to facilitate and speed up image analysis along with the improvement of the results accuracy. Mapping different types of micro-landforms, such as aeolian, glacier and volcanic minor features, and extracting their morphometric and pattern information on planets is challenging because of their small footprint on satellite images and their large numbers or high density in small areas. Unfortunately available feature extraction modules of remote sensing software don’t work properly for the size of these features. Previous studies traced and digitized small features manually (e.g. [1]). This proposal intends to create a framework based on an unsupervised ANN algorithm to automatize outlining these features and extracting their metrics. ANN algorithm characteristics such as learning ability, abstraction with topology preservation, and visualization can be applied to complex tasks in different disciplines (e.g. [2, 3]). In this study HiRISE images from Mars as well as UAV images from Earth are used as preliminary data and other layers will be extracted from selective filters. Different settings have been examined for the best which captures small linear feature outlines most accurately from these high quality satellite images. We intend to make our framework and module applicable and adjustable for all types of high resolution images.

The categorization of NDVI derived from IKONOS 2007 and PLEIADES 2012 high-resolution multispectral satellite images into the bare lands, sparse and dense vegetation revealed the positive vegetation cover restoration along oil and gas pipelines. The change detection analysis of NDVIs showed that the class of ‘Significant Increase in Vegetation’ was 5.40 km2 within the croplands. However, the classes of ‘Significant Decrease in Vegetation’ and ‘No Significant Change in Vegetation’ were observed to be 2.56 and 5.10 km2 within croplands, correspondingly. This decrease can be explained by the encumbrances applied for the partial restrictions of land-use activities along oil and gas pipelines to mitigate potential risks to pipelines and by the slow natural vegetation restoration. NDVI analysis for 50-m section polygons of pipeline corridor and contiguous areas showed that 7072 polygons had no significant NDVI difference in 2012, whereas in 2007 it was 4383.

First, the spectral response curve of the oil and other typical objects were analyzed to build the spectral feature space. Second, the classification algorithm of the polynomial kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) was studied to extract various levels of oil spill information including severe pollution, moderate pollution, and slight pollution. Third, the performance of the classification model was validated by comparison with other traditional approaches and the ground investigation data supported by the Shanghai Environmental Science Research Institute. Fourth, multi-temporal HJ-1 images were used to implement the classification with the polynomial kernel-based SVM algorithm. Finally, the oil-covered areas were calculated, the changes in spatial distribution were analyzed on the basis of the extracted results, and a statistical histogram was obtained. The results prove that the polynomial kernel-based SVM classification model has high accuracy with reliable performance for oil spill extraction.

The objective is to study satellite data COSMO - SkyMed: X band and Radarsat-2: C band land use / land cover in coastal areas of Chanthaburi province. The important advantage of SAR imagery is that it is independent of the impact of climate factors, e.g., rain, haze, and cloud. As a result, the SAR imagery can be acquired from all seasons; therefore, it is suitable for tracking land use and land cover changes. Additionally, the potential capability of SAR sensor is to provide the backscattering data and these data can be performed to classify land use/land cover. However, the backscattering characteristics depend on the wavelength, direction of the radiated electromagnetic field, surface roughness, and moisture content. Cosmo-SkyMed (X-band, HH polarization) and Radarsat-2 (C band, HH, HV polarization) were used in this study. Those multi-temporal satellite images were acquired in May, August, and November 2013. The study area is in Chanthaburi province, Thailand. Land use in this area are paddy fields, cassava, rubber Trees, shrimp farms, mangrove, forest, orchard, buildings, forest, and water. The result of this study exhibited that the backscattering from buildings showed very high values in all wavelength and direction, where as the back scattering of water and shrimp farms were very low, which appears black on images because such surfaces are smooth forest, orchard and rubber Trees represented similar backscattering levels due to the characteristics of sparse vegetation canopy and paddy fields are medium roughness. The backscattering gray scale in this study area demonstrated different values from different materials according to the wavelength and direction of the radiated electromagnetic. This study found that surface roughness and moisture content are also the major factors of different backscattering values. If surfaces are rough, the brightness value will be white, such as roof and concrete road. Other important factors are moisture, wind, and incident angle. In addition, the result indicated that the major land use/land cover of this area, included paddy fields, shrimp farms, orchard, rubber trees, and cassava, respectively. Land uses/land cover within 15 km. of coastline in Chanthaburi province were also illustrated in this study.

Quick observation of the disaster damage is extremely important for planning effective rescue operations. In the past, acquiring damage information was limited to only field surveys or using aerial photographs. In the last decade, space-borne images were used in many disaster researches, such as tsunami damage detection. In this study, SAR data of ALOS/PALSAR satellite images were used to estimate tsunami damage in the form of inundation areas in Talcahuano, the area near the epicentre of the 2010 Chile earthquake. The image processing consisted of three stages, i.e. pre-processing, analysis processing, and post-processing. It was conducted using multi-temporal images before and after the disaster. In the analysis processing, inundation areas were extracted through the masking processing. It consisted of water masking using a high-resolution optical image of ALOS/AVNIR-2 and elevation masking which built upon the inundation height using DEM image of ASTER-GDEM. The area result was 8.77 Km2. It showed a good result and corresponded to the inundation map of Talcahuano.

The algorithm is tested in a semi-arid tropical region in South India using 30 satellite images of RADARSAT-2, SMOS L2 SM products, and 1262 SM field measurements in 50 plots spanning over 4 years. The validation with the field data showed the ability of the developed algorithm to retrieve SM with RMSE ranging from 0.02 to 0.06m3/m3 for the majority of plots. Comparison with the SMOS SM showed a good temporal behaviour with RMSE of approximately 0.05 m3/m3 and a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.9. The developed model is compared and found to be better than the change detection and delta index model.

In this analysis, the long-term shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern are estimated along the coastal stretch using multi-temporal aerial photographs and high resolution satellite images for the past 45 years (1967–2012). The shoreline change rate and erosion/accretion pattern at each transects are estimated by five statistical parameters functionalized in DSAS 4.5 software such as end point rate (EPR), shoreline change envelop (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM), linear regression rate (LRR), and least median of squares (LMS). The measurement of shoreline change rate and coastal erosion and accretion pattern has been described for three segments namely (1) North–North–West (NNW) to South–South–East (SSE); (2) North–East (NE) to South–West (SW); (3) North–North–East (NNE) to South–South–West (SSW) based on the coastal configuration. The analysis reveals that the severe erosion risk (−1.75 to −0.03 m/year) was noticed between transects 41 and 61 in NE–SW segments and moderate erosion risk (−1.09 to −0.18 m/year) between transects 62 and 95 of the NNE–SSW segments. The NNW–SSE segment shows low erosion risk with an EPR value of −0.55 to −0.05 m/year. The values of shoreline change rate of these transects indicate the occurrence of severe erosion along the coastal area over the periods of 1967–2012. However, the coastal segment in NNW–SSE configuration faces least erosion rate and the protective coral reefs reduce the wave energy action which leads to the formation of sustainable coast in the area. Moreover, poor set back and management activities with reference to high energetic waves, storm surge and cyclonic conditions produce direct impacts on the coastal morphology and degradation of coral reef ecosystem. The shoreline change studies through integrated remote sensing and GIS technology is considered of paramount importance for accurately focusing on planning, management and coastal intervention in long-term purpose. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Mascarene Islands; Mauritius; Anthozoa; Beaches; Erosion; Reefs; Remote sensing; Wave energy conversion; Coastal erosion; DSAS; Geospatial techniques; Mauritius; Remote sensing and GIS; Shoreline change; Trou Aux Biches; accretion; aerial photography; coastal erosion; coastal morphology; coastal protection; coral reef; degradation; erosion rate; GIS; remote sensing; risk assessment; satellite imagery; shoreline change; software; statistical analysis; storm surge; wave energy; Risk assessment","Coastal erosion risk; DSAS; Geospatial technique; Mauritius; Remote sensing and GIS; Shoreline change; Trou Aux Biches","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959457539"

Therefore, it has focused on conservation, on wood and fruit use, and on sweet chestnut preservation as they are faced a canker disease that threatens the forest stands. Within this project, a method has been developed for the precise and up-to-date mapping of chestnut stands throughout Alsace. To distinguish chestnut from other species, the method is based on a targeted selection of satellite images acquired at different seasons and field plot data geo-locating chestnut trees. Thus, SPOT 5 and ALOS AVNIR-2 multi temporal images covering the chestnut tree vegetative phases were used. The study is based on the multi-temporal spectral characteristic analysis of the main deciduous species using field samples. In this way, the spectral signature analysis identified images acquired in early spring and in summer as differentiating chestnut trees. They correspond to the particular characteristics of this species which are its late bud break compared to other species and its abundant flowering. The results of this mapping covering the whole of the Alsace region were validated during field campaigns. This partial validation has shown an accuracy of detection concerning mature chestnut stands of 85[%].","Castanea; Flowers; Forests; Images; Forestry; Fruits; Image acquisition; Mapping; Satellites; Tracking (position); Wood preservation; Conservation strategies; Deciduous species; Global warnings; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal image; Satellite images; Spectral characteristics; Spectral signature; Satellite imagery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962509022"

Two types of image analysis techniques were applied in this study to identify different species of coastal vegetations, health and their areal extent. RGB-NDVI was computed to detect and monitor the changes of vegetation health during pre and post-monsoon period. Another technique is supervised digital classification was used for mapping of different coastal vegetations and to determine their spatial extent of the study area. Five major coastal vegetation types were delineated using satellite data viz., dune vegetation, mangroves, salt marsh, agricultural lands and other vegetations. An attempt has been made to analyze seasonal change monitoring and mapping of different coastal vegetations communities including mangroves, salt marsh, and dune vegetation from 2000 to 2002 using Landsat 7 ETM+ data. From 2000 to 2002 it is observed that the areal extent of salt marsh and dune vegetation is changed seasonally along each littoral cell. It is increased during post-monsoon season and decrease during pre-monsoon season. In this period, the gain of 704.34 ha area of salt marsh and 2153.88 ha area of dune vegetations cover was noticed. During post-monsoon period the mangrove vegetation covers along all littoral cells have increased this may be due to supply of huge amount of sediment and increase of salinity condition after monsoon. But over the entire 3 years period from pre-monsoon 2000 to post-monsoon 2002 the net change was negative, which was quantified as 61.83 ha. The depletion of mangroves may be due to high anthropogenic pressure, commercial aquaculture, highly eroding nature of the coast and tidal activities. The NDVI derived from ETM+ images provide useful information to monitor coastal vegetation changes, especially the natural plants growing on sand dunes, mangroves and salt marsh vegetations. The analysis of NDVI variations showed the qualitative information about the vegetation. On the other hand classified image provide quantitative information about the coastal vegetation. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Balasore; Bay of Bengal; India; Indian Ocean; Midnapur; Odisha; West Bengal; coastal zone; environmental monitoring; Landsat thematic mapper; mapping; NDVI; remote sensing; seasonal variation; vegetation cover; vegetation type","Coastal vegetation; Midnapur-Balasore coast; NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index); Remote sensing; RGB-NDVI; Seasonal change","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070439670"

Remote sensing (RS) technology is one of the most beneficial tools to study spatial and temporal changes of VC. A case study has been conducted in the agro-ecosystem (AE) of Al-Kharj, in the center of Saudi Arabia. Characteristics and dynamics of total VC changes during a period of 26 years (1987-2013) were investigated. A multi-temporal set of images was processed using Landsat images from Landsat4 TM 1987, Landsat7 ETM+2000, and Landsat8 to investigate the drivers responsible for the total VC pattern and changes, which are linked to both natural and social processes. The analyses of the three satellite images concluded that the surface area of the total VC increased by 107.4% between 1987 and 2000 and decreased by 27.5% between years 2000 and 2013. The field study, review of secondary data, and community problem diagnosis using the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) method suggested that the drivers for this change are the deterioration and salinization of both soil and water resources. Ground truth data indicated that the deteriorated soils in the eastern part of the Al-Kharj AE are frequently subjected to sand dune encroachment, while the southwestern part is frequently subjected to soil and groundwater salinization. The groundwater in the western part of the ecosystem is highly saline, with a salinity ≥ 6 dS m-1.

The algorithm operates on a difference image, which is created by using a novel fusion algorithm on multitemporal multispectral images, by iteratively minimizing a cost function with PBPSO to produce a final binary change-detection mask representing changed and unchanged pixels. Each BPSO of parallel instances is run on a separate processor and initialized with a different starting population representing a set of change-detection masks. A communication strategy is applied to transmit data in between BPSOs running in parallel. The algorithm takes the full advantage of parallel processing to improve both the convergence rate and detection performance. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method by quantitative and qualitative tests on semisynthetic and real-world data sets. The semisynthetic results for different levels of Gaussian noise are obtained in terms of false and miss alarm (MA) rates between the estimated change-detection mask and the ground truth image.

This task is usually achieved by modeling accurate decision criteria that capture the user's intention while being resilient to many irrelevant changes including acquisition conditions. Among existing change detection solutions, correlation-based models - such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - are particularly successful, but their success is very dependent on the quality of alignments used to train these models. In this paper, we introduce a novel interactive change detection algorithm based on a new variant of CCA, referred to as misalignment resilient CCA. Given a small sample of 'changes' and 'no-changes' labeled by an oracle (user), our method learns transformation matrices that map these data from different input spaces, related to multi-temporal images, into a common latent space which is sensitive to relevant changes while being resilient to irrelevant ones including misalignments. These CCA transformations correspond to the optimum of a particular constrained maximization problem that mixes a new soft-alignment term and a context-based regularization criterion. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive satellite image change detection, show that our misalignment resilient CCA approach is highly effective. © 2016 IEEE.","Alignment; Linear transformations; Metadata; Satellite imagery; Canonical correlation analysis; Change detection; Change detection algorithms; Decision criterions; Maximization problem; Multi-temporal image; Transformation matrices; User's intentions; Pattern recognition","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019167492"

The focus of the study is to assess the changes occurring after catastrophic wind events using Landsat time series data. Estimates of disturbance rates are derived using 8 sample sites selected across the Apuseni Mountains during 2000-2014 periods. Multitemporal analysis on annual basis has detected the patterns of the changing forest ecosystem and the trends that are occurring and give more accurate results. The satellite images have been calibrated and the root mean square error has been made The satellite images preprocessing is made in order to transform the DN values into the surface reflectance. The approach requires images during the peak growing season. Local knowledge and available ancillary data about windthrow occurrence are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends. The statistical algorithms are applied to characterize the magnitude of the disturbance. We found evidence of systematic change in the forest ecosystem of the Apuseni Mountains by analyzing multi-temporal surface data. The accuracy of forest disturbance detection diminishes with the decrease of the temporal resolution.

To relieve these difficulties, this study employs multi-temporal and multi-sensor fusion methods for a long-term and fine-scale summer SUHI analysis of the city of Wuhan in China. By integrating several series of satellite images, we generated 26-year (1988 to 2013) high spatial resolution (Landsat-like) summer land surface temperature (LST) data. This series of data was then used for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the SUHI patterns, evolution characteristics, and mechanisms. This study not only provides a generalized research framework for the long-term and fine-scale analysis of the SUHI effect, but also reveals several findings about the heat distribution and SUHI characteristics in Wuhan. Firstly, our results show that the high temperature and sub-high temperature areas were continuously concentrated from rural to urban areas, but the high temperature area within the old city zones showed an obvious decreasing tendency. Secondly, a more important finding is that the SUHI intensity first increased and then decreased over the 26. years. The maximum temperature difference between the city zone and the rural area was in 2003 (7.19. K for the old city zone, and 4.65. K for the area within the third ring road). Finally, we confirm that the relationships between heat distribution and land cover (especially vegetation and impervious surfaces) were interannually stable, and that the influences of industry, businesses, and residential districts on the SUHI effect were in descending order in Wuhan. © 2015.","China; Hubei; Wuhan; Economic and social effects; Landforms; Remote sensing; Rural areas; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Sensor data fusion; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Thermal pollution; Evolution characteristics; Land surface temperature; Maximum temperature differences; Multi-sensor fusion; Multi-sensor fusion method; Multi-temporal; Qualitative and quantitative analysis; Surface urban heat islands; cloud cover; data assimilation; heat island; land cover; land surface; Landsat; long-term change; remote sensing; sensor; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; surface temperature; trade-off; Atmospheric temperature","Land surface temperature (LST); Multi-sensor fusion; Multi-temporal fusion; Surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946926389"

In this paper, an automatic cloud removal algorithm is proposed to generate cloud-free and cloud shadow-free images from multi temporal registered remote-sensing images. An automatic cloud detection and a shadow detection algorithm is combined in this method. The quality assessment of multitemporal images based on SSIM index is used to sort the images. Information cloning is used to fill the cloud-covered areas in the satellite image. For each cloud contaminated area, the corresponding cloud free areas are selected from sorted multitemporal images to reconstruct the clouds without any visible seams.

The processing of ENVISAT satellite images for oil spill detection included the following stages: filtering of images for noise reduction and imagery enhancement, preliminary segmentation for detection of dark features, interactive visual interpretation for the discrimination among other oil spill look-alikes, computation of oil spill frequency, and approximation of oil leak sources. The analysis showed that the appearance of the oil slicks in the radar imagery significantly depends on the Caspian Sea wind speed. The best wind speed conditions for the detection of oil spill were determined to be 2.5–14 m/s. The hot spot areas of detected oil spill frequencies for 2009–2010 were the following: 2–25 (4,658.83 sq. km.), 26–45 (302.83 sq. km.), 46–75 (77.95 sq. km.). The most critical oil leak sources were observed around the Oil Rocks Settlement. The exponential regression analysis between wind speeds and oil slick areas in 2009 with R2 equal to 0.61 showed that larger oil spill areas were observed with lower wind speeds. The spatiotemporal patterns of currents in the Caspian Sea explained the multi-directional spatial distribution of oil spills around the Oil Rocks Settlement. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Caspian Sea; Geodetic satellites; Geographic information systems; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Leakage (fluid); Noise abatement; Oil spills; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Rocks; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Wind; Advanced synthetic aperture radars; Chilov; Exponential regression; Oil spill detection; Pirallahi; Radarsat; Spatiotemporal patterns; Visual interpretation; Envisat; GIS; oil spill response; RADARSAT; remote sensing; synthetic aperture radar; temporal period; Radar imaging","Chilov; GIS; Oil rocks; Pirallahi; RADARSAT; Remote sensing; SAR","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027945794"

In the northern part of Luzon Island of the Philippines, farmers reported that gully erosion was severely developed in recent years in some areas of corn fields located on hilly land. In order to understand the actual condition of development of gully erosion, we attempted to develop a method to extract spatial distribution of gullies and to analyze recent development of gully associated with land use changes by using multi-platform satellite data. Gully-eroded areas are presented as dark linear features on satellite images on the condition that the spatial resolution of satellite data is small enough. The average gully top width in this case was about 2 meters, which was considerably larger compared with the 0.5 meter spatial resolution of the WorldView panchromatic data adopted in this study. After performing median filtering to reduce local noise, the Sobel filter was applied to enhance the edge features of the image. At this stage, enhanced linear parts were contaminated with gully and non-gully objects. Thereafter, the following processes were undertaken to extract only the gully-affected areas; first, the topographic factors were considered by enhancing the image contrast of the pixels oriented orthogonally to the slope orientation, second, texture parameters (window size: 21 by 21 pixels) were calculated and non-gully objects were discriminated after setting an appropriate threshold, and third, forest areas were estimated from multi-temporal ALOS/AVNIR2 data and set it as masked out area. It was notified that the second process was effective in masking out non-gully parts such as roads, houses, piles of crop residue, irregular ground conditions on arable land, and so on. According to the results of comparison with the field surveyed data of location of head and end of major gullies, it concluded that 63.4 percent of gullies were properly extracted. We then examined facts of recent occurrence of gullies in comparison with deforestation process estimated from multi-temporal Landsat/TM/ETM+ and ALOS/AVNIR2 data. The result revealed that gully eroded area was presented even in the part where forest cover was cleared after the year of 2000. This suggested that gully erosion could be significantly developed from non-gully condition in short period such as less than 10 years.","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Deforestation; Erosion; Extraction; Forestry; Image resolution; Land use; Median filters; Pixels; Productivity; Rain; Remote sensing; Satellites; Distribution features; Extraction method; Gully erosion; Luzon Island; Satellite data; Landforms","Distribution feature; Extraction method; Gully erosion; Luzon Island; Satellite data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964043713"

Multi-temporal satellite images and aerial photographs, along with field data of beach profiles, are used to analyze the sequential landform changes before and after the construction of these engineering structures. During the late 1990s, the shoreline of the Ding-tou-er Barrier had retreated after a couple of typhoon events, and the coastal hazard prevention agency decided to install detached breakwaters to prevent further erosion. Due to the installation of detached breakwaters, the nearby shores, especially the down-drift side of the coast, experienced rapid erosion either during or after the construction. Only the four detached breakwaters at the most northern end had salients that formed on their back sides. The others yielded no sand accumulation at all. Moreover, the sand accumulates on the back side of the detached breakwaters at such a fast rate that vegetation cannot grow or expand. Thus, the bare surface sand became the source of wind-blown sand that moved over the dike during the winter season. These wind-blown sand first buried the road and large numbers of spare tetrapods, then encroached the nearby aqua-cultural ponds. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2016.","Tainan; Taiwan; Tetrapoda; aerial photograph; breakwater; coastal landform; coastal zone management; depositional sequence; fluid-structure interaction; geomorphological response; satellite imagery; sediment yield; shoreline change; temporal record; time series analysis","Coastal management; Detached breakwaters; Engineering structures; Morphological change; Windblown sand","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84987719097"

This study evaluates urban expansion process in Montréal census metropolitan area (CMA), Canada, between 1975 and 2015 using satellite images and socio-economic data. Spatial and temporal dynamic information of urbanization process was quantified using Landsat imagery, supervised classification algorithms and the post-classification change detection technique. Accuracy of the Landsat-derived land use classification map ranged from 80% to 97%. The results indicated that continuous growth of built-up areas in the CMA over the study period resulted in a decrease in the area of cultivated land and vegetation. The results showed that urban areas expanded 442 km2 both along major river systems and lakeshores, as well as expanded from urban centres to surrounded areas. The analysis revealed that urban expansion has been largely driven by population growth and economic development. Consequently, the urban expansion maps produced in this research can assist decision-makers to promote sustainable urban development, and forecast potential changes in urbanization growth patterns.","Classification (of information); Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Economics; Expansion; Land use; Population statistics; Regional planning; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Surveys; Urban planning; Change detection; Driven force; Landsat imagery; Metropolitan area; Urban expansion; Urban growth","Change detection; Classification; Driven forces analysis; Landsat imagery; Montréal census metropolitan area; Remote sensing; Urban expansion","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979544758"

In order to prepare and mitigate the effect of disaster, Evaluating land value and disaster risk in term of spatial information is necessary. This research proposed a methodology to estimate land value and disaster risk in urban area using remotely sensed data. High-resolution satellite images acquired by GeoEye-1 satellite and past to present medium-resolution satellite images provided by Landsat 1-7 satellites have been used. The high-resolution images have been employed to provide land cover and digital elevation model (DEM) and medium-resolution time series were extracted to get land cover changes. Using both land cover and DEM, height of building that can indicate residential or commercial areas were able to obtain. Land value has been estimated in term of index based on height of building and land cover change. While disaster risk has been assessed by using land elevation and floodway for flood risk, and by using distance from fault line, land slope and indirect age of building for earthquake risk. In our experiment, Yangon, former capital of Myanmar, was concentrated to evaluate since it is the country's largest city with over five million people and has had suffer with flood and earthquake disasters. There are three resultant maps with land value, flood risk and earthquake risk. For validation, the land value map was compared with landmark buildings by surveying.

Satellite images, in particular data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM+) sensors, are often integrated with field plots from forest inventory programs, leveraging the complete spatial coverage of imagery with detailed ecological information from a sample of plots to spatially model forest conditions and resources. However, in remote and unmanaged areas such as Canada's northern forests, financial and logistic constraints can severely limit the availability of inventory plot data. Additionally, Landsat spectral information has known limitations for characterizing vertical vegetation structure and biomass; while clouds, snow, and short growing seasons can limit development of large area image mosaics that are spectrally and phenologically consistent across space and time. In this study we predict and map forest structure and aboveground biomass over 37 million ha of forestland in Saskatchewan, Canada. We utilize lidar plots-observations of forest structure collected from airborne discrete-return lidar transects acquired in 2010-as a surrogate for traditional field and photo plots. Mapped explanatory data included Tasseled Cap indices and multi-temporal change metrics derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ pixel-based image composites. Maps of forest structure and total aboveground biomass were created using a Random Forest (RF) implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation. The imputation model had moderate to high plot-level accuracy across all forest attributes (R2 values of 0.42-0.69), as well as reasonable attribute predictions and error estimates (for example, canopy cover above 2 m on validation plots averaged 35.77%, with an RMSE of 13.45%, while unsystematic and systematic agreement coefficients (ACuns and ACsys) had values of 0.63 and 0.97 respectively). Additionally, forest attributes displayed consistent trends in relation to the time since and magnitude of wildfires, indicating model predictions captured the dominant ecological patterns and processes in these forests. Acknowledging methodological and conceptual challenges based upon the use of lidar plots from transects, this study demonstrates that using lidar plots and pixel compositing in imputation mapping can provide forest inventory and monitoring information for regions lacking ongoing or up-to-date field data collection programs. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Canada; Saskatchewan; Biomass; Decision trees; Ecology; Forestry; Optical radar; Pixels; Satellite imagery; Change metrics; Ecological information; Enhanced thematic mappers; Field data collection; Imputation; LANDSAT; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Random forests; aboveground biomass; forest inventory; forest management; forestry policy; integrated approach; Landsat; lidar; phenology; pixel; prediction; satellite imagery; thematic mapping; transect; wildfire; Forecasting","Change metrics; Imputation; Landsat; Lidar; Pixel composites; Random forest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84956704477"

In this study, we introduced a direct link between Landsat vegetation spectral indices and ground/airborne LiDAR data; this integration was established to estimate the biomass dynamics over various years using multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Our case study is located in an area highly affected by coal mining activity. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI and EVI2), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI), and tasseled cap transformations were used as vegetation spectral indices to estimate canopy height. In turn, canopy height was used to predict a coniferous forest's biomass using Jenkins allometric and Lambert and Ung allometric equations. The biophysical properties of 700 individual trees at eight different scan stations in the study area were obtained using high-resolution ground LiDAR. Nine models (Hi) were established to discover the best relationship between the canopy height model (CHM) from the airborne LiDAR and the vegetation spectral indices (VSIs) from Landsat images for the year 2005, and HB9 (Jenkins allometric equation) and HY9 (Lambert and Ung allometric equation) proved to be the best models (r2 = 0.78; root mean square error (RMSE) = 44 Mg/H, r2 = 0.67; RMSE = 58.01 Mg/H, respectively; p < 0.001) for estimating the canopy height and the biomass. This model accurately captured the most affected areas (deforested) and the reclaimed areas (forested) in the study area. Five years were chosen for studying the biomass change: 1988, 1990, 2001, 2005, and 2011. Additionally, four pixel-based image comparisons were analyzed (i.e., 1988-1990, 1990-2005, 2005-2009, and 2009-2011), and Mann-Kendall statistics for the subsets of years were obtained. The detected change showed that, in general, the environment in the study area was recovering and regaining its initial biomass after the dramatic decrease that occurred in 2005 as a result of intensive mining activities and disturbance. © 2015 by the authors.","Biomass; Climate change; Coal mines; Data integration; Dynamics; Forestry; Mean square error; Optical radar; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Enhanced vegetation index; Land-cover change; LANDSAT; LANDSAT satellite images; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Spectral vegetation indices; Tasseled cap transformation; Vegetation","Biomass; Land cover change; Landsat; LiDAR; Spectral vegetation indices","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926375539"

This method provides improvements of change detection accuracy and simplifies the software realization by unifying recursively performed processing. In this article the method of difference images and its adaptation for automatic applications is also analysed. In particular, a complementary pair of images is proposed as the main presentation of a difference image which allows automatic separation of the changes of ground objects without loss or distortion. The use of the histograms obtained by variations of image brightness (increasing and decreasing) provides opportunities for the assessment and experimental verification of existing approaches in the selection of automatic detection thresholds. The assessment of the implementations of the algorithms of Kittler, Kapur, Otsu, and the method of mean risk minimum demonstrate the instability of their solutions, wide variance in of results, as well as inconsistencies with the visual approaches to the selection of the binarization thresholds.

These issue are worse in developing countries. Their forests continue to degrade for firewood collection and food production. The deforestation in North Korea is on the rise from forest reclamation for food. Also, secondary effects such as flooding intensify deforestation. Therefore, assessing the current situation of forest in North Korea is necessary. Although many institutions released statistics of forest information of North Korea, the difference between the statistics increased confusion of policy-makers. Since the political situation in North Korea makes difficult to have in-situ measurements, it is more difficult to have accurate information of North Korea. By using satellite images, the limitation of accessibility could be overcome. In this paper, the objective of this research is to monitor the forest status of North Korea using multi-temporal Landsat TM images, from 1980s to 2010s. Since the deforestation in North Korea is caused by local residents, the study area are Pyeongyang and Hyesan which are having high population density. The images acquired at fall after the harvest are used to distinguish the agriculture area from the forest area. After the atmospheric effect with the COST model is corrected, the modified NDVI values are calculated by using Red, Green, Blue, and NIR bands. The modified NDVI is used to observe autumn colours of fall time images by migrating value of Red band. Forest area is extracted by applying a threshold to each NDVI images. Finally, total forest area difference is analysed in time-series. As results, the dimension of forest has largely decreased in both Pyeongyang and Hyesan. Also, we find that forest area can be more accurately calculated from an image of the fall season by using the modified NDVI.","Climate change; Deforestation; Developing countries; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Atmospheric effects; Current situation; Degraded forests; Forest reclamation; High population density; In-situ measurement; Normalized difference vegetation index; North Korea; Forestry","Deforestation; Degraded forest; NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index); North Korea","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964047632"

Demographic change has led to ever-decreasing farmland area per household and expansion of agriculture into marginal lands. Climatic extremes have been further aggravating the situation in large parts of the region. Governments and state organizations have been assertive in land use related decisions but effects of land use policies often have become visible only after longer periods. Our study shows changes in land cover, tenure and land use over a period of four decades (1972-2013), reflecting influences of very contrasting political systems.We used an approach of multi-temporal mid resolution satellite images, combined with visual interpretation and supervised classification, to enhance accuracy of land cover classification and dealing with varying cloud cover, which resulted in improvements of 12-30% over the conventional method.The combination of enhanced image interpretation and consideration of the specific historical context allowed to draw conclusions on land cover and land use related trends - from collectivization and villagization to recent local techniques of soil conservation through stone bunds - across various agroecological zones of the study region.Analysis also showed that agriculture nowadays has reached its maximum extension on suitable lands and is expanding more and more into marginal lands threatening biodiversity in forests. Ways of sustainable agricultural intensification are thus urgently needed for land use planning. Without judging the efficacy of past measures, we claim that the enhanced remote sensing-based image analysis technique introduced here can assist in land use planning by identifying areas of success (expansion) and failures (land cover change) of certain practices that only become visible from a greater historical and spatial distance. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","","Agricultural land expansion; Central Ethiopia; GIS; Land use and land cover; Multi-temporal images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964253560"

Detection of these changes can be a very important step in urban planning and optimal use of natural resources. Accordingly, the present study was carried out to track land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes of Ahwaz County in southwestern Iran using remote sensing techniques over a period of 26 years, from 1987 to 2013. For this, ISODATA algorithm and Maximum Likelihood were initially used for unsupervised and supervised classifications of the satellite images. The accuracy of the LULC maps was checked by the Kappa Coefficient and the Overall Accuracy methods. As the final step, the LULC changes were detected using the cross-tabulation technique. The obtained results indicated that urban and agricultural areas have been increased about 57.5 and 84.5 %, respectively, from 1987 to 2013. Further, the area of poorly vegetated regions, in the same period, has been decreased to approximately 36 %. The largest land conversion area belongs to the poorly vegetated regions, which have been declined to about 10,371 and 1,334 ha during 1987–2007 and 2007–2013, respectively. Approximately 1,670 and 382 ha of the agricultural lands have also been changed to built-up areas by about 1,670 and 382 ha during the same periods. As a result, it was found that the northwest, southwest, and south of the county were highly subjected to urban development. This would be of great importance for urban planning decision-making faced by the planners of the city in the present and future. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Agriculture; Cities; City Planning; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Iran; Satellite Imagery; Urban Renewal; Urbanization; Ahwaz; Iran; Khuzestan; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Decision making; Land use; Maximum likelihood; Tracking (position); Urban growth; Ahwaz; Change detection; Cross-tabulation; Land use/land cover change; Multi-temporal satellite images; Remote sensing techniques; Supervised classification; Urban development; decision making; detection method; land cover; land use change; remote sensing; satellite imagery; urban development; urban planning; accuracy; agriculture; algorithm; Article; case study; controlled study; cross tabulation technique; decision making; environmental monitoring; fast tracking approach; Iran; kappa statistics; land use; land use land cover change; maximum likelihood method; Multi Temporal Satellite Image; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; post classificaton comparison; principal component analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; training; urban area; urban development change detection; vegetation; city; city planning; environment; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; policy; procedures; trends; urbanization; Remote sensing","Ahwaz; Change detection; Cross-tabulation; Land-use; Remote sensing; Urban development","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928251741"

By 2000, that proportion increased up to 47%, and by 2050 the estimated number will be around 72%. Urban sprawl, an undesirable type of urban growth, is one of the major concerns of the city planners and administrators. Understanding urban patterns, dynamic processes, and their relationships is a primary objective in the urban research agenda. It is benefited from a wide consensus among scientists, resource managers, and planners. The reason for this consensus is that future development and management of urban areas requires detailed information about ongoing processes and patterns. To describe these different patterns intelligently, to understand how they change over time, to compare one area with others, or to explain the variations among these patterns statistically, we need to select quantitative measures to summarize the properties of the urban areas changed during the development process. A continuous monitoring of urban growth evolution in terms of type and extent of changes over time is essential to support planners and decision makers in future urban planning. The requirement for understanding and monitoring urban expansion processes is the availability of both (i) time-series data set and (ii) updated information related to the current urban spatial structure to define and to locate evolution trends. In this context, multi-temporal analysis based on remotely sensed data has played an important role in detection of urban growth. Remotely sensed imagery is an effective data source for urban environment analysis. It is also suitable to provide information on urban land cover characteristics and their changes over time at various spatial and temporal scales. In general, urban change detection involves the application of multi-temporal datasets to quantitatively (or visually) analyze the temporal effects of the phenomenon. Effective and sustainable urban management increasingly requires advanced techniques to obtain various and up-to-date information on the pattern, state, characteristics, and development of an urban environment. Recently, more attention has been paid to the use of spatial autocorrelation in measuring urban growth. The use of satellite imagery coupled with autocorrelation techniques can be used for monitoring and planning purposes. These enable the reporting of ongoing trends of urban growth at a detailed level. The spatial autocorrelation can be employed for measurements and analyses of the degree of dependency among observations in a geographical space. In urban studies, this often means that high values are found near other high values and low values appear in geographical proximity. The aim of this paper is to show the potential application of the spatial autocorrelation techniques to detect fragmentation over the landscape. This study analyzes urban expansion over time using satellite images and spatial autocorrelation. Materials and methods: The spatial autocorrelation here is separated in six sections. Spatial autocorrelation statistics Spatial autocorrelation: basic concepts The concept of the spatial autocorrelation is rooted in Waldo Tobler's first law of geography: ""everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"". A non-random spatial pattern may show either positive or negative spatial autocorrelation. In the case of positive spatial autocorrelation, the value of a variable at a given location tends to be similar to the values of that variable in nearby locations. In other words, if the value of some variable is low in a given location, the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation indicates that nearby values are also likely to be relatively low. Conversely, negative spatial autocorrelation is characterized by a tendency for dissimilar values to cluster in proximate locations. For example, the areas exhibiting low values for a particular variable may be surrounded by high values when negative spatial autocorrelation exists. The absence of spatial autocorrelation indicates that the spatial arrangement of the variable values is random. Global indicators of spatial autocorrelation Global indicators of autocorrelation can measure if and how much the dataset is auto-correlated throughout the study region. These indicators provide a single statistic that summarizes the spatial pattern of the region and the two main indicators are Moran I and Geary C Ratio indices. Moran's index I is defined in the following formula 1: (Equation Presented) Where N is the total pixel number, Xi and Xj are intensities in points i and j (with i / = j), -∗ is the average value, and wij is an element of the weight matrix. Moran index shows a trend similar to the correlation coefficient, consequently it can have values d between-1 and 1. Geary C Ratio is quite similar to Moran's I index and it is defined by the following equation 2: (Equation Presented) Parameters are very similar to the prior equation: the main difference is represented by the cross-product term in the numerator, which in Moran's it is calculated using deviations from the mean, while in Geary's it is directly computed. The Geary's C Ratio is ranged between 0 and 2. The values between 0 and 1 define positive autocorrelation, while those greater than 1 and smaller than 2 indicate negative autocorrelation. Value 0 represents a perfect positive autocorrelation, the same as neighboring values with cross-product equal to 0. Value 2 defines a perfect negative spatial autocorrelation. Local indicators of spatial autocorrelation Local indicators of the spatial autocorrelation allow us to locate clustered pixels, by measuring how much features inside the fixed neighborhood are homogeneous. In this study, we used the Getis-Ord Local Gi, as defined according to the formula: (Equation Presented) This is very similar to Moran's index, except for wij (d) which, in this case, represents a weight that varies according to distance. The interpretation of Getis and Ord's Gi meaning is not immediate, but it needs a preliminary classification that should be done in comparison with Gi to intensity the values. In particular, a high value of the index means positive correlation for high values of intensity, while a low value of the index means positive correlation for low values of intensity. Local versions of the spatial autocorrelation are used to measure the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation within the immediate neighborhood. Values indicating the magnitude of the spatial association can be derived and located for each areal unit. The local version of the statistic employs distance information to identify local clusters and relies on the distance information captured in distance matrix. The Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) represents the local version of Moran's index I. It is defined by the relation 4: (Equation Presented) Where X is the intensity mean of all events, Xi is the intensity of event ""i"", Xj is the intensity of event ""j"" (with j ≈ i), Sx2 is the variance of all events and wij is the weight matrix. Analysis Urban Sprawl using NDVI index In our analysis, we adopted the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is the most widely used index for a number of different applications, ranging from vegetation monitoring to urban sprawl. The NDVI is computed using the following formula 5: (Equation Presented) This index was computed for the years 1986 and 2010 to emphasize on changes and improve change detection. Results and discussion: All of the spatial autocorrelation statistics discussed so far have a common characteristic; they are global because they are summary values for the entire study region. It is reasonable to suspect that the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation does not have to be uniform over the region (spatial homogeneity), but rather they are variable according to the location. In other words, it is likely that the magnitude of the spatial autocorrelation is high in some sub regions but low in other sub regions within the study area. It may even be possible to find positive autocorrelation in one part of the region and negative autocorrelation in another part. This phenomenon is called spatial heterogeneity. Results of the local Moran indicated that the highest spatial autocorrelation was found in forest areas. This is because of their uniformity and homogeneity compared to the other covers. Urban cover in outputs of local Moran has moderate spatial autocorrelation and it means that pixels of the built-up places have moderate similarity. The minimum spatial autocorrelation was seen in agricultural areas. Results of Getis's Gi statistic show that forest cover has positive spatial autocorrelation and urban cover has negative spatial autocorrelation. In contrast to the local Moran's, Getis's Gi statistic, we consider low values in NDVI as negative spatial autocorrelation. The urban cover in NDVI map has low values, and outputs of Getis's Gi statistic show negative spatial autocorrelation. In general, comparison of output maps of the local Moran and Getis's Gi statistic indicated that both indices can detect and measure built-up places and forest covers but, the Getis's Gi statistic was better for measuring urban sprawl because of its capability in representation of negative values as distinct clusters. Most studies on measurement of urban sprawl in Iran apply discrete approach or land use classification from Landsat images. According to this fact that Landsat images have moderate spatial resolution, it is necessary to evaluate the data set to detect and separate built-up areas. Spatial resolution is a function of sensor altitude, detector size, focal size and system configuration.","","NDVI; Spatial autocorrelation statistics; Temporal-spatial measurement; Urban sprawl","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012292960"

Moreover, a single WorldView-2 satellite image acquired on 30 September 2013, was also used as a data source. In this approach, basic spectral information, textural features and several vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Landsat 8 and WorldView-2 multi-temporal satellite data were computed on previously segmented image objects in order to identify four of the most popular autumn crops cultivated under greenhouse in Almería, Spain (i.e., tomato, pepper, cucumber and aubergine). The best classification accuracy (81.3% overall accuracy) was achieved by using the full set of Landsat 8 time series. These results were considered good in the case of tomato and pepper crops, being significantly worse for cucumber and aubergine. These results were hardly improved by adding the information of the WorldView-2 image. The most important information for correct classification of different crops under greenhouses was related to the greenhouse management practices and not the spectral properties of the crops themselves. © 2015 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Fruits; Greenhouses; Remote sensing; Satellites; Time series; Classification accuracy; Decision tree classifiers; Greenhouse crops; Greenhouse management; LANDSAT; Object based image analysis (OBIA); Object-based classifications; Worldview-2; Satellite imagery","Decision tree; Greenhouse crops; Landsat 8; Object-based classification; Time series; WorldView-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84933506460"

The results indicate that evergreen forest is the largest class occupying an area of 68% in 1986, 62% in 1991, 50% in 2002 and 51% in 2011 and during the past 26 years, the largest land cover change has been the conversion of evergreen and secondary forests to shrubs/farms,  mining areas and settlements. During this period, mining areas increased over two-fold, while settlements and shrubs/farms increased more than three and four-fold, respectively. This resulted in increasing annual deforestation rate of 0.33% between 1986 and 1991, 0.70% between 1991 and 2002 and 2% between 2002 and 2011. The results suggests that the drivers of the land cover changes in the Bonsa catchment, are both local and global and include, international trade, local population growth, agriculture extensification and urbanization. The identified land cover changes have the potential to impact negatively on the hydrological regimes of the Bonsa River and the local communities by leading to flooding, soil erosion and the siltation and pollution of the river during peak seasons and the scarcity of water during dry seasons. Therefore, the maps and statistics generated can be applied to assess the impacts of the land use changes on the local hydrology and provide a better basis for future land use planning. Through these findings the importance of multi-temporal analysis of satellite imagery for planning in data poor regions is highlighted. © 2015, ALÖKI Kft.","","Bonsa catchment; Ghana; Hydrological regimes; Land cover change; Multi-temporal analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953254486"

These components of landscapes in the steppe biome of Western Siberia (WS) are indicators of ecosystem dynamics. The testing methods were consistently performed first at key sites, then over large areas of the steppe biome. Four key sites were selected for space-time monitoring of lakes and solonchaks of the south of the West Siberian Plain based on a series of multi-temporal satellite image. The plots are located submeridionally to reflect the change in climatic conditions from north to south, especially moisture, and their influence on the parameters of the objects investigated. The monitoring of lakes and Solonchaks was conducted on the basis of various satellite systems depending on the research scale. On the medium scale, Landsat and Spot imagery were used over a chronological interval of 20 years. The dynamics of indicators were studied on a small scale on 250 m Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer images (MODIS). Special indices were developed to delineate the Solonchaks and water bodies on MODIS images. For the purposes of retrospective monitoring, ancient lake basins (50–60 thousand years old) were mapped using a complex method based on a combination of various data: geologic and topographic maps and RSD. The morphometric analysis was carried out on the basis of a Shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital model. Lakes of the mid-1970s and 1980s were also digitized from topographic maps. The results of the delineation of lakes on MODIS images were also used. The obtained monitoring results allow us to plot the increasing degradation of lakes and an increasing area of Solonchaks in the steppe biome of WS and, as a consequence, an increase in aridity. Combining paleogeographic data based on the analysis of SRTM, topographic maps of the last century, and more recent satellite imagery led to the conclusion that large bodies of water in arid became fragmented and then gradually dried out. Thus, the dynamics of ecosystems based on the selected indicator objects (lakes and Solonchaks) can be described not by a model of gradual change from south to north, but by a model of focal and discrete transformations throughout the area studied, regardless of their position on the submeridional transect. However, the analysis of the spatial distribution of objects-indicators in the region allows us to assess the situation more adequately and go from simplified models of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystems due to the aridization of climate to more complex ones. The obtained results show that the methods based on GIS analysis of digital elevation models in conjunction with the processing of remote sensing data on all scales are effective for retrospective and current monitoring of ecosystem dynamics under the influence of global environmental changes. Proven technologies are promising to construct historical and current maps showing the status of individual objects (e.g., water and soil) of ecosystem by means of medium- and small-scale ecological mapping and environmental monitoring. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","","Arid ecosystems; Aridization; Digital elevation models; GIS; Monitoring; Multispectral images; Remote sensing; Solonchaks","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119148027"

Based on this information, well-targeted land management decisions can be made. Remote sensing is in a unique position to contribute to this task as it is globally available and provides a plethora of information about current crop status. M4Land is a comprehensive system in which a crop growth model (PROMET) and a reflectance model (SLC) are coupled in order to provide these information products by analyzing multi-temporal satellite images. SLC uses modelled surface state parameters from PROMET, such as leaf area index or phenology of different crops to simulate spatially distributed surface reflectance spectra. This is the basis for generating artificial satellite images considering sensor specific configurations (spectral bands, solar and observation geometries). Ensembles of model runs are used to represent different crop types, fertilization status, soil colour and soil moisture. By multi-temporal comparisons of simulated and real satellite images, the land cover/crop type can be classified in a dynamically, model-supervised way and without in-situ training data. The method is demonstrated in an agricultural test-site in Bavaria. Its transferability is studied by analysing PROMET model results for the rest of Germany. Especially the simulated phenological development can be verified on this scale in order to understand whether PROMET is able to adequately simulate spatial, as well as temporal (intra-and inter-season) crop growth conditions, a prerequisite for the model-supervised approach. This sophisticated new technology allows monitoring of management decisions on the field-level using high resolution optical data (presently RapidEye and Landsat). The M4Land analysis system is designed to integrate multi-mission data and is well suited for the use of Sentinel-2's continuous and manifold data stream.","Agricultural robots; Data streams; Decision making; Food supply; Land use; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture; Sustainable development; Canopy reflectance model; Classification system; Crop growth model; M4Land; Sentinel; Crops","Canopy reflectance model SLC; Crop growth model PROMET; Land management classification system; M4Land; Sentinel","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930390504"

The total change during (1987–1997) was 68.40% and during (1997–2007) was 80.12%. Major exchanges of areas are in between degraded forest and built up land followed by dense forest and degraded forest. Others dominant systematic transitions are: degraded forest to built up land; dense forest to degraded forest; agricultural land to built up; degraded forest to land with or without scrub; land with or without scrub to built up; and in between river and sandy area. The transformation from forest to built up land especially built-up area constitutes a large percentage of the total landscape.

To calculate the phase velocity, two methods are considered. The first is based on the different positions of IW images acquired by Environmental Satellite-advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) and Terra-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in a very short time interval, and the second method uses the images of several packets of IWs associated with semidiurnal tidal period in either a single ASAR or MODIS image. The former is termed as the multitemporal images (MTI) method, and the latter is referred to as the tidal period images (TPI) method. The results show that the wave velocities estimated by the MTI method have strong correlation with those derived from a depth-dependent IW propagation theory, while those by the TPI method have moderate correlation. Both the methods can be used to estimate the IW phase velocity but with reduced accuracy by the TPI method. The main reason of this reduced accuracy is the long tidal period during which the characteristics of IWs change as they propagate over long distance in the water of variable currents and/or bottom topography. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Phase velocity; Radiometers; Satellites; Synthetic aperture radar; Topography; Velocity; Advanced synthetic aperture radars; Environmental satellites; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multi-temporal image; Multiple satellites; Propagation theory; Semi-diurnal tidal period; Short time intervals; bottom topography; MODIS; phase velocity; satellite data; satellite imagery; shallow water; synthetic aperture radar; temporal analysis; topography; water depth; wave velocity; Space-based radar","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930455581"

The main objective of the segmentation process is to modify and simplify the representation of an image into an easier form for efficient analysis. The performance of the image segmentation process reduces due to the occurrence of noise and disturbances in the image. Existing segmentation approaches suffer from the performance degradation in the segmentation accuracy owing to the quality of the acquired satellite image. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an efficient image segmentation process for the clear view of the multi-temporal satellite image. Gaussian Filter (GF) is used for filtering the image to remove the noises present in the image. PSO-Affine based image registration is applied for the extraction of the pixel points and registration of the multi-temporal image. Removal of cloud from the image is performed to get a clear view of the image. Feature extraction is performed by using the Fast-Scale Invariant Feature Transform (F-SIFT) approach. The feature points of the image are extracted to form the cluster including six different classes such as building area, road area, vegetation area, tree area, water area and land area. The classes of the cluster are recognized by using the Fuzzy-Relevance Vector Machine (F-RVM) algorithm. The proposed approach achieves better performance in the cloud removal and efficient image segmentation. © 2016, Allerton Press, Inc.","Affine transforms; Extraction; Feature extraction; Fuzzy filters; Image processing; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Remote sensing; Affine transformations; Gaussian filters; Multi-temporal image; Relevance Vector Machine; Scale invariant feature transforms; Image segmentation","Affine Transformation; Fast-Scale Invariant Feature Transform (F-SIFT); Fuzzy-Relevance Vector Machine (RVM); Gaussian Filter (GF); Image Segmentation; Multi-Temporal Image; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983086745"

In this research, the RGB and NIR sensors carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were applied to the trophic state mapping of Tain-Pu reservoir, which is one of the small reservoirs in Kinmen, Taiwan. Due to the limited sampling points and the uncertainty of water fluidity, the average method and the matching pixel-by-pixel (MPP) method were employed to search for the optimal regression models.

Remote sensing imagery in general and, more specifically, high temporal and high spatial resolution data as the ones which will be available with upcoming systems, such as Sentinel-2, constitute a major asset for this kind of application. The goal of this paper is to assess to what extent state-of-the-art supervised classification methods can be applied to high resolution multi-temporal optical imagery to produce accurate crop type maps at the global scale. Five concurrent strategies for automatic crop type map production have been selected and benchmarked using SPOT4 (Take5) and Landsat 8 data over 12 test sites spread all over the globe (four in Europe, four in Africa, two in America and two in Asia). This variety of tests sites allows one to draw conclusions applicable to a wide variety of landscapes and crop systems. The results show that a random forest classifier operating on linearly temporally gap-filled images can achieve overall accuracies above 80% for most sites. Only two sites showed low performances: Madagascar due to the presence of fields smaller than the pixel size and Burkina Faso due to a mix of trees and crops in the fields. The approach is based on supervised machine learning techniques, which need in situ data collection for the training step, but the map production is fully automatic. © 2015 by the authors.","Agricultural machinery; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Decision trees; Image resolution; Learning systems; Mapping; Remote sensing; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; Crop type mappings; Land cover; LANDSAT; Random forests; Satellite images; Sentinel-2; SPOT4 (Take5); Satellite imagery","Crop type mapping; Land cover; Landsat 8; Random forests; Satellite image time series; Sentinel-2; SPOT4 (Take5); Support vector machines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942518161"

The city is visited by millions of pilgrims every year. It has undergone significant changes in land cover (LC) since the government first embarked on a series of ambitious development projects 20 years ago to accommodate the growing number of pilgrims and citizens. The main objective of our study is to detect, identify, analyze and measure the evolving land cover and urban morphology composition from multi-temporal satellite images. To characterize the morphological change during a period of twenty years, four satellite images, acquired in 1998 by Landsat TM and in 2003, 2008 and 2013 by Landsat ETM+, were classified into five main categories: Urban, Street, Soil and Vegetation. In addition, DEM has been extracted and included as Mountain. Change detection (CD) analysis is applied using post-classification comparison and GIS. As part of the study, morphological index, such as, Entropy is included for better understanding of urban structures behaviour. Mecca and its surroundings show a noticeable increase in urban and vegetation cover. Urban cover (UC) changes were divided into five radial directions: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, East, and Northwest. These changes are influenced by mountain ranges surrounding the city and the highways. These revelations can play a significant role towards future planning and development activities, which may further promote urban growth.","Geographic information systems; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Vegetation; Change detection; Land cover; LANDSAT; Mecca; Urban morphology; Urban growth","Change detection; Land cover; Landsat; Mecca; Remote sensing; Urban morphology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979561660"

Spatial coverage of this urban development is a good basis for deriving prospective traffic-and urban development plans. Satellite imagery exists since the early 70s which now document almost historic cityscape. Different methods for semi-automatic classification of urban growth and structure were tested and optimized by means of several satellite data based on Landsat MSS, Landsat TM5, Landsat ETM7 or RapidEye sensors in order to get a quick and acceptable overview of the urban dynamics. The frst applied method was a object-oriented classification with ecognition 8.0 divided into segmentation and classification. The object defnition rules of time series already of one sensor based on different weather conditions, seasons and bounding boxes were not transferrable caused by completely different segmentation. In contrast to this an approach with representatives has better results for time series because these 'segments' are pre-defned and have always the same borders. The same is true for data from other sensors, for example Sentinel 2. This free data could become in future a low-cost possibility to get quick hints for suburbanization, agglomeration or urban decay. The aim of a multi-temporal approach was not achieved due to an unsufficient number of satellite data caused by many clouds in the subtropical Siedlungsarea. The use of radar satellite data, irrespective of clouds, could specially in this area be an alternative and a focus for further research works. Sentinel 1 is a radar satellite with a revisit time of six days. The analysis of the change has roughly confirmed the political plans for suburban growth or also known as New Urban Area (NUA). Moreover, areas with fast or slow growth were detected while urban structures were differentiated in more detail. © 2016 E.

The area and spatial pattern of various land-use types have different impacts on urban island, but we have little knowledge about the quantitative relationship between them, and small cities usually have different land-use patterns from mega cities. Changshu City close to Shanghai was taken as a rep- resentative small city in our study to analyze the relationship between urban heat island and vari- ous land-use types by using landscape ecology approach. The time-series HJ satellite images in 2013 were employed to map land use of Changshu, and multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI images were used to inverse the seasonal surface temperature. The results indicated that the intensity of heat island of Changshu was the strongest in winter due to the “warm island” effect of paddy field and dryland, while the weakest in summer due to water body’s “cold island” effect. Therefore, Changshu had a relatively favorable surface thermal environment. Meanwhile, the results also showed that there existed a threshold, beyond which the influence of waters, wetlands, forests on the urban heat island was no longer significant. We analyzed the impact factors of the construction land surface temperature by using GeogDetector approach. The results showed that water body had the greatest impact on construction land surface temperature in summer, while dryland had the greatest impact in winter.

Earth Observation has been a tool for agronomists with ever-increasing capability, however, the case of agriculture in low-income countries imposes challenges, for instance in recognizing mixed- and inter-cropping, the small size of the farm plots and lack of sound crop management systems, which increase the uncertainty of information derived from remotely sensed data. The Spurring a Transformation for Agriculture through Remote Sensing (STARS) project aims to investigate the potential of Very High Spatial Resolution remote sensing in delivering data products that can better inform decisions around smallholder agriculture. Data are collected throughout the growing season via in-situ measurements, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles equipped with NIR and multispectral cameras and VHSR satellite images. One important STARS' objective is to analyze the spectral information of this multi-scale and multi-temporal dataset and establish implementation flows to support stakeholders in their decision making and economic development. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of VHSR images in mapping and monitoring smallholder crop fields in Bangladesh.

Water depths were extracted from digitized charts to explore the accretion-erosion characteristics of three estuarine environments, and to provide quantitative estimates of changes in sediment volumes. Multi-temporal satellite images have been used, in combination with topographical data, to analyze the coastline changes. PRD has gained an abundant amount of sediment of almost 9.45×105km3 above the 10-m isobath in the period roughly between 1970 and 2010; the average sedimentation rate was 3.15×104km3/yr. Between 1976 and 2006, the coastline extended seaward by 579.2m on average, with a mean net extension rate of 19.3m/yr. The results suggest that the PRD experienced a major phase of accretion, with net erosion only in some local zones. Coastline extension, associated with major morphological changes, has accelerated in recent decades. Changes in boundary conditions, such as sea-level rise, seem to have relatively minor impacts on the dramatic changes in the morphology of the estuaries. The seaward extension of the coastlines shows an increasing trend whereas the sediment supply from the delta displays a decreasing trend. A detailed comparative analysis demonstrates that land reclamation in the PRD is the most significant factor that progressively alters the delta morphology, overwhelming the effects of subsidence and sediment supply. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Zhujiang Estuary; Coastal zones; Erosion; Estuaries; Gems; Geographic information systems; Land reclamation; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sea level; Sedimentation; Sediments; Coastline; Digital elevation model; Erosion characteristics; Estuarine environments; Morphological changes; Multi-temporal satellite images; Pearl River estuary; Quantitative estimates; bathymetry; coast; comparative study; digital elevation model; erosion; geomorphology; GIS; land reclamation; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; sedimentation; sedimentation rate; Morphology","Coastline; Land reclamation; Morphological change; Pearl River Estuary; Sedimentation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924716008"

However, rigorous formal study is made difficult by the high level of mobility of pastoralists as well as by the sizable spatio-temporal variability of their environment. This article presents a new computational approach for studying mobile pastoralism that overcomes these issues. Combining multi-temporal satellite images and agent-based modeling allows a comprehensive examination of pastoral resource access over a realistic dryland landscape with unpredictable ecological dynamics. The article demonstrates the analytical potential of this approach through its application to mobile pastoralism in northeast Nigeria. Employing more than 100 satellite images of the area, extensive simulations are conducted under a wide array of circumstances, including different land-use constraints. The simulation results reveal complex dependencies of pastoral resource access on these circumstances along with persistent patterns of seasonal land use observed at the macro level. © 2016 Takuto Sakamoto.

Therefore in forecasting weather, cyclone prediction has a major role as this is directly related to the lives and households of human being. Many sub-continents in the world have regions that are affected severely because of cyclones.

Because of its limited range and semi-automatic approach, there is a need to propose a method to automate cyclone prediction, which finds the movement &amp; direction of cyclone towards the given specific locality and relays those information to the subscribed users. Fuzzy C-means clustering is applied for segmenting each cyclone image, followed by extracting features like shape, color and texture for the same. Change Detection is the process of finding changes in multitemporal images. The features obtained from the multi-temporal cyclone IR images are compared with each other in order to determine the movement of cyclone. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; Doppler radar; Forecasting; Hurricanes; Image processing; Infrared imaging; Satellites; Storms; Atmospheric disturbance; Change detection; Color and textures; Extracting features; Fuzzy C means clustering; Multi-temporal image; Satellite cloud images; Torrential rainfalls; Weather forecasting","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944411827"

A huge event has been observed in summer 2014, more than 25 kilometer-square of seagrass in northern atoll disappear within three months, and the habitat changes from seagrass to sand and coral reef debris. In this study, satellite images with finer temporal resolution will be analyzed to track the speed of changes. However to classify bottom material directly from spectral information has some difficulties, because spectral information is also mixed with other factors, including water absorption coefficient and water depth. In this research, sun glint and water depth correction will be conducted to remove the effects from atmosphere and bathymetry. And image classification for seagrass is followed with multi-source satellite images to track the disappearance and recovery of the seagrass area. The satellite images for experiments include FORMOSAT-2, SPOT-6 and LandSat-8.","Bathymetry; Biodiversity; Classification (of information); Ocean structures; Plants (botany); Reefs; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surveys; Water absorption; Coral reef ecosystems; Dongsha atolls; Multi-temporal satellite images; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing techniques; Seagrasses; Water absorption coefficient; Image classification","Bathymetry correction; Dongsha atoll; Multispectral images; Seagrass classification","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964053659"

Taking powdery mildew in winter wheat as an example, two experiments were carried out at both leaf-level and parcel level, to facilitate the development of methods for detection and monitoring of the disease. Firstly, to understand the spectral response of powdery mildew, a detailed spectral analysis was conducted by comparing healthy leaves with disease infected leaves at various severity levels. A total of 32 spectral features were examined for their sensitivity to disease severity. Both regression and discriminant analysis were implemented for estimating the disease severity of powdery mildew. The results indicated that based on disease sensitive SFs and PLSR model, a satisfactory estimation of the disease severity can be achieved by both forms of models, with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.23 for regression model and an overall accuracy of 0.92 for discriminant model. Then, to attempt to extend the monitoring of crop diseases to large spatial scale based on satellite remote sensing data, we introduce disease mapping strategies based on both highresolution satellite images and multi-temporal moderate resolution satellite images. A high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery, SPOT-6, was analyzed for mapping powdery mildew disease. Three supervised classification methods-artificial neural network, mahalanobis distance, and maximum likelihood classifier-were compared in disease monitoring. The accuracy assessment showed that the ANN has the highest overall accuracy of 89%, following by MD and MLC with overall accuracies of 84% and 79%, respectively. Moreover, based on multi-temporal moderate resolution satellite-based data, a synthesized method coupling MTMF with PLSR algorithms was proposed, with overall accuracy increasing from 72% to 78%. This result suggested that the multitemporal satellite images have a great potential in crop diseases mapping at a regional scale. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The research was conducted on SPOT 5 multispectral multitemporal images covering the 2010 floods in Pakistan. Segmentation was performed to extract the built up area (BUA) from the satellite images and change detection was performed to find the damaged BUA. The damaged area was classified into three categories based on the extent of damage. The segmentation results were validated using statistical measures like precision, recall, and dice coefficient on available ground truth. The results of change classification were compared and found consistent with the manual assessment report produced by UNO experts using Worldview 1 satellite imagery with submeter resolution. The proposed scheme and results give an indication that SPOT 5 imagery can be used for fast automatic damage assessment and classification immediately after a natural calamity. The proposed change detection technique was also applied on Unites States Geographical Survey dataset.

The multi-temporal satellite data gives the data in periodic basis which helps for continuous monitoring, but due to the earth’s rotation, climatic changes, sensor characteristics, etc. there are too many distortions and noises which has to be removed before further processing for getting better results. Many researchers have put forth different methodologies for removing the different kinds of noises from the satellite data. Each and every methodology helps in removing a specific kind of noise.

These techniquesare prone to human error and do not permit integration of remotely sensed data from diverse sources. Here, we integrate aerial photographs with high spatial resolution satellite imagery and use a discretewavelet transform to objectively detect the dynamics in bush encroachment at two protected Zimbab-wean savanna sites. Based on the recently introduced intensity-dominant scale approach, we test thehypotheses that: (1) the encroachment of woody patches into the surrounding grassland matrix causesa shift in the dominant scale. This shift in the dominant scale can be detected using a discrete wavelettransform regardless of whether aerial photography and satellite data are used; and (2) as the woodypatch size stabilises, woody cover tends to increase thereby triggering changes in intensity. The resultsshow that at the first site where tree patches were already established (Lake Chivero Game Reserve),between 1972 and 1984 the dominant scale of woody patches initially increased from 8 m before stabil-ising at 16 m and 32 m between 1984 and 2012 while the intensity fluctuated during the same period. Incontrast, at the second site, which was formely grass-dominated site (Kyle Game Reserve), we observedan unclear dominant scale (1972) which later becomes distinct in 1985, 1996 and 2012. Over the sameperiod, the intensity increased. Our results imply that using our approach we can detect and quantifywoody/bush patch dynamics in savanna landscapes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Zimbabwe; abundance; aerial photograph; grassland; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; savanna; spatial resolution; woody plant","Bush encroachment; Dominant scale; Intensity; Remote sensing; Savanna; Wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924351517"

Some experimental analyses are conducted by using Landsat-8 images. Band 3 and band 4 are selected because they can distinguish between cloud and non cloud. Afterwards, band 5 and band 6 are used to distinguish between cloud shadow and clear. The results show that the MCM algorithm can detect cloud and cloud shadow appropriately.

This paper introduces an approach, which exploits local spatial information between the pixel and its neighbors to compute the membership degree by using an interval type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm, called IIT2-FCM.

The main objective of this study was to quantify the forest change and forest degradation in one of the oldest forests of Iran named Jangal-Abr Forest at the north of Shahrood city. Based on Landsat-TM and OLI images acquired from 1987 to 2013, four vegetation and soil fraction images were produced and compared to map the land-cover changes occurred over 26 years. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) method was applied to estimate fraction images of the selected components over the study area. This technique examines the direction of physical changes between multi-temporal images. Then, change vector analysis (CVA) approach was used for detecting forest changes. Results revealed that during the last 26 years, 147.5 km2 of forests were degraded mostly with medium severity. Part of the deforestation related to the northern and eastern regions of the study area in the vicinity of residential areas in contrast, forest regrowth area during the study period was estimated to be 62 km2 typically classified with low and medium severity in the eastern parts of the study area. CVA demonstrates that deforestation in the Jangal-Abr area has significantly accelerated from 4.6 km2/year in period 1987–2000 to about 9.6 km2/year in period 2010–2013. The rate of regrowth has been decreased gradually from 3.3 km2/year in period 1 (1987–2000) to about 0.76 km2/year in period 3 (1987–2000).

So far, Earth observation has been carried out only through satellite images, which are limited in resolution and suffer from important barriers such as cloud occlusion. Microdrone solutions, providing video streaming capabilities, are already available on the marketplace, but they are limited to altitudes of a few hundred feet. In contrast, UAVs equipped with high quality cameras can fly at altitudes of a few thousand feet and can fill the gap between satellite observations and ground sensors. Therefore, new needs for data processing arise, spanning from computer vision algorithms to sensor and mission management. This paper presents a solution for automatically detecting changes in images acquired at different times by patrolling UAVs flying over the same targets (but not necessarily along the same path or at the same altitude).

Compared to other candidate methods, a hyperboloid equation is found to be the most suitable for change detection, and its resulting positive value indicates that the typhoon had a high level of impact on the area. Potential damage areas are extracted using a thresholding operation, and the results are compared to twoWorldView-2 satellite images to specifically assess coastal erosion and damage to buildings and offshore fish traps. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.

It is an urgent need to develop near-real time paddy field monitoring, which can be used by policy maker for handling the food problems directly. Monitoring of these lands continuously, using remote sensing technology, will provide information related to the cropping intensity in the field, as well as its dynamics change immediately. This study explored the use of satellite imagery of multi temporal MODIS EVI 16-day composite data, which provided the seasonal dynamics for the paddy field patterns from 2000 to 2014. We characterized seasonal vegetation dynamics from long-term multi-temporal MODIS satellite datasets in order to analyze the dynamics change in paddy field. The results indicate that the methodology employed in this research distinguished many specific uses in paddy fields as means of their cropping intensity. Moreover, the seasons were the most important factor affected the dynamics change in the agricultural system. Extreme climate variability caused many paddy fields, especially in non-irrigated land; to remain barren as well the planting time was postponed. Indeed, characterizing the long-term vegetation dynamics of paddy field provides information about the characteristic and trends in these land use types, either caused by natural factors or human activities, also to be a guidance of water resources management due to improving its effectiveness.","Agriculture; Dynamics; Food supply; Information management; Land use; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Water resources; MODIS EVI; MODIS satellite images; Near-real-time monitoring; Paddy fields; Remote sensing technology; Seasonal dynamics; Sustainable agricultural; Water resources management; Satellite imagery","MODIS EVI; Paddy field; Seasonal dynamics change","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964047099"

Field visit, as the currently used method of IB detection, is time and man power consuming, in addition to its high cost. Therefore, an automatic IB detection is required. Acquiring multi-temporal satellite images and using image processing techniques for automatic change detection is one of the optimum methods which can be used in IB monitoring. In this research an automatic method of IB detection has been proposed. Two-temporal panchromatic satellite images of IRS-P5 of the study area in a part of Tehran, the city map and an updated spatial database of existing buildings were used to detect the suspected IBs. In the pre-processing step, the images were geometrically and radiometrically corrected. In the next step, the changed pixels were detected using K-means clustering technique because of its quickness and less user's intervention required. Then, all the changed pixels of each building were identified and the change percentage of each building with the standard threshold of changes was compared to detect the buildings which are under construction. Finally, the IBs were detected by checking the municipality database. The unmatched constructed buildings with municipal database will be field checked to identify the IBs. The results show that out of 343 buildings appeared in the images; only 19 buildings were detected as under construction and three of them as unlicensed buildings. Furthermore, the overall accuracies of 83%, 79% and 75% were obtained for K-means change detection, detection of under construction buildings and IBs detection, respectively.","Buildings; Crime; Database systems; Image processing; Information science; Information systems; Pixels; Population statistics; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal detection; Urban growth; Automatic change detection; Building detection; Geo-spatial information systems; Image processing technique; K-means; K-means clustering techniques; Multi-temporal satellite images; Panchromatic satellites; Construction","Automatic illegal building detection; Building infractions; Geospatial information system; K-means; Multi-temporal satellite images","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974603891"

To reach this goal, calibrating machine learning (ML) approaches to model land use/cover conversions have received increasing interest among the scholars. This originates from the strength of these techniques as they powerfully account for the complex relationships underlying urban dynamics. Compared to other ML techniques, random forest has rarely been used for modeling urban growth. This paper, drawing on information from the multi-temporal Landsat satellite images of 1985, 2000 and 2015, calibrates a random forest regression (RFR) model to quantify the variable importance and simulation of urban change spatial patterns. The results and performance of RFR model were evaluated using two complementary tools, relative operating characteristics (ROC) and total operating characteristics (TOC), by overlaying the map of observed change and the modeled suitability map for land use change (error map). The suitability map produced by RFR model showed 82.48% area under curve for the ROC model which indicates a very good performance and highlights its appropriateness for simulating urban growth.","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forestry; Land use; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Coastal regions; Growth modelling; Operating characteristics; Random forests; Relative operating characteristics; Urban growth","Coastal region; Random forest; Relative operating characteristics; Total operating characteristics; Urban growth modelling","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981275722"

Sand dune movements can be effectively monitored through the comparison of multi-temporal satellite images. However, not all remote sensing platforms are suitable to study sand dunes. This study compares coarse (Landsat) and fine (Worldview) resolution platforms, specifically focussing on sand dunes within the Ubari Sand Sea (Libya). Sand dune features (crest line, dune ridge basal outlines) were extracted from Landsat and Worldview 2 imagery in order to construct geomorphic maps. These geomorphic maps were then compared using image overlay and differencing, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was used to determine if the mapped dune patterns were significantly different. It was found that Landsat is a sufficient data source when studying dune patterns within a regional sand sea, but smaller dunes identified from Worldview data were not capable of being extracted in the data sourced from Landsat. This means that for studies concerned with the dune patterns and movements within sand seas, Landsat is sufficient. But in studies where the specific dynamics of specific dunes are required, a finer resolution is required; platforms such as Worldview are needed in order to gain more detailed insight and to link the past and present day climate and environmental change.","Climate change; Geomorphology; Landforms; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Desertification; Environmental change; Libya; Multi-temporal satellite images; Remote sensing platforms; Root mean squared errors; Sahara; Sand dunes; Sand","Desertification; Geomorphology; Libya; Remote sensing; Sahara; Sand dunes","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930399681"

However, disturbances or abnormal changes of land cover - caused by such as forest fire, flood, deforestation, and plant diseases - occur worldwide at unknown times and locations. Timely detection and characterization of these disturbances is of importance for land cover monitoring. Recently, many time-series-Analysis methods have been developed for near real-Time or online disturbance detection, using satellite image time series. However, the detection results were only labelled with ""Change/ No change"" by most of the present methods, while few methods focus on estimating reliability (or confidence level) of the detected disturbances in image time series. To this end, this paper propose a statistical analysis method for estimating reliability of disturbances in new available remote sensing image time series, through analysis of full temporal information laid in time series data. The method consists of three main steps. (1) Segmenting and modelling of historical time series data based on Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). (2) Forecasting and detecting disturbances in new time series data. (3) Estimating reliability of each detected disturbance using statistical analysis based on Confidence Interval (CI) and Confidence Levels (CL). The method was validated by estimating reliability of disturbance regions caused by a recent severe flooding occurred around the border of Russia and China. Results demonstrated that the method can estimate reliability of disturbances detected in satellite image with estimation error less than 5% and overall accuracy up to 90%.","Deforestation; Estimation; Floods; Image analysis; Image reconstruction; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal detection; Statistical methods; Time series; Anomaly detection; Change detection; Confidence levels; Disturbance detection; Multi-temporal; Time series analysis","Anomaly Detection; Change Detection; Confidence Level; Disturbance Detection; Multi-Temporal; Time Series","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978066769"
