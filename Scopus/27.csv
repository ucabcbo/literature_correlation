However, it is labor-intensive for human experts and challenging for computer execution because of the blurry boundary and inhomogeneous luminosity of aurora. In this work, we formulate the automatic KLS extraction to learn a mapping from an all-sky auroral image to a KLS mask style with artificial intelligence technique. We explore the Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network to generate the KLS masks based on the unpaired training data set consisting of 2508 all-sky auroral images observed between years 2003–2009 at the Arctic Yellow River Station, of which only 200 images were manually annotated as the ground truth of KLS masks. The extracted KLS are consistent with human visual perception, and the intersection-over-union metric is significantly improved by at least 17% than previous method by Niu et al. (2018) (https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2018.2848725). Classification accuracy has been improved when combining the KLS masks further indicates the effectiveness and value of this work. ©2019.

Most of existing methods highly rely on massive labeled data which are scarce in many real world applications. It should also be noticed that progressive learning demands of existing data is very common today. That is, we may pay attention to more fine-grained information (like arctic tern, black tern, buttercup or tulip) in an existing data set with labels like 'bird' and 'flower'. It is reasonable to believe that the existing labels and model with transferable knowledge would be helpful to another related but different, fine-grained recognition task. In this context, an improved transfer deep learning approach with hierarchical multi-adversarial networks is proposed in this paper. With this approach, cross domain features are extracted by advanced deep encoders coarsely. After that, we annotate a small amount of images in the target domain, thereby creating the 'active labels' which can provide instructions for adversarial learning. Then, the GAN-based hierarchical model is utilized to select cross domain categories and enhance related features so as to facilitate an effective transfer. In order to exploit useful local features, a novel adaptive attention mechanism, Region Adversarial Network (RAN) which can select attention regions during adversarial learning and generate valuable fine-grained features, is introduced in the article. We call the proposed hierarchical framework 'Attentional Multi-Adversarial Networks (AMAN)'. Experimental results show that AMAN is able to augment cross domain features well-directly and build an effective classifier for fine-grained categorization in the target domain with fewer training samples and higher accuracies.  © 2013 IEEE.","Deep learning; Feature extraction; Hierarchical systems; Imaging systems; Radio access networks; Semi-supervised learning; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Attention mechanisms; Computer vision problems; Hierarchical model; Image Categorization; Progressive learning; Transferable knowledge; Transfer learning","attention; deep learning; domain adaption; Fine-grained classification; generative adversarial networks; transfer learning","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082923521"

There is a large amount of heterogeneous radar data from the polar regions that have been gathered through expensive missions. However, retrieving meaningful information from this large volume of data is still a great challenge. With the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, many scientists are eager to take advantage of these algorithms and techniques to explore and mine Arctic and Antarctic data. These advancements, however, have happened mainly in the area of supervised learning where the models are data hungry and require large amounts of annotated data. Generating simulated data can be an effective and inexpensive approach to provide large labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this work, we explore two approaches to simulate arctic snow radar echogram images, namely a radar scattering physics based approach combined with some statistical measures and a purely data-driven approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Using several image comparison metrics, we analyze the utility of both methods for the purpose of simulating echograms. Our results show that the physics simulator generates images with good structural similarities, while the purely data-driven approach achieves better textural similarities for simulated image. Finally, we also show that by augmenting our real dataset by the simulated echograms, we can improve our deep learning model for tracking internal layers of snow. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Remote sensing; Snow; Statistical Physics; Tracking radar; Data simulation; Data-driven approach; GAN; Large amounts; Polar Regions; Radar data; Radar remote sensing; Remote-sensing; Simulation; Snow radar; airborne sensing; computer simulation; radar; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; snow cover; Radar imaging","Generative adversarial networks (GANs); remote sensing; simulation; snow radar","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120072277"

Sea ice concentration is one of the important parameters to study the temporal and spatial change of sea ice. Accurately retrieving sea ice concentration is the innovation of this paper. At present, the high-resolution microwave-detected sea ice concentration product was provided by the University of Bremen, which was derived by the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTSIST) Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm based on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) 89-GHz brightness temperature data. The AMSR-E/AMSR-2 89-GHz brightness temperature data has higher spatial resolution, but it is often affected by cloud and water vapor, which affects the recognition and subsequent use of ground feature. Although the weather filters can remove some errors in the edge regions of the sea water and the sea ice, the errors of the sea ice concentration in other regions cannot be removed. The generative model of Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) increases the utilization of image feature information through skip connection, which improves the removal of the influence of cloud and water vapor. The discriminative model can retain the image feature information and realize the non-linear mapping from the image to the image. The loss function can reduce the pixel-level loss, which can remove the influence of cloud and water vapor. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN. Firstly, the relatively stable relationship between the 89-GHz brightness temperature data which is not disturbed or less affected by the external environment and the 36-GHz brightness temperature data was determined, and the 89-GHz brightness temperature data with large interference was screened. Secondly, based on the 36-GHz brightness temperature data with high reliability, the 89-GHz brightness temperature data with large interference was corrected through CGAN. Finally, the ASI algorithm was used to retrieve sea ice concentration. Compared with sea ice concentration retrieved by the ASI algorithm, the results showed that the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN was feasible. Compared with sea ice distribution obtained from the Landsat 8 OLI-L1T data, the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN significantly improves the inversion accuracy of sea ice concentration. The improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN makes use of the reliable 36-GHz brightness temperature data, which greatly reduces the error caused by cloud and water vapor, and the method effectively corrects sea ice concentration of the pixels affected by the external environment. Therefore, the improved ASI algorithm based on CGAN realizes high spatial resolution and significantly improves the inversion accuracy of sea ice concentration.

To understand the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of a deep learning model (i.e., DeepLabv3+) when applied to large areas or multiple regions, we conducted several experiments using training data from three different regions across the Canadian Arctic. To overcome the main challenge of transferability, we used a generative adversarial network (GAN) called CycleGAN to produce new training data in an attempt to improve transferability. The results show that (1) data augmentation can improve the accuracy of the deep learning model but does not guarantee transferability, (2) it is necessary to choose a good combination of hyper-parameters (e.g., backbones and learning rate) to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and (3) a GAN can significantly improve the transferability if the variation between source and target is dominated by color or general texture. Our results suggest that future mapping of retrogressive thaw slumps should prioritize the collection of training data from regions where a GAN cannot improve the transferability. © 2022 by the authors.
