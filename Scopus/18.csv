Hence, water level retrieval requires accurate detection of fractures in the sea ice (leads). This paper describes a thorough assessment of various surface type classification methods, including a thresholding method, nine supervised-, and two unsupervised machine learning methods, applied to Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter data. For the first time, the simultaneously sensed images from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument, onboard Sentinel-3, were used for training and validation of the classifiers. This product allows to identify leads that are at least 300 meters wide. Applied to data from winter months, the supervised Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, Naïve-Bayes, and Linear Discriminant classifiers showed robust results with overall accuracies of up to 92%. The unsupervised Kmedoids classifier produced excellent results with accuracies up to 92.74% and is an attractive classifier when ground truth data is limited. All classifiers perform poorly on summer data, rendering surface classifications that are solely based on altimetry data from summer months unsuitable. Finally, the Adaptive Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and Bootstrap Aggregation classifiers obtain the highest accuracies when the altimetry observations include measurements from the open ocean. © 2022 The Author(s).

Snow properties-snow grain size (SGS), snow particle shape (SPS) and specific surface area (SSA)-are derived under cloud-free conditions. XBAER-derived snow properties are compared to other existing satellite products and validated by ground-based and aircraft measurements. The atmospheric correction is performed on SLSTR for cloud-free scenarios using Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the aerosol typing strategy according to the standard XBAER algorithm. The optimal SGS and SPS are estimated iteratively utilizing a look-up-table (LUT) approach, minimizing the difference between SLSTR-observed and SCIATRAN-simulated surface directional reflectances at 0.55 and 1.6ĝ€¯μm. The SSA is derived for a retrieved SGS and SPS pair. XBAER-derived SGS, SPS and SSA have been validated using in situ measurements from the recent campaign SnowEx17 during February 2017. The comparison shows a relative difference between the XBAER-derived SGS and SnowEx17-measured SGS of less than 4ĝ€¯%. The difference between the XBAER-derived SSA and SnowEx17-measured SSA is 2.7ĝ€¯m2/kg. XBAER-derived SPS can be reasonably explained by the SnowEx17-observed snow particle shapes. Intensive validation shows that (1) for SGS and SSA, XBAER-derived results show high correlation with field-based measurements, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.85. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of SGS and SSA are around 12ĝ€¯μm and 6ĝ€¯m2/kg. (2) For SPS, aggregate SPS retrieved by XBAER algorithm is likely to be matched with rounded grains while single SPS in XBAER is possibly linked to faceted crystals. The comparison with aircraft measurements, during the Polar Airborne Measurements and Arctic Regional Climate Model Simulation Project (PAMARCMiP) campaign held in March 2018, also shows good agreement (with RCombining double low line0.82 and RCombining double low line0.81 for SGS and SSA, respectively). XBAER-derived SGS and SSA reveal the variability in the aircraft track of the PAMARCMiP campaign. The comparison between XBAER-derived SGS results and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow-Covered Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) product over Greenland shows similar spatial distributions. The geographic distribution of XBAER-derived SPS over Greenland and the whole Arctic can be reasonably explained by campaign-based and laboratory investigations, indicating a reasonable retrieval accuracy of the retrieved SPS. The geographic variabilities in XBAER-derived SGS and SSA both over Greenland and Arctic-wide agree with the snow metamorphism process. © 2021 Linlu Mei et al.","Arctic; Bremen; Greenland; atmospheric correction; essential oil; model validation; MODIS; Sentinel; snow cover; spatial distribution","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108239124"

Melting dynamics are directly related to a decrease in surface albedo, amongst others caused by the accumulation of light-absorbing particles (LAPs). Featuring unique spectral patterns, these accumulations can be mapped and quantified by imaging spectroscopy. We present first results for the retrieval of glacier ice properties from the spaceborne PRISMA imaging spectrometer by applying a recently developed simultaneous inversion of atmospheric and surface state using optimal estimation. The image analyzed in this study was acquired over the South-West margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet in late August 2020. The area is characterized by patterns of both clean and dark ice associated with a high amount of LAPs deposited on the surface. We present retrieval maps and uncertainties for grain size, liquid water, and algae concentration, as well as estimated reflectance spectra for different surface properties. We then show the feasibility of using imaging spectroscopy to interpret multiband sensor data to achieve high accuracy, frequently repeated observations of changing snow and ice conditions. For example, the impurity index calculated from multiband Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument measurements is dependent on dust particles, but we show that algae concentration alone can be predicted from this data with less than 20% uncertainty. Our study evidences that present and upcoming orbital imaging spectroscopy missions such as PRISMA, Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission, and the Surface Biology and Geology designated observable, can significantly support research of melting ice sheets. © 2022.

From this collection, we find a bare-ice albedo at ice-ablation onset (here called bare-ice-onset albedo) of 0.565 ± 0.109 that has no apparent spatial dependence among 20 sites across Greenland.

Here we show for the first time the regional variability in algal abundance across the dark zone in southwest Greenland, derived from Sentinel-3 images acquired during the summertime in 2016 and 2017. We demonstrate the capacity of Sentinel-3 imagery to characterize the spatial pattern of algal abundance using the reflectance ratios between 709- and 673-nm bands, highly consistent with field measurements.

Large-scale, long-term analyses are required to postulate if these incidents are merely peaks within the natural oscillation, or rather the consequence of a linearly rising trend. While extensive datasets are available to facilitate the investigation of the extent and frequency of wildfires, no means has been available to also study the severity of the burnings on a comparable scale. This is now possible through a dataset recently published by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This study exploits the possibilities of this new dataset by exemplarily analyzing fire severity trends on the Australian East coast for the past 20 years. The analyzed data is based on 3503 tiles of the ESA Sentinel-3 OLCI instrument, extended by 9612 granules of the NASA MODIS MOD09/MYD09 product. Rising trends in fire severity could be found for the states of New South Wales and Victoria, which could be attributed mainly to developments in the temperate climate zone featuring hot summers without a dry season (Cfa). Within this climate zone, the ecological units featuring needleleaf and evergreen forest are found to be mainly responsible for the increasing trend development. The results show a general, statistically significant shift of fire activity towards the affection of more woody, ecologically valuable vegetation. © 2021 by the authors.

The masking algorithm covers the Arctic, Antarctic and regions typically classified as the cryosphere such as northern hemisphere permafrost. The mask has been trained using collocations with the CALIOP active lidar, which in narrow strips provide more accurate detection of cloud, and was subsequently evaluated as a function of cloud type and surface type. The mask was compared with the existing operational Bayesian and Empirical cloud masks by eye and also statistically using CALIOP data. It was found to perform exceptionally well in the polar regions. The Kuiper skill score improved from 0.28, for the operational Bayesian and 0.17 for the Empirical masks to 0.77 for the NN. The NN algorithm also has a much more homogeneous performance over all surface types. The key improvement came from better identification of clear scenes; for the NN mask, the same performance in terms of contamination of cloudy pixels in the sample of identified clear pixels can be achieved while retaining 40% of the clear pixels compared with 10% for the operational cloud identification.

A challenge encountered during melt pond retrieval from optical satellite observations is the filtering of cloud which in the visible range of spectrum look similarly bright as the sea ice surface. Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR.

Unfortunately, the dissipation of wave energy is not well quantified and its possible effect on upper ocean mixing and ice drift is still mysterious. As the Arctic is opening up and wave energy increases, the limited amount of in situ observations is a clear limitation to our scientific understanding. Both radar and optical remote sensing has revealed the frequent presence of waves in ice, and could be used more systematically to investigate wave-ice interactions. Here we show that, in cloud-free conditions, Sentinel-2 images exhibit brightness modulations in ice-covered water, consistent with the presence of waves measured a few hours later by the ICESat-2 laser altimeter. We show that a full-focus SAR processing of Sentinel-3 radar altimeter data also reveals the presence and wavelengths of waves in sea ice, within minutes of Sentinel-2 imagery. The SWIM instrument on CFOSAT is another source of quantitative evidence for the direction and wavelengths of waves in ice, when ice conditions are spatially homogeneous. In the presence of sea ice, a quantitative wave height measurement method is not yet available for all-weather near-nadir radar instruments such as altimeters and SWIM. However, their systematic colocation with optical instruments on Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2, which are less frequently able to observe waves in sea ice, may provide the empirical transfer functions needed to interpret and calibrate the radar data, greatly expanding the available data on wave-ice interactions. © 2022 American Geophysical Union.

Our analysis has shown that the final product’s real uncertainties are significantly (≥100%) higher than the calculated errors of the ADG443_NN_err (~10%). The main reason is the unsatisfactory atmospheric correction. We present the analysis of the various influential factors (satellite sensors, processing algorithms, and other parameters) and formulate future work goals. © 2020 by the authors.

In this work, we present results from a new Snow Processor for SNAP. We also describe physical principles behind the developed snow property retrieval technique based on the analysis of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A/B measurements over clean and polluted snow fields. Using OLCI spectral reflectance measurements in the range 400'1020 nm, we derived important snow properties such as spectral and broadband albedo, snow specific surface area, snow extent and grain size on a spatial grid of 300 m. The algorithm also incorporated cloud screening and atmospheric correction procedures over snow surfaces. We present validation results using ground measurements from Antarctica, the Greenland ice sheet and the French Alps. We find the spectral albedo retrieved with accuracy of better than 3% on average, making our retrievals sufficient for a variety of applications. Broadband albedo is retrieved with the average accuracy of about 5% over snow. Therefore, the uncertainties of satellite retrievals are close to experimental errors of ground measurements. The retrieved surface grain size shows good agreement with ground observations. Snow specific surface area observations are also consistent with our OLCI retrievals. We present snow albedo and grain size mapping over the inland ice sheet of Greenland for areas including dry snow, melted/melting snow and impurity rich bare ice. The algorithm can be applied to OLCI Sentinel-3 measurements providing an opportunity for creation of long-term snow property records essential for climate monitoring and data assimilation studies'especially in the Arctic region, where we face rapid environmental changes including reduction of snow/ice extent and, therefore, planetary albedo. © 2019 by the authors.","Data handling; Glaciers; Grain size and shape; Ice; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Specific surface area; Uncertainty analysis; Albedo; OLCI; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel 3; Snow grain size; Snow","Albedo; OLCI; Optical remote sensing; Sentinel 3; Snow characteristics; Snow grain size; Specific surface area","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073417696"

Current spatio-temporal resolution of radar freeboard is limited as 30ĝ€¯d are required in order to generate pan-Arctic coverage from CryoSat-2 and 27ĝ€¯d are required from Sentinel-3 satellites. This therefore hinders our ability to understand physical processes that drive sea ice thickness variability on sub-monthly timescales. In this study we exploit the consistency between CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B radar freeboards in order to produce daily gridded pan-Arctic freeboard estimates between December 2018 and April 2019. We use the Bayesian inference approach of Gaussian process regression to learn functional mappings between radar freeboard observations in space and time and to subsequently retrieve pan-Arctic freeboard as well as uncertainty estimates. We also employ an empirical Bayesian approach towards learning the free (hyper)parameters of the model, which allows us to derive daily estimates related to radar freeboard spatial and temporal correlation length scales. The estimated daily radar freeboard predictions are, on average across the 2018-2019 season, equivalent to CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards to within 1ĝ€¯mm (standard deviationsĝ€¯<6ĝ€¯cm), and cross-validation experiments show that errors in predictions are, on average, ≤ĝ€¯4ĝ€¯mm across the same period. We also demonstrate the improved temporal variability of a pan-Arctic daily product by comparing time series of the predicted freeboards, with 31ĝ€¯d running means from CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards, across nine sectors of the Arctic, as well as making comparisons with daily ERA5 snowfall data. Pearson correlations between daily radar freeboard anomalies and snowfall are as high as +0.52 over first-year ice and +0.41 over multi-year ice, suggesting that the estimated daily fields are able to capture real physical radar freeboard variability at sub-weekly timescales.  © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic Ocean; Satellites; Bayesian analysis; CryoSat; observational method; satellite data; sea ice; Sentinel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108713285"

As a consequence, the quantity and the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is transported via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean is expected to change. Particularly in these remote permafrost regions of the Arctic, monitoring of terrigenous organic carbon fluxes is insufficient and knowledge of distribution and fate of organic carbon when released to the coastal waters is remarkably lacking. Despite its poorly evaluated performance in Arctic coastal waters, Satellite Ocean Colour Remote Sensing (SOCRS) remains a powerful tool to complement monitoring of land-ocean DOC fluxes, detect their trends, and help in understanding their propagation in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, we use in situ and SOCRS data to show the strong seasonal dynamics of the Mackenzie River plume and the spatial distribution of associated terrigenous DOC on the Beaufort Sea Shelf for the first time. Using a dataset collected during an extensive field campaign in 2019, the performance of three commonly-used atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms and two available colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) retrieval algorithms were evaluated using the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Our results showed that in optically-complex Arctic coastal waters the Polymer AC algorithm performed the best. For the retrieval of CDOM, the gsmA algorithm (Mean Percentage Error (MPE) = 35.7%) showed slightly more consistent results compared to the ONNS algorithm (MPE = 37.9%). By merging our measurements with published datasets, the newly-established DOC-CDOM relationship for the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region allowed estimations of DOC concentrations from SOCRS across the entire fluvial-marine transition zone with an MPE of 20.5%. Finally, we applied SOCRS with data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor to illustrate the seasonal variation of DOC concentrations in the surface waters of the Beaufort Sea on a large spatial scales and high frequency throughout the entire open water period. Highest DOC concentrations and largest lateral extent of the plume were observed in spring right after the Mackenzie River ice break-up indicating that the freshet was the main driver of plume propagation and DOC distribution on the shelf. Satellite-derived images of surface water DOC concentration placed the in situ observations into a larger temporal and spatial context and revealed a strong seasonal variability in transport pathways of DOC in the Mackenzie- Beaufort Sea region. © 2022 The Authors","Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Canada; Canadian Arctic; Mackenzie River [Northwest Territories]; Biogeochemistry; Catchments; Color; Dissolution; Oceanography; Organic carbon; Permafrost; Remote sensing; Beaufort sea; Carbon concentrations; Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic matters; Land-ocean flux; Mackenzie river; Ocean colour remote sensing; Satellite Ocean Color; Satellite ocean color remote sensing; Sentinel-3 ocean and land color instrument; coastal water; dissolved organic matter; remote sensing; seasonal variation; Sentinel; Rivers","Beaufort Sea; Dissolved organic matter; Land-ocean fluxes; Mackenzie River; Satellite ocean colour remote sensing; Sentinel-3 OLCI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140925391"

The aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the optical characteristics of aerosol loading. This paper describes a novel algorithm, which retrieves AOD above snow-covered regions from the measurements of the up-welling radiation at the top of atmosphere, observed by the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments. The algorithm optimizes the generic eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) approach for longer wavelengths over the cryosphere. The algorithm utilizes the characteristics of solar bidirectional distribution properties of snow and aerosol at wavelength 3.7 μm to derive above-snow-AOD. Since the impact of fine-mode aerosol on 3.7 μm is ignorable, the retrieved AOD in this manuscript represents mainly coarse-mode dominated part. A novel method to extract the solar reflection part at 3.7 μm is presented and used in the surface parameterization. Two aerosol types (sea salt-dominated and dust-dominated) are used and the best-fit type is derived by an iterative procedure, using a Look-Up-Table (LUT) approach. Sensitivity studies of the impact on the retrieved AOD using XBAER algorithm, which investigate the impacts of aerosol type, snow surface emissivity and potential cloud contamination under typical AATSR observation conditions, are presented. The sensitivity studies show that the surface parametrization and aerosol typing are suitable for the retrieval of above-snow-AOD over the Arctic snow-covered region. AOD observations retrieved in this study from AATSR (2002–2012) observation collocated with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over Greenland show good agreement. 72.1% of the match-ups fall into the expected error envelope of (±0.15AOD ± 0.025). The AATSR derived above-snow-AOD at 0.55 μm research product has also been compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol product, the Mineral Aerosols Profiling from Infrared Radiances (MAPIR) derived Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) AOD research product, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD simulations over Greenland on April 2011. The comparison reveals that all datasets show similar patterns for the AOD above Greenland. The AOD is smaller in central Greenland and larger over the coastline regions. The XBAER derived above-snow-AOD has improved coverage, as compared to that of the existing AATSR aerosol product. The transition between above-snow-AOD and AOD derived over surrounding ocean surfaces does not indicate any systematic errors. Two aerosol transport events have been well-captured by the XBAER derived above-snow-AOD research product. The new algorithm is also applied to the SLSTR onboard Sentinel-3 demonstrating new SLSTR above-snow-AOD data products, and its value for research in the changing AOD during the period of Arctic Amplification. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Arctic; Greenland; Amplification; Iterative methods; Land surface temperature; Optical properties; Optical radar; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Snow; Systematic errors; Table lookup; AATSR/SLSTR; Advanced-along track scanning radiometers; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol robotic networks; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Cryosphere; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; retrieval; aerosol composition; algorithm; CALIPSO; coastal zone; cryosphere; marine environment; optical method; remote sensing; snow cover; wavelength; Aerosols","AATSR/SLSTR; Aerosol optical depth; Arctic Amplification; cryosphere; retrieval","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079831320"

In order to find the best-performing method, an intercomparison exercise has been carried out in which the scientific community was asked to provide their best SEC estimates as well as feedback sheets describing the applied method. Due to the hitherto few radar-based SEC analyses as well as the higher accuracy of laser data, the participants were asked to use either ENVISAT radar or ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) laser altimetry over the Jakobshavn Isbræ drainage basin. The submissions were validated against airborne laser-scanner data, and intercomparisons were carried out to analyse the potential of the applied methods and to find whether the two altimeters were capable of resolving the same signal. The analyses found great potential of the applied repeat-track and cross-over techniques, and, for the first time over Greenland, that repeat-track analyses from radar altimetry agreed well with laser data. Since topography-related errors can be neglected in cross-over analyses, it is expected that the most accurate, ice-sheet-wide SEC estimates are obtained by combining the cross-over and repeat-track techniques. It is thus possible to exploit the high accuracy of the former and the large spatial data coverage of the latter. Based on CryoSat’s different operation modes, and the increased spatial and temporal data coverage, this shows good potential for a future inclusion of CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 data to continuously obtain accurate SEC estimates both in the interior and margin ice sheet. © 2015,Taylor & Francis.","Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Jakobshavn Isbrae; Catchments; Geodetic satellites; Glaciers; Radar tracking; Remote sensing; Routers; Space-based radar; Airborne laser scanners; Environmental satellites; European remote sensing; European Space Agency; Intercomparison exercise; Land elevation satellites; Scientific community; Surface elevation changes; CryoSat; drainage basin; elevation; Envisat; ice margin; ice sheet; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial data; Ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961290319"

Glacier algae have been suggested to play a critical role in darkening the ablation zone in southwestern Greenland. It was very recently found that the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) band ratio R709 nm=R673 nm can characterize the spatial patterns of glacier algal blooms. However, Sentinel-3 was launched in 2016, and current data are only available over three melting seasons (2016 2019). Here, we demonstrate the capability of the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) for mapping glacier algae from space and extend the quantification of glacier algal blooms over southwestern Greenland back to the period 2004 2011. Several band ratio indices (MERIS chlorophyll a indices and the impurity index) were computed and compared with each other. The results indicate that the MERIS two-band ratio index (2BDA) R709 nm=R665 nm is very effective in capturing the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of glacier algal growth on bare ice in July and August. We analyzed the interannual (2004 2011) and summer (July August) trends of algal distribution and found significant seasonal and interannual increases in glacier algae close to the Jakobshavn Isbrae Glacier and along the middle dark zone between the altitudes of 1200 and 1400 m. Using broadband albedo data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), we quantified the impact of glacier algal growth on bare ice albedo, finding a significant correlation between algal development and albedo reduction over algae-abundant areas. Our analysis indicates the strong potential for the satellite algal index to be used to reduce bare ice albedo biases in regional climate model simulations. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

As a dominant optical component of the AO, the variations in chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration affect the physiological state marine organisms. In this study, machine learning retrieval model based on in situ data and mixture density network (MDN) was developed. Compared to other models, MDN model performed better on test data (R2 = 0.83, and root mean squared error = 0.22 m−1) and was applied to Sentinel-3 OLCI data. Afterward, the spatiotemporal distribution of CDOM during the ice-free (June–September) from 2016 to 2020 in the Beaufort Sea was obtained. CDOM concentration generally exhibited an upward trend. The maximum monthly average CDOM concentration appeared in June and gradually decreased thereafter, reaching its lowest value in September of each year. The maximum value appeared in June 2020 (0.91 m−1), and the minimum value was observed in September 2017 (0.81 m−1). The CDOM concentration nearshore was higher than that in other areas; and gradually decreased from offshore to the open sea. CDOM was highly correlated with salinity (R2 = 0.49) and discharge (R2 = 0.53), and the tight correlation between salinity and CDOM further suggested that terrestrial inputs were the main source of CDOM in the Beaufort Sea. However, sea level pressure contributed to the spatial variations in CDOM. When southerly wind prevailed and wind direction was aligned with the CDOM diffusion direction, the wind accelerated the diffusion of CDOM into the open sea. Meanwhile, seawater was diluted by the sea ice melting, resulting in decrease in CDOM concentration. Herein, this paper proposed a robust and near real-time method for CDOM monitoring and influence factor analysis, which would promote the understanding of AO CDOM budgets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dissolved Organic Matter; Environmental Monitoring; Oceans and Seas; Salinity; Seawater; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Arctic Ocean; Beaufort Sea; Biogeochemistry; Dissolution; Marine biology; Mean square error; Melting; Mixtures; Offshore oil well production; Sea ice; Sea level; chromophoric dissolved organic matter; dissolved organic matter; ice; unclassified drug; sea water; Arctic ocean; Beaufort sea; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Controlling factors; High Latitudes; Hydrological cycles; Mixture density; Mixture density network; Regional climate; Sentinel-3; concentration (composition); dissolved organic matter; satellite data; seawater; Sentinel; spatial variation; Article; Beaufort Sea; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diffusion; dilution; factor analysis; machine learning; melting point; mixture density network; model; salinity; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; trend study; wind; environmental monitoring; procedures; sea; spectrofluorometry; Budget control","Beaufort Sea; Chromophoric dissolved organic matter; Mixture density network; Sentinel-3","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135865633"

This process, similar to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems, reduces the along-track resolution down to the theoretical limit equal to half the antenna length. We call this the fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) altimetry processing. The technique is directly applicable to SAR altimetry missions such as CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, or Sentinel-6/Jason-CS. The footprint of an FF-SAR altimeter measurement is a narrow strip on the surface, which is pulse limited across track and SAR focused along track. Despite the asymmetry of the altimeter footprint, the fully focused technique may be useful for applications in which one needs to separate specific targets within highly heterogeneous scenes, such as in the case of sea ice lead detection, hydrology, and coastal altimetry applications. In addition, over rough homogeneous surfaces, such as the ocean or ice sheets, the improved multilooking capability of FF-SAR leads to a significant increase in the effective number of looks with respect to the delay/Doppler processing, resulting in better geophysical parameter estimation. The proposed processing technique was verified by processing full bit rate CryoSat-2 SAR mode data over the Svalbard transponder. Hydrology, sea ice, and open ocean applications are also demonstrated in this paper, showing the improvement of this technique with respect to conventional and delay/Doppler altimetry. © 2016 IEEE.","Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Chemical detection; Hydrology; Ice; Image resolution; Meteorological instruments; Radar; Radar imaging; Sea ice; Altimeter measurements; Coherent processing; Geophysical parameters; Homogeneous surfaces; Lead detection; Processing technique; Theoretical limits; Track resolution; asymmetry; CryoSat; data processing; Doppler radar; ice lead; imaging method; Jason; open ocean; satellite altimetry; satellite mission; sea ice; Sentinel; spectral resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Synthetic aperture radar","Altimetry; delay/Doppler altimetry; SAR altimetry; Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990868168"

The SAR data also allows for a more detailed study of the ocean surface, since these make small-scale variations visible. Combined, data from the Sentinel-3 satellites creates a tremendous possibility for improving tidal models and mean sea surfaces near the coast, where these models are currently using extrapolation to provide information. However, some challenges are also becoming more apparent in areas where satellite altimetry have not previously been available. Such as the discrepancies between tidal models near the coast, which are amplified because the Sentinel-3 satellites fly in a sun-synchronous orbit. Acquiring satellite altimetry data in coastal and sea ice covered areas also highlights some issues with the current wet tropospheric correction, calculated from measurements by the on-board microwave radiometer, leading us to the conclusion that it is safest to use a WTC from a model – at least in coastal and sea ice prone areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Aneroid altimeters; Microwave devices; Orbits; Sea ice; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Coastal altimetry; FES2014; GOT4.10; Microwave radiometers; Satellite altimetry; Satellite altimetry data; Sentinel-3; Sun synchronous orbits; Satellites","Coastal altimetry; FES2014; GOT4.10; MSS; Sentinel-3; SLA","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081549281"

It is commonly assumed that radar pulses from satellite-mounted Ku-band altimeters penetrate through the snow and reflect from the snow-ice interface. We would therefore expect a negative correlation between snow accumulation and radar freeboard measurements, as increased snow loading weighs the ice floe down. In this study we produce daily resolution radar freeboard products from the CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 altimeters via a recently developed optimal interpolation scheme. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between radar freeboard anomalies and modeled snow accumulation. This suggests that, in the period after snowfall, radar pulses are not scattering from the snow-ice interface as commonly assumed. Our results offer satellite-based evidence of winter Ku-band radar scattering above the snow-ice interface, violating a key assumption in sea ice thickness retrievals. © 2023.

Here, we evaluated the capability of obtaining highly resolved in situ surface Chl-a using underway spectrophotometry operated during two summer cruises in 2015 and 2016 in the Fram Strait. Results showed that Chl-a measured using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was well related (R2 = 0.90) to the collocated particulate absorption line height at 676 nm obtained from the underway spectrophotometry system.

It' acts as a reflector of solar energy, mainly in spring and summer. Sea ice covered with fresh snow can reflect 75-90% of solar energy, the open sea reflects just 5-15%. Sea ice acts as an insulator in autumn and winter. This insulating effect limits the amount of both heat and moisture the ocean loses to the atmosphere. The declining sea ice disrupts the climate, societies and fauna of Polar areas, but encourages the econcmic and industrial development. The relevance of this study is related to current trends in the use of remote sensing in solving problems of a different nature in environmental monitoring. The sea ice was analyzed and mapped according to the European Space Agency data (ESA), acquired by sensors of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), Sentinel-2MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), Sentinel-3 and GIS. The subject of the study is to demonstrate the dynamics, during the summer season from 2015 to 2019, around the coastline of Livingston Island, New Shetland Islands in Antarctica and Longyearbyen in the Arctic. Changes in environmental objects are indicated by radar images through different processing approaches. The results clearly show that sea ice melting can be best recorded by using SAR data through the C-band. The results obtained are data in the form of thematic maps showing the spatial reflectance of sea ice and its dynamics over time.  © 2020 SPIE.","Dynamics; Insulator contamination; Maps; Reflection; Sea ice; Solar energy; Space optics; Synthetic aperture radar; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental objects; European Space Agency; Industrial development; Processing approach; SAR(synthetic aperture radar); Sea ice melting; Shetland islands; Remote sensing","Optical data; SAR data; Sea ice; Sentinel 2-MSI; Sentinel-1 SAR","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091226958"

The classification based on optical data has improved, so it is expected that the results will be ideally suited to be processed together with SAR data into significantly improved sea ice information products to support marine navigation. The usefulness of the combined processing is demonstrated by means of two simple algorithms and a more sophisticated approach is outlined, which will be realized in the future in order to form the basis for an integration into an operational service with the involvement of further partners and users. © 2021 by the authors.

Spaceborne optical instruments allow the continuous monitoring of the occurrence, distribution, and amount of Chl-a. In recent years, the Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3 (S3) A and B satellites were launched, which provide data about various aquatic environments on advantageous spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions with high SNR. Although S3 OLCI could be favorable to monitor high northern latitude waters, there have been several challenges related to Chl-a concentration retrieval in these waters due to their unique optical properties coupled with challenging environments including high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. In this work, we aim to overcome these difficulties by developing a machine-learning (ML) approach designed to estimate Chl-a concentration from S3 OLCI data in high northern latitude optically complex waters. The ML model is optimized and requires only three S3 OLCI bands, reflecting the physical characteristic of Chl-a as input in the regression process to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy in terms of the bias (five times improvements.) The ML model was optimized on data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, and showed promising performance. Finally, we present the performance of the optimized ML approach by computing Chl-a maps and corresponding certainty maps in highly complex sub-Arctic and Arctic waters. We show how these certainty maps can be used as a support to understand possible radiometric calibration issues in the retrieval of Level 2 reflectance over these waters. This can be a useful tool in identifying erroneous Level 2 Remote sensing reflectance due to possible failure of the atmospheric correction algorithm. © 2019 by the authors.","Chlorophyll; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optical properties; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Signal to noise ratio; Arctic; Atmospheric correction algorithm; Chlorophyll a; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Ocean color; Remote-sensing reflectance; Sentinel 3 OLCI; Spaceborne optical instruments; Machine learning","Arctic; Chlorophyll-a; Machine-learning; Ocean color monitoring; Sentinel 3 OLCI","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072647161"

Sentinel-3 altimeter data along with the Metop Advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) are jointly used to build the NRCS dependencies on the incidence angle for the selected sea ice samples.

Based on remote sensing data of the orbiting multi-source satellites, the observation capability of the sea surface wind and the ocean wave in the Arctic Ocean is analyzed from three aspects: spatial coverage of remote sensing observations, time coverage and remote sensing data merging. It is concluded as follows. The ASCAT and HY-2A scatterometers can be used for sea surface wind remote sensing observation in the Arctic seas and the multi-satellite joint observation can obtain the sea surface wind remote sensing data with the spatial and temporal resolution of better than 12 hours and 0.1° in the Arctic Ocean. Based on the HY-2A, CryoSat-2, SARAL and Sentinel-3 altimeters, the remote sensing observations of the Arctic seas waves can be realized. The multi-satellite joint observations can obtain the ocean wave remote sensing data of the spatial and temporal resolution of 1 day and 0.25° in the Arctic seas. Based on sea surface wind and ocean wave fusion data in 2016, it is concluded that sea surface wind and ocean wave in the Arctic seas are high from January to March and then decrease to the minimum in July, then gradually increase. The results show that sea surface wind and ocean wave in the Arctic seas can be monitored by multi-source scatterometers and altimeters with high spatial and temporal resolution. © 2018, Editorial Office of Haiyang Xuebao.

DOC plays an important role in the Arctic carbon cycle, and its export from land to sea is expected to increase as ongoing climate change accelerates permafrost thaw. However, transport pathways and transformation of DOC in the land-to-ocean transition are mostly unknown. We collected DOC and aCDOM(λ) samples from 11 expeditions to river, coastal and offshore waters and present a new DOC-aCDOM(λ) model for the fluvial-marine transition zone in the Laptev Sea. The aCDOM(λ) characteristics revealed that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in samples of this dataset are primarily of terrigenous origin. Observed changes in aCDOM(443) and its spectral slopes indicate that DOM is modified by microbial and photo-degradation. Ocean colour remote sensing (OCRS) provides the absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter (aCDOM(λ)sat) at λ=440 or 443 nm, which can be used to estimate DOC concentration at high temporal and spatial resolution over large regions. We tested the statistical performance of five OCRS algorithms and evaluated the plausibility of the spatial distribution of derived aCDOM(λ)sat. The OLCI (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) neural network swarm (ONNS) algorithm showed the best performance compared to in situ aCDOM(440) (r2=0.72). Additionally, we found ONNS-derived aCDOM(440), in contrast to other algorithms, to be partly independent of sediment concentration, making ONNS the most suitable aCDOM(λ)sat algorithm for the Laptev Sea region. The DOC-aCDOM(λ) model was applied to ONNS-derived aCDOM(440), and retrieved DOC concentration maps showed moderate agreement to in situ data (r2=0.53). The in situ and satellite-retrieved data were offset by up to several days, which may partly explain the weak correlation for this dynamic region. Satellite-derived surface water DOC concentration maps from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) satellite data demonstrate rapid removal of DOC within short time periods in coastal waters of the Laptev Sea, which is likely caused by physical mixing and different types of degradation processes. Using samples from all occurring water types leads to a more robust DOC-aCDOM(λ) model for the retrievals of DOC in Arctic shelf and river waters. © 2019 Author(s).","Arctic Ocean; Laptev Sea; absorption coefficient; algorithm; artificial neural network; climate change; coastal water; correlation; data set; MERIS; ocean color; performance assessment; remote sensing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068858521"
