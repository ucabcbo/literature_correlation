By injecting physical properties into the cycle consistent generative adversarial network (GAN), we were able to convert a cloudy multispectral image to a cloudless image. To recover information beneath clouds and shadows we create a synthetic multispectral space to obtain illumination invariant features. Multispectral vectors were transformed from Cartesian coordinates to Polar coordinates to obtain spectral angular distance (SAD) then we employed them as input to train the deep neural network (DNN). Afterward, the outputs of DNN were transformed to Cartesian coordinates to obtain shadow and cloud-free multispectral images. The proposed method, Hybrid GAN-SAD yields trustworthy reconstructed results because of exploiting transparent information from certain multispectral bands to recover uncorrupted images.  © 2021 IEEE.","Computer vision; Deep neural networks; Gallium nitride; Angular distance; Auxiliary data; Cartesian coordinate; Cloud removal; Corrupted images; Generative adversarial network; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Polar coordinate; Generative adversarial networks","Cloud Removal; Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs); Multispectral Satellite Images; Polar Coordinates","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129811525"

Current spatiotemporal fusion methods try to solve the contradiction between temporal resolution and spatial resolution, which cannot achieve good reconstruction accuracy partly because the data sources are from heterogeneous platforms with long chains difficult to be modeled. Different from the crossing-platform fusion, this work proposes to improve the spatial and temporal resolutions on a single platform. For the 2-m panchromatic images, 8-m multispectral images, and 16-m wide-field-view images captured by the Gaofen-1 satellite, our goal is to produce 2-m multispectral images with high temporal resolutions. Two convolutional neural networks are built to solve this spatiotemporal-spectral fusion issue with pansharpening and spatiotemporal fusion in serial. In the validation stage, the 2-m multispectral images are built and evaluated with the panchromatic images and 8-m multispectral images. The digital and visual evaluations show that our method can produce visually acceptable fusion quality, which may enhance the feasibility of the Gaofen-1 data.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Data visualization; Neural networks; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellites; Gaofen-1; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Pan-sharpening; Pansharpen; Sensor fusion; Spatial resolution; Spatio-temporal fusions; Spatiotemporal fusion.; Spatiotemporal phenomenon; accuracy assessment; model validation; panchromatic image; satellite data; satellite imagery; sensor; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; Image resolution","Gaofen-1; multispectral; pansharpen; spatiotemporal fusion","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122062661"

The characterization of vulnerability is traditionally accomplished using nationwide census exercises, a burdensome process that requires field visits by trained personnel. Unfortunately, most countrywide censuses exercises are conducted only sporadically, making it difficult to track the short-term effect of policies to reduce poverty. This paper introduces a definition of vulnerability following UN-Habitat criteria, assesses different CNN machine learning architectures, and establishes a mapping between satellite images and survey data. Starting with the information corresponding to the 2,178,508 residential blocks recorded in the 2010 Mexican census and multispectral Landsat-7 images, multiple CNN architectures are explored. The best performance is obtained with EfficientNet-B3 achieving an area under the ROC and Precision-Recall curves of 0.9421 and 0.9457, respectively. This article shows that publicly available information, in the form of census data and satellite images, along with standard CNN architectures, may be employed as a stepping stone for the countrywide characterization of vulnerability at the residential block level. © 2021 by the authors.

Sentinel-2 A/B images have been highly valued in the aspects of land surface vegetation and ecological monitoring at different spatial scales due to their advantages of free access, multi-spectral bands (especially the introduction of red edge bands), and finer spatial (10 m/20 m) and temporal (5-day) resolutions. Compared with Landsat and other similar satellite products, cloud coverage analysis of Sentinel-2 A/B has not been reported. In this paper, the cloud of 5288 Sentinel-2 A/B images (Granule/Tile) over northern Laos from 2016 to 2018 were used to determine the appropriate threshold of cloud coverage for image acquisition probability analysis under different cloud coverage thresholds (0~100%) based on GIS, aiming to reveal the spatial-temporal difference in acquisition probability. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Sentinel-2 A/B imagery was highly appropriate for land surface remote sensing monitoring with a cloud coverage threshold of 20% (i.e., cloud coverage is ≤ 20%). This threshold resulted in the largest monthly cumulative probability (~27.41%) of Sentinel-2 A/B images in northern Laos. (2) Using the threshold of 20% cloud coverage, the differences in monthly cumulative average acquisition probabilities of Sentinel-2 A/B images in northern Laos were consistent with the temporal distributions of dry season (November to April) and wet season (May to October). The acquisition probability was 42.91% in the dry season, with the largest in March (50.27%), followed by April and February. The fact that Sentinel-2 is featured by larger acquisition probability during the peak of dry season greatly facilitates the monitoring of dynamics in swidden agriculture and rubber plantations. The corresponding probability in the wet season was merely 11.81%, with the lowest in June (~1.26%). (3) Huge differences in monthly cumulative average acquisition probabilities of Sentinel-2 A/B images between the east and west of northern Laos were revealed. In the dry season, the image acquisition probabilities of the western provinces (e.g., Luang Namtha) were much larger than those of the eastern ones, while the situation was just the opposite in the wet season. This study can provide important reference for the large-scale (e.g. global) cloud coverage analysis of Sentinel-2 A/B images and the selection of Sentinel-2 images for monitoring land use change due to United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) in the tropics, including swidden agriculture transformation and rubber plantation expansion. © 2020, Science Press.

A new method (the TIP method) for cloud shadow detection in multi-spectral satellite images is presented and compared to current methods. The TIP method is based on the evaluation of thresholds, indices and projections. Most state-of-the-art methods solemnly rely on one of these evaluation steps or on a complex working mechanism. Instead, the new method incorpo-rates three basic evaluation steps into one algorithm for easy and accurate cloud shadow detection. Furthermore the performance of the masking algorithms provided by the software packages ATCOR (“Atmospheric Correction”) and PACO (“Python-based Atmospheric Correction”) is compared with that of the newly implemented TIP method on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe, covering a wide variety of environments and climates. The algorithms incorporated in each piece of masking software use the class of cloud shadows, but they employ different rules and class-specific thresholds. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or “truth”. The overall accuracies for the class cloud shadows of ATCOR and PACO (including TIP) for difference areas of the selected scenes are 70.4% and 76.6% respectively. The difference area encompasses the parts of the classification image where the classification maps disagree. User and producer accuracies for the class cloud shadow are strongly scene-dependent, typically varying between 45% and 95%. The experimental results show that the proposed TIP method based on thresholds, indices and projections can obtain improved cloud shadow detection performance. © 2022 by the authors.

The tested approaches include the combination of different image processing and classification methods, and takes into account cast shadows. The efficiency of these approaches is evaluated on mountain glaciers in the European Alps by comparing the results with manually annotated data. Solutions provided by the different approaches are robust when compared to the ground truth’s snow lines, with a Pearson’s correlation ranging from 79% to 96% depending on the method. However, the tested approaches may fail when snow lines are not continuous or exhibit a strong change of elevation. The major advantage over the state of the art is that the proposed approach does not require one calibration per glacier. © 2022 by the authors.","Image processing; Remote sensing; Snow; Spectroscopy; Support vector machines; Active contours; Glacier snow line; Machine learning approaches; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Neural-networks; Random forests; Satellite remote sensing; Snowline; SVM; Decision trees","active contours; glacier snow line; multi-spectral images; neural networks; random forest; satellite remote sensing; SVM","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137767258"

Clouds in optical remote sensing images seriously affect the visibility of the background and greatly reduce the usability of images for land applications. Traditional methods based on thresholding, multi-temporal or multi-spectral information are often specific to a particular satellite sensor. Convolutional Neural Networks for cloud detection often require labeled cloud masks for training that are very time-consuming and expensive to obtain. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a hybrid cloud detection method based on the synergistic combination of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and a physics-based cloud distortion model (CDM). The proposed weakly-supervised GAN-CDM method (available online https://github.com/Neooolee/GANCDM) only requires patch-level labels for training, and can produce cloud masks at pixel-level in both training and testing stages. GAN-CDM is trained on a new globally distributed Landsat 8 dataset (WHUL8-CDb, available online doi:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6420027) including image blocks and corresponding block-level labels. Experimental results show that the proposed GAN-CDM method trained on Landsat 8 image blocks achieves much higher cloud detection accuracy than baseline deep learning-based methods, not only in Landsat 8 images (L8 Biome dataset, 90.20% versus 72.09%) but also in Sentinel-2 images (“S2 Cloud Mask Catalogue” dataset, 92.54% versus 77.00%).

High-resolution imagery is however expensive to obtain, while lower resolution imagery is often freely available and can be used for a range of social good applications. To that end, we curate a multi-spectral multi-image dataset for super-resolution of satellite images. We use PlanetScope imagery from the SpaceNet-7 challenge as the high resolution reference and multiple Sentinel-2 revisits of the same location as the low-resolution imagery. We present the first results of applying multi-image super-resolution (MISR) to multi-spectral remote sensing imagery. We, additionally, introduce a radiometric-consistency module into the MISR model to preserve the high radiometric resolution and quality of the Sentinel-2 sensor. We show that MISR is superior to single-image super-resolution (SISR) and other baselines on a range of image fidelity metrics. Furthermore, we present the first assessment of the utility of multi-image super-resolution on a semantic and instance segmentation – common remote sensing tasks – showing that utilizing multiple images results in better performance in these downstream tasks, but MISR pre-processing is non-essential. © 2022 The Author(s)","Image segmentation; Object detection; Optical resolving power; Radiometry; Semantics; Building detection; Image super resolutions; Low-resolution imagery; Multi-image super-resolution; Multi-images; Multi-spectral; Radiometrics; Segmentation; Sentinel 2; Superresolution; detection method; image resolution; MISR; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; segmentation; Sentinel; Remote sensing","Building detection; Multi-image super-resolution; Segmentation; Sentinel 2; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141808181"

For this study, ten multispectral SPOT 6/7 satellite images with a medium resolution covering the coastal waters of the study areas were analyzed. These images were geometric, radiometric, and atmospheric corrected and acquired in three different sensing dates having coverage with at least 30% of lidar data. A number of 5284 random depth measurements with 0 to 50 meters depth were acquired for the ratio conversion algorithm with absolute depths and error assessment. A series of steps were performed to obtain reliable results using satellite optical data such as, sun glint process, land/sea extraction, kernel filters. The study area was divided into three sub-regions, based on the sensing date of the satellite imageries. The light attenuation in the water column increases at a depth of about thirty meters as seen in other related studies. This study identified the depth of light attenuation to determine the maximum depth that can be estimated through optical sensors. The results show that better correlation was identified up to 15 meters depth. Results of the regression analysis show the following correlation coefficients R²:0.90, 0.87, 0.80, and 0.89 with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the respective study areas to be 1.34, 1.53 1.70 and, 1.15.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In this study, object based classification method was applied to 2017 Sentinel 2 Level 2A satellite image in order to map crop types in the Adana, Çukurova region in Turkey. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used as a classifier. Texture information were incorporated to spectral wavebands of Sentinel-2 image, to increase the classification accuracy. In this context, all of the textural features of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) were tested and Entropy, Standard deviation, and Mean textural features were found to be the most suitable among them. Multi-spectral and textural features were used as an input separately and/or in combination to evaluate the potential of texture in differentiating crop types and the accuracy of output thematic maps.

The detection stage is based on the definition of a residual sequence calculated from the novelty filter. A statistical approach based on the NFA test is then employed to detect significant changes. We then use these detections to classify the changes according to their nature: unique or lasting.

Fractal dimension D f varies between 1.65 and 1.90 with high values for highly urbanised urban sectors and low ones for suburban and peripheral ones. Based on recently proposed models, the values of the fractal dimension D f are checked against the exponents β s and β i of the scaling law Y ∼N β , respectively for socio-economic and infrastructural variables Y, with N the population size. The exponents β s and β i are traditionally derived as if cities were zero-dimensional objects, with the relevant feature Y related to a single homogeneous population value N, thus neglecting the microscopic heterogeneity of the urban structure. Our findings go beyond this limit. High sensitive and repeatable satellite records yield robust local estimates of the urban scaling exponents.

The problem becomes even more complicated under the few-shot setting yet it has barely been studied to date. In this paper, we propose a colorization framework for the RS scene for synthesizing optical images from their panchromatic (PAN) counterparts using color injection and attention fusion mechanism. Our proposed model ensures that the synthesized optical images are coherent with the structural variability of panchromatic images while constraining the realistic appearance in the optical domain from a few training image pairs. To accomplish the same, we introduce a novel Dual Attention fusion of Receptive Kernels (DARK) which considers the spatial nuances along with color injection conditioned on prior label allocation. DARK is a multi spectral-spatial feature generator that selectively accentuates important cross-spatial features based on attention fusion. We also employ a prior distribution constraint on color embedding generation for introducing vibrant yet diverse variance in a color generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the publicly available EuroSAT and PatternNet datasets while demonstrating significant speedups. We showcase our results quantitatively by comparing the PSNR, mean squared error(MSE), and cosine similarity of generated images and qualitatively via visual perception.

However, existing fusion methods mainly use the average relationship from samples, which does not consider the differences in the relationships among samples. In this paper, a differentiated fusion method for determining satellite and ground spectral variables of soil salinity according to the differences among samples is proposed to increase the regional inversion precision. Nonnegative matrix factorization was employed to decompose soil salinity spectral variables from the Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) image and the simulated spectra on ground spectra. Then, the base spectra matrix of soil salinity was from the simulated data, and the weight coefficient matrix was obtained from the Sentinel-2A MSI data as the differentiated correction coefficients. By multiplying the base matrix and weight matrix, the spectral variables were reconstructed. The results indicate that this differentiated fusion method can not only enhance the correlation between soil salinity and Sentinel-2A MSI data but also improve the precision of regional soil salinity inversion models. For the differentiated fused model, the validation R2, RMSE, and RPD were 0.71, 7.02 g/kg, and 1.49, respectively; compared with the unfused model, the validation R2 increased by 0.09, the RMSE decreased by 0.80 g/kg, and the RPD increased by 0.18. Furthermore, the differentiated fused model performed better than the average-ratio adjusted model. These findings have practical implications for the use of multisource optical remote sensing data for regional soil salinity mapping and analysis. © 2021 The Author(s)","data inversion; remote sensing; saline soil; salinity; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spectral resolution","Data fusion; Hyperspectra; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2A MSI; Soil salinity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117313601"

At the same time, two representative test areas and 99 grid sample points were set, and the surface soil salinity data in wheat field and the multi-spectral images of UAV in the test area were collected. The sensitive spectral parameters were screened from four spectral bands (red, green, red edge, and near-infrared) and five spectral indexes (SI, NDVI, DVI, RVI, and GRVI). Stepwise regression, partial least squares, BP neural network and support vector machine methods were used to establish models for predicting the soil salinity, and the band ratio mean method was used to obtain the correction coefficient of the corresponding band of sentinel-2A satellite image. And then the selected soil salinity estimation model was converted into an inversion model based on satellite image. After using the data from the wheat field sample points to verify the models, the best soil salinity inversion model in wheat field was selected, and two scales of soil salinity inversion are realized in the test areas and the research area.[Result]The results showed that the four bands of UAV and the spectral indexes NVDI, RVI and SI were significantly correlated with soil salinity. Among the 13 models of the four modeling methods, the four index models established by NDVI, RVI and SI were better than the other models in modeling and verifying R2; The best inversion model was the spectral index model obtained by partial least square method: Y=-9.4774×NDVI1+ 0.4794×RVI1+ 3.0747×SI1+ 5.0604, and the accuracy R2 was 0.513 and RMSE was 1.379. By using this model, the soil salinity distribution map of the test area and the whole wheat area was obtained. Combined with the measured interpolation and the survey, the inversion model and spatial distribution results were proved to be accurate and reliable. [Conclusion]In this study, the soil salinity inversion model of the coastal wheat area based on the integration of satellite and UAV was constructed, which had positive reference value for the production and management of crops in the coastal saline area. © 2020 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

In a remote sensing field, conventional SR methods required high-quality satellite images as the ground truth. However, in most cases, high-quality satellite images are difficult to acquire because many image distortions occur owing to various imaging conditions. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive image quality modification method to improve SR image quality for the KOrea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3 (KOMPSAT-3). The KOMPSAT-3 is a high performance optical satellite, which provides 0.7-m ground sampling distance (GSD) panchromatic and 2.8-m GSD multi-spectral images for various applications. We proposed an SR method with a scale factor of 2 for the panchromatic and pan-sharpened images of KOMPSAT-3. The proposed SR method presents a degradation model that generates a low-quality image for training, and a method for improving the quality of the raw satellite image. The proposed degradation model for low-resolution input image generation is based on Gaussian noise and blur kernel. In addition, top-hat and bottom-hat transformation is applied to the original satellite image to generate an enhanced satellite image with improved edge sharpness or image clarity. Using this enhanced satellite image as the ground truth, an SR network is then trained. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by comparing it with other SR methods in multiple ways, such as edge extraction, visual inspection, qualitative analysis, and the performance of object detection. Experimental results show that the proposed SR method achieves improved reconstruction results and perceptual quality compared to conventional SR methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop an algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from satellite images. In this study, the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum and the capability of several multispectral satellite missions to distinguish them is first analyzed. The results show that the reflectance peak in visible wavelength is always in 550 nm for U. prolifera whether it is floating in clear open water or turbid nearshore water. However, the reflectance of Sargassum floating in clear and turbid water shows totally different characteristics, because most of Sargassum body is submerged in the water and the observed Sargassum reflectance is seriously affected by water reflectance. Compared with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), HuanJing-1, Charge-Coupled Devices (HJ-1 CCD), Aqua Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), GaoFen-1, Wide Field of View (GF-1 WFV) can preferably capture the spectral difference between U. prolifera and Sargassum. Based on the spectral difference analysis, we propose a random forest-based algorithm to distinguish U. prolifera and Sargassum from GF-1 WFV images with an overall accuracy of 97.6% except when U. prolifera and Sargassum mix together. The algorithm is more robust than the existing ones as it allowed more Sargassum samples from different ocean regions to be used in the training; in addition, it avoids negative effects caused by the selection of a threshold. The proposed algorithm is proved effective in distinguishing U. prolifera and Sargassum in the Yellow and East China Seas in May and June 2017 and in detecting Sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean. Thus, this method can be used in researches including floating macroalgae traceability and competition and succession between different macroalgae species in different regions of the ocean with similar environments.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Atlantic Ocean; East China Sea; Pacific Ocean; Yellow Sea; Charge coupled devices; Decision trees; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellites; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multispectral satellite image; Operational land imager; Overall accuracies; Spectral differences; Visible wavelengths; Water reflectances; Wide field of view; algorithm; Aqua (satellite); Landsat; machine learning; macroalga; MODIS; satellite altimetry; Sentinel; spectral reflectance; tide; Random forests","Machine learning algorithms; multispectral imaging; remote monitoring; tide","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104588080"

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are powerful machine learning approaches that have been successfully implemented in numerous fields of study. There exist many kinds of neural networks and there is no single efficient approach for resolving all geospatial problems. Therefore, this research aims at investigating and evaluating the efficiency of three ANN approaches, namely, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and Elman backpropagation recurrent neural network (EBPRNN) using multi-spectral satellite images for terrain feature classification. Additionally, there has been close to no application of EBPRNN in modeling multi-spectral satellite images even though they also contain patterns. The efficiency of the three tested approaches is presented using the kappa coefficient, user’s accuracy, producer’s accuracy, overall accuracy, classification error, and computational simulation time. The study demonstrated that all the three ANN models achieved the aim of pattern identification, segmentation, and classification. This paper also discusses the observations of increasing sample sizes as inputs in the various ANN models. It was concluded that RBFNN’s computational time increases with increasing sample size and consequently increasing the number of hidden neurons; BPNN on overall attained the highest accuracy compared to the other models; EBPRNN’s accuracy increases with increasing sample size, hence a promising and perhaps an alternative choice to BPNN and RBFNN if very large datasets are involved. Based on the performance metrics used in this study, BPNN is the best model out of the three evaluated ANN models. © 2021, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET).","artificial neural network; back propagation; computer simulation; image classification; machine learning; numerical model; remote sensing","Backpropagation neural network; Elman backpropagation recurrent neural network; Multispectral image classification; Radial basis function neural network; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100858339"

It can accurately reflect changes in hydrology, climate, and human activities, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The main goal of this paper is to review the remote sensing satellite sensors and the methods used for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover changes in arid and semi-arid. Arid and semi-arid lands are eco-sensitive environments with limited water resources and vegetation cover. Monitoring vegetation changes are especially important in arid and semi-arid regions due to the scarce and sensitive nature of the plant cover. Due to expected changes in vegetation cover, land productivity and biodiversity might be affected. Thus, early detection of vegetation cover changes and the assessment of their extent and severity at the local and regional scales become very important in preventing future biodiversity loss. Remote sensing data are useful for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover changes and have been used extensively for identifying, assessing, and mapping such changes in different regions. Remote sensing data, such as satellite images, can be obtained from satellite-based and aircraft-based sensors to monitor and detect vegetation cover changes. By combining remotely sensed images, e.g., from satellites and aircraft, with ground truth data, it is possible to improve the accuracy of monitoring and mapping techniques. Additionally, satellite imagery data combined with ancillary data such as slope, elevation, aspect, water bodies, and soil characteristics can detect vegetation cover changes at the species level. Using analytical methods, the data can then be used to derive vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring vegetation. © 2022 by the authors.","Aircraft; Arid regions; Biodiversity; Geographic information systems; Image enhancement; Monitoring; Satellite imagery; Vegetation mapping; Water resources; Arid and semi-arid areas; Arid and semi-arid regions; HyperSpectral; Mapping vegetations; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing data; Remote sensing technology; Remote-sensing; Vegetation cover; Vegetation cover change; Remote sensing","arid regions; GIS; hyperspectral; multispectral; remote sensing; vegetation cover changes","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140717536"

It is challenging in the medium spatial resolution. This work proposes a novel methodology named ‘6+’ for improving building extraction in 10 m medium spatial resolution multispectral satellite images. Data resources used are Sentinel-2A satellite images and OpenStreetMap (OSM). The proposed methodology merges the available high-resolution bands, super-resolved Short-Wave InfraRed (SWIR) bands, and an Enhanced Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (ENDISI) built-up index-based image to produce enhanced multispectral satellite images that contain additional information on impervious surfaces for improving building extraction results. The proposed methodology produces a novel building extraction dataset named ‘6+’. Another dataset named ‘6 band’ is also prepared for comparison by merging super-resolved bands 11 and 12 along with all the highest spatial resolution bands. The building ground truths are prepared using OSM shapefiles. The models specific for extracting buildings, i.e., BRRNet, JointNet, SegUnet, Dilated-ResUnet, and other Unet based encoder-decoder models with a backbone of various state-of-art image segmentation algorithms, are applied on both datasets.

It is an effective monitoring approach to recognize the land cover or land use of arid areas through machine learning methods using satellite images. However, there is no public classified dataset for arid areas currently, and hence remote sensing image monitoring in desert areas is restricted. Existing classification methods are not able to fully utilize effective features of satellite images and multi-spectral optical parameters. In this paper, our contributions are as follows: Firstly, we presented a new satellite dataset named the ARID-5 for arid area land cover/land use (LULC) classification, the LULC in arid areas included desert, oasis, Gobi, and water system. Second, we proposed a machine learning algorithm named the multi-dimensional multi-grained residual forest algorithm for LULC recognition on arid areas. In this algorithm, the multi-dimensional multi-grained structure was able to effectively extract image features and spectral information. The residual forest structure mapped probability feature vectors to higher levels for prediction, which effectively improved the reflection of the forest structure on the sample. At the same time, the base estimator was transmitted in cascade layers, and thus the diversity and the accuracy were improved. Experimental results proved that the multi-dimensional multi-grained residual forest showed good classification abilities. Last, we also tested our algorithm on SAT-4 and SAT-6 datasets, which proved the generalization performance of our algorithm. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arid regions; Classification (of information); Forestry; Land use; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Satellites; Turing machines; Classification ability; Classification methods; Generalization performance; Land use/land cover; Machine learning methods; Monitoring approach; Remote sensing images; Spectral information; algorithm; land classification; land cover; land use; machine learning; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Learning algorithms","Arid area; Land use/land cover recognition; Machine learning; Multi-dimensional multi-grained residual forest; Satellite image","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089744402"

In recent years, machine learning image classification has been increasingly used in land mapping and feature extraction showing advantages in many cases. In this paper we used a machine learning method for urban land cover classification using WorldView-2 imagery with 8 multispectral bands at 2-m resolution and a 0.5-m panchromatic band. The WorldView-2 imagery was acquired on 26 Jan 2020 covering a region of interest (ROI) in Singapore from 103°48'22.921""E to 103°51'48.901""E and 1°24'20.486"" N and 1°21'6.606""N was chosen in this study. After radiometric correction and spectral-preserving pan-sharpening, the pan-sharpened multispectral reflectance was used for classification. Eight classes (Tree, Grass, Cloud, Water, Building, Bare soil, Shadow and Road/Paved) were defined. A thousand samples, each with 11 spectral features wee extracted from the imagery. The features were 8 spectral bands from the pan-sharpened multispectral image plus NDVI = (NIR1 - Red)/(NIR1 + Red), REVI = (RedEdge-Red)/(RedEdge + Red) and NYVI = (NIR2 - Yellow)/(NIR2 + Yellow). Eighty percent of the samples were used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with depth 5 and kernel size 5 x 5 pixels. The remaining 20% were used for validation and an accuracy of 92.1% was achieved. The trained CNN was applied to classify the whole ROI and the result was compared to a ground truth map. Two regions were selected for accuracy assessment. One was dominated with man-made objects (Buildings and Road/Paved), the other mainly contains natural objects (Tree, Grass, Water and Bare soil).

In the past two decades, the water environment of Honghu Lake has been suffering from serious deterioration due to the rapid development of agriculture and industry in the urbanization of surrounding areas. Under the combined effect of multiple non-point source pollution and point source pollution, cyanobacteria blooms often occur here. As a proxy of eutrophication, chlorophyll-A (Chl-A) has been considered to be an important indicator of water quality parameters. For better understanding of the change of the water quality of Honghu Lake, an improved empirical model for estimating chlorophyll-A concentrations (Chl-A) from different multi-spectral satellites images was established and validated. (1) We combined the results of two-band algorithms(2BDA), three-band algorithms(3BDA), normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) and fluorescence line height (FLH) into support vector machine model (SVM) for better multi-nonlinear relationship establishment between Chl-A concentration and surface water reflectance, which acquired higher model accuracy.(2) Based on the long-Term time series data derived from Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, the variation of Chl-A concentration of Honghu Lake over long term was obtained. (3) Our results demonstrate that the average chlorophyll concentration has been at a very high level and showing an increasing tendency in recent years, which may indicate the eutrophication in the Honghu Lake is still getting worse.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The atmospheric correction is one of the fundamental and complicated topics, which helps to produce Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Top-of-Canopy (TOC) reflectance from multi-spectral image sets. Most remote sensing software provides algorithms or processing schemes dedicated to those corrections of the Landsat-8 OLI sensors. Furthermore, Google Earth Engine (GEE), provides direct access to Landsat reflectance products, USGS-based ARD (USGS-ARD), on the cloud environment. We implemented the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) atmospheric correction extension, an open-source remote sensing software for manipulating and analyzing high-resolution satellite images. This is the first tool because OTB has not provided calibration modules for any Landsat sensors. Using this extension software, we conducted the absolute atmospheric correction on the Landsat-8 OLI images of Railroad Valley, United States (RVUS) to validate their reflectance products using reflectance data sets of RVUS in the RadCalNet portal. The results showed that the reflectance products using the OTB extension for Landsat revealed a difference by less than 5% compared to RadCalNet RVUS data. In addition, we performed a comparative analysis with reflectance products obtained from other open-source tools such as a QGIS semi-automatic classification plugin and SAGA, besides USGS-ARD products. The reflectance products by the OTB extension showed a high consistency to those of USGS-ARD within the acceptable level in the measurement data range of the RadCalNet RVUS, compared to those of the other two open-source tools. In this study, the verification of the atmospheric calibration processor in OTB extension was carried out, and it proved the application possibility for other satellite sensors in the Compact Advanced Satellite (CAS)-500 or new optical satellites. © 2021 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.

The prediction of crop yield includes the extensive manual sampling or the use of remote sensing images at present. Particularly, the remote sensing is preferred to predict the large-scale crop yield, providing a large number of satellite images with long time and high spatial resolution. Much effort has been made on the crop yield prediction using remote sensing images and deep learning. However, the yield generally presents nonlinear spatio-temporal characteristics, due mainly to the growth status of crops changes with the time. A single deep learning cannot make full use of crop growth characteristics in multi-temporal images. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Networks - Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU) estimation model was proposed to extract rich spatial-spectral features from multi-spectral remote sensing images. The time dependence in the phase remote sensing image was also adaptively learned among the various stages in the growth period of winter wheat. As such, the growth characteristics of winter wheat were integrated from multiple scales, further to predict the yield. Furthermore, the main production areas of winter wheat in the country were taken as the research area, including 1 713 districts and counties. The forecast dataset of winter wheat production was finally constructed using the statistical output of winter wheat, MODIS surface reflectance, day and night surface temperature images, and land cover data from 2001 to 2018, thereby to verify the performance of CNN-GRU production estimation model. The results showed that: 1) The annual average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the CNN-GRU production estimation model from 2016 to 2018 were 818.3 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was reduced by 20.13%, 18.81%, 29.51%, 34.84%, and 36.57%, respectively, compared with the CNN, GRU, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT). Therefore, the CNN-GRU yield estimation model can be expected to accurately predict the winter wheat yield, further to effectively extract the space-spectrum-time information in the entire growth period of winter wheat from multi-temporal remote sensing images. 2) Six time windows were divided during the whole growth period of winter wheat, including the sowing-emergence, tillering-overwintering, green-rising, jointing-booting, heading-flowering, and filling-maturity period. Among them, the highest accuracy of CNN-GRU estimation model was found in the filling-maturation period. Specifically, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE were 817 and 556 kg/hm2, respectively, and R2 was greater than 0.7. However, the annual averages of RMSE and MAE during the heading-flowering period were 823 and 560 kg/hm2, respectively, where the annual average RMSE was 0.7% lower than the filling-maturation period. Therefore, the proposed CNN-GRU yield estimation model can accurately predict the output of winter wheat in the middle and late stages of growth period, particularly for the national yield of winter wheat two months in advance. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

With advancement in technology, monitoring degradation of coastal zones using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) has become a critical subject for scientific research. RS refers to the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft) while GIS is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. This paper reports an evolving Kenyan coastline over the past three decades using RS and GIS. Literature on chronological evolution and its impacts along this coastline is scanty and it is therefore envisaged that this work will instigate more enquiry into factors that were involved in landscape formation along the Kenyan coast. Prior reports indicate that research work done along this coastline were by field survey. We report a prograding beach on Mto Tamamba delta as displayed by multispectral Landsat imagery. The marine ecosystems, riparian communities and tourism industry are facing a major threat. The finding establishes hydrodynamic effects and human influence as key contributors of this menace. This study is aimed at detecting the coastline change using multispectral Landsat images from the years 1990 to 2021. For this purpose, coastlines belonging to these years were drawn numerically with the aid of GIS and RS on ENVI 5.3 software. We utilized maximum likelihood algorithm to categorize the images, and employed a time series methodology on classified endmembers to infer the presence of erosion and accretion. Using the image subset technique, areas prone to erosion and accretion within the coastal datum were identified and cut. The patterns of spatiotemporal trend of these endmembers were effectively employed to corroborate these findings. Change in distribution of endmembers over the 31 years' period was assessed using thematic change technique; an approach not previously applied in this study area. From the classified Mto Tamamba image, the pixel coverage area for each endmember was extracted. Validation using field campaign data gave an overall accuracy of 84% and kappa coefficient of 0.799. Taking into account that, the traditional methods of monitoring land degradation over a large area are time consuming and expensive; remote sensing data used in this study has offered alternatively cheap, consistent, reliable and retrievable data.  © 2022 D.

The primary environmental problem of the Caspian Sea is oil pollution which is determined by its natural properties, mainly by the presence of big oil and gas deposits beneath the seabed. Our research focuses on natural oil slicks (NOS), i.e., oil showings on the sea surface due to natural hydrocarbon emission from seabed seeps. The spatial and temporal variability of NOS in the Caspian Sea and the possibilities of their reliable detection using satellite data are examined. NOS frequency and detectability in satellite images depending on sensor type, season and geographical region are assessed. It is shown that both parameters vary significantly, and largely depend on sensor type and season, with season being most pronounced in visible (VIS) data. The locations of two offshore seep sites at the Iranian and Turkmenian shelves are accurately estimated. Statistics on individual sizes of NOS are drawn.

Satellite observations should help in understanding cloud responses, but decades and petabytes of multispectral cloud imagery have to date received only limited use. This study describes a new analysis approach that reduces the dimensionality of satellite cloud observations by grouping them via a novel automated, unsupervised cloud classification technique based on a convolutional autoencoder, an artificial intelligence (AI) method good at identifying patterns in spatial data. Our technique combines a rotation-invariant autoencoder and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to generate cloud clusters that capture meaningful distinctions among cloud textures, using only raw multispectral imagery as input. Cloud classes are therefore defined based on spectral properties and spatial textures without reliance on location, time/season, derived physical properties, or pre-designated class definitions. We use this approach to generate a unique new cloud dataset, the AI-driven cloud classification atlas (AICCA), which clusters 22 years of ocean images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua and Terra instruments—198 million patches, each roughly 100 km × 100 km (128 × 128 pixels)—into 42 AI-generated cloud classes, a number determined via a newly-developed stability protocol that we use to maximize richness of information while ensuring stable groupings of patches. AICCA thereby translates 801 TB of satellite images into 54.2 GB of class labels and cloud top and optical properties, a reduction by a factor of 15,000. The 42 AICCA classes produce meaningful spatio-temporal and physical distinctions and capture a greater variety of cloud types than do the nine International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) categories—for example, multiple textures in the stratocumulus decks along the West coasts of North and South America. We conclude that our methodology has explanatory power, capturing regionally unique cloud classes and providing rich but tractable information for global analysis. AICCA delivers the information from multi-spectral images in a compact form, enables data-driven diagnosis of patterns of cloud organization, provides insight into cloud evolution on timescales of hours to decades, and helps democratize climate research by facilitating access to core data. © 2022 by the authors.","Budget control; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Earth (planet); Earth system models; Learning systems; Optical properties; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Textures; Auto encoders; Cloud classification; Deep learning; Energy budgets; Future climate projections; Machine-learning; Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometers; Petabytes; Satellite observations; Uncertainty; NASA","artificial intelligence; cloud classification; deep learning; machine learning; MODIS","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142712956"

This paper identifies some specific regions of interest (RoI) of the earth's surface from the remotely sensed spectral or satellite image. The RoI are extracted and identified as major segments. Trivially, uni-variate histogram thresholding is used for gray images as a tool of segmentation. However, for color images multivariate histogram is effective to get control on color bands. It also helps emphasizing color information for clustering purpose. In this paper, the 2D and 3D histograms are used for clustering pixels in order to extract the RoI. The RGB color bands along with the infrared (IR) band information are used to form the multivariate histogram. Two datasets are used to carry out the experiment. The first one is an artificially designed dataset and the next is Indian Remotely Sensed (IRS-1A) satellite imagery. This paper proves the correctness of the proposed mathematical implication on the artificial dataset and consequently perform the application on LandSat Spectral data.

Many land use change models have been developed aiming at the accurate prediction of land use changes. This study is aimed at mapping land use changes during past years and predicting the future trends in the rural environment of the Dinevar region to support local decision makers. For this research, we used the archive of Landsat satellite images of 2000, 2006, 2012 and 2018 to investigate the land-use changes in and initial pre-processes such as geometrical correction, radiometric correction. PCA was utilised to reduce the bands and multi-spectral images were fused with panchromatic band using Gram-Schmidt method to increase spatial separation. Four land uses of agriculture, rocky lands, pasture and bare soil were extracted through maximum likelihood method and predictions are made using CA-Markov chain. Land use for 2018 was predicted and the results were compared with the field observations, to evaluate the validity of the prediction method. Finally, the prediction was conducted for 2024 and 2030 land use. The highest extent of changes in the study period (2000-2030) was related to the change from pasture to bare soil with 1689 hectares. Based on the results, 0.7499% of changes were occurred between 2000 and 2006, 0.8562% between 2000 and 2012, and remaining 15% from 2012 to 2018. It indicates that the highest rate of changes in the area occurred within 2000- 2006, while stagnation occurred in the period of 2006 to 2012. These changes increased during the last 5-years due to the promotion of rural life. The results show that human activity and lifestyle changes have caused many changes in LULC in the area.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the ability of the PRISMA hyperspectral imager to estimate topsoil properties (i.e., organic carbon, clay, sand, silt), in comparison with current satellite multispectral sensors. To investigate this expectation, a test was carried out using topsoil data collected in Italy following two approaches. Firstly, PRISMA, Sentinel‐2 and Landsat 8 spectral simulated datasets were obtained from the spectral resampling of a laboratory soil library. Subsequently, bare soil reflectance data were obtained from two experimental areas in Italy, using real satellites images, at dates close to each other. The estimation models of soil properties were calibrated employing both Partial Least Square Regression and Cubist Regression algorithms. The results of the study revealed that the best accuracies in retrieving topsoil properties were obtained by PRISMA data, using both laboratory and real datasets. Indeed, the resampled spectra of the hyperspectral imager provided the best Ratio of Performance to Inter‐Quartile distance (RPIQ) for clay (4.87), sand (3.80), and organic carbon (2.59) estimation, for the spectral soil library datasets. For the bare soil reflectance obtained from real satellite imagery, a higher level of prediction accuracy was obtained from PRISMA data, with RPIQ ± SE values of 2.32 ± 0.07 for clay, 3.85 ± 0.19 for silt, and 3.51 ± 0.16 for soil organic carbon. The results for the PRISMA hyperspectral satellite imagery with the Cubist Regression provided the best performance in the prediction of silt, sand, clay and SOC. The same variables were better estimated using PLSR models in the case of the resampled hyperspectral data. The statistical accuracy in the retrieval of SOC from real and resampled PRISMA data revealed the potential of the actual hyperspectral satellite. The results supported the expected good ability of the PRISMA imager to estimate topsoil properties. © 2022 by the authors.

This study presents the creation of surface water inventory for a part of Pune district (an administrative area), in India using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a multi spectral water indices method. Methods: A total of 13 Landsat 8 OLI cloud free images were analyzed for surface water detection. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) spectral index method was employed to enhance the water pixels in the image. Water and non-water areas in the map were discriminated using the threshold slicing method with a trial and error approach. The accuracy analysis based on kappa coefficient and percentage of the correctly classified pixels was presented by comparing MNDWI maps with corresponding Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) images. The changes in the surface area of eight freshwater reservoirs within the study area (Bhama Askhed, Bhatghar, Chaskaman, Khadakwasala, Mulashi, Panshet, Shivrata, and Varasgaon) for the year 2016 were analyzed and compared to GSWE time series water databases for accuracy assessment. The annual water occurrence map with percentage water occurrence on a yearly basis was also prepared. Results: The kappa coefficient agreement between MNDWI images and GSWE images is in the range of 0.56 to 0.96 with an average agreement of 0.82 indicating a strong level of agreement. Conclusions: MNDWI is easy to implement and is a sufficiently accurate method to separate water bodies from satellite images. The accuracy of the result depends on the clarity of image and selection of an optimum threshold method. The resulting accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm will improve with implementation of automatic threshold selection methods and comparative studies for other spectral indices methods. © 2022 Kulkarni R et al.","Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Environmental Monitoring; India; Satellite Imagery; algorithm; environmental monitoring; factual database; India; procedures; satellite imagery","Confusion matrix; Landsat 8 OLI; MNDWI; Otsu's Threshold; Surface water; Water index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146548569"

Forest fires destroy the forest’s wealth and affect the environment. They pose a threat, to fauna and flora, seriously. Forest fires are difficult to detect and thus have a long response time which leads to mass destruction. Hence, it has been a prominent research area with the aim of conserving ecology. In this paper, we have created a knowledge base for forest fire risk prediction and detection purposes by extracting different forest-fire-causing factors from Landsat 8 satellite imageries. With increasing forest fires incident everywhere, the main goal of constructing a domain-based knowledge base of forest fires is to have records of forest fires and relevant geographical, environmental, and demographical information systematically, to understand the behavior of forest fires so that they are more predictable eventually leading to quick response time and thus mitigating the loss due to forest fires. In our study, we have extracted texture features such as contrast, energy, entropy, correlation, color feature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) of Landsat 8 satellite images. All these feature extractions will help develop information systems on forest areas which include topographic, weather, vegetation data to predict the risk of forest fire. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Fires; Forecasting; Knowledge based systems; Land surface temperature; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Textures; Vegetation; Features extraction; Fire risks; Forest fires; LANDSAT; Landsat 8; Mass destructions; Multi-spectral image analysis; Normalized difference vegetation index; Research areas; Texture features; Feature extraction","Feature extraction; Knowledge base; Land surface temperature; Landsat 8; Multispectral image analysis; Normalized difference vegetation indices; Texture feature","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123374243"

Deep Learning (DL) based methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have recently received increasing attention in CD problems demonstrating high potential. However, most of the CNN-based CD methods are designed for bi-temporal image analysis. Here, we propose a Three-Dimensional (3D) CNN-based CD approach that can effectively deal with HR image time series and process spatial-spectral-temporal features. The method is unsupervised and thus does not require the complex task of collecting labelled multi-temporal data. Since there are only a few pretrained 3D CNNs available that are not suitable for remote sensing CD analysis, the proposed approach starts with a pretrained 2D CNN architecture trained on remote sensing images for semantic segmentation and develops a 3D CNN architecture using a transfer learning technique to jointly deal with spatial, spectral and temporal information. A layerwise feature reduction strategy is performed to select the most informative features and a pixelwise year-based Change Vector Analysis (CVA) is employed to identify changed pixels. Experimental results on a long time series of Landsat 8 images for an area located in Saudi Arabia confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © Authors 2022","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image analysis; Network architecture; Remote sensing; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Time series; Time series analysis; 3d convolutional neural network; Change detection; Change vector analyse; Change vector analysis; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; High-resolution images; Image time-series; Transfer learning; Deep learning","3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Change Detection (CD); Change Vector Analysis (CVA); Deep Learning; High Resolution (HR) Image; Transfer Learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131940906"

In recent years, the water quality of inland water has deteriorated, the eutrophication has intensified, and the algal blooms frequently occur. The research of remote sensing inversion of PC has attracted more and more attention. Therefore, it is urgent to sort out and write a comprehensive overview paper. In this paper, 178 relevant literatures were reviewed, and the development history and trend of PC remote sensing inversion research of PC in the past 30 years (1990-2020) were comprehensively summarized from the perspectives of PC optical characteristics, development of inversion algorithms, application of satellite sensors, difficulties and interference factors of quantitative remote sensing inversion of PC. This paper helps us to understand the new ideas and new methods emerging at home and abroad, master the new development trends of PC remote sensing inversion in the future, and provide data basis for the monitoring and management of water environment, water quality and water resources. Over the past 30 years, PC remote sensing inversion study number rising, and a breakthrough in the algorithm, has a lot of classic algorithms, such as band ratio method, the baseline method, nested band ratio method, biological optical model, derivative algorithm and machine learning algorithms, algorithm successfully isolated PC spectral characteristic of absorption coefficients at wavelength of 620 nm. Decreased the influence of other optically active substances (Chla、TSM) and obtained the high precision of inversion and validation. In addition, the development of PC inversion algorithms mostly based on in situ hyperspectral data or aerial images (CASI-2, AISA Eagle). In order to meet the needs of PC concentration distribution in a certain space and frequency, satellite image data sources are mostly used. PC. There are many types of multi-spectral satellite data sources to choose, such as Landsat series, MODIS, MERIS, Sentinel-2 MSI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, etc. However, due to the more appropriate band setting, MERIS and Sentinel-3 OLCI are still the most used data sources for PC remote sensing inversion research. Because PC spectrum signal is weak, and vulnerable to the interference of chlorophyll a, TSM, there is still a major difficult to get an accurate estimation result. Based on the above analysis, the future development direction of PC remote sensing inversion can be summarized as the following aspects: first, an international standard measurement method is urgently needed in PC extraction testing; secondly, the development of algorithm, adhere to the mechanism research related to the inherent optical properties, and the integrating machine learning algorithm to bring higher inversion accuracy; third, the scale of study area water body in space and time will toward a larger geographical space scale, longer time series history tracing and future prediction; fourth, at the aspect of the expansion of application, PC remote sensing inversion is not limited to the quantitative estimation of cyanobacteria biomass, but will predict distribution of algal toxins and related diseases based on the relationships between these parameters and PC concentration, furtherly establish a water risk factor rating system based on remote sensing in the future. © 2022, Science Press.

This high-resolution surface temperature over broader scales can usually be obtained via satellite remote sensing for historical period. However, it can be hard for future predictions. This article presents a physics informed hierarchical perception (PIHP) network, a novel approach for accurate, high-resolution, and generalizable urban surface temperature estimation. The key to our approach is leveraging the implied temperature-related physics information of the land surface structure from high-resolution multispectral satellite images, thus achieving precise estimation or prediction for high spatial resolution urban surface temperature. Specifically, a semantic category histogram is first designed to describe the land surface structures. Based on this, a hierarchical urban surface perception network is proposed to capture the complex relationship between the underlying land surface features, upper atmosphere conditions, and the intracity temperature. The proposed PIHP-Net makes it possible to generate models that can generalize across different cities, thus estimating or predicting high-resolution urban surface temperature when the satellite land surface temperature (LST) observation is not available. Experiments over various cities in different climate regions in China show, for the first time, errors less than 2 K (for most of the cases) at the high resolution (60-by-60 meters grids), thus making it possible to predict future intracity temperature from forcing meteorology and multispectral satellite imagery. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","China; Deep neural networks; Remote sensing; Risk perception; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Temperature distribution; Urban planning; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric modeling; Down-scaling; High resolution; Land surface; Land surface temperature; Multi-spectral; Multi-spectral satellite imagery; Spectral satellites; Urban areas; land surface; remote sensing; spatial resolution; surface structure; surface temperature; upper atmosphere; urban planning; Atmospheric temperature","Deep neural network; downscaling; land surface temperature (LST); multispectral satellite imagery","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137557483"

However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the “Copernicus module” of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are significantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level. © 2020 The Author(s)","Germany; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica rapa; Helianthus; Hordeum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum; Agricultural robots; Backscattering; Biology; Land use; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Search engines; Sugar beets; Surface measurement; Synthetic aperture radar; Backscattering coefficients; Land surface phenology; Mean absolute error; Multi-spectral data; Normalized difference vegetation index; Phenological observations; Spatial resolution imagery; Start of seasons (SOS); backscatter; data acquisition; error analysis; image resolution; phenology; satellite data; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; synthetic aperture radar; Crops","Agriculture; Crop phenology; DWD ground phenological observations; Europe; Land surface phenology; LUCAS survey; Satellite image time series; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097639924"

Such Agronomical issues affecting agriculture include agricultural management, national food policies, as well as the international crop trade-which is under the mandate of Food agriculture organization (FAO). Also, an increase in food demand due to the ever-growing population has contributed to the cultivation of large tracts of land. Thus has led to the evolution of diverse methods as well as systems deployed for prediction of crop yield including the application of satellite images. Satellite techniques are utilized due to their capacity to continuously cover large areas while providing accurate estimations of crop yields. In this context of crop yield estimations, the vegetation indices provided by the satellite sensors, as well as land surface variables such as weather elements, soil moisture, hydrological conditions, soil fertility, and fertilizer application is used. Where the convenience of data acquisition and high prediction accuracy is mandatory, many empirical models based on machine learning techniques were employed and the most successful methodology applied was the neural network. The neural network data input varied in the form of normalized histograms of a multi-spectral image bands, normalized vegetation index, absorbed active photosynthetic radiation, canopy surface, and environmental factors. Our findings indicate that the rapid advances in satellite technologies and ML techniques will provide affordable and comprehensive solutions for accurate grain prediction.

In this research, the electrical conductivity of 93 soil samples from 0 to 30 cm and 0 to 100 cm was measured using the hypercube technique at Sharifabad-Saveh Plain, Iran. Land area parameters such as TWI, TCI, STP, DEM, and LS were used as topographic variables and spatial indices of salinity and vegetation were derived from Landsat 8 images. Soil salinity off crops and gardens was determined at 0–30 cm and 0–100 cm. The data were divided into two series: the training set (70%) and the test set (30%). In order to model and predict salinity, models such as an artificial neural network (ANN), integration of neural network and genetic algorithm (ANN-GA), PLSR, and decision tree (DT) were used. The results of the models’ evaluation based on MSE and R2 indices showed that the ANN-GA model has the highest accuracy in predicting soil properties. This model improved the accuracy of soil salinity prediction by 28%, 42%, and 23% in 0–30 cm and by 20%, 28%, and 25% at 100 cm than ANN, PLSR, and DT.

The low-resolution bands can be upsampled to match the high resolution bands to extract valuable information at higher spatial resolution. This paper presents a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) based approach named as DSen2-WGAN to super-resolve the low-resolution (i.e., 20 m and 60 m) bands of Sentinel-2 images to a spatial resolution of 10 m. A proposed generator is trained in an adversarial manner using the min-max game to super-resolve the low-resolution bands with the guidance of available high-resolution bands in an image. The performance evaluated using metrics such as Signal Reconstruction Error (SRE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art method, DSen2 as the DSen2-WGAN reduced RMSE by 14.68% and 7%, while SRE improved by almost 4% and 1.6% for 6 (Formula presented.) and 2 (Formula presented.) super-resolution. Lastly, for further evaluation, we have used trained DSen2-WGAN model to super-resolve the bands of EuroSAT dataset, a satellite image classification dataset based on Sentinel-2 images.

However, previous CNN-based pansharpening methods mostly use an ordinary convolution, which has a small receptive field in the convolution layer, has insufficient contextual information, and can only extract shallow features, which is not conducive to learning the complex nonlinear mapping relationship between the input image and the fused image. Therefore, this study proposes a pansharpening algorithm based on a multiscale densely convolutional neural network (MDCNN). First, a two-stream network is used for feature extraction, with two convolution layers to extract spectral information from MS images. The multiscale convolutional feature extraction module is designed to extract the spatial detail features of the PAN images. Second, the proposed multiscale densely connected modules and residual modules are used as the backbone of the fusion network. Finally, the deep features generated are reconstructed, and spectral mapping is used to retain spectral information to obtain a high-resolution fusion image. Experimental results using three satellite image datasets show that the proposed algorithm generates high-quality fusion images, and it outperforms most advanced pansharpening methods in subjective visual and objective evaluation indexes.  © 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Extraction; Image fusion; Photomapping; Convolutional neural network; Dense module; Features extraction; Fusion image; Image feature extractions; Multi-spectral; Network-based; Pan-sharpening; Receptive fields; Spectral information; Feature extraction","convolutional neural network; dense module; feature extraction; image fusion; pansharpening","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116391570"

However, traditional methods for AGB measurement are time-consuming and only provide a low number of spatiotemporal measurements. Newly developed remote sensing platforms such as UAVs and new generation satellites allow unprecedented large-scale and frequent monitoring of rangeland vegetation that is typically produced in marginal lands characterized by high surface heterogeneity. This study used high-resolution UAV data and the new multi-spectral VENμS satellite to monitor AGB production for two consecutive years in a Mediterranean and semiarid grassland rangeland in Israel. We then studied the effects of grazing intensity and precipitation along the growing season on AGB. Data were collected from two long-term ecological research sites with plots under controlled grazing pressures (i.e., no grazing, moderate, and intensive grazing). We used high-spatial-resolution UAV imagery for land cover classification in order to mask different levels of mixed pixels in the VENμS satellite images along the growing season. A support vector regression model (SVM) for satellite-based AGB estimation was developed using more than 600 ground-truth AGB measurements collected during 2019–2020. The effect of the percentage cover for mixed pixel removal was examined. The results showed an improvement in the prediction model by 35% and reduced the RMSE by half for the support vector machine regression model's best prediction. The best AGB prediction results were achieved by including satellite pixels with over 50% vegetation cover. For the first time in Eastern Mediterranean rangelands, our study illustrates the benefits of high-integrated remote sensing data (i.e., satellite and UAV) for generating more accurate AGB estimations even in highly heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of surface cover. Such an approach can provide crucial and better information for sustainable rangeland management under varying spatiotemporal and climatic conditions. © 2022","","Aboveground biomass estimation; Grazing; Landscape heterogeneity; Machine learning; Mixed pixel; Sensor combination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129245892"

However, some current image fusion methods cannot fully utilize the spectral information and texture details of the original data. In order to overcome these problems, a fusion method based on space-spectrum information collaboration and Gram-Schmidt transform is proposed. In the proposed method, Sentinel-2A images and GaoFen-3 (GF-3) images are preprocessed by different methods. Since the gray co-occurrence matrix can effectively extract the texture information of the image, it is applied to the Sentinel-2A image to extract the structural features, and the multispectral image coordinated by the space-spectrum information is fused with GF-3 image by the Gram-Schmidt transform. Principal component analysis (PCA) and the traditional Gram-Schmidt transform are used as the comparison methods in this experiment. In order to determine the effectiveness of the fusion algorithm, this paper uses five evaluation indicators including average gradient, spatial frequency, mean, standard deviation and correlation coefficient to measure the quality of the fusion image. In addition, due to its excellent training speed and excellent classification performance, random forest is used for land cover classification. The classification accuracy of random forest, Kappa coefficient and classification result graph are used as the evaluation criteria of the fusion method. Experimental results show that, compared with the original Sentinel-2A alone, the proposed fusion method can improve the overall accuracy by up to 5%, and has the potential to improve the accuracy of land cover classification in remote sensing satellite images. © 2022, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

Widely used multi-spectral satellite image-based approaches for burned area detection have a problem in that they do not work under cloudy conditions. Therefore, in this study, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Europe Space Agency, which can be collected in all weather conditions, were used to identify forest fire damaged area based on a series of processes including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. Four forest fire cases, which occurred in Gangneung·Donghae and Goseong·Sokcho in Gangwon-do of South Korea and two areas in North Korea on April 4, 2019, were examined. The estimated burned areas were evaluated using fire reference data provided by the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS) for two forest fire cases in South Korea, and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for all four cases. The average accuracy using the NIFOS reference data was 86% for the Gangneung·Donghae and Goseong·Sokcho fires. Evaluation using dNBR showed an average accuracy of 84% for all four forest fire cases. It was also confirmed that the stronger the burned intensity, the higher detection the accuracy, and vice versa. Given the advantage of SAR remote sensing, the proposed statistical processing and K-means clustering-based approach can be used to quickly identify forest fire damaged area across the Korean Peninsula, where a cloud cover rate is high and small-scale forest fires frequently occur. © 2020 National Chengchi University.

However, there is currently no clear and definite method of image fusion for different aquaculture areas distribution extraction from high-resolution satellite images. This study uses three types of high-resolution remote sensing images, GF-1 (Gaofen-1), GF-2 (Gaofen-2), and WV-2 (WorldView-2), covering the raft and enclosure seines aquacultures in the Xiangshan Bay, China, to evaluate panchromatic and multispectral image fusion techniques to determine which is the best. This study applied PCA (principal component analysis), GS (Gram-Schmidt), and NNDiffuse (nearest neighbor diffusion) algorithms to panchromatic and multispectral images fusion of GF-1, GF-2, and WV-2. Two quantitative methods are used to evaluate the fusion effect. The first used seven statistical parameters, including gray mean value, standard deviation, information entropy, average gradient, correlation coefficient, deviation index, and spectral distortion. The second is the CQmax index. Comparing the evaluation results by these seven common statistical indicators with the results of the image fusion evaluation by index CQmax, the results prove that the CQmax index can be applied to the evaluation of image fusion effects in different aquaculture areas. For the floating raft cultured area, the conclusion is consentaneous; NNDiffuse was also optimal for GF-1 and GF-2 data, and PCA was optimal for WV-2 data. For the enclosure seines culture area, the conclusion of quantitative evaluations is not consistent and it shows that there is no definite good method that can be applied to all areas; therefore, careful evaluation and selection of the best applicable image fusion method are required according to the study area and sensor images. © 2022 by the authors.

MS sensors are limited to cloud free conditions, whereas SAR imagery is plagued by noise-like speckle. Prior studies that use combinations of MS and SAR data to overcome individual limitations of these sensors have not fully examined sensitivity of flood mapping performance to different combinations of SAR and MS derived spectral indices or band transformations in color space. This study explores the use of diverse bands of Sentinel 2 (S2) through well-established water indices and Sentinel 1 (S1) derived SAR imagery along with their combinations to assess their capability for generating accurate flood inundation maps. The robustness in performance of S-1 and S-2 band combinations was evaluated using 446 hand labeled flood inundation images spanning across 11 flood events from Sen1Floods11 dataset which are highly diverse in terms of land cover as well as location. A modified K-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of 32 combinations of S1 and S2 bands using a fully connected deep convolutional neural network known as U-Net. Our results indicated that usage of elevation information has improved the capability of S1 imagery to produce more accurate flood inundation maps. Compared to a median F1 score of 0.62 when using only S1 bands, the combined use of S1 and elevation information led to an improved median F1 score of 0.73. Water extraction indices based on S2 bands have a statistically significant superior performance in comparison to S1. Among all the band combinations, HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) transformation of S2 bands provides a median F1 score of 0.9, outperforming the commonly used water spectral indices owing to HSV's transformation's superior contrast distinguishing abilities. Additionally, U-Net algorithm was able to learn the relationship between raw S2 based water extraction indices and their corresponding raw S2 bands, but not of HSV owing to relatively complex computation involved in the latter.

Automating the building extraction process, however, has become attractive given the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of the CNN-based architecture U-Net and its variations, namely, the Residual U-Net, the Attention U-Net, and the Attention Residual U-Net, in automatic building extraction. We showcase their robustness in feature extraction and information processing using exclusively RGB images, as they are a low-cost alternative to multi-spectral and LiDAR ones, selected from the SpaceNet 1 dataset. The experimental results show that U-Net achieves a (Formula presented.) accuracy, whereas introducing residual blocks, attention gates, or a combination of both improves the accuracy of the vanilla U-Net to (Formula presented.), (Formula presented.), and (Formula presented.), respectively. Finally, the comparison between U-Net architectures and typical deep learning approaches from the literature highlights their increased performance in accurate building localization around corners and edges. © 2022 by the authors.","","attention residual U-Net; attention U-Net; automatic building extraction; residual U-Net; semantic segmentation; SpaceNet 1 dataset; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144536712"

The conventional approach to acquiring bathymetry data relies on field surveys. They are time-consuming and expensive. In many cases, field surveys are logistically difficult to carry out because river sites can be partially or even entirely inaccessible. The remote sensing approach offers a new opportunity to complement field surveys. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate estimating river bathymetry from satellite images. This paper uses a shallow reach of the Nicolect River near the Town of Victoriaville in central Quebec, as a site of study. We selected multi-spectral high-resolution satellite images that consisted of four spectral bands (red, green, blue and near-infrared) and were virtually free from cloud coverage. More importantly, they gave good conditions of sunlight penetrating the water body. We obtained correlations between frequency bands and field measurements of flow depths at a series of survey locations. The correlations permit the conversion of frequency band ratios to flow depths with optimal coefficients for the rest of the river reach. The results of bathymetry from this study are useful for addressing issues of the Nicolet River, related to sediment bedload transport, excavation pools, and restoration of fish habitats. In addition to bathymetry, detailed results of channel bathymetry can help identify locations of sediment erosion and deposition, and locations of riverbank instability. © 2022, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.","Bathymetry; Infrared devices; Location; Remote sensing; Satellites; Bathymetric data; Case-studies; Conventional approach; Field surveys; Flow depth; Hydrological response; River bathymetry; River environment; River hydraulics; Satellite images; Rivers","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132763590"

In this study, we explored the detection of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) outbreaks at the individual tree crown level using multispectral satellite images. Moreover, we explored the possibility of tracking the progression of the outbreak over time using multitemporal data. Sentinel-2 data acquired during the summer of 2020 over a bark beetle–infested area in the Italian Alps were used for the mapping and tracking over time, while airborne lidar data were used to automatically detect the individual tree crowns and to classify tree species. Mapping and tracking of the outbreak were carried out using a support vector machine classifier with input vegetation indices extracted from the multispectral data. The results showed that it was possible to detect two stages of the outbreak (i.e., early, and late) with an overall accuracy of 83.4%. Moreover, we showed how it is technically possible to track the evolution of the outbreak in an almost bi-weekly period at the level of the individual tree crowns. The outcomes of this paper are useful from both a management and ecological perspective: it allows forest managers to map a bark beetle outbreak at different stages with a high spatial accuracy, and the maps describing the evolution of the outbreak could be used in further studies related to the behavior of bark beetles. © 2022 by the authors.

Water hyacinth Eichhornia crassipes (Liliales: Pontederiaceae) appeared in Rwandan water bodies in 1957, and it was legislated and accepted as a problematic invasive species in Rwanda in 1999. Water hyacinth has led to a reduction in water quantity and threatened the livelihood of local communities that live off fishing. To comprehend the status of the water hyacinth invasion and assist management strategies, it is important to have detailed and consistent information on its spatio-temporal spread, magnitude, and rate of change dynamics in water systems. This was investigated using time series Landsat satellite images for the years 1989, 2002, and 2017. Image classifications using the nonparametric classifier random forest as well as change detection analysis were carried out to process the satellite data. The results revealed a fluctuation in the extent of water hyacinth over the time series of 1989, 2002, and 2017 with estimated percentage cover of 17.7%, 22.4%, and 20.8%, respectively. An annual increase of 1.9% in water hyacinth invasion was observed from 1989 to 2002; while, a decline of 1.7% per annum was observed from 2002 to 2017. The decline observed in 2017 could be due to manual control undertaken by the government since 2002. This study confirms the potential of using remotely sensed imagery as a valuable method for determining the change in the extent and distribution of invasive alien weeds over time. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Eichhornia crassipes; Liliales; Pontederiaceae; Decision trees; Satellite imagery; Time series; Waterworks; Change detection analysis; Eichhornia crassipes; LANDSAT satellite images; Management strategies; Multi-spectral imagery; Non-parametric classifiers; Remotely sensed imagery; Spatio-temporal variation; aquatic plant; invasive species; Landsat; multispectral image; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; Information management","Change detection; Invasive species; Magnitude change; Random forest; Spatial extent","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087623293"

The Mujib basin is considered as one of the major sources for water production in Jordan, while the agricultural production is the main consumer sector for water in the basin. High multi-temporal multi-spectral resolutions Sentinel-2b satellite images were used to identify the land use types using the supervised classification that applied on spring and summer growing season. The results show that the temporal NDVI curve is very useful in distinguishing between different crops type with high details, and is used in assisting the agricultural land use pattern. Multi-temporal NDVI images were used to identify the cropping pattern within the agricultural land using the unsupervised classification approach. The results show that the rainfed agriculture is confined in the high rainfall zones with one period of growing season, while the irrigated agricultural crops are spreading in the basin over the whole year with different periods of growing seasons. Irrigated vegetables and tree crops are the dominant agricultural crops in the basin with more than 70% of cultivated land. Most of the irrigated vegetables and trees are grown in the summer seasons under high temperatures conditions which consumes the highest percentage of irrigated water. These results show that the patterns of agricultural land use under Dryland regions are very essential issue in determining water consumption and management alternatives. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Jordan; Cultivation; Forestry; Land use; Vegetables; Water management; Water supply; Agricultural land use; Dry land; Growing season; Irrigated crops; Jordan; Land use pattern; Multi-temporal; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI; Water resources management; agricultural land; agricultural production; detection method; dryland farming; growing season; irrigation system; land use; NDVI; rainfed agriculture; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; Sentinel; unsupervised classification; Crops","Agriculture; Jordan; Multi-temporal analysis; NDVI; Water resources management","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124987626"

Buildings are the most prominent features in the urban environment, and are necessary for urban decision support; thus, buildings should be modeled effectively and efficiently in three dimensions (3D). In this study, with the help of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) high-resolution stereo mapping satellite double-line camera (DLC) images and multispectral (MUX) images, the boundary of a building is seg-mented via a multilevel features fusion network (MFFN). A digital surface model (DSM) is gener-ated to obtain the elevation of buildings. The building vector with height information is processed using a 3D modeling tool to create a white building model. The building model, DSM, and multi-spectral fused image are then imported into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to complete the urban scene level, vividly rendered with environmental effects for urban visualization. The results of this study show that high accuracy of 95.29% is achieved in building extraction using our proposed method. Based on the extracted building vector and elevation information from the DSM, building 3D models can be efficiently created in Level of Details 1 (LOD1). Finally, the urban scene is produced for realistic 3D visualization.

As 25% of global wetlands are located in Canada, accurate and up-to-date wetland classification is of high importance, nationally and internationally. The advent of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the current use of machine learning algorithms to classify complex environments, specifically in remote sensing. In this paper, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding the use of ensemble deep learning techniques for complex wetland classification and discusses the potential and limitation of various solo convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including DenseNet, GoogLeNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-ResNet, ResNet18, and ResNet101 in three different study areas located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (i.e., Avalon, Gros Morne, and Grand Falls). Moreover, to improve the classification accuracies of wetland classes of bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water, the results of the three best CNNs in each study area is fused using three supervised classifiers of random forest (RF), bagged tree (BTree), Bayesian optimized tree (BOT), and one unsupervised majority voting classifier. The results suggest that the ensemble models, in particular BTree, have a valuable role to play in the classification of wetland classes of bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water. The ensemble CNNs show an improvement of 9.63–19.04% in terms of mean producer’s accuracy compared to the solo CNNs, to recognize wetland classes in three different study areas. This research indicates a promising potential for integrating ensemble-based learning and deep learning for operational large area land cover, particularly complex wetland type classification. © 2021 by the authors.

However, how to effectively explore the wider spectrum bands of multispectral sensors to achieve significantly better performance compared to the use of only RGB bands has been left underexplored. In this article, we propose a novel DCNN model - multichannel water body detection network (MC-WBDN) - that incorporates three innovative components, i.e., a multichannel fusion module, an Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, and Space-to-Depth/Depth-to-Space operations, to outperform state-of-the-art DCNN-based water body detection methods.

In particular, time-critical disaster applications, require accurate and immediate cloud and cloud shadow masks while being able to adapt to possibly large variations caused by different sensor characteristics, scene properties or atmospheric conditions. This study introduces the newly developed open-source Python package ukis-csmaski for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation in multi-spectral satellite images. Segmentation with ukis-csmaski is performed with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network based on a U-Net architecture. It works directly on Level-1C data, eliminating the need for prior atmospheric correction. Images need to be in top of atmosphere reflectance and include at least the Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1 and SWIR2 spectral bands. We provide a performance evaluation on a recent benchmark dataset for cloud and cloud shadow segmentation and proof the generalization ability of our method across multiple satellites (Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2). We also show the influence of augmentation and image bands on the segmentation performance and compare it to the widely used Fmask algorithm and a Random Forest classifier.

Estimation of water-spread area and volume of the reservoirs using traditional methods like field surveys, acoustic surveys and hydrographic surveys is time-consuming, laborious and expensive. To overcome these problems, many researchers have used satellite images and the per-pixel (hard classification), the sub-pixel (soft classification) and the super resolution mapping approaches. The conventional hard and soft classification approaches do not give accurate results due to the presence of mixed pixels in the image scene of the periphery of the reservoir. In this work, a per-pixel algorithm (Maximum Likelihood), a sub-pixel algorithm (Fuzzy C Means) and a super resolution mapping algorithm (Genetic algorithm) are developed and the water-spread area is estimated for the reservoir using multi-date Landsat8 OLI images. The volume of the reservoir at different water levels are estimated using the water-spread area and the Trapezoidal formula. The capacity estimated from satellite image-derived area is compared with the capacity data obtained from the Poondi reservoir authority. The error in estimation due to the per-pixel approach is 16.74%, while it is 9.06% for the sub-pixel approach and a mere 3.25% for the super-resolution approach. Thus, the super-resolution mapping approach results in minimum error when compared to the sub-pixel approach which in turn gives lesser error result when comparing with the per-pixel approach. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Chennai; India; Tamil Nadu; computer simulation; drinking water; fuzzy mathematics; genetic algorithm; research work; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; water quality","satellite image; sub-pixel mapping; Super resolution mapping; water-spread area","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074952062"

Soil chemical properties analysis and forecast model was developed and validated with the Wavelet transform methods and multispectral satellite images. At the study area sites, satellite images and soil samples were collected during a similar time. Three most important soil chemical properties such as organic carbon, pH and EC were chosen to development of predication modeling based on the soil chemical information. This valuable information of parameters was analysed according to conventional methods. The observed data of soil was used for the predication modeling of soil chemical properties by MATLAB software. The identification of soil chemical properties was the subject of multi-spectral satellite images through algorithm of soil predication modeling. The real chemical characteristics of the soil are associated to wavelet transformation methods. Forecasting of soil chemical properties and this model can be given more accurate information related to soil nutrient parameters. Now a day's machine learning programming is an easy to applied on the natural resources and agriculture studies. The chemical characteristics of the soil are compared with the different spectrum wavelengths of the MATLAB program. Therefore, four wavelets models like Daubechies, Symlet, Biorthogonal and Coiflet were selected to development of predication modelling, which wavelet model can be given more accurate information with best model of the soil chemical properties. Also, the coefficient of five key components and soil-chemical values were associated in the MATLAB software. In the semi-arid regions in, India, which components have been highly correlated with soil parameters in the predicated modeling. More detailed information of soil chemical characteristics was provided by four selected wavelet models developed based on the observed data and satellite data. Prediction of soil chemical values has been identified through low and high-frequency satellite images and artificial neural network model. In this study, the neural network wavelet model was used to predicted values related to soil chemical properties in the semi-arid region. The developed two models, like polynomial and ANN, have been validated and compared to the soil chemical properties data, which models can be fitted with the study of soil chemical properties. The results of the study area can be more beneficial for development of agriculture activities, climate change approaches, crop and soil suitability planning. From the results of models have been given a fast and quickly information of soil nutrient parameters without laboratory analysis. The results of predicated values can be more helpful to precision farming related activates and soil fertility mapping to provide the farmers and agriculture scientist. © 2021 The Authors","","ANN; Correlation; Multispectral Image; Soil; Wavelet","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109682376"

Remote sensing technology can be an effective way to rapidly acquire the spatial distribution of soil texture. Taking the Youyi Farm in Heilongjiang Province of China as the study area, this study aims to evaluate the best time window for the remote sensing inversion of soil texture in the cultivated land. 25 Sentinel-2 images were selected in the study area from 2019 to 2021. The band and spectral index of each image were input into the random forest model, in order to establish a remote sensing inversion model of soil texture. A comparison was made on the model accuracy of soil texture inversion from the images in different periods. The most suitable image was determined for the remote sensing inversion of soil texture. The spatial distribution of soil texture was obtained to evaluate the accuracy of soil texture inversion from the Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images on different dates. The results showed that: 1) From the visible light to short wave infrared 1 (1 565-1 655nm) spectral reflectance increased with the increase of wavelength, from the short wave infrared 1 to short wave infrared 2 (2 100-2 280nm) spectral reflectance decreased significantly. The spectral reflectance decreased with the increase of silt and clay content, whereas there was an increase with the increase of sand content. 2) There was the maximum accuracy of inversion model in the silt and sand on May 7, 2020 (the coefficient of determination (R2) of silt was 0.785 in 25 Sentinel-2 images, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 6.697%; the R2 of sand was 0.776, and RMSE was 8.296 %). The maximum accuracy was also achieved in the clay inversion model on May 3, 2019 (R2=0.776, RMSE=1.600%). 3) The appropriate time of satellite images was selected as an important impact on soil texture inversion. The best time window was from late April to mid-May in the study area. The time window and good-quality spectral data were obtained to develop a stable spectral model for the spatial distribution of soil texture. 4) Different inversion accuracy of soil texture were obtained using the 25 Sentinel-2 images from 2019 to 2021. This data was attributed to the soil water content and straw mulching. 5) The silt and clay particles were distributed more in the northeast, north, and south, and less in the middle and southwest of the study area. There was the opposite trend of the sand, especially the generally high sand content in the middle of the study area. Therefore, the high-precision remote sensing inversion model was achieved in the soil texture. The finding can provide the key technologies for regional soil texture mapping and farmland protection in the black soil areas. © 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

We employ representation learning based on deep convolutional neural networks in an “end-to-end” fashion. Here, a crucial problem is handling the imbalance of the positive and negative classes appropriately in order to be able to obtain predictive results (which is not addressed by many previous machine-learning-based approaches). The resulting network outperforms previous methods based on physically based features and optical flow methods (similar to operational prediction models) and generalizes across different years. A closer examination of the classifier performance over time and under masking of input data indicates that the learned model actually draws most information from structures in the visible spectrum, with infrared imaging sustaining some classification performance during the night. © 2022 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Geostationary satellites; Learning systems; Lightning; Thermography (imaging); Class imbalance; End to end; Feature attribution; Lightning prediction; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Nowcasting; Property; Satellite images; Short-term forecasts; Forecasting","class imbalance; feature attribution; lightning prediction; machine learning; meteorology; neural networks; nowcasting; satellite images; short-term forecasts","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137094815"

Observing winds is a complex process and presents a large gap in NASA's Earth Observation System. Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) aim to fill this gap by making numerical estimates of cloud movement between sequences of multi-spectral satellite images, tracking clouds and water vapor. Recent imaging hardware and software advancements have enabled the use of numerical optical flow techniques to produce accurate and dense vector fields outperforming traditional methods. This work presents WindFlow as the first machine learning based system for feature tracking atmospheric motion using optical flow. Due to the lack of large-scale satellite-based observations, we leverage high-resolution numerical simulations from NASA's GEOS-5 Nature Run to perform supervised learning and transfer to satellite images. We demonstrate that our approach using deep learning based optical flow scales to ultra-high-resolution images of size 2881x5760 with less than 1 m/s bias and 2.5 m/s average error. Four network and learning architectures are compared and it is found that recurrent all-pairs field transforms (RAFT) produces the lowest errors on all metrics for wind speed and direction. Results on held out numerical outputs show RAFT's good performance in each of the spatial, temporal, and physical dimensions. A comparison between WindFlow and an operational AMV product against rawinsonde observations shows that RAFT transfers across simulations and thermal infrared satellite observations. This work shows that machine learning based optical flow is an efficient approach to generating robust feature tracking for AMVs consistently over large regions.  © 2022 Owner/Author.","Deep learning; Geostationary satellites; NASA; Numerical methods; Ocean currents; Optical flows; Wind; Atmospheric motion vectors; Atmospheric Winds; Deep learning; Energy-transport; Feature-tracking; Geostationary satellite imagery; Large-scale circulation; Machine-learning; Natural hazard; Physical phenomena; Satellite imagery","atmospheric winds; deep learning; geostationary satellite imagery; optical flow","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137150687"

Most of the practical fusion methods determine the optimal parameters based on the spatial and spectral characteristics of all original panchromatic and multispectral bands. However, for built-up and non-built-up areas (like cropland, forest) in one image, there may be large differences in their spatial and spectral characteristics, so their fused results are not optimal respectively with same parameters. To address above issues, this paper presents a high-resolution satellite image fusion method assisted with building segmentation. First, the proposed approach computes the average gradient and Gaussian filtering parameters of built-up and non-built-up areas separately according to the building segmentation results, on the basis of smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM). Then the intermediate data of two types of areas are computed in parallel and they are composited to obtain the final fused image, weighted by the pixel-wise “building factors” derived from the building segmentation results. Moreover, to better simulate the spatial characteristics of the multispectral image, we perform the “gradient simulation” operation to extract the gradient values in the multispectral image. Experimental results on Jilin-1 satellite images show that the proposed method provides competitive performance in spatial resolution, multispectral fidelity and quantity of information, as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in mainstream commercial software. © 2022 Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd.","Image fusion; Image segmentation; Modulation; Satellites; Building segmentation; High resolution satellite images; High-resolution satellite image fusion; Image fusion methods; Multi-spectral image fusions; Panchromatic-multispectral image fusion; Panchromatic/multispectral; Smoothing filter based intensity modulation; Spatial characteristics; Spectral characteristics; computer simulation; Gaussian method; image resolution; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; Buildings","Building segmentation; High-resolution satellite images fusion; Panchromatic-multispectral image fusion; Smoothing filter-based intensity modulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139228390"

The complex terrain and climatic conditions in mountainous areas where GLs are located make it difficult to employ conventional remote sensing observation means to obtain stable, accurate, and comprehensive observation data. In view of this situation, this study presents an algorithm with a high generalization ability established by optimizing and improving a deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation network model for extracting GL contours from combined synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) amplitude and multispectral imagery data. The aim is to use the high penetrability and all-weather advantages of SAR to reduce the effects of cloud cover as well as to integrate the multiscale and detail-oriented advantages of multispectral data to facilitate accurate, quantitative extraction of GL contours. The accuracy and reliability of the model and algorithm were examined by employing them to extract the contours of GLs in a large region of south-eastern Tibet from Landsat 8 optical remote sensing images and Sentinel-1A amplitude images. In this study, the contours of a total 8262 GLs in south-eastern Tibet were extracted. These GLs were distributed predominantly at altitudes of 4000–5500 m. Only 17.4% of these GLs were greater than 0.1 km2 in size, while a large number of small GLs made up the majority. Through analysis and validation, the proposed method was found highly capable of distinguishing rivers and lakes and able to effectively reduce the misidentification and extraction of rivers. With the DL model based on combined optical and SAR images, the intersection-over-union (IoU) score increased by 0.0212 (to 0.6207) on the validation set and by 0.038 (to 0.6397) on the prediction set. These validation data sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of the model and algorithm. The technical means employed in this study as well as the results and data obtained can provide a reference for research and application expansion in related fields. © 2020 by the authors.

This problem is persistent when the presence of some of the major land-cover classes affects the other recessive classes in a particular region and due to this the generated training set contains a fewer number of samples from the latter group of classes. Here, an adversarial auto-encoder has been used to generate synthetic samples from each of the minority classes so that each of the classes is well represented in the training set. A new training set has then been designed by including the ‘most confident’ artificial samples from the minority classes. This newly formed balanced training set is then shown to be more effective to classify the test samples as compared to the initially available imbalanced training set. The validation of the proposed approach has been performed using patterns collected from two multi-spectral satellite images captured by Ikonos-2 and landsat-8 satellites over different regions of India. The results show significant improvement in test class prediction when compared to that of other state-of-the-art imbalance handling schemes in land-cover classification. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Semi-supervised learning; Adversarial learning; Artificial samples; Class imbalance problems; Class prediction; Land cover classification; Learning-based approach; Multispectral satellite image; Number of samples; Classification (of information)","Adversarial auto-encoder; Adversarial learning; Class-imbalance problem; Deep learning; Land-cover classification","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089715774"

Space factors such as elevation, temperature, and spatial locations are usually used as input variables for a model to estimate the SSC. However, whether temporal patterns of salt-affected soils (identified as temporal spectral patterns) can indicate the SSC level and be applied as a covariate in a model to estimate the SSC remains unclear. Hence, temporal changes in soil spectral patterns need to be characterized and explored as to their use as an input variable to improve SSC estimates. In this study, a total of 54 field samples and a time-series of Sentinel-2 multispectral images taken at monthly intervals (from October 2017 to April 2018) were collected in the Yinbei area of western China. Then, two-date satellite images were used to quantify significant spectral changes over time using spectral change vector analysis, and four two-date-based index methods were used to characterize soil spectral changes. Lastly, the optimal two-date-based spectral indices and multispectral bands were used as input variables to build the estimation models using a random forest algorithm. Results showed that the two-date-based spectral index could be applied as an input variable to improve the accuracy of SSC estimation at a regional scale. Temporal changes in salt-induced spectral patterns can be indicated by the band difference in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 900 nm. Three two-date-based indices designated as D28a (i.e., the band difference between band 2 from an image acquired in April 2018 and band 8a from an image acquired in December 2017), D22, and D28 were the optimal parameters for characterizing salt-induced spectral changes, which were dominated by the total brightness, chloride, and sulfate accumulation of the soils. The model did not yield satisfactory estimation results (RPD = 1.49) when multispectral bands were used as the input variables. Multispectral bands coupled with two two-date-based indices (D22 and D28a) used as the input variables produced the best estimation result (R2 = 0.92, RPD = 3.27). Incorporating multispectral bands and two-date-based indices into the random forest model provides a remotely-sensed strategy that effectively supports the monitoring of soil salt content. © 2021 by the authors.

The spatial structure quality of HS images can be improved by fusing them either with higher-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images, or with higher-resolution multispectral (MS) images. Fusion of HS images can be done with fusion methods that are designed to fuse MS and PAN images, and the fusion methods developed for the fusion of HS and MS images. A wide variety of HS-MS and MS-PAN image fusion techniques can be used for the fusion of HS images, which leads the users to a hesitation as to which method(s) should be used for optimal fusion performance. Hence, the current study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the HS image fusion performances of a total of 15 MS-PAN image fusion methods and 17 state-of-the-art HS-MS image fusion techniques within four experiments, with the hope to give some clues on the performances of the fusion techniques used. Experiments showed that the HS-MS fusion methods exhibited much better HS image fusion performance, compared to the MS-PAN fusion methods used. It was also concluded that the coupled nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF), convolutional neural network (CNN) denoiser-based method (CNN-D), HS super-resolution (HySure) and fast fusion based on Sylvester equation with naive Gaussian prior (FUSE-G) techniques provided the most robust fusion results. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Hyperspectral imaging; Image fusion; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Fusion methods; Fusion performance; High resolution; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral image fusions; Image fusion methods; Image fusion techniques; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Remote-sensing; image analysis; image classification; image resolution; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; spectral analysis; Image enhancement","hyperspectral imaging; image enhancement; Image fusion; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136524797"

Satellite-based water turbidity monitoring can be conducted at a greater spatial extent and higher temporal frequency than field measurements. The new Planet Dove satellite constellation has a daily revisit frequency and higher spatial resolution than Sentinel or Landsat satellites, allowing Planet Dove to track water turbidity dynamics in greater detail when suitable atmospheric correction is provided. We developed a new shallow coastal water turbidity estimation algorithm for Planet Dove and similar multi-spectral satellites. Our algorithm accounts for bottom reflectance in total water-leaving radiance to derive turbidity values in shallow coastal waters. We tested the algorithm with data from 235 Dove satellite images at five sites with different water conditions (Pelekane Bay, Big Island, Hawai‘i; Hilo Bay, Big Island, Hawai‘i; Kilo Nalu and Ala Wai, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i; Fagatele Bay, American Samoa; Vieques Island, Puerto Rico). We then validated satellite-derived turbidity results (RMSE = 0.79–1.12 FNU [Formazin Nephelometric Unit]) using 75 days of field-measured data, ranging in turbidity from 0.1 to 11.6 FNU in the five sites. Results show that our algorithm accurately detects turbidity in critical nearshore environments. In Hawai‘i, we used ~6700 Dove images to support a weekly turbidity monitoring study at a large geographic scale. We found this new, shallow-water algorithm can be effectively applied to Dove satellite data to monitor water turbidity at high temporal resolution. © 2022 The Authors.

Because of the multi-spectral limitation, however, it is challenging to derive bathymetry over global shallow waters without reliable mechanistic algorithms. In this contribution, we present and test a physics-based algorithm for improved retrieval of bathymetry with multi-spectral sensors. The algorithm leverages the temporal variation of water-column optical properties in two satellite measurements. By incorporating two remote sensing reflectance spectra in an optimization procedure, it enhances the spectral constraining condition for the optimization, thus leading to improved retrieval accuracy. This scheme is evaluated using synthetic multi-spectral data. It is shown that the new approach can provide accurate estimation of water depths over 0–30 m range with three types of benthic substrates (corals, seagrass, and sand) and for a wide range of water column optical properties. Based on the degree of improvement, Landsat-8 appears to be benefited the most, followed by SNPP, and then Sentinel-3. The application of the new approach is demonstrated with satellite images over shallow waters (0–30 m) dominated with coral reefs, seagrass, and sand, respectively. This proof-of-concept study confirms the promise of multi-spectral satellite sensors for accurate water depth retrieval by accounting for the temporal characteristics in multiple measurements, suggesting a path forward for the derivation of bathymetry from the existing satellites over global shallow waters. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Anthozoa; Bathymetry; Optical properties; Orbits; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellites; Multiple measurements; Multispectral sensors; Ocean-color satellites; Optimization procedures; Remote-sensing reflectance; Satellite measurements; Shallow water bathymetry; Temporal characteristics; algorithm; bathymetric survey; Landsat; ocean color; satellite altimetry; satellite imagery; Sentinel; shallow water; spectral analysis; spectral reflectance; Suomi NPP; temporal variation; water column; Hydrographic surveys","Bathymetry; Landsat-8; Remote sensing reflectance; Sentinel-3; Shallow water; SNPP; Spectral optimization; Temporal variation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089341894"

High-resolution optical satellite images can provide fine spatial details within urban areas, while they have not been applied to building height estimation over multiple cities and the feasibility of mapping building height at a fine scale (< 5 m) remains understudied. Multi-view satellite images can describe vertical information of buildings, due to the inconsistent response of buildings (e.g., spectral and structural variations) to different viewing angles, but they have not been employed to deep learning-based building height estimation. In this context, we introduce high-resolution ZY-3 multi-view images to estimate building height at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. We propose a multi-spectral, multi-view, and multi-task deep network (called M3Net) for building height estimation, where ZY-3 multi-spectral and multi-view images are fused in a multi-task learning framework. A random forest (RF) method using multi-source features is also carried out for comparison. We select 42 Chinese cities with diverse building types to test the proposed method. Results show that the M3Net obtains a lower root mean square error (RMSE) than the RF, and the inclusion of ZY-3 multi-view images can significantly lower the uncertainty of building height prediction. Comparison with two existing state-of-the-art studies further confirms the superiority of our method, especially the efficacy of the M3Net in alleviating the saturation effect of high-rise building height estimation. Compared to the vanilla single/multi-task models, the M3Net also achieves a lower RMSE. Moreover, the spatial-temporal transferability test indicates the robustness of the M3Net to imaging conditions and building styles. The test of our method on a relatively large area (covering about 14,120 km2) further validates the scalability of our method from the perspectives of both efficacy and quality.

Landsat-7 has supplied multi-spectral imagery of the Earth’s surface for more than 4 years and has become an important data source for a large number of research and policy-making initiatives. Unfortunately, a scan line corrector (SLC) on Landsat-7 broke down in May 2003, which caused the loss of up to 22 percent of any given scene. We present a single-image approach based on leveraging the abilities of the deep image prior method to fill in gaps using only the corrupt image. We test the ability of deep image prior to reconstruct remote sensing scenes with different levels of corruption in them. Additionally, we compare the performance of our approach with the performance of classical single-image gap-filling methods. We demonstrate a quantitative advantage of the proposed approach compared with classical gap-filling methods. The lowest-performing restoration made by the deep image prior approach reaches 0.812 in (Formula presented.), while the best value for the classical approaches is 0.685. We also present the robustness of deep image prior in comparing the influence of the number of corrupted pixels on the restoration results. The usage of this approach could expand the possibilities for a wide variety of agricultural studies and applications. © 2022 by the authors.","Agriculture; Deep Learning; Imagery, Psychotherapy; Satellite Imagery; Telemetry; Agriculture; Deep learning; Image reconstruction; Remote sensing; Deep image prior; Deep learning; Filling methods; Gap filling; Image priors; LandSat 7; Performance; Remote-sensing; Single images; Single-image approach; agriculture; satellite imagery; telemetry; Restoration","deep image prior; deep learning; Landsat-7; remote sensing; single-image approach","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143670606"

Remote sensing imagery captured via satellites, drones, and aircraft has successfully influenced a wide range of fields such as monitoring vegetation health, tracking droughts, and weather forecasting, among others. Researchers studying the Earth's surface are often hindered while gathering reliable observations due to contaminated reflectance values that are sensitive to thin, thick, and cirrus clouds, as well as their shadows. In this study, we propose a deep learning network architecture, CloudNet, to alleviate cloud-occluded remote sensing imagery captured by Landsat-8 satellite for both visible and non-visible spectral bands. We propose a deep neural network model trained on a distributed storage cluster that leverages historical trends within Landsat-8 imagery while complementing this analysis with high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. Our empirical benchmarks profile the efficiency of the CloudNet model with a range of cloud-occluded pixels in the input image. We further compare our CloudNet's performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as SpAGAN and Resnet.

A new technique based on the buffer overlay method is also presented to determine the shoreline changes from different satellite images and obtain a time series for the shoreline changes. The shoreline detection model was applied to imagery from multiple satellites and validated to have sub-pixel accuracy using beach survey data that were collected from the Lake Michigan (USA) shoreline using a novel backpack-based LiDAR system. The model was also applied to 132 satellite images of a Lake Michigan beach over a three-year period and detected the shoreline accurately, with a >99% success rate. The model out-performed other existing shoreline detection algorithms based on different water indices and clustering techniques.

Every location worldwide can be freely monitored approximately every 5 days using the multi-spectral images provided by Sentinel-2. The spatial resolution of these images for RGBN (RGB + Near-infrared) bands is 10 m, which is more than enough for many tasks but falls short for many others. For this reason, if their spatial resolution could be enhanced without additional costs, any posterior analyses based on these images would be benefited. Previous works have mainly focused on increasing the resolution of lower resolution bands of Sentinel-2 (20 m and 60 m) to 10 m resolution. In these cases, super-resolution is supported by bands captured at finer resolutions (RGBN at 10 m). On the contrary, this paper focuses on the problem of increasing the spatial resolution of 10 m bands to either 5 m or 2.5 m resolutions, without having additional information available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution. For standard images, deep learning techniques have become the de facto standard to learn the mapping from lower to higher resolution images due to their learning capacity. However, super-resolution models learned for standard images do not work well with satellite images and hence, a specific model for this problem needs to be learned. The main challenge that this paper aims to solve is how to train a super-resolution model for Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exists (Sentinel-2 images at 5 m or 2.5 m). Our proposal consists of using a reference satellite with a high similarity in terms of spectral bands with respect to Sentinel-2, but with higher spatial resolution, to create image pairs at both the source and target resolutions. This way, we can train a state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network to recover details not present in the original RGBN bands. An exhaustive experimental study is carried out to validate our proposal, including a comparison with the most extended strategy for super-resolving Sentinel-2, which consists in learning a model to super-resolve from an under-sampled version at either 40 m or 20 m to the original 10 m resolution and then, applying this model to super-resolve from 10 m to 5 m or 2.5 m. Finally, we will also show that the spectral radiometry of the native bands is maintained when super-resolving images, in such a way that they can be used for any subsequent processing as if they were images acquired by Sentinel-2. © 2020 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Learning systems; Optical resolving power; Spectroscopy; Earth observation data; Higher resolution images; Learning techniques; Multispectral images; Posterior analysis; Reference satellites; Spectral radiometry; Super-resolution models; Image enhancement","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Multi-spectral image; Sentinel-2; Super-resolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091855430"

The present study assessed past and predicted future LULC and LST change in the Swabi District of Pakistan. LULC maps were generated from satellite data for years 1987, 2002, and 2017 using supervised classification. Mean LST and its areal change were estimated for different LULC classes from thermal bands of satellite images. LULC and LST were projected for the year 2047 using the integrated weighted evidence-cellular automata (WE-CA) model and a regression equation developed in this study, respectively. LULC change revealed an increase of > 5% in the built-up while a decrease in the agricultural area by ~ 9%. There was an increase of ~ 63% area in the LST class ≥ 27 °C which may create urban heat island (UHI). Simulation results indicated that the built-up area will further be increased by ~ 3% until 2047. Area associated with LST class > 30 °C indicated a further increase of ~ 38% till 2047 with reference to year 2017.

AGC ground truth was acquired for 85 plots in a small study area in the Baviaanskloof, South Africa. Using the ground truth, univariate and multivariate snapshot models were developed to predict AGC from features in a 2017 WorldView-3 (0.34-m resolution 8-band) satellite image.

In particular, VIs can show saturation behaviour at medium/high vegetation density.

However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediterranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of environmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3% and 14.6% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2–82.7% overall accuracy.

Complications arise while incorporating multispectral datasets for regional-scale spatial assessment of soil macronutrients. Sporadically satellite image fusion techniques have been used for soil nutrient interpolation to circumvent the complications. The fusion of multispectral bands encompasses precise soil information that cannot be observed as accurate with single satellite dataset. In this study, fusion of near infrared regions of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel 2 has been observed for its contribution on soil macronutrient assessments. Area-to-point regression Kriging (ATPRK) approach is followed in fusing the two satellite imagery and in situ soil spectral have used for the validation of the resultant. Comparative statistical analysis on Landsat 8 OLI band 5 (wavelength: 845–885 nm), Sentine-2 band 8,8A (wavelength: 785–900 nm) datasets and fused satellite bands provides R2 values of 0.8209, 0.8436, and 0.8763 respectively.

The objective of this study was to determine the seasonally inundated hydroperiod for a floodplain section (28.66 km2) of the Upper Columbia River wetlands complex using time series satellite image observations and binary open water mask extraction. A mid pixel resolution (30 m) optical satellite image time series of 61 clear sky scenes from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors were used to map temporal variations in floodplain open water wetland extent during the April to October hydrologically active season from 1984 to 2019 (35 years). The hydroperiod from the first 31 scenes (T1: 18 years) was compared to the second 30 (T2: 16 years) to identify changes in the permanent and seasonal open water bodies. The seasonal variation in open water extent and duration was similar across the two time periods but the permanent water body extent diminished by ~16% (or ~3.5% of the floodplain). A simple linear model (r2 = 0.87) was established to predict floodplain open water extent as a function of river discharge downstream of the case study area. Four years of Landsat Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS) data from 1992 to 1995 (12 scenes) were examined to evaluate the feasibility of extending the hydroperiod record back to 1972 using lower resolution (60 m) archive data. While the MSS hydroperiod produced a similar pattern of open water area to duration to the TM/OLI hydroperiod, small open water features were omitted or expanded due to the lower resolution. While MSS could potentially extend the TM/OLI hydroperiod record, this was not performed as the loss of features like the river channel diminished its value for change detection purposes. Radarsat 2 scenes from 2015 to 2019 were examined to evaluate the feasibility of continued mountain valley hydroperiod monitoring using higher spatial and temporal resolution sensors like the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM). From the available horizontal transmit/receive (HH) single polarization sample set (8 scenes), the hydroperiod pattern of open water extent to duration was similar to the longer Landsat time series and possessed greater feature detail, but it was significantly reduced in seasonal inundation area due to the systematic omission of open water areas containing emergent vegetation. However, accepting that differences exist in sensor-based hydroperiod attributes, the higher temporal resolution of RCM will be suited to mountain floodplain inundation monitoring and open water hydroperiod analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

Image statistical parameters related to first-order image statistics, that is, mean (μ), SD (σ), and variance (σ2) are used to obtain the feature values for both original images and their encrypted versions. Multispectral satellite images generally contain a wide range of bands, which is 9 to 11 specifically for the Landsat 8 satellite. Hence, the information content of these images is richer than typical images. Through this algorithm, we aim to reduce the image content by randomly selecting only 10% of the total image pixels. These pixels are used to create new images, the so-called encrypted images. The visual presentation of the encrypted image resembles a noisy picture. First-order image statistics are calculated for both original images and their encrypted counterparts. These parameters show a similarity in their numerical values for both original and encrypted images. Thus, noisy pictures can be used for transmission in place of the original image when an outcome is decided through statistical image features. The visual similarity in the original images and encrypted images is obtained from the histogram signature plot for both original and encrypted images. The proposed algorithm can hence be used to convert image data for secure transmission and privacy. © 2020 The Authors.

Single band methods, spectral index methods, classification using machine learning and spectral un-mixing methods are the widely used strategies for surface water mapping from multi-spectral images. Level set theory based algorithms have been successfully employed in image segmentation problems and are proven to be effective. This study presents a hybrid level set theory based segmentation algorithm which is a combination of edge based and region based approaches to detect and delineate surface water bodies in Landsat 8 images. Level set algorithms were applied in combination with Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to further improve the delineation accuracy. Robustness of the proposed approach was established by successfully applying the algorithm to delineate water bodies of different sizes, ranging from 0.5 km2 to 298 km2 in surface area. The proposed algorithm was also compared with established machine learning based delineation methods and found to be faster than the algorithms those produced comparable delineation outputs. As the ground truth was not available for accuracy measurement, the output image of the proposed method was compared with the outputs of the machine learning algorithms using Pearsons correlation co-efficient, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Dice Similarity Index. The proposed algorithm was subsequently applied to multi-temporal Landsat data for water body change detection and analysis. © 2021, International Association of Engineers.

This is a boon to the domains like Earth Observation (EO), where labelled data availability is scarce but unlabelled data is freely available. While Transfer Learning from generic RGB pre-trained models is still common-place in EO, we argue that, it is essential to have good EO domain specific pre-trained model in order to use with downstream tasks with limited labelled data. Hence, we explored the applicability of SSL with multi-modal satellite imagery for downstream tasks. For this we utilised the state-of-art SSL architectures i.e. BYOL and SimSiam to train on EO data. Also to obtain better invariant representations, we considered multi-spectral (MS) images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as separate augmented views of an image to maximise their similarity. Our work shows that by learning single channel representations through non-contrastive learning, our approach can outperform ImageNet pre-trained models significantly on a scene classification task. We further explored the usefulness of a momentum encoder by comparing the two architectures i.e. BYOL and SimSiam but did not identify a significant improvement in performance between the models. © 2021 IEEE","","Satellite images; Self-supervised learning; Unsupervised learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126055646"

Yet, despite the increasing accuracy of digital soil mapping (DSM) in recent years, generating regional-scale, high-accuracy soil maps remains a challenging task. Our study objective was to propose a new DSM method based on temporal-spatial-spectral (TSS) data and to compare the DSM result with a legacy soil map of China. In this study, 13 Landsat multispectral data from 2000 to 2019 were fused by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to obtain temporal information, a shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (SRTM-DEM) was used as spatial information, and Gaofen-5 satellite hyperspectral data was used as spectral information. TSS information was obtained after the DWT and spectral band segmentation methods were used to fuse the temporal and spectral information, combined it with the spatial information. Then, the TSS information and random forest model were used for DSM. The results indicated that 1) The mapping result based on TSS information was highly correlated with the legacy soil map. In different soil classes, there were minute differences in the core area and large differences in adjacent soil classes between the two maps. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on TSS information were 88.11% and 0.82, respectively. 2) With the same values of the soil moisture, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of DSM based on hyperspectral data were 6.80% and 0.02, respectively, higher than those based on multispectral data. 3) With increasing temporal information, the DSM accuracy continuously increased, and the mapping accuracy based on multi-temporal multispectral data was higher than that based on mono-temporal hyperspectral data when the number of multi-temporal multispectral images reached 6. 4) The DSM accuracy was effectively improved when terrain factors were considered, and the terrain factors featuring a strong separability for various soil classes differed. The DSM method proposed in this study based on TSS information from multi-sources remote sensing data greatly improved the DSM accuracy and provided new insight for future DSM research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","China; Data fusion; Decision trees; Image classification; Image enhancement; Landsat; Radar imaging; Remote sensing; Signal reconstruction; Soil moisture; Topography; Tracking radar; Vegetation mapping; Digital soil mappings; Hyperspectral Data; Mapping accuracy; Mapping method; Multi-spectral data; Multi-temporal; Soil class; Soil classification; Soil maps; Spectral information; environmental protection; mapping; satellite imagery; soil classification; Discrete wavelet transforms","Data fusion; Hyperspectral data; Mapping; Multi-temporal; Soil class; Soil classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134849338"

The FPA is a nature-inspired algorithm simulating the behavior of flower pollination. The proposed approach is used to extract key information in terms of optimal cluster centers that are derived from training samples of the selected databases. These extracted cluster centers are then validated on test samples. Three datasets from the UCI machine learning data repository and an additional multi-spectral, real-time satellite image are chosen to illustrate the effectiveness and diversity of the proposed technique. The FPA performance is compared with the k-means, a popular clustering algorithm and metaheuristic algorithms, namely, the Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Cuckoo Search, Spider Monkey Optimization, Grey Wolf Optimization, Differential Evolution, Harmony Search and Bat Algorithm. The results are evaluated based on classification error percentage (CEP), time complexity and statistical significance. FPA has the lowest CEP for all four datasets and an average CEP of 28%, which is 5.5% lower than next best algorithm in that sense. The FPA is the second quickest algorithm to converge after HS algorithm. FPA also shows a higher level of statistical significance.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the spatial resolution on soil pH mapping using satellite images of the black soil region in northeastern China. A high spatial resolution Gaofen (GF)-2 high-definition image and multispectral images acquired by the Landsat 8 operational land imager and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument were used to compare their performance in soil pH prediction. The spectral variables, including the original bands of the three satellite images and a variety of spectral indices derived from the original bands, were employed. Then, a machine learning model (quantile regression forest) was used to determine the relationships between the spectral variables and the measured soil pH, and prediction models were established to estimate the soil pH and to characterize the spatial pattern of the soil pH. The results revealed that the soil pH prediction model based on the GF-2 image had a slightly higher prediction accuracy than the models constructed using the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. The prediction models for Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and GF-2 had root mean square errors of 0.34, 0.39, and 0.31, respectively.

For this we use hyperspectral satellite images from PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa) and multispectral images from Sentinel-2 MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) in July 2020. The visual inspection of the available acquisitions differentiates between four aquatic types: lagoons; river and stream plumes mixing with marine waters; turbid and optically complex coastal waters; and optically clean waters away from the shore. For each of the four types we determine the characteristic averaged reflectance spectra from PRISMA and Sentinel-2 for the spectral range from 400 nm to 2500 nm. It is found that Sentinel-2 spectra are very similar for the 4 water types, in contrast to the PRISMA spectra which give substantial additional information. Further we analyse the gradual modification of the characteristic hyper- and multispectral spectra from the shoreline to the open sea (1/425 km distance) in 15 locations passing through areas of varying turbidity. We demonstrate that the intensity of surface reflectance from the hyperspectral instrument decreases gradually with distance from shoreline, clearly showing the transition zone between riverine and marine water. The multispectral reflectance spectra for the same study areas did not present such consistent behaviour. The presented results demonstrate the benefits of hyperspectral over multispectral images for turbid aquatic regions in the Black Sea coastal zone. They show that with little requirements regarding pre-processing and computational resources hyperspectral data can contribute greatly to classification of water types, in respect of their turbidity.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Reflection; Turbidity; Black sea; Coastal area; HyperSpectral; Marine waters; Multi-spectral; Multispectral images; Reflectance spectrum; Spectra's; Water types; Zone-based; Coastal zones","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131197700"

There exist several initialization algorithms that most of them are focused on using the distance and density based metrics defined in the feature space. However image space has a great potential to be used as the search space for initial seeds. In this research, developing clustering initialization using spatial information (image space) and spectral information (feature space) with the help of particle swarm optimization has been examined. Standard deviation and homogeneity of pixels in the image space in addition to distance and density of points in the feature space have been utilized in the objective function of the particle swarm optimization. Two different search spaces (feature and image spaces) and 26 objective functions have been applied to a simulated image and two real satellite multi-spectral images. Comparing the results of 26 cases with four prevailing initialization methods, demonstrated that searching for initial seeds in the image space using PSO with a full objective function (using four spectral–spatial criteria) can produce better results than the other tested cases. Using this case for k-means clustering initialization, led to about 20% improvement in overall accuracy relative to the clustering results with commonly used initialization algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Spectroscopy; Clustering results; Initialization methods; Multispectral images; Objective functions; Overall accuracies; Spatial informations; Spectral information; Standard deviation; K-means clustering","Clustering; Initialization; Particle swarm optimization; Satellite images; spectral–spatial information","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096576998"

With this parameters, a new era of Neural Network (NN) approach has been stimulated from 1992 for cloud classification. A summary of their empirical results are provided for various published works based on NN approach from 1970 to 2020. Moreover, the present article embodies experimental analysis of cloud detection using NN based classifier on multi-spectral satellite images with distinguish mathematical model of learning rules and number of hidden layers. The analysis is verified on L8, AVHRR, NOAA and GOES satellite images. The result demonstrates improved performance of NN approach with two layer perceptron architecture with Levenberg-Marquardt learning rule for cloud detection in terms of ellapse time. However, potential of self-organizing feature map (SOFM), an unsupervised NN approach, is observed in terms of accuracy over supervised learning architecture.

Predictions of invasion dynamics derived from modeling tools are often spatially coarse and therefore unsuitable for guiding local management. Accurate information on the occurrence of invasive plants and on the main factors that promote their spread is critical to define successful control strategies. For addressing this challenge, we developed a dual framework combining satellite image classification with predictive ecological modeling. By combining data from georeferenced invaded areas with multispectral imagery with 10-meter resolution from Sentinel-2 satellites, a map of areas invaded by the woody invasive Acacia longifolia in a municipality of northern Portugal was devised. Classifier fusion techniques were implemented through which eight statistical and machine-learning algorithms were ensembled to produce accurate maps of invaded areas. Through a Random Forest (RF) model, these maps were then used to explore the factors driving the landscape-level abundance of A. longifolia. RF models were based on explanatory variables describing hypothesized environmental drivers, including climate, topography/geomorphology, soil properties, fire disturbance, landscape composition, linear structures, and landscape spatial configuration. Satellite-based maps synoptically described the spatial patterns of invaded areas, with classifications attaining high accuracy values (True Skill Statistic, TSS: 0.895, Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve, ROC: 0.988, Kappa: 0.857). The predictive RF models highlighted the primary role of climate, followed by landscape composition and configuration, as the most important drivers explaining the species abundance at the landscape level. Our innovative dual framework—combining image classification and predictive ecological modeling—can guide decision-making processes regarding effective management of invasions by prioritizing the invaded areas and tackling the primary environmental and anthropogenic drivers of the species’ abundance and spread. © 2021 by the authors.

The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) stereo-mapping satellite can provide multi-view and multi-spectral satellite images, which can clearly describe the fine spatial details within urban areas, while the feasibility of extracting building 3D information from GF-7 image remains under-studied. This article establishes an automated method for extracting building footprints and height information from GF-7 satellite imagery. First, we propose a multi-stage attention U-Net (MSAU-Net) architecture for building footprint extraction from multi-spectral images. Then, we generate the point cloud from the multi-view image and construct normalized digital surface model (nDSM) to represent the height of off-terrain objects. Finally, the building height is extracted from the nDSM and combined with the results of building footprints to obtain building 3D information. We select Beijing as the study area to test the proposed method, and in order to verify the building extraction ability of MSAU-Net, we choose GF-7 self-annotated building dataset and a public dataset (WuHan University (WHU) Building Dataset) for model testing, while the accuracy is evaluated in detail through comparison with other models. The results are summarized as follows: (1) In terms of building footprint extraction, our method can achieve intersection-over-union indicators of 89.31% and 80.27% for the WHU Dataset and GF-7 self-annotated datasets, respectively; these values are higher than the results of other models. (2) The root mean square between the extracted building height and the reference building height is 5.41 m, and the mean absolute error is 3.39 m. In summary, our method could be useful for accurate and automatic 3D building information extraction from GF-7 satellite images, and have good application potential. © 2021 by the authors.

An existing LULC map of the region was used as an input for automatically generating labeled training samples and a modified SegNet was implemented for classification. Four major LULC classes of interest - water bodies, forest lands, croplands, built-up were classified with an average F1 score of 0.84.

The comparison experiment found that compared with the original image, the fused image has greatly improved the ability to recognize the topography of rivers, lakes, land and sea boundaries, and mountain range trends. And the ability to recognize snow, vegetation cover, and structural features of cloud has also been significantly enhanced.

This study was conducted to relate apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), topographic attributes, and multi-spectral satellite imagery to fruit yield and soil attributes and evaluate the potential of site-specific management (SSM) of nutrients. Elevation and ECa at multiple depths were collected from two experimental fields (referred as FieldUnd, FieldFlat) in Normandin, Quebec, Canada. Soil samples were collected at two depths (0–0.05 m and 0.05–0.15 m) and analyzed for a range of soil properties. Statistical analyses of fruit yield, soil, and sensor data were used to characterize within-field variability. Fruit yield showed large variability in both fields (CVUnd = 54.4%, CVFlat = 56.5%), but no spatial dependence. However, several soil attributes showed considerable variability and moderate to strong spatial dependence. Elevation and the shallowest depths of both the Veris (0.3 m) and DUALEM (0.54 m) ECa sensors showed moderate to strong spatial dependence and correlated significantly to most soil properties in both study sites, indicating the feasibility of SSM. In place of management zone delineation, a quadrant analysis of the shallowest ECa depth vs. elevation provided four sensor combinations (scenarios) for theoretical field conditions. ANOVA and Tukey–Kramer’s post hoc test showed that the greatest differentiation of soil properties in both fields occurred between the combinations of high ECa/low elevation versus low ECa/high elevation. Vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from satellite data showed promise as a biomass indicator, and bare spots classified with satellite imagery in FieldUnd revealed significantly distinct soil properties. Combining proximal and multispectral data predicted within-field variations of yield-determining soil properties and offered three theoretical scenarios (high ECa/low elevation; low ECa/high elevation; bare spots) on which to base SSM. Future studies should investigate crop response to fertilization between the identified scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.","","apparent soil electrical conductivity; management zone; precision horticulture; proximal soil sensors; sensor combinations; SPOT satellite image","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144657678"

The study uses 72 available images with 16/30m spatial resolution from Landsat-7/8, GaoFen-1 and HJ-1A/1B satellites. Firstly, per-pixel LSTM models are trained by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images before the earthquake. Secondly, the trained LSTM models are used to predict NDVI images after the earthquake. Then, anomalies or changes are detected by comparing predicted and observed NDVI images. Finally, anomalies related to landslides are separated from other changes with a SVM model which was trained by multi-spectral images in the study area. Experiment demonstrates that the recall rate and precision rate of landslides detection are 82.09% and 76.21%, respectively.

Hyperspectral narrowbands are more sensitive spectrally to changes in crop growth than multispectral broadbands but few studies quantified the gains in the former over the later. The PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) mission offers narrow (≤10 nm) band capability across the full optical range. The multispectral broadband Sentinel-2 mission carries four experimental red-edge and near infrared (NIR) hyperspectral narrow (≤20 nm) bands. We compared the performance of PRISMA and Sentinel-2 spectral bands at important phases of crop development (vegetative, reproductive, maturity) in estimating field-level biomass and yield for corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We selected three data-driven methods: two-band vegetation indices (TBVIs), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and random forest (RF). The PRISMA and Sentinel-2 models on average explained approximately 20% more variability in biomass and yield with RF than TBVIs and PLSR. The mean RMSE of the PRISMA RF models was 0.42 and 0.17 kg m−2, which was lower than the Sentinel-2 RF models (0.48 and 0.18 kg m−2). Multidate image (seasonal) model performance was generally higher than single-date image model performance. PRISMA shortwave infrared narrowbands and Sentinel-2 red-edge and near infrared bands were among the top-performing spectral regions. The results highlight potential complementarity between the PRISMA and Sentinel-2 missions for predicting crop biomass and yield.

Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data were exploited to detect the films around three aquaculture sites. The study is divided in three stages: (a) preprocessing, (b) main process and (c) accuracy assessment. The preprocessing stage includes subset, filtering, land masking and image corrections. The main process was similar for both datasets, using an adaptive thresholding method to identify dark formations, extract and classify them. Finally, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated based on the estimation of standard classification error statistics. The evaluation of the results was based on empirical photointerpretation and in situ photos. The results are successful and promising, with overall accuracy over 70%, while both sensors are proved to be effective in the detection, with Sentinel-1 SAR presenting slightly better accuracy (81%) than Sentinel-2 MSI (70%).

In particular, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) methods have attracted researchers’ attention in data science due to their superior results compared to other commonly used ML algorithms. Despite their popularity within the computer science community, they have not yet been well examined in detail in the field of Earth Observation (EO) for satellite image classification. As such, this study investigates the capability of different EL algorithms, generally known as bagging and boosting algorithms, including Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest (RF), for the classification of Remote Sensing (RS) data. In particular, different classification scenarios were designed to compare the performance of these algorithms on three different types of RS data, namely high-resolution multispectral, hyperspectral, and Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data. Moreover, the Decision Tree (DT) single classifier, as a base classifier, is considered to evaluate the classification’s accuracy.

Identifying the Pseudo-Invariant Features (PIF) with invariant or near-invariant radiometric reflectance over a certain period in multi-temporal images is a key to radiometric normalization. This paper proposed a novel method for automatic extraction and optimal selection of PIF. First, the change vectors including brightness, and spectral and spatial domains of bitemporal images were generated. Then, the pixels of each change vector were sorted from the lowest to the highest value, and the majority vote algorithm was used to extract the initial PIF. Finally, the PIF was selected by the iterative linear regression and outlier analysis. Taking two multi-spectral high-resolution Tripesat-2 images acquired on November 27, 2016 and July 18, 2017 as example, two typical regions with different land cover types were selected to test the proposed method. The proposed method was compared with Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) and Iteratively Reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) methods. The applicability of the proposed method was also validated by two WorldView-2 and Landsat OLI images. The results show that: (1) the accuracy of the PIF that extracted within two regions were 98.74% and 98.71%, respectively. The extracted PIF was distributed in the unchanged areas and covered the main land cover types in the images; (2) the linear regression models of the relative radiometric normalization using the PIF extracted by the proposed method were significant (p<0.000 1); (3) the differences in image brightness, spectral domain, and spatial domain were taken into account in this method with less parameters and high operability; (4) compared with MAD and IR-MAD, the proposed method showed a better performance in extraction precision and an significant linear regression model of the relative radiometric normalization; and (5) the proposed method was suitable for other medium- or high-resolution remote sensing images with same bands. © 2021, Science Press.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pléiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pléaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pléiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline. © 2020 The Author(s)","Himalayas; Automation; Debris; Ice; Image resolution; Landforms; Large dataset; Remote sensing; Debris covered glaciers; High spatial resolution; Linear spectral unmixing; Multi-spectral data; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing platforms; Spectral information; data set; glacial debris; glacier mass balance; ice; ice-rafted debris; mapping method; Pleiades; satellite imagery; Sentinel; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; Mapping","Automated delineation; Debris-covered glaciers; Ice cliff inventory; Linear spectral unmixing; Pléiades; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial ice cliffs","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097089079"

Typically, the optical satellite images are often corrupted because of poor weather conditions. As a rule, the measure of degradation of optical images is such that one can not rely even on the brightness inside of the damaged regions. As a result, some subdomains of such images become absolutely invisible. So, there is a great deal of missing information in optical remote sensing data. In this work, we propose a new variational approach for exact restoration of multispectral satellite optical images. We discuss the consistency of the proposed variational model, give the scheme for its regularization, derive the corresponding optimality system, and discuss the algorithm for the practical implementation of the reconstruction procedure. Experimental results are very promising and they show a significant gain over baseline methods using the reconstruction through linear interpolation between data available at temporally-close time instants.  © 2021 IEEE.","Geometrical optics; Image reconstruction; Meteorology; Optical data processing; Remote sensing; Satellites; Damaged region; Images processing; Monitoring applications; Multi-spectral; Optical image; Optical remote sensing; Optical satellite images; Satellite images; Variational approaches; Variational modeling; Restoration","Image processing; Restoration; Satellite images; Variational approach","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124793862"

Remote sensing technology is suitable for the regular extraction and monitoring of tailings pond information. However, traditional remote sensing is inefficient and unsuitable for the frequent extraction of large volumes of highly precise information. Object detection, based on deep learning, provides a solution to this problem. Most remote sensing imagery applications for tailings pond object detection using deep learning are based on computer vision, utilizing the true-color triple-band data of high spatial resolution imagery for information extraction. The advantage of remote sensing image data is their greater number of spectral bands (more than three), providing more abundant spectral information. There is a lack of research on fully harnessing multispectral band information to improve the detection precision of tailings ponds. Accordingly, using a sample dataset of tailings pond satellite images from the Gaofen-1 high-resolution Earth observation satellite, we improved the Faster R-CNN deep learning object detection model by increasing the inputs from three true-color bands to four multispectral bands. Moreover, we used the attention mechanism to recalibrate the input contributions. Subsequently, we used a step-by-step transfer learning method to improve and gradually train our model. The improved model could fully utilize the near-infrared (NIR) band information of the images to improve the precision of tailings pond detection. Compared with that of the three true-color band input models, the tailings pond detection average precision (AP) and recall notably improved in our model, with the AP increasing from 82.3% to 85.9% and recall increasing from 65.4% to 71.9%. This research could serve as a reference for using multispectral band information from remote sensing images in the construction and application of deep learning models. © 2021 by the authors.

The present work is aimed to develop a deep learning multimodal model that can predict the crop yield in Ecuadorian corn farms.

The use of multimodal data is aimed to extract hidden patterns in the status of crops and in this way obtain better results than the use of vegetation indices or other state-of-the-art methods.

This study aims to map the land area affected by the flood by using multispectral satellite images. To pursue this aim, Level-2A multispectral images from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 sensor were acquired before and after the tailing dam collapse in the period 2019–2021.

Geospatial analyses using various statistical and quantitative methods which are more applicable, accurate and dependable to measures the spatio-temporal trend of erosion accretion and estimate the change rate of shoreline. Remote sensing and GIS techniques have been used for the identification of shoreline change over the various time scales. To identify the rate Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was applied in the current research. The present study aimed to identify the trend of coastal erosion accretion during 43 years (1975–2018) which is divided into four short term period (1975–1988, 1988–2000, 2000–2010 and 2010–2018) between the coastal stretch of Subarnarekha and Rasulpur estuary along Bay of Bengal using multi temporal satellite images. The accurate shoreline position has been delineated by the histogram threshold method using the images of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper. The shoreline change rate has been calculated based on cast transect method through some statistical techniques such as End Point Rate (EPR) and Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) in GIS application. 70.42 km long coastal stretch along Bay of Bengal has been divided into three littoral zones (LZ) to analyze the shoreline shifting on a zone basis. From the analysis it has been observed that maximum erosion occurred between 1988 and 2000 time period in all zones. The result shows that highest rate of net shoreline movement has been found in LZ I (− 1715.71 m) in 1975–1988 and LZ III (− 1719.65 m) in 2000–2010 at Subarnarekha estuary and Junput respectively. The present study reveals that most of the accretive formation is observed in 2000–2010 and 2010–2018. Major accretion is identified in the southern part of Subarnarekha estuary, 23.93 m/year in EPR method. Maximum shades of changes was experienced in LZ I, especially in Subarnarekha estuary area. In the time span of 1975–1988 this area faced the highest erosion and highest accretion with the rate of − 78.54 m/year and 23.93 m/year respectively through EPR method. During 1988–2000, − 37.35 m/year erosional rate was found in the Subarnarekha estuary. The highest erosional rate was − 8.48 m/year in Beguran Jalpai during 1988–2000 by EPR.

However, these are not well-suited to detect weak signatures of certain disturbances of ecological systems. To resolve this problem we propose a new approach based on image-to-image translation and one-class classification (OCC). We aim to map forest mortality caused by an outbreak of geometrid moths in a sparsely forested forest-tundra ecotone using multisource satellite images. The images preceding and following the event are collected by Landsat-5 and RADARSAT-2, respectively. Using a recent deep learning method for change-aware image translation, we compute difference images in both satellites’ respective domains. These differences are stacked with the original pre- and post-event images and passed to an OCC trained on a small sample from the targeted change class. The classifier produces a credible map of the complex pattern of forest mortality. © 2022 The Author(s).

Slum mapping is one of the key problems concerning slums. Policymakers need to delineate slum settlements to make informed decisions about infrastructure development and allocation of aid. A wide variety of machine learning and deep learning methods have been applied to multispectral satellite images to map slums with outstanding performance. Since the physical and visual manifestation of slums significantly varies with geographical region and comprehensive slum maps are rare, it is important to quantify the uncertainty of predictions for reliable and confident application of models to downstream tasks. In this study, we train a U-Net model with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) on 13-band Sentinel-2 images, allowing us to calculate pixelwise uncertainty in the predictions. The obtained outcomes show that the proposed model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model, having both higher AUPRC and lower uncertainty when tested on unseen geographical regions of Mumbai using the regional testing framework introduced in this study. We also use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values to investigate how the different features contribute to our model’s predictions which indicate a certain shortwave infrared image band is a powerful feature for determining the locations of slums within images. With our results, we demonstrate the usefulness of including an uncertainty quantification approach in detecting slum area changes over time. © 2022 by the authors.

The minimization of co-registration error is addressed considering 8-neighborhood pixels.

Specifically, the obtained location and boundary of farmland together with crop types can contribute to the specific payment of planting subsidies and resource survey. Multi-source high-spatial and temporal resolution satellite images can provide an effective way to realize parcel-based crop mapping. However, some deficiencies still remain inthe extraction of farmland parcels and construction of spatiotemporal features. In this present study, a novel model was constructed to implement a parcel-based classification of crops by collaborating satellite data with high-spatial and temporal resolution. Four steps were included in a parcel-based crop mapping: 1) A D-LinkNet deep learning model was selected to extract the parcels from the 0.6m high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images; 2) Time series data set was constructed for each parcel using multi-source observations from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 satellite, where the tiles with high cloud cover were removed from the images; 3) A weighted Double-Logistic fitting was utilized to reconstruct the parcel-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the extraction of phenological parameters, such as the duration of the growth cycle, the time of growth starting and ending, and spectral indexes were calculated from Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data; 4) A Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) indicator was used to estimate the feature importance. A field experiment was also conducted to collect the data of crop types for the training of random forest classification model in a parcel-based crop mapping. The Fusui County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China was taken as the study area. There was a relatively complex planting structure in the study area.It was cloudy and rainy with the rainfall days of about 130-220 d, as well as the diverse and complex topography. The dominated crops included sugarcane, paddy rice, banana, and orange. The results showed that the farmland parcels were well extracted by the D-LinkNet deep learning model, with an edge accuracy of 84.54% and a produce accuracy of 83.06%, compared with the conventional multi-scale segmentation. Phenological features were extracted from the reconstructed NDVI time series of the parcels. The NDVI of sugarcane and paddy rice first increased and then decreased significantly. The growth season of sugarcanes started from March to the following March. In addition, the growth season of paddy rice lasted for about 3-4 months, in which there was the most intense change in the NDVI time series. There was a relatively steady state in the reconstructed NDVI time series of evergreen eucalyptus and orange in the whole year. The eucalyptus with high vegetation cover showed high NDVI values during the observation period. The MDA indicator demonstrated that the images captured in summer and autumn were better for the crop classification in the study area. A best performance of classification was achieved to combine the phenological and spectral features. The overall accuracy reached 88%, and the accuracy of sugarcane reached over 95% in the study areas. The crop mapping indicated that sugarcane was spatially distributed around the whole study area, including plain and mountainous areas. The planting area of sugarcane accounted for nearly 70%, orange for 18.06%, and paddy rice for 7.12% of farmland. Furthermore, the paddy rice was mostly distributed near the settlement places. Consequently, the study successfully extractedphenological features by using Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 multi-source observations, and verified the importance of phenological features in the parcel-based crop mapping. The finding can provide a series of practical schemes to acquire parcel-based cropdistribution. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Our approach compares the standard deviation and the mean values of a greenness-index in Sentinel-2 time-series, and does not require to determine the date of mowing. A high standard deviation of the greenness-index demonstrates that the area of interest (AOI) includes grassland patches with tall and short (un-mowed and mowed) grass at a certain timepoint.

In the present investigation, the unsupervised layers of a stacked auto-encoder are used for granular transformation of the weighted samples (or group of samples) at every level. Out of the three, the first two layers of the stack involve unsupervised weighted transformation of source-target samples without using any labelled information from the target domain. After that, a fuzzy membership-based transfer learning scheme has been used to capture the target-distinctive information thereby facilitating a selective transformation between matching source-target sample groups in the third level. Finally, more accurate class-label predictions for the unknown target samples are obtained using the labelled source samples in the transformed (source-target) feature space. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experimentation has been carried out using samples collected from various multi-spectral satellite images captured over various source and target regions of India.

The extraction of the accurate building footprints in densely populated urban areas from medium resolution satellite images is still a challenging task which requires the development of the new methods to solve such problem. In this paper, a novel Dilated-ResUnet deep learning architecture for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images has been proposed. The proposed model has been tested on three novel building datasets that are prepared for three densely populated cities of India (viz. Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) using Sentinel-2 satellite images and Planet OSM. First FCC (false colour composite) dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green bands, second FCC dataset prepared by merging NIR, Red, Green and Blue bands and third is TCC (true colour composite) dataset by merging red, green and blue bands. The proposed architecture is applied to both the FCC datasets and TCC dataset separately; it has been identified that the proposed model has obtained better building extraction results using FCC (NIR, Red, Green) dataset. The input satellite image enhancement and extensive experimentations to identify the optimal deep learning hyper-parameters using FCC spatial dataset have also been carried out to further improve the performance of the proposed model. The results of the experimentations reveal that the proposed model has out-performed the state of the art models available in literature by achieving the F1-score of 0.4718 and Mean IoU of 0.582 for building extraction from Sentinel-2 satellite images.

In recent years, pan-sharpening methods based on supervised learning have achieved superior performance over traditional methods. However, all these supervised pan-sharpening methods rest upon the assumption that performance of model trained on a coarse scale can generalize well on a finer one, which is not always the case. To address this problem, we propose a novel dual-output and cross-scale learning strategy DOCSNet for pan-sharpening. DOCSNet consists of two sub-networks, ReducedNet1 and FullNet2, which are both adapted from simple three convolutional layers and progressively cascaded. ReducedNet1 is first trained on the reduced-scale training set, its parameters are frozen, and then the whole network (fixed ReducedNet1 cascaded with FullNet2) adopts a cross-scale training strategy which involves simultaneously reduced and full resolution training samples. Each sub-network has an output terminal for reduced-scale and target-scale results, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to introduce a dual-output architecture to pan-sharpening framework. Extensive experiments on GaoFen-2 and WorldView-3 satellite images demonstrate that DOCSNet outperforms other state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods in terms of qualitative visual effects and quantitative metrics evaluations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Image fusion; Image resolution; Spectroscopy; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Dual outputs; High resolution; Multispectral images; Pan-sharpening; Performance; Reduced scale; Remote-sensing; Subnetworks; artificial neural network; image resolution; machine learning; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Remote sensing","convolutional neural network; deep learning; image fusion; Pan-sharpening; remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127080978"

Accurate cloud detection plays an important role in land resource management, environmental pollution monitoring, and land target recognition. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown great progress in cloud detection. However, as the complexity of the DL-based model increases, cloud detection efficiency decreases. DL-based cloud detection models are unable to successfully balance the performance-efficiency tradeoff. In our study, a multi-dimensional and multi-grained dense cascade forest (MDForest) is proposed for multi-spectral cloud detection. MDForest is a deep forest structure that automatically extracts low-level and high-level features from satellite cloud images end-to-end; a multi-dimensional and multi-grained scanning mechanism is introduced to capture the spectral information of multi-spectral satellite images while enhancing the representation learning ability of cascade forest. The experimental results on the HJ-1A/1B dataset show that MDForest improves the performance of cloud detection and possesses a good inference efficiency compared with DL-based cloud detection methods, which makes the proposed MDForest satisfy the application where good performance and high efficiency are both required.  © The Authors.

Existing vegetation indices (VIs) often perform well for high canopy cover conditions, but their performance becomes poor at early growth stages due to the significant exposure of background materials and the induced spectral mixing effect. This study proposed a novel approach to estimate the LNC at early and middle growth stages of paddy rice by using abundance adjusted VIs (AAVIs) from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery. An AAVI was constructed by combining the traditional VI and the rice abundant from linear spectral mixture analysis of UAV imagery. Subsequently, the performance of AAVIs was evaluated in comparison with traditional VIs derived from all pixels or green pixels for individual growth stages or multiple stages. The results demonstrated that AAVIs exhibited better performance in LNC estimation, regardless of individual stages or across the entire early season. Specially, AACIred-edge showed the best performance among the AAVIs evaluated for LNC estimation. For universal modeling across early stages, the combination of AACIred-edge and AAEVI yielded the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.26%, and rRMSE = 10.4%) performed remarkably better than the traditional VIs from all pixels or green pixels (R2<0.40).

Its main purpose is to fuse the high spectral characteristics of the multispectral (MS) images with the high spatial information of the panchromatic (Pan) image to output a sharper MS image (pan-sharpened) that encompasses higher spectral and spatial resolutions. In this paper, we investigate a conception of a new pan-sharpening scheme using the pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) in the nonsubsampled shearlet transform (NSST) domain. This can be done based on two main steps. In the first step, the input MS and Pan images are individually decomposed into multi-scaled and multi-directional coefficients by NSST. Second, the PCNN is applied to the low-frequency coefficients, which are merged by a weighted firing energy fusion rule utilizing the PCNN firing times. The detail coefficients with higher matching value are chosen to be the fused detail coefficients. Lastly, the pan-sharpened image is generated by the inverse NSST. WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, and QuickBird satellite datasets are employed in the experiments which demonstrate that the investigated scheme gained the ability in preserving both the high spatial details and high spectral characteristics simultaneously without involving abundant computation time. In addition, various image quality metrics such as CC, RMSE, RASE, ERGAS, SAM, Q4, QNR, and SCC are adopted to assess the spectral and spatial qualities of the pan-sharpened image. The experimental results and performance analysis illustrated that our scheme improved performance efficiency and achieved superiority over other conventional techniques. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Neural networks; Satellite imagery; Multi-spectral; NSST; Pan-sharpening; Panchromatic; PCNN; Image enhancement","Multispectral; NSST; Pan-sharpening; Panchromatic; PCNN","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076018384"

Research has generally focussed on extracting the instantaneous waterline position from time-series of satellite images to interpret long-term trends. The use of this proxy can, however, be uncertain because the waterline is sensitive to marine conditions and beach gradient. In addition, the technique disregards potentially useful data stored in surrounding pixels. In this paper, we describe a pixel-based technique to analyse coastal change. A hybrid rule-based and machine learning methodology was developed using a combination of Sentinel multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar composite imagery. The approach was then used to provide the first national-scale pixel-based landcover classification for the open coast of New Zealand. Nine landcover types were identified including vegetation, rock, and sedimentary classes that are common on beaches (dark sand, light sand, and gravel). Accuracy was assessed at national scale (overall accuracy: 86%) and was greater than 90% when normalised for class area. Using a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data improved overall accuracy by 14% and enhanced the separation of coastal sedimentary classes. Comparison against a previous classification approach of sandy coasts indicated improvements of 30% in accuracy.

In this context, impervious surface coverage is increasingly becoming an essential indicator for assessing urbanization and environmental quality, with several works relying on satellite imagery to determine it. However, although satellite imagery is typically available with a frequency of 3–10 days worldwide, imperviousness maps are released at most annually as they require a huge human effort to be produced and validated. Attempts have been made to extract imperviousness maps from satellite images using machine learning, but (i) the scarcity of reliable and detailed ground truth (ii) together with the need to manage different spectral bands (iii) while making the resulting system easily accessible to the end users is limiting their diffusion. To tackle these problems, in this work we introduce a deep-learning-based approach to extract imperviousness maps from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images leveraging a very detailed imperviousness map realised by the Italian department for environment protection as ground truth. We also propose a scalable and portable inference pipeline designed to easily scale the approach, integrating it into a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application. As a result, even non-expert GIS users can quickly and easily calculate impervious surfaces for any place on Earth (accuracy (Formula presented.)), with a frequency limited only by the availability of new satellite images. © 2022 by the authors.","Deep learning; Geographic information systems; Satellite imagery; Deep learning; Fusenet; Impervious; Impervious surface; Land cover; Multi-spectral; Remote-sensing; Resnet; Sentinel-2; U-net; Remote sensing","CNN; deep learning; FuseNet; impervious; land cover; remote sensing; ResNet; Sentinel-2; U-Net","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140592184"

This paper concentrates on the land use classification and proposes an optimization algorithm, called Firefly Harmony Search (FHS) for training the Deep Belief Neural Network (DBN). The FHS algorithm is the integration of the Firefly Algorithm and Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA), which tunes the weights of DBN to perform the multi-class classification. For the effective classification, the multispectral image is subjected to the sparse Fuzzy C-Means to form segments such that the feature extraction is effective, free from dimensionality issues and computational complexities. The features extracted from the segments of the multi-spectral images include vegetation indices and statistical features. Then, these features are fed to the DBN, which is tuned using the FHS algorithm for performing the land use classification. Experimentation using four datasets proves the effectiveness of the proposed multi-class classification approach. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the method are found to be 0.9317, 0.9568, and 0.0379, respectively, that is effective over the existing land use classification methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bioluminescence; Classifiers; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image classification; Land use; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Optimization; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Harmony search algorithms; Land cover classification; Landuse classifications; Multi-class classification; Multi-classification; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite image; Optimization algorithms; Classification (of information)","DBN; Harmony search algorithm; Land use classification; Multi-classification; Multi-spectral satellite images","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079800930"

The current land use was assessed by using the supervised classification which was applied on multi-spectral sentinel satellite images to identify the land use types. The potential land use was evaluated based on different utilization types such as field crops, vegetables, tree crops, forests, and rangelands. The suitability degree was derived by using spatial overlay techniques which were applied to specific criteria for each land utilization type. This study shows that the northern parts of the region have the highest suitability degree due to the high rainfall quantities, good soil quality, and gentle slope. It is also highlighted that these areas are embedded by urban expansion which led to a loss of fertile lands. The study shows as well that the highest suitability area in the basin is for field crops and vegetables while the lowest suitability area is for the forest and irrigated crops. It is recommended to orient the urban expansion in the southern part of the basin to preserve existing fertile lands. © 2022 Jordan Journal of Earth and Environmental Sciences.

In the particular case of sharpness assessment, traditional procedures based on the edge method tend to be extremely time-consuming due to their reliance on visual analysis performed by human operators, and would make proper processing of all bands a daunting task to perform on a large scale. In this paper we propose a flexible and fully automatic approach to edge method-based sharpness assessment that can be applied inde-pendently from the number of spectral bands.

As one of the traditional ET estimation methods, crop coefficient (Kc) has been commonly used. Many studies indicated a linear regression relationship between the Kc curve and the vegetation index curve. The linear regression model is usually developed between the Kc and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellite imagery. The satellite images can provide temporally and spatially distributed measurements. However, multispectral satellite imagery's spatial resolution is in the range of meters, which is often not enough for crops with clumped canopy structures, such as trees and vines. Little ET estimation has been studied based on the single-tree level. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a reliable tree-level ET estimation method using UAV high-resolution multispectral images. Compared with satellite imagery, the spatial resolution of UAV images can be as high as centimeter-level. A field study was conducted to investigate pomegranate trees at the USDA-ARS (US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service) San Joaquin Valley Agricultural Sciences Center in Parlier, California, USA. The NDVI map was derived from UAV imagery. The Kc values were calculated based on the actual ET from a weighing lysimeter and reference ET from the weather station. The authors then established a linear regression model between the NDVI and Kc to estimate the actual daily ET. Results showed that the linear regression model could estimate tree-level ET with an R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.9143 and 0.39 mm/day, respectively.  © 2021 IEEE.","Agricultural robots; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Image resolution; Linear regression; Lysimeters; Soil surveys; Sustainable development; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Water management; Agricultural Research Services; Distributed measurements; Linear regression models; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral satellite imagery; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regression relationship; Us department of agricultures; Satellite imagery","Evapotranspiration; Pomegranate; tree-level; UAV","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114207663"

Many remote sensing applications require the spatial resolutions of all data to be at the highest resolution possible, i.e., 10 m for S2. To address this demand, researchers have proposed various methods that exploit the spectral and spatial correlations within multispectral data to sharpen the S2 bands to 10 m. In this study, we combined S2 and L8 data.

To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (~0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of >0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Algae; Debris; Infrared devices; Microplastic; Pixels; Reflection; Satellites; Sensitivity analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Spectrum analysis; Marine debris; Microplastics; Near infrared spectral; Planetscope/DOVE; Remote detection; Remote-sensing; Resolution; Sensitivity; Sentinel-2; Spectral band; algorithm; detection method; experimental study; marine pollution; near infrared; remote sensing; satellite altimetry; satellite data; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; visible spectrum; Remote sensing","Marine debris; Microplastics; PlanetScope/DOVE; Remote sensing; Resolution; Sensitivity; Sentinel-2; Spectral bands","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103979274"

The movement of suspended sediment along the coastal water is an indicator of erosion and deposition of the coastal landforms. This study aims to analyse the shoreline changes and the corresponding spatio-temporal pattern of suspended sediment concentration of the southern Kerala coast using Sentinel 2 MSI satellite images for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. Single band at 645 nm shows good correlation with better regression co-efficient in a closed or semi-enclosed lake that shows less complexity of water quality. Hence red band of Sentinel 2 MSI has been used to estimate the suspended sediments in this study. Total suspended sediment along the south Kerala coast ranging from 0–10 mg/l has been estimated from the satellite images. The seasonal pattern of suspended sediment concentration has been estimated from the satellite images (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The suspended sediments derived from the satellite image have been compared with the corresponding field data. The suspended sediment concentration derived from the satellite images shows a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.85 with the field data. Similarly, the shoreline erosion and accretion have been analysed from the shoreline change analysis methods. In this study, monthly and seasonal shoreline changes have been estimated along the southern Kerala coast using multi-spectral and multi-temporal satellite imagery (SENTINEL 2 MSI) for the corresponding available dates of the period from December 2018 to November 2019. The shoreline from the satellite image has been validated with the shoreline derived from the field collected beach profile data. The shoreline erosion and accretion have been compared with the sediment concentration map derived from the satellite images along the south Kerala coast.

Therefore, acquiring reliable and up-to-date information about these ecosystems is vital for their conservation and sustainable blue carbon development. In this regard, the joint use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms can assist in producing accurate mangrove ecosystem maps. This study investigated the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different topologies and specifications for mangrove classification in Iran. To this end, multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi-spectral remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Afterward, the ANN topologies and specifications considering the number of layers and neurons, learning algorithm, type of activation function, and learning rate were examined for mangrove ecosystem mapping. The results indicated that an ANN model with four hidden layers, 36 neurons in each layer, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) learning algorithm, rectified linear unit (Relu) activation function, and the learning rate of 0.001 produced the most accurate mangrove ecosystem map (F-score = 0.97). Further analysis revealed that although ANN models were subjected to accuracy decline when a limited number of training samples were used, they still resulted in satisfactory results. Additionally, it was observed that ANN models had a high resistance when training samples included wrong labels, and only the ANN model with the Adam learning algorithm produced an accurate mangrove ecosystem map when no data standardization was performed. Moreover, further investigations showed the higher potential of multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing data compared to single-source and mono-temporal (e.g., single season) for accurate mangrove ecosystem mapping. Overall, the high potential of the proposed method, along with utilizing open-access satellite images and big-geo data processing platforms (i.e., GEE, Google Colab, and scikit-learn), made the proposed approach efficient and applicable over other study areas for all interested users. © 2022 by the authors.

A dataset composed of 450,837 echosounder data points and 89 Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 images acquired from 2013 to 2020, is generated to test and validate SDB and uncertainty models for various contrasting optical conditions. Results show that water column optical properties are characterized by a high spatio-temporal variability controlled by hydrodynamics and seasonal conditions. The best performance and highest robustness are found for the cluster-based approach using a green band log-linear regression model. A total of 80 satellite images can be exploited to calibrate SDB models, providing average values of root mean square error and maximum bathymetry of 0.53 m and 7.3 m, respectively. The uncertainty model, developed to extrapolate information beyond the calibration dataset, is based on a multi-scene approach. The sensitivity of the model to the optical variability not explained by the calibration dataset is demonstrated but represents a risk of error of less than 5%. Finally, the uncertainty model applied to a diachronic analysis definitively demonstrates the interest in SDB maps for a better understanding of morphodynamic evolutions of large-scale and complex coastal systems. © 2022 by the authors.

It has usually been used to monitor paddy growing ecosystems in the past few decades. However, there are uncertainties in data fusion techniques which can be resolved in image classification on paddy rice. In this study, a series of learning concepts integrated by a probability progress Fuzzy Dempster-Shafer (FDS) analysis is presented to upgrade various models and different types of image data which is the goal of this study. More specifically, the study utilized the FDS to generate a series of probability models in the classification of the system. In addition, Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (NN) approaches are employed into the developed FDS system. Furthermore, two different image types are Satellite Image and Aerial Photo used as the analysis material. The overall classification accuracy has been improved to 97.27%, and the kappa value is 0.93. The overall accuracy of the paddy field image classification for a multi-period of mid-scale satellite images is between 85% and 90%.

One popular category of SSL are distillation networks, such as Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL). This work proposes RS-BYOL, which builds on BYOL in the remote sensing (RS) domain where data are nontrivially different from natural RGB images. Since multispectral (MS) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors provide varied spectral and spatial resolution information, we utilize them as an implicit augmentation to learn invariant feature embeddings. In order to learn RS-based invariant features with SSL, we trained RS-BYOL in two ways, i.e., single channel feature learning and three channel feature learning. This work explores the usefulness of single channel feature learning from random 10 MS bands of 10-20 m resolution and VV-VH of SAR bands compared to the common notion of using three or more bands. In our linear probing evaluation, these single channel features reached a 0.92 F1 score on the EuroSAT classification task and 59.6 mIoU on the IEEE Data Fusion Contest segmentation task for certain single bands. We also compare our results with ImageNet weights and show that the RS-based SSL model outperforms the supervised ImageNet-based model.

The combination of remotely sensed and field-collected data, under the paradigm of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), represents one of the most promising approaches to boost large-scale and reliable biodiversity monitoring practices. Here, the potential of SVH to capture information on plant diversity at a fine scale in an ecological network (EN) embedded in a complex landscape has been tested using two new and promising methodological approaches: the first estimates α and β spectral diversity and the latter ecosystem spectral heterogeneity expressed as Rao’s Quadratic heterogeneity measure (Rao’s Q). Both approaches are available thanks to two brand-new R packages: “biodivMapR” and “rasterdiv”. Our aims were to investigate if spectral diversity and heterogeneity provide reliable information to assess and monitor over time floristic diversity maintained in an EN selected as an example and located in northeast Italy. We analyzed and compared spectral and taxonomic α and β diversities and spectral and landscape heterogeneity, based on field-based plant data collection and remotely sensed data from Sentinel-2A, using different statistical approaches. We observed a positive relationship between taxonomic and spectral diversity and also between spectral heterogeneity, landscape heterogeneity, and the amount of alien species in relation to the native ones, reaching a value of R2 = 0.36 and R2 = 0.43, respectively. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of estimating and mapping α and β spectral diversity and ecosystem spectral heterogeneity using remotely sensed images. Moreover, we highlighted that spectral diversity values become more effective to identify biodiversity-rich areas, representing the most important diversity hotspots to be preserved. Finally, the spectral heterogeneity index in anthropogenic landscapes could be a powerful method to identify those areas most at risk of biological invasion. © 2022 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Vegetation mapping; Biodiversity patterns; Free and open-source algorithm; Heterogeneity maps; Multi-spectral; Open-source; Satellite images; Spectral diversity; Spectral diversity map; Spectral heterogeneity; Spectral heterogeneity map; Vegetation plots; Ecosystems","biodiversity patterns; free and open-source algorithms; multispectral; satellite images; spectral diversity maps; spectral heterogeneity maps; vegetation plots","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139984306"

High-resolution space images have become the fundamental source to extract agricultural field boundaries. Manual boundary delineation is not practical. In this study, we present an approach to detect agricultural fields from satellite images on the basis of agricultural field blocks. An agricultural field block consists of one or more fields that are owned by the farmers. The approach combines the Otsu’s thresholding algorithm and marker-controlled watershed (MCW)-based segmentation. First, the well-separated field segments within a field block being considered are detected through recursive processing of the Otsu’s thresholding algorithm. Then, these distinct field segments are used to generate a marker image, and further extraction of individual fields is carried out through a marker-controlled watershed (MCW)-based segmentation. The approach was tested using 10-m resolution Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-5 multi-spectral (XS) image, 4-m resolution IKONOS XS image, 2.40-m resolution QuickBird XS image, and 0.60-m resolution QuickBird pan-sharpened (PS) image. The results were evaluated using the reference field boundary dataset. The achieved overall accuracies were 89.7, 83.2, 81.0, and 77.4% for the IKONOS XS, QuickBird XS, SPOT-5 XS, and QuickBird PS images, respectively.

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an $F1$ score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.  © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning; Media streaming; Remote sensing; Satellites; Urban growth; Change detection; Deep learning; Features extraction; Multispectral satellite image; Remote-sensing; Shape; Spatial pyramid pooling; Spatial pyramids; Streaming medium; multispectral image; Sentinel; Feature extraction","Change detection (CD); deep learning; multi-spectral satellite images; spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127087143"

The characteristic feature of the proposed model is the fact that the variable exponent, which is associated with non-standard growth in spatial interpolation problem, is unknown a priori and it depends on the solution of the first-level optimal control problem. It makes this spatiotemporal interpolation problem rather challenging. In view of this, we discuss the consistency of the proposed model, study the existence of optimal solutions, and derive the corresponding optimality systems.

The high product yield, and the consequent high profitability, has led to a widespread expansion of plantations in the greater region. However, oil palms are susceptible to diseases that can have a detrimental effect. In this study we use hyper-and multi-spectral remote sensing to detect diseased oil palm trees in Krabi province, Thailand. Proximate spectroscopic measurements were used to identify and discern differences in leaf spectral radiance; the results indicate a relatively higher radiance in visible and near-infrared for the healthy leaves in comparison to the diseased. From a total of 113 samples for which the geolocation and the hyperspectral radiance were recorded, 59 and 54 samples were healthy and diseased oil palm trees, respectively. Moreover, a WorldView-2 satellite image was used to investigate the usability of traditional vegetation indices and subsequently detecting diseased oil palm trees. The results show that the overall maximum likelihood classification accuracy is 85.98%, the Kappa coefficient 0.71 and the producer’s accuracy for healthy and diseased oil palm trees 83.33 and 78.95, respectively.

Agriculture relies on healthy soil for crop growth and animal grazing. Water retention reduces the risks of desertification and of flooding as the capacity to retain water reduces the rate of surface water flow. In addition, soil organic carbon represents the largest terrestrial carbon stock and is second only to the oceans. Yet, soil health is threatened by intensive farming practices and changes of land use such as deforestation. Thus, it is important to manage soil health to maintain food security, avoid desertification and maintain or ideally increase soil organic carbon storage. A useful tool to inform this management function would be a machine learning model that can predict soil health given land cover and parameters of the abiotic context, such as terrain elevation and historical weather data. The first step in developing such a model is to be able to identify the land cover for a chosen area. Satellites provide multi-spectral images that include the visual bands. Land cover databases provide the ground truth labels for a supervised learning approach to train an image semantic segmentation model.

However, diverse solar illumination conditions, similarities between shadows, and other dark land features bring uncertainties and deviations to shadow extraction processes and results. In this paper, we classify shadows as either strong or weak based on the ratio between ambient light intensity and direct light intensity, and use the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA), which is a multi-scale segmentation method based on spectral and shape heterogeneity, to reduce the interference of salt and pepper noise and relieve the error of misdiagnosing land covers with high reflectivity in shaded regions as unshaded ones. Subsequently, an object-based shadow index (OSI) is presented according to the illumination intensities of different reflectance features, as well as using the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and near infrared (NIR) band to highlight shadows and eliminate water body interference. The data from three high-spatial-resolution satellites—WorldView-2 (WV-2), WorldView-3 (WV-3), and GaoFen-2 (GF-2)—were used to test the methods and verify the robustness of the OSI. The results show that the OSI index performed well regarding both strong and weak shadows with the user accuracy and the producer accuracy both above 90%, while the four other existing indexes that were tested were not effective at diverse solar illumination conditions. In addition, all the disturbances from water body were excluded well when using the OSI, except for the GF-2 data in weak shadows. © 2020 by the authors.

Compared to the ship detection in sea and offshore area, it is more difficult to detect ships in inland river due to several challenges. First of all, many ships in inland river are clustered together and hard to be separated from each other. Secondly, ships lying alongside the pier are very likely to be recognized as part of the pier. Thirdly, ships in inland river is usually smaller than those in the sea. A hierarchical method is proposed to detect the ships in inland river in this paper. The Regions of Interest (ROIs) are firstly extracted based on water–land segmentation using multi-spectral information. Then two kinds of ship candidates are extracted based on the panchromatic band. The isolated ships are detected by analyzing the shape of connected components and the clustered ships are detected by using mixtures multi-scale Deformable Part Models (DPM) and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG). At last, a Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is trained to classify the ship candidates using the multi-spectral bands. The experiments using Quickbird satellite images show that our approach is effective in ship detection and performs particularly well in separating the ships clustered together and staying alongside the pier. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Backpropagation; Mixtures; Neural networks; Offshore oil well production; Piers; River pollution; Rivers; Satellite imagery; Back-propagation neural networks; Deformable part models; Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); Inland rivers; Optical satellite imagery; Pollution monitoring; Ship detection; Traffic surveillance; Ships","Deformable part model; Inland river; Optical satellite imagery; Ship detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066401240"

Unlike the traditional global models that make predictions from a unified global model for the entire study area, our system uses locally trained SVMs and spatially weighted votes to make predictions. By using IKONOS-2 multi-spectral image and airborne bathymetric LiDAR water depth samples, we developed a spatially distributed SVM system for bathymetry estimates. The distributed model outperformed the global SVM model in predicting bathymetry from optical satellite images, and it worked well at the scenarios with a low number of training data samples. The experiments showed the localized model reduced the bathymetry estimation error by 60% from RMSE of 1.23 m to 0.48 m. Different from the traditional global model that underestimates water depth near shore and overestimates water depth offshore, the spatially distributed SVM system did not produce regional prediction bias and its prediction residual exhibited a random pattern. Our model worked well even if the sample density was much lower: The model trained with 10% of the samples was still able to obtain similar prediction accuracy as the global SVM model with the full training set. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bathymetry; IKONOS; optical method; spatial distribution; support vector machine; water depth","bathymetry; optical images; spatially distributed model; support vector machine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055702267"

Hydrographic surveys and acoustic surveys are time-consuming and expensive. The limited availability and high cost of the high-resolution images require a different methodology to accurately estimate the water-spread area of the reservoir. In this study, 30 m resolution hyperspectral image (hyperion) and multi-spectral image (The Earth Observing One (EO-1) advanced land imager) are used to estimate the water-spread area of the Peechi Reservoir, South India. A hybrid genetic algorithm (GA)-based super-resolution mapping approach is developed and demonstrated, which incorporates the multi-objective GA and Hopfield neural network (HNN). The hybrid GA-based super-resolution mapping approach gives a global optimum solution in half of the original computation time. Furthermore, mapping approach gives an error of 6.38% for the multi-spectral image and a lesser error of 3.86% for the hyperspectral image, while the HNN-based super-resolution mapping approach gives an error of 8.23% for the multi-spectral image and 5.71% for the hyperspectral image. Thus, in this work, an efficient technique based on hybrid GA is presented, which is a useful tool for accurate mapping of water bodies at the sub-pixel scale using hyperspectral imagery. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.","Errors; Hopfield neural networks; Hydrographic surveys; Optical resolving power; Photomapping; Reservoirs (water); Spectroscopy; Advanced land imagers; Global optimum solutions; High resolution image; Hopfield neural networks (HNN); Hybrid genetic algorithms; Hyper-spectral imageries; Hyperspectral satellite; Super-resolution mappings; Genetic algorithms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084959481"

Managing and delivering large sets of data becomes extremely difficult and resource demanding for the data vendors, but even more for individual users and third party stakeholders. Hence, research in the field of efficient remote sensing data handling and manipulation has become a very active research topic (from both storage and communication perspectives). Driven by the rapid growth in the volume of optical satellite measurements, in this work we explore the lossy compression technique for multispectral satellite images. We give a comprehensive analysis of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) still-image intra coding part applied to the multispectral image data. Thereafter, we analyze the impact of the distortions introduced by the HEVC's intra compression in the general case, as well as in the specific context of crop classification application. Results show that HEVC's intra coding achieves better trade-off between compression gain and image quality, as compared to standard JPEG 2000 solution. On the other hand, this also reflects in the better performance of the designed pixel-based classifier in the analyzed crop classification task. We show that HEVC can obtain up to 150:1 compression ratio, when observing compression in the context of specific application, without significantly losing on classification performance compared to classifier trained and applied on raw data. In comparison, in order to maintain the same performance, JPEG 2000 allows compression ratio up to 70:1. © 2020 by the authors.","Crops; Data compression ratio; Data handling; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Image coding; Remote sensing; Satellites; Video signal processing; Classification performance; Comparative studies; Comprehensive analysis; High-efficiency video coding; Multi-spectral image data; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing data; Image compression","Crop classification; HEVC; High bit-depth compression; Intra coding; JPEG 2000; Landsat-8; Multispectral satellite images; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085582316"

To produce LULC maps, supervised classification methods are often used. For many supervised classification algorithms, independence of features is an implied assumption. However, this assumption is rarely tested. For LULC classification, using all bands as input features to models is the default approach. However, some of the bands may be highly correlated, which may cause model performances unstable. In this research, correlations and multicollinearity among multi-spectral bands are analyzed for four major LULC types, i.e. cropland, forest, developed area and water bodies. Guided by the correlation analysis, different band combinations were used to train Support Vector Machines (SVM) for four-class LULC classification and the results were compared. From our experiments, band 4, 5, 6 is the best three-band combination and band 1, 2, 5, 7 is the best four-band combination which achieved almost identical performance as using all bands for LULC classification. © 2019 IEEE.","Feature extraction; Land use; Regression analysis; Supervised learning; Band combinations; Correlation analysis; Land use/ land covers; Land-use and land cover classifications; LANDSAT; Model performance; Multicollinearity; Supervised classification; Support vector machines","Feature selection; Land use land cover; Landsat 8","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072924117"

Comparison of the processing results confirmed a rather high efficiency of water object recognition both in the two-polarization radar data of the C-band and in the multispectral data of the visible and near-IR ranges. Both methods showed similar results in quality of recognition of water objects with a small number of unrecognized or falsely recognized objects (on average less than 10% of the area of recognized objects). The information technology for automated processing of optical and radar data from Sentinel satellites for monitoring floods and droughts is independent from weather conditions over the monitored territory (imaging is possible even with 100% cloudiness). Owing to the high degree of automation of data processing in the developed information technology, it can be used to promptly inform about the course and consequences of floods and droughts not only representatives of government services and commercial structures, but also the general public. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Automation; C (programming language); Drought; Floods; Image processing; Information technology; Intelligent systems; Monitoring; Object recognition; Optical data processing; Polarization; Radar; Radar imaging; Satellite imagery; Space-based radar; Weather satellites; All-weather monitoring; Automated processing; Commercial structures; Degree of automation; Government services; Multi-spectral data; Polarization radars; Satellite image processing; Data handling","Drought; Floods; Image processing; Information technology; Monitoring; Polarization; Radar; Satellite imagery","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076944337"

SSTs are essential information for ocean-related industries but are hard to measure. Although multi-spectral imaging sensors on meteorological satellites are used for measuring SSTs over a wide area, they cannot measure sea temperature in regions covered by clouds, so most of the temperature data will be partially occluded. In meteorology, data assimilation with physics-based simulation is used for interpolating occluded SSTs, and can generate physically-correct SSTs that match observations by satellites, but it requires huge computational cost. We propose a low-cost learning-based method using pre-computed data-assimilation SSTs. Our restoration model employs adversarial physical model loss that evaluates physical correctness of generated SST images, and restores SST images in real time. Experimental results with satellite images show that the proposed method can reconstruct physically-correct SST images without occlusions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Atmospheric temperature; Deep learning; Image reconstruction; Meteorology; Pattern recognition; Restoration; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Computational costs; Data assimilation; Image Inpainting; Multispectral imaging; Physics-based Simulation; Restoration model; Sea surface temperature (SST); Sea surface temperatures; Oceanography","Adversarial loss; Image inpainting; Sea surface temperature","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081550594"

Among these countries, Spain is listed as the largest olive producing country with almost 45% of olive oil production per year. Dedicating land of over 2.4 million hectares for the olive cultivation, Spain is among the leading distributors of olives throughout the world. Due to its high significance in the country's economy, the crop yield must be recorded. Manual collection of data over such expanded fields is humanly infeasible. Remote collection of such information can be made possible through the utilization of satellite imagery. This paper presents an automated olive tree counting method based on image processing of satellite imagery. The images are pre-processed using the unsharp masking followed by improved multi-level thresholding-based segmentation. Resulting circular blobs are detected through the circular Hough transform for identification. Validation has been performed by evaluating the proposed scheme for the dataset formed by acquiring images through the 'El Sistema de Información Geográfica de Parcelas Agrícolas' viewer over the region of Spain. The proposed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 96% in detection. Computation time was recorded as 24 ms for an image size of $300\times300$ pixels. The less spectral information is used in our proposed methodology resulting in a competitive accuracy with low computational cost in comparison to the state-of-the-art technique. © 2013 IEEE.","Crops; Forestry; Hough transforms; Image segmentation; Olive oil; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Circular Hough transforms; Mediterranean countries; Multi-spectral imagery; Multilevel thresholding; Olive; Olive oil production; State-of-the-art techniques; Tree counting methods; Image enhancement","crop estimation; Hough transform; multi-spectral imagery; olive; Remote sensing; satellite imagery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058102622"

These methods focused on various types of convolutional neural network (CNN) structures, which were trained by simply minimizing a spectral loss between network outputs and the corresponding high-resolution (HR) multi-spectral (MS) target images. However, owing to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times, HR panchromatic (PAN) and low-resolution MS image pairs tend to have large pixel misalignments, especially for moving objects in the images. Conventional CNNs trained with only the spectral loss with these satellite image data sets often produce PS images of low visual quality including double-edge artifacts along strong edges and ghosting artifacts on moving objects. In this letter, we propose a novel loss function, called a spectral-spatial structure (S3) loss, based on the correlation maps between MS targets and PAN inputs. Our proposed S3 loss can be very effectively used for pan-sharpening with various types of CNN structures, resulting in significant visual improvements on PS images with suppressed artifacts. © 2019 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Acquisition time; Correlation maps; Ghosting artifacts; Satellite image datas; Satellite images; Sensor characteristics; Spatial structure; Visual improvements; data acquisition; data set; machine learning; network analysis; pixel; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; spectral analysis; Image enhancement","Convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; pan colorization; pan-sharpening; satellite imagery; spectral-spatial structure; super-resolution (SR)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084149631"

This may since the TM spatial resolution is 2.7 times finer than MSS, and consequently, TM imagery has more spectral variability for a class. The increase of the spectral heterogeneity in a class and the higher number of channels being used in the classification process may play significant role. For example, the optimum threshold for classifying an agricultural scene using MSS data is about 2.5 standard deviations, while that for TM corresponds to more than four standard deviations. This paper compares the optimum threshold between MSS and TM and suggests a method of using unassigned boundary pixels to determine the optimum threshold. Further, it describes the relationship of the optimum threshold to the class variance with a full illustration of TM data.

Recent multi-Temporal quantifications of ice mass loss at mountain range to regional scale are missing. However, this is fundamental information for future water resource planning and glacier change projections. In this study, we measure temporally consistent glacier area changes and geodetic mass balances throughout the Bolivian Cordillera Real and Tres Cruces based on multi-sensor remote-sensing data. By analyzing multi-spectral satellite images and interferometric SAR data, a glacier recession of 81 ± 18 km2 (29%; 5.1 ± 1.1 km2 a-1), a geodetic mass balance of-403 ± 78 kg m-2 a-1 and a total ice mass loss of 1.8 ± 0.5 Gt is derived for 2000-2016. In the period 2013-2016, ice mass loss was 21% above the average rate. A retreat rate of 15 ± 5 km2 a-1 and a mass budget of-487 ± 349 kg m-2 a-1 are found in this more recent period. These higher change rates can be attributed to the strong El Niño event in 2015/16. The analyses of individual glacier changes and topographic variables confirmed the dependency of the mass budget and glacier recession on glacier aspect and median elevation.

In this study, the development of a validated data and image-processing schema demonstrated the capability of current metre-scale satellite technology (WorldView-3) to identify specific tree species within an unmanaged tropical forest. The experimental site, La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, provided access for field validation and spectral data acquisition of individual tree canopies from established canopy towers. It is also a representative biome of diverse lowland Atlantic tropical forests in Central America. The process defined in this paper calibrated and corrected field-acquired ASD field spectra for ten tree species and corrected WorldView-3 image data for viewing and illumination geometry. In addition, assessments of three current atmospheric compensation methods for correcting recent WorldView-3 satellite imagery established the most accurate compensation process for a tropical forest setting. Corrected reflectance in the satellite data matched the spectrometer data to ±0.25% for visible bands and ±0.5% for near-infrared bands. This study shows that spectral data from the satellite and field spectrometer data are nearly equivalent when applying the appropriate atmospheric compensation, band response emulation, and viewing correction processes established in this study. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Costa Rica; La Selva Biological Station; Limon; Climate change; Data acquisition; Data handling; Image processing; Infrared devices; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Spectrometers; Tropics; Accurate compensation; Atmospheric compensation; Correction process; Forest compositions; Illumination geometry; Multispectral satellite image; Near infrared band; Satellite technology; biome; forest canopy; image processing; satellite data; satellite imagery; tree; tropical forest; WorldView; Forestry","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044280098"

In this paper, we introduced a novel generative adversarial network with multiple discriminators for colorizing gray-scale satellite images with pseudo-natural appearances. Although being powerful, deep generative model in its common form with a single discriminator could be unstable for achieving spatial consistency on local textured regions, especially highly textured ones. To address this issue, the generator in our proposed structure produces a group of colored outputs from feature maps at different scale levels of the network, each being supervised by an independent discriminator to fit the original colored training input in discrete Lab color space. The final colored output is a cascaded ensemble of these preceding by-products via summation, thus the fitting errors are reduced by a geometric series form. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with the sole-discriminator version have been performed on high-resolution satellite images in experiments, where significant reductions in prediction errors have been observed. © 2018 IEEE","","Generative adversarial network; Gray-scale satellite images; Multiple discriminators; Pseudo-natural colorization","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063144299"

To deal with this problem, we present a new pansharpening method using multistage joint bilateral filtering. Our method first separates the multispectral data into intensity and angular components by hyperspherical color transform (HCT). Then the proposed multistage joint bilateral filter is used to capture the different-scale details of both the panchromatic and the intensity images. Specifically, multistage joint bilateral filter performs joint bilateral filtering iteratively while the reference image remains unchanged and the filtering parameters vary progressively. The structure information with different scale is aware and the corresponding spatial details can be effectively extracted. The total spatial details are then combined and injected into the intensity component of the MS imagery. Finally, all the fused MS bands are obtained by the inverse HCT. The experiment is carried out on IKONOS and GeoEye-1 satellite images, respectively.

The necessary independent reference data on forest damage were collected during the ground surveys of test sites in the Amur, Irkutsk, Tomsk Regions, the Republic of Komi and the Krasnoyarsk Territory. The analysis made it possible to draw a conclusion about the significant influence of the processes of post-fire restoration of ground vegetation cover on the spectral-reflective characteristics of damaged forests measured during the vegetation period, and, as a consequence, the need to take this factor into account in the remote assessment of their degree of damage. The conducted research allowed drawing a conclusion about the principal possibility of using satellite images obtained in winter with the presence of snow cover on the earth’s surface to assess the degree of fire damage to coniferous evergreen forests. The advantages of using satellite data of the winter survey period are due to the masking effect of snow cover, minimizing the influence of spatially inhomogeneous spectral-reflective characteristics of ground vegetation on the values of vegetation indices damaged by forest fires. The use of satellite imagery data in the period with the presence of snow on the earth’s surface opens up the possibility of a unified application of the established dependencies between the values of vegetation indices and the degree of damage by fires of coniferous evergreen forests to assess the long-term dynamics of their condition. © 2019 Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Forestry can be improved by using NDVI. Water body and soil cannot be improved so easy. Classified result shows that water body includes shadow of building. There are many colors for soil because of humidity and vegetation contents. We found out that these problems can be solved by using maximum filter and minimum filter. Water body and shadow of building are detected very easy by using pixel value. These pixels have very small value. Shadow of buildings were deleted by using these filter because the area is very small. After applying these filter, we can divide into water body and shadow of building.

This study examines the accuracy of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) imagery when estimating biophysical properties of savannah grasses. Six commonly used vegetation indices utilising spectral ranges covered by the MSI were derived from a satellite image coinciding with a field campaign. The imaging and fieldwork dates were at the end of the growing season, at peak grass productivity. Two common grass species were selected for sampling: one broad-leaved, the other narrow-leaved. At widely spread sampling sites under different grazing intensities, five plants with no external manifestation of infection and in close proximity were selected for each species. From each species 35 foliar and 10 stem reflectance measurements were collected using a spectroradiometer which sensed in the 350–2500 nm range in 1.1–1.4 nm bandwidths. The reflectance was later averaged to generate one reflectance profile per species per sampling site. The leaves and stems from which reflectance was measured were collected for laboratory analysis to determine macronutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) concentrations. At three sites where sampling coincided with sunny weather during the satellite overpass window of 09:30–10:30 AM local time, above canopy grass reflectance was measured at ground resolution distance (GRD) of 1 m. Some reflectance was collected within 10 min of image acquisition, which facilitated comparison. The image data were corrected to bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance using the Sent2Cor algorithm whose output included 20 m GRD visible, red edge, near- and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands, which were used for the respective vegetation indices. The plant level and above canopy reflectance were resampled to the spectral ranges of the MSI bands, and values of the respective indices computed. Plant level values of three red edge indices, which collectively indicated green biomass and chlorophyll, had the strongest significant correlation with N concentrations in both grass species (r = 0.473–0.561; p < 0.01). P and K concentrations had low correlations with the tested indices. Largely due to canopy background reflectance, the above canopy and image-derived vegetation index values differed from corresponding plant level values by up to 9% and 40%, respectively. Despite the attenuation, the Red Edge Chlorophyll Index, Red Edge Inflection Point and a devised SWIR ratio index (ρ1650 nm/ρ2200 nm) showed potential for monitoring relative chlorophyll and green biomass (indicated by N concentrations), Ca and Mg content of savannah grass using Sentinel-2 MSI images. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Poaceae; Chlorophyll; Edge detection; Infrared radiation; Vegetation; Biophysical properties; Canopy reflectance; Ground resolution; Laboratory analysis; Red edge inflection points; Short wave infrared bands; Spectro-radiometers; Vegetation index values; algorithm; biomass; chlorophyll; correlation; leaf; multispectral image; satellite imagery; savanna; Sentinel; stem; vegetation index; Reflection","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077960910"

Mathematical morphology helps to analyze the spatial correlation of pixel spectra due to its rigorous mathematical foundation, in order to enhance its ability to analyze spectral correlation between pixel bands. The paper is based on the principle of multivariate order of principal component analysis, and defines multi-spectral morphology. Firstly, the first principal component analysis is used to sort the pixel spectral vectors in the structural unit, and the upper and lower bound operators of the structural unit are defined accordingly. Then, using the upper and the lower bound to construct basic multi-spectral morphological operations, including dilation, erosion, opening and closing. Finally, the proposed multi-spectral morphological basic operations are applied to multi-spectral image processing. The performance of QuickBird, Ikonos and aerial remote sensing images is analyzed and studied.

In this study, we used Sentinel-2, the latest multi-spectral satellite image in Europe, and Landsat satellite image, which can detect forest cover before deforestation, to find out where to restore not only the degraded area. Forest area was identified in 1970-1980s using Landsat satellite images and focused on changes in the area. Monthly Sentinel-2 images are calculated as NDVI to identify forest-related covers through phenological change of vegetation. Random forest machine learning classification is used to classify each cover. And for the impact of deforestation also quantified in terms of agriculture and water by multi-spatial model. Agro-environmental variables, agricultural water demand and forest water supply were estimated using the EPIC and InVEST-WY models, respectively. Analysis of deforestation showed that area under forests decreased by 25%, whereas that under cropland increased by 63%, and that the conversion from forest to cropland was the largest for the study period. As a result, agricultural water demand increased and forest water supply decreased, significantly. Analysis of the net impact of deforestation on water budgets using recent climate and two land covers showed that forest water supply decreased by 43% and agricultural water demand increased by 62%. In terms of agro-environment, the negative changes in organic carbon loss, water erosion, and runoff were observed, regardless of the crop type. On newly-converted agricultural lands, runoff is 1.5 times higher and water-driven erosion and soil organic loss are more than twice as high compared to older croplands. The North Korea has declined many benefits from ecosystem attributable to deforestation in recent three decades. In contrast, South Korea has experienced success in national-scale afforestation in recent decades, and North Korea can emulate this. The restoration of forests in North Korea promises more than environmental benefits; it will provide a new growth engine for the prosperity of the Korean Peninsula as a whole. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

Many approaches of removing haze focus on processing multi-spectral or RGB images, whereas few of them utilize multi-sensor data. The multi-sensor data fusion is significant to provide auxiliary information since RGB images are sensitive to atmospheric conditions. In this paper, a dataset called SateHaze1k is established and composed of 1200 pairs clear Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), hazy RGB, and corresponding ground truth images, which are divided into three degrees of the haze, i.e. thin, moderate, and thick fog. Moreover, we propose a novel fusion dehazing method to directly restore the haze-free RS images by using an end-to-end conditional generative adversarial network(cGAN). The proposed network combines the information of both RGB and SAR images to eliminate the image blurring.

In particular, we assume that there is a large undiscovered potential in multitemporal airborne laser scanning (ALS) for topographic mapping. In this study, automated change detection from multitemporal multispectral ALS data was tested for the first time. The results showed that direct comparisons between height and intensity data from different dates reveal even small changes related to the development of a suburban area. A major challenge in future work is to link the changes with objects that are interesting in map production. In order to effectively utilize multisource remotely sensed data in mapping in the future, we also investigated the potential of satellite images and ground-based data to complement multispectral ALS. A method for continuous change monitoring from a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite images was developed and tested. Finally, a high-density point cloud was acquired with terrestrial mobile laser scanning and automatically classified into four classes. The results were compared with the ALS data, and the possible roles of the different data sources in a future map updating process were discussed. © The Authors.

In consequence, the features in the images strongly depend on the environmental conditions. Such dependency between climate and landscapes has been regarded since the beginning of earth sciences; however, it has never been taken as literally as in the present study. We adapted a deep learning generative model as a first demonstration of the potential behind deep learning for spatial pattern generation in geoscience. The purpose is to build a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) useful to establish the relationship between two loosely linked set of variables that show multitude of complex spatial features such as climate conditions to aerial image. We trained a custom cGAN to generate Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery given a set of climatic and terrain predictors. Results show that the generated imagery shares many characteristics with the real one. In some cases, the quality of the generated imagery is high enough to deceive humans.

A common challenge in pansharpening is to reduce the spectral distortion caused by increasing the resolution. In this paper, we propose a method for reducing the spectral distortion based on the intensity–hue–saturation (IHS) method targeting satellite images. The IHS method improves the resolution of an RGB image by replacing the intensity of the low-resolution RGB image with that of the high-resolution PAN image. The spectral characteristics of the PAN and MS images are different, and this difference may cause spectral distortion in the pansharpened image. Although many solutions for reducing spectral distortion using a modeled spectrum have been proposed, the quality of the outcomes obtained by these approaches depends on the image dataset. In the proposed technique, we model a low-spatial-resolution PAN image according to a relative spectral response graph, and then the corrected intensity is calculated using the model and the observed dataset. Experiments were conducted on three IKONOS datasets, and the results were evaluated using some major quality metrics. This quantitative evaluation demonstrated the stability of the pansharpened images and the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2020 by the authors.","Image resolution; Quality control; Spectroscopy; IKONOS; Intensity correction; Intensity hue saturations; Multispectral images; Pan-sharpening; Relative spectral response; Relative spectral response graph; Response graphs; Spectral distortions; Spectrum correction; Image enhancement","IKONOS; Intensity correction; Model; Pansharpening; Relative spectral response graph; Spectrum correction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085087226"

Since there is no standardized method for estimating TC intensity and the most widely used method is a manual algorithm using satellite-based cloud images, there is a bias that varies depending on the TC center and shape. In this study, we adopted convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which are part of a state-of-art approach that analyzes image patterns to estimate TC intensity by mimicking human cloud pattern recognition. Both two dimensional-CNN (2D-CNN) and three-dimensional-CNN (3D-CNN) were used to analyze the relationship between multi-spectral geostationary satellite images and TC intensity. Our best-optimized model produced a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 8.32 kts, resulting in better performance (~35%) than the existing model using the CNN-based approach with a single channel image. Moreover, we analyzed the characteristics of multi-spectral satellite-based TC images according to intensity using a heat map, which is one of the visualization means of CNNs. It shows that the stronger the intensity of the TC, the greater the influence of the TC center in the lower atmosphere. This is consistent with the results from the existing TC initialization method with numerical simulations based on dynamical TC models. Our study suggests the possibility that a deep learning approach can be used to interpret the behavior characteristics of TCs. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Geostationary satellites; Image analysis; Mean square error; Numerical methods; Pattern recognition; Storms; Tropics; Behavior characteristic; Initialization methods; Learning approach; Lower atmosphere; Multi dimensional; Root mean squared errors; Standardized methods; Tropical cyclone intensity; Hurricanes","2D/3D convolutional neural networks; Multispectral imaging; Tropical cyclones","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081906306"

This work aimed to monitor siltation in two large rural and urban reservoirs by recording water color variations within a savanna biome in the central region of Brazil using a low cost and very light unmanned platform. Airborne surveys were conducted using a Parrot Sequoia camera (~0.15 kg) onboard a DJI Phantom 4 UAV (~1.4 kg) during dry and rainy seasons over inlet areas of both reservoirs. Field measurements of total suspended solids (TSS) and water clarity were made jointly with the airborne survey campaigns. Field hyperspectral radiometry data were also collected during two field surveys. Bio-optical models for TSS were tested for all spectral bands of the Sequoia camera. The near-infrared single band was found to perform the best (R2: 0.94; RMSE: 7.8 mg L-1) for a 0-180 mg L-1 TSS range and was used to produce time series of TSS concentration maps of the study areas. This flexible platform enabled monitoring of the increase of TSS concentration at a ~13 cm spatial resolution in urban and rural drainages in the rainy season. Aerial surveys allowed us to map TSS load fluctuations in a 1 week period during which no satellite images were available due to continuous cloud coverage in the rainy season. This work demonstrates that a low-cost configuration allows dense TSS monitoring at the inlet areas of reservoirs and thus enables mapping of the sources of sediment inputs, supporting the definition of mitigation plans to limit the siltation process. © 2020 by the authors.","Antennas; Cameras; Costs; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Orbits; Remote sensing; Reservoirs (water); Rural areas; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bio-optical models; Continuous development; Flexible platforms; Multi-spectral imagery; Remote sensing platforms; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Spatial resolution; Total suspended solids; Surveys","Drone; Inland water; Parrot sequoia; Remote sensing; Remotely piloted aircraft; Reservoir; Total suspended solids; UAV; Urban drainage; Water quality","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086436445"

In order to train the model, we propose a following framework divided in three blocks: generation of thick cloud masks for training images based on texture and spectrum analysis, selection of input-target couples of training images and training of the model using the GAN framework. The use of cloud masks for the training images allows the training of a model for clouds removal, robust to artifact generation in areas with thick clouds.

Scholars have long been interested in the study of soil organic matter and have helped address key environmental, agricultural and social and political issues over the past ten years. It is essential to have simpler, more accurate, more rapid and more inexpensive methods for plotting soil organic matter maps, and moreover, more time-and-cost saving ones.【Method】 Remote sensing data have extensively been used in digital soil mapping, especially in assessing soil organic matter, because the use improves accuracy of the prediction of soil physical parameters to some extent. To explore feasibility of combining the narrow band of hyperspectrum and the wide band of multispectral remote sensing images to realize high-accuracy prediction of soil organic matter (SOM), field data and soil samples were collected in Weigan River Oasis of Kuche in May of 2016 for in-lab analysis of SOM content using the potassium dichromate method; hyperspectral data were in the darkroom with the aid of the ASD Fieldspec3 spectrometer; the first 7 bands of the Landsat 8 OLI remote sensing images of May 30, 2016 were selected and used for atmospheric correction, radiometric correction and fine geometric correction of the images as pretreatment. In addition, the band averaging method was used to fit the measured data of the hyperspectral narrow bands into data of the multispectral wide bands, and then to screen out sensitive spectral parameters; models for assessing soil organic matter were built up, using the partial least squares regression method for test and screening of an optimal model. In the end, spatial distribution of soil organic matter was analyzed, taking into account all soil factors.【Result】Results show that SOM content in the oasis varies in the range of 3.57～39.22 g kg-1. An optimal prediction model was built up based on the 2nd, 5th and 6th bands as independent variables after being subjected to first differential transformation, with determination coefficient R2 of the model dataset being 0.852 and of the validation set being 0.897. On such a basis, the optimal model was applied to multi-spectaral data based prediction of soil organic matter using the Landsat 8 OLI satellite images. Differential transformation significantly improved the correlation of hyperspectrum with soil organic matter content. After the reflectances of the multi-spectral bands were calibrated with the ratio method, determination coefficient R2 of the validation dataset was raised from 0.711 to 0.849. Distribution of soil organic matter was less affected by land use types or soil texture than soil particle composition.【Conclusion】The inversion of SOM indicates that the remote sensing based inversion of SOM fits the actual situation of the study area, displaying good reliability and authenticity. In this study, the findings are the same as and different in places from those of other scholars, so further studies should take into account effects of soil moisture content, salinity, landform and some other factors on soil organic matter content and improve accuracy of the prediction model. All the findings of the study exploring feasibility of combining the hyperspectral model with remote sensing inversion in predicting soil organic matter in the studied area may serve as scientific basis and technical reference for quick acquisition of SOM information in Arid and semi-arid regions. © 2018 Science Press.

First, both sources are classified separately in five classes, using state-of-the-art supervised Random Forest classification and Convolutional Neural Networks. The two results are then merged in order to extract individual buildings with the highest spatial precision conceivable. Secondly, detected buildings are merged again with the Sentinel-2 classification so as to extract the artificialized areas; the building labels from the regularization step are dilated in order to connect the building objects; a binary classification is derived from the original Sentinel-2 classification before being reintroduced in a fusion and contrast sensitive regularization process so as to eventually retrieve the urban footprint.

For this reason, currently, the Bolivian state has considered a list of interesting applications of remote sensing in the country, including the following: biodiversity, forest and environment monitoring, mining and geology, epidemiology, agriculture, water resources and land use planning. Satellite images have a wide variety of applications for forest monitoring and evaluation, especially in the area of deforestation and determination of the use of natural resources. The Indigenous Territory and Isiboro-Secure National Park (TIPNIS). TIPNIS is a Bolivian protected area, of difficult access that is considered one of the regions with greater biodiversity worldwide. Recently the Bolivian state has decreed the construction of a high road that crosses the TIPNIS, given this, certain sectors have shown their disagreement because the construction of this road would violate the intangibility of this nature reserve. The Bolivian state has indicated that the construction of this high road will not have a negative impact on the environment, for which it has committed itself to a constant monitoring of forest resources. The present project seeks to contribute to these actions of monitoring the resources of this protected area, for which the proposal is to develop a nanosatellite provided with a multispectral camera, with at least seven spectral bands, to acquired and send the images to the earth station located in the Universidad de Ciencias y Humanidades, so then it can be processed and complemented with open source data from others Earth Observation satellites. Finally, two types of analysis will be carried out, the first is a temporal analysis of forest monitoring and various environmental parameters and the second analysis is the classification of agricultural land, to identify the type of crops that exist in the area. This project will be carried out with the help of undergraduate students, so the main objective is educational, but we believe it is important to show how aerospace technology and its applications help to solve real problems.

Actually, the probability of occurrence of frequency of appearance of pixel has certain effects on clustering results. In this article, the authors propose a method for clustering satellite imagery based on density.

Such maps also provide information for natural resource planning and analysis of the temporal and spatial trends in crop distribution and gross production. In this work, 10 meter resolution land cover maps were generated over a 6200 km2 area of the Riverina region in New SouthWales (NSW), Australia, with a focus on locating the most important perennial crops in the region. The maps discriminated between 12 classes, including nine perennial crop classes. A satellite image time series (SITS) of freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was used. A segmentation technique grouped spectrally similar adjacent pixels together, to enable object-based image analysis (OBIA). K-means unsupervised clustering was used to filter training points and classify some map areas, which improved supervised classification of the remaining areas. The support vector machine (SVM) supervised classifier with radial basis function (RBF) kernel gave the best results among several algorithms trialled. The accuracies of maps generated using several combinations of the multispectral and radar bands were compared to assess the relative value of each combination. An object-based post classification refinement step was developed, enabling optimization of the tradeoff between producers' accuracy and users' accuracy. Accuracy was assessed against randomly sampled segments, and the final map achieved an overall count-based accuracy of 84.8% and area-weighted accuracy of 90.9%. Producers' accuracies for the perennial crop classes ranged from 78 to 100%, and users' accuracies ranged from 63 to 100%.

The proposed integrated method was applied over the entire country of Romania (including minor order basins) for a 100-year return time at 30-m resolution. The results showed how the description of flood risk may especially benefit from the ability of the proposed cost-efficient model to carry out large-scale analyses in data-scarce environments.

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development.

Optimal threshold for segmentation procedure is selected from rate of change-local variance graph. Object-based fuzzy approach is implemented to identify LULC classes and LULC initial sets, and then the initial sets are classified to final LULC classes. In case of Lao Cai area, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), water index (WI) in object-based are used to generated water, terrace field classes, and built-up and vegetation sets. NDVI, soil index (SI) and red band are used to distinguish built-up set to building, bare land and road classes. NDVI and RedEgde band are inputs to classify rice field and forest classes from vegetation set. In case of Can Tho area, NDWI and WI are generated to water, vegetation, paddy field classes and built-up set, and then built-up set is classified to building, bare land, road, and paddy field classes.

We have evaluated the inter-annual variability of ET0-P during the period 1992-2017 and compared its anomalies (i.e., deviations from average) with anomalies in annual water release. Overall, it appeared that anomalies in water release were consistent with anomalies in ET0-P. The actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was estimated using a time series of multi-spectral satellite image data by applying the Surface Energy Balance (SEBAL) algorithm in a dry, wet, and reference year. We have determined the quartiles of the distribution of the ET0-P time series to identify these three years. The dry year was 2015-2016, the wet year was 2014-2015, and the reference (median of ET0-P) was 2013-2014. Finally, we compared seasonal and annual anomalies in ET0-P, ETa and release, Wd of irrigation water. In the period 1992-2017, the relative anomalies in ET0-P and Wd were similar only in 2000-2001 and 2015-2016. The analysis of anomalies in water inflow and stocks confirmed the response in increased Wd following wet years with higher inflow and replenishment of the reservoir. The response of crop water use to the irrigation water supply was evaluated by comparing anomalies in the ratio of actual to maximum ET, i.e., ETa/ETc with anomalies in Wd. As regards the Sidi Bennour, Faregh, and Gharbia districts, the relative anomalies in ETa/ETc and Wd were consistent, i.e., they had the same sign and comparable magnitude. Overall, the study shows that water delivery Wd responds to inter-annual variability in the pre-irrigation season water inflows into the reservoirs, rather than in ET0-P. On the other hand, actual crop water use, i.e., ETa/ETc, does respond to inter- and intra-annual variability in Wd. This evidence suggests that there is scope for adaptive water management based on a flexible adaptation of water release to inter- and intra-annual variability in water demand. © 2019 by the authors.","Crops; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Remote sensing; Time series; Water management; Water supply; Actual evapotranspiration; Adaptive water managements; Atmospheric water; Intra-annual variability; Irrigation water management; Irrigation water supply; Multispectral satellite image; Remote sensing monitoring; algorithm; annual variation; climate change; detection method; environmental monitoring; evapotranspiration; inflow; irrigation; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; water demand; water management; water use; Reservoirs (water)","Actual evapotranspiration; Adaptive water management; Atmospheric water demand; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073233936"

The technique used relied on a two-stage hybrid classification process: the first stage applied a knowledge-driven learning scheme to provide a land cover map (LC), including deciduous vegetation and other classes, without the need of reference training data; the second stage exploited a data-driven classification to: (i) discriminate pixels of the invasive species found within the deciduous vegetation layer of the LC map; (ii) determine the most favourable seasons for such recognition. In the second stage, when a traditional Maximum Likelihood classifier was used, the results obtained with multi-temporal July and October WV-2 images, showed an output Overall Accuracy (OA) value of ≈91%. To increase such a value, first a low-pass median filtering was used with a resulting OA of 99.2%, then, a Support Vector Machine classifier was applied obtaining the best A. altissima User's Accuracy (UA) and OA values of 82.47% and 97.96%, respectively, without any filtering. When instead of the full multi-spectral bands set some spectral vegetation indices computed from the same months were used the UA and OA values decreased. The findings reported suggest that multi-temporal, very high resolution satellite imagery can be effective for A. altissima mapping, especially when airborne hyperspectral data are unavailable. Since training data are required only in the second stage to discriminate A. altissima from other deciduous plants, the use of the first stage LC mapping as pre-filter can render the hybrid technique proposed cost and time effective. Multi-temporal VHR data and the hybrid system suggested may offer new opportunities for invasive plant monitoring and follow up of management decision. © 2018 The Authors","Italy; Ailanthus altissima; Classification (of information); Decision support systems; Hybrid systems; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Median filters; Passive filters; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Alien species; Invasive species; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Novel ecosystems; Support vector machine classifiers; Very high resolution satellite imagery; Very high resolution satellite images; Worldview-2; accuracy assessment; airborne survey; deciduous tree; ecosystem dynamics; grassland; image classification; image resolution; introduced species; invasive species; land cover; maximum likelihood analysis; pixel; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spectral analysis; support vector machine; vegetation mapping; WorldView; Information management","Ailanthus altissima mapping; Alien species; Invasive species; multi-temporal WorldView-2 data; Novel ecosystems; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056756443"

Various studies have shown the use of different remote sensing techniques to estimate forage nutritive values in field such as satellite images, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors. This study used multiple UAV- and ground-based sensors to estimate in-field forage dry matter (DM) and nutritive values including crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in-vitro true digestibility (IVTD). The main goal was to evaluate the performance of different sensors in estimating the forage DM and nutritive values. Two experiments were conducted, which involved only UAV-based sensors on a managed pasture followed by utilizing both UAV- and ground-based sensors on another pasture (without grazing animals). The UAV-based sensors used included a color (RGB) camera and a multispectral camera with red (R), green (G), and near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands. The ground-based sensor used was a spectrometer with wavelengths ranged from 587 to 1104 nm (128 narrow bands). The results indicated that some image feature such value (V) from HSV color space, normalize red, green, and near-infrared, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green NDVI (GNDVI) are important in predicting forage DM and CP.

This study aims to assess and monitor the transformation of pastoral land to agricultural land in the arid environment of the Feija Basin (Southeast of Morocco) and to find the key drivers and the issues resulting from this transformation. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to multi-temporal (1975–2017) and multi-sensor (i.e. Multi-spectral Scanner, Thematic Mapper, and Operational Land Imager) Landsat satellite images, from which land use classifications were derived. The remote sensing data in combination with ground reference data (household level), groundwater and climate statistics were used to validate and explain the derived land use change maps. The results of the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural lands show two patterns of changes, a middle expansion from 1975 to 2007, and a rapid expansion from 2008 to 2017. In addition, the overall accuracy demonstrated a high accuracy of 94.4%. In 1975 and 1984, the agricultural lands in Feija covered 0.17 km2 and 1.32 km2, respectively, compared with 20.10 km2 in 2017. Since the adoption of the Green Morocco Plan in 2008, the number of watermelon farms and wells has increased rapidly in the study area, which induced a piezometric level drawdown. The results show that spectral mixture analysis yields high accuracies for agricultural lands extraction in arid dry lands and accounts for mixed pixels issues. Results of this study can be used by local administrators to prepare an effective environmental management plan of these fragile drylands. The proposed method can be replicated in other regions to analyse land transformation in similar arid conditions. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Morocco; agricultural land; GIS; land use; Landsat; monitoring; pixel; remote sensing; time series analysis","GIS; Land use monitoring; Landsat images; Linear-mixture analysis; Morocco; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070943151"

The mapped rock glaciers were classified on the basis of their activity (intact or relict) and their origin (glacier-derived or talus-derived). Logistic regression models were applied to calculate the probability of permafrost distribution within transect under observation. We observed that freely available high resolution S-2A MSI L1C products are a valuable addition to the already existing freely available high resolution satellite images that can be exploited to study rock glaciers in Himalayan region. The distribution of rock glaciers in Sikkim Himalayas is found to be strongly controlled by elevation and aspect. Topoclimatic conditions above 5000 m a.s.l. are favourable for the presence of permafrost in Sikkim Himalayas. More glacier-derived rock glaciers than talus-derived rock glaciers were observed within transect under observation. Outputs from logistic regression models were capable to reasonably estimate the spatially-distributed probability of permafrost occurrence in the region. However, outputs from these models depended upon the selection of the initiation line location points of rock glaciers and topoclimatic and topographic variables used as predictors for model computation.

In particular, ASTER spectroradiometer images recorded in the Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) and Thermal Infrared Ranges (TIR) ranges can provide the lithological mapping and mineralogical composition of rocks. The scale of the resulting maps is based on the spatial resolution of the recorded digital images corresponding to the sensor. The ASTER spectroradiometer corresponds to the thematic maps with 1: 100000-1: 500000 scales. The goal is to increase the spatial resolution (upsampling) ASTER images in the SWIR and TIR bands with saving their spectral characteristics. The problem is the inability to use most known Pan-Sharpening methods because of ASTER images specification. The stack of imagery does not have the appropriate high spatial resolution panchromatic reference image Using any image (from visible or near-infrared (VNIR) spectral ranges) as a reference is not a good idea because they contain the data captured in the narrow spectral range (only in green, or red, or infrared). Therefore, the applying of standard approaches causing significant distortion of the spectral characteristics of SWIR images after the Pan-Sharpening procedure. In this paper, the main idea is using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning techniques for superresolution resampling Aster multispectral imagery. Accuracy assessment of proposed model shows better RMSE metric values (up to 50%) in the spectral characteristics of transformed images, as compared with standard pan-sharpening technics. © 2019 Monitoring 2019 Conference - Monitoring of Geological Processes and Ecological Condition of the Environment.","Condition monitoring; Convolutional neural networks; Ecology; Image resolution; Infrared devices; Infrared radiation; Lithology; Maps; Radiometers; Spectrometers; Accuracy assessment; High spatial resolution; Mineralogical compositions; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral satellite image; Short wave infrared; Spectral characteristics; Spectro-radiometers; Deep learning","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089586263"

Recently, various studies using hyperspectral imagery have been attempted. In particular, airborne hyperspectral imagery is composed of hundreds of bands with a narrow band width and high spatial resolution, and thus may be more effective in coastal areas than estimation of CHL through conventional satellite image. In this study, comparative analysis of hyperspectral and satellite-based CHL images was performed to estimate CHL in coastal areas. As a result of analyzing CHL and seawater spectrum data obtained by field survey conducted on the south coast of Korea, the seawater spectrum with high CHL peaked near the wavelength bands of 570 and 680 nm. Using this spectral feature, a new band ratio of 570 / 490 nm for estimating CHL was proposed. Through regression analysis between band ratio and the measured CHL were generated new CHL empirical formula. Validation of new empirical formula using the measured CHL showed valid results, with R2 of 0.70, RMSE of 2.43 mg m-3, and mean bias of 3.46 mg m-3. As a result of applying the new empirical formula to hyperspectral and satellite images, the average RMSE between hyperspectral imagery and the measured CHL was 0.12 mg m-3, making it possible to estimate CHL with higher accuracy than multi-spectral satellite images. Through these results, it is expected that it is possible to provide more accurate and precise spatial distribution information of CHL in coastal areas by utilizing hyperspectral imagery. © 2020 Korean Society of Remote Sensing.","","Airborne hyperspectral imagery; Band ratio; Chlorophyll a concentration","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101332044"

However, existing methods at the pixel scale consider only water bodies but disregard complicated mixtures. Emerging subpixel–scale methods improve water mapping a detailed description, but they still fail to achieve precise identification of various types of mixed pixels. This deficiency restricts the further development and application of the spectral index method. In this study, we proposed a novel spatial–spectral extraction method that utilizes double thresholds in describing pixels at the subpixel scale. This method combines spatial and spectral attributes to refine and decompose mixed water–land pixels. In this manner, a stepwise approach is adopted to achieve the optimal result instead of the common single–judging method. The experiments use moderate spatial–resolution images, such as those taken by Landsat–8 Operational Land Imager, GF–1’s wide field view multispectral camera and the Sentinel–2A satellite.

Remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System(GIS) technologies are to identify, study & analyze the urban expansion pattern. Surat city, Gujarat, India was the 4th fastest growing Indian city in 2016 as per a study conducted by international think tank city Mayors Foundation. This paper study mainly aims to identify urban sprawl for Surat city from 4 decade years 1990-2000-2010-2020. Landsat 5 & Landsat 8 RS satellite multi spectral 30-meter resolution images were used as input data to identify urban sprawl. Land Use Land Cover (LULC) classification for all 4 decade years were obtained by performing Iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification from Landsat imagery. Obtained classified images were reclassified mainly into 2 classes i.e. urban and non-urban. Further urban class was separately extracted using conditional tools in ArcGIS. Shannon’s entropy was computed to detect the urban growth of Surat city. Shannon’s entropy standard modelling equation was used and higher value of entropy was obtained indicating occurrence of sprawl. Mutli ring buffers of each radius distance interval of 2km were created to calculate the Shannon’s Entropy of the urban class for all the images. Total Entropy value for the year 1990, 2000, 2010 & 2020 are 1.657, 1.752, 1.766 & 1.848 respectively. The values of entropy are around 55% of the log(n), hence it shows dispersion in the region. Comparison graphs was created to compare Shannon entropy values from which compact development within the first 7km of Central business district(CBD) and beyond 7km dispersed growth was observed. From the above values the growth pattern for Surat city is radial and can be seen more in the southern part of the Tapti river from south west to south east. Very little increase in the urban area is visible in the northern region of the Tapti river. Three compact clusters can be seen being developed in the eastern, south-eastern & south Surat which contribute to the dropping entropy in the 10km & 18km buffer rings. For better visualization of urban sprawl in decision making for urban planner in development of city a webpage is created on WebGIS platform (ArcGIS online, HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, bootstrap etc.).

Crevasse splays represent significant geomorphological features for understanding the fluvial morphodynamics in lowland areas dominated by avulsion processes. Within wide floodplains characterized by very low elevation ranges, the detection and accurate mapping of crevasse splay morphology and features, such as crevasse channels, levees, and deposit, can be very challenging considering floodplain extension, anthropic impact on the natural channels network, logistic difficulties, and in some cases, climate conditions that prevent field work. This research aims at improving the detection and mapping of crevasse splays in lowland areas through the combination of different remote sensing techniques based on optical multispectral imagery and topographic data derived from satellite earth observation missions. The Lower Mesopotamia Plain (LMP) offers a unique opportunity to study the avulsion processes because it presents numerous examples of crevasse splays, characterized by different sizes and states of activity. Furthermore, in this area, a strong correlation exists between the formation and development of crevasse splays and the expansion of agriculture and early societies since the Early Holocene. Different supervised classification (SC) methods of Landsat 8 satellite images have been tested together with topographic analysis of the microrelief, carried out based on two different 1-arcsec DEMs (AW3D30 and GDEM2). The results of this study demonstrate that the combination of multispectral imagery analysis and topographic analysis of the microrelief is useful for discerning different crevasse elements, distinguishing between active and relict landforms. The methodological approach proved helpful for improving the mapping of erosional and depositional landforms generated by the avulsion process and, in the study area, provided the best results for the active landforms. © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural robots; Floods; Geomorphology; Image analysis; Landforms; Mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Earth observations; Economic activities; Methodological approach; Multi-spectral imagery; Remote sensing techniques; Strong correlation; Supervised classification; Topographic analysis; Image enhancement","Avulsion processes; Crevasse splays; Mesopotamian plain; Multispectral analysis; Relief analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088648324"

In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95% with official flood maps. © 2018 by the authors.","Flood control; Geomorphology; Mapping; Open source software; Open systems; Remote sensing; Satellites; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Ebro basin; Flood mapping; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite data; Normalized difference water index; Satellite data; Satellite remote sensing; Supervised classification; Floods","Ebro basin; Flood mapping; Free satellite data; Multispectral; Po basin; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057088214"

This requires accurate and efficient methods of determining rice N uptake in order to prescribe optimal N amounts for topdressing. This study aims to determine the accuracy of using remotely sensed multispectral data from satellites to predict N uptake of rice at the panicle initiation (PI) growth stage, with a view to providing optimum variable-rate N topdressing prescriptions without needing physical sampling. Field experiments over 4 years, 4-6 N rates, 4 varieties and 2 sites were conducted, with at least 3 replicates of each plot. OneWorldView satellite image for each year was acquired, close to the date of PI. Numerous single- and multi-variable models were investigated. Among single-variable models, the square of the NDRE vegetation index was shown to be a good predictor of N uptake (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 22.8 kg/ha for data pooled from all years and experiments). For multi-variable models, Lasso regularization was used to ensure an interpretable and compact model was chosen and to avoid over fitting. Combinations of remotely sensed reflectances and spectral indexes as well as variety, climate and management data as input variables for model training achieved R2 < 0.9 and RMSE < 15 kg/ha for the pooled data set. The ability of remotely sensed data to predict N uptake in new seasons where no physical sample data has yet been obtained was tested. A methodology to extract models that generalize well to new seasons was developed, avoiding model overfitting. Lasso regularization selected four or less input variables, and yielded R2 of better than 0.67 and RMSE better than 27.4 kg/ha over four test seasons that weren't used to train the models. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate models; Nitrogen; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellites; Multi-spectral data; Multi-spectral imagery; Multi-variable models; Multispectral satellite data; Nitrogen management; Reflectance index; Remotely sensed data; Rice; Multivariable systems","Lasso model; Multiple variable linear regression; Multispectral imagery; Nitrogen management; Reflectance index; Remote sensing; Rice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070474437"

Standard satellite missions could not provide such data at both high resolutions. Fusion approaches that leverage the complementary strengths in various satellite sources (e.g. MODIS/VIIRS/GOES-R's sub-daily revisiting frequency and Landsat/Sentinel-2's high spatial resolution) provide a viable means to simultaneously achieve both high resolutions in the fusion data. In this paper, we presented a novel, generic and fully-automated method, STAIR, for fusing multi-spectral satellite data to generate a high-frequency, high-resolution and cloud-/gap-free data. Building on the time series of multiple sources of satellite data, STAIR first imputes the missing-value pixels (due to cloud cover or sensor mechanical issues) in satellite images using an adaptive-average correction process, which takes into account different land covers and neighborhood information of miss-value pixels through an automatic segmentation. To fuse satellite images, it employs a local interpolation model to capture the most informative spatial information provided by the high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat) and then performs an adjustment step to incorporate the temporal patterns provided by the high-frequency data (e.g., MODIS). The resulting fused products contain daily, high spatial resolution and cloud-/gap-free fused images. We tested our algorithm to fuse surface reflectance data of MODIS and Landsat in Champaign County at Illinois and generated daily time series for all the growing seasons (Apr 1 to Nov 1) from 2000 to 2015 at 30 m resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAIR not only captures correct texture patterns but also predicts accurate reflectance values in the generated images, with a significant performance improvement over the classic STARFM algorithm. This method is computationally efficient and ready to be scaled up to continental scales. It is also sufficiently generic to easily include various optical satellite data for fusion. We envision this novel algorithm can provide effective means to leverage historical optical satellite data to build long-term daily, 30 m surface reflectance record (e.g. from 2000 to present) at continental scales for various applications, as well as produce operational near-realtime daily and high-resolution data for future earth observation applications. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Champaign County [Illinois]; Illinois; United States; Adaptive optics; Fusion reactions; Image enhancement; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Pixels; Radiometers; Reflection; Stairs; Time series; Automatic segmentations; Computationally efficient; Gap filling; High spatial resolution; LANDSAT; MODIS; Neighborhood information; Performance improvements; algorithm; GOES; growing season; Landsat; MODIS; numerical method; numerical model; satellite data; satellite imagery; satellite mission; segmentation; Sentinel; spatial resolution; surface reflectance; VIIRS; Satellite imagery","Fusion; Gap filling; Landsat; MODIS","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047396754"

This study proposes an approach of coupling the high-resolution satellite images and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data to observe the variation of Tan An open rocky mine during its lifetime. Five satellite images with the resolution of 0.5 m acquired in 2006, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and two ortho-images with 0.034 m resolution constructed from UAV photos captured in 2019, 2020 are used to make land cover maps. The analysis of land cover changes discovers 3 stages of open-pit mine exploitation consisting of unprompted exploitation, exploiting outbreak and stable exploitation corresponding to the changes in the mine. Besides, two Digital Surface Models (DSM) constructed by UAV photos are compared to calculate the elevation and volume changes. The assessment of the correlation between elevation change and land cover change indicates that the mineral exploitation is in the vertical range from 645 m to 660 m, and the exploitation trend is following the horizontal expansion rather than the deep excavation. Additionally, this experiment results in 79,422 m3 of mineral taken from the mine, and 34,022 m3 of soil used for the restoration within a year from June 2019 to June 2020. © 2020 Polish Mineral Engineering Society.

Though studies have been conducted using different spectral and sensing technologies to detect and monitor the wheat rust disease, few studies have been conducted in the application of high resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery in the monitoring of wheat rust to facilitate an operational monitoring over large areas. Since there are not many options for the multispectral data than the hyperspectral data, it is more important to select appropriate vegetation indices for the classification model. However, there have been few literatures about the comparison of these feature selection methods on the application of wheat disease. We proposed a wheat rust disease mapping protocol including removing the non-vegetated and lodged area, calculating and filtering the vegetation indices and mapping the wheat rust. In the process of filtering the proper features, we applied wrapper feature selection instead of traditional filter feature selection combined with the classification methods (support vector machine and random forests). The experiment data was a scene of ZY-3 satellite image of the wheat field in Changge County in Henan Province with a certain portion of rust disease. The classification results can achieve overall accuracy of higher than 90%, ranging from 90.80% to 95.10%. The wrapper feature selection method with the overall accuracy of 93.60% is better than filters feature selection method with the overall accuracy of 92.65%. The random forests method with the overall accuracy of 94.80% is better than support vector machine method with the overall accuracy of 91.45%. The high accuracies thus justified the feasibility of using high-resolution multi-spectral satellite images for mapping wheat rust disease, which is promising for this technology to be applied in the practical wheat production management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Henan; Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici; Triticum aestivum; Decision trees; Disease control; Feature extraction; Mapping; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Classification methods; Feature selection methods; High spatial resolution satellite imagery; Multispectral remote sensing; Multispectral satellite image; Operational monitoring; Support vector machine method; Wheat rust; accuracy assessment; disease incidence; estimation method; mapping method; monitoring system; numerical method; remote sensing; rust disease; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; spectral analysis; support vector machine; vegetation classification; vegetation index; vegetation mapping; ZiYuan; Satellite imagery","Feature selection; Mapping; Multispectral remote sensing; Support vector machine; Wheat rust","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049726138"

Multi-temporal satellite images are a natural data source to survey ice on lakes. In this paper, we describe a method for lake ice monitoring, which uses low spatial resolution (250 m-1000 m) satellite images to determine whether a lake is frozen or not. We report results on four selected lakes in Switzerland: Sihl, Sils, Silvaplana and St. Moritz. These lakes have different properties regarding area, altitude, surrounding topography and freezing frequency, describing cases of medium to high difficulty. Digitized Open Street Map (OSM) lake outlines are back-projected on to the image space after generalization. As a pre-processing step, the absolute geolocation error of the lake outlines is corrected by matching the projected outlines to the images. We define the lake ice detection as a two-class (frozen, non-frozen) semantic segmentation problem. Several spectral channels of the multi-spectral satellite data are used, both reflective and emissive (thermal). Only the cloud-free (clean) pixels which lie completely inside the lake are analyzed. The most useful channels to solve the problem are selected with xgboost and visual analysis of histograms of reference data, while the classification is done with non-linear support vector machine (SVM). We show experimentally that this straight-forward approach works well with both MODIS and VIIRS satellite imagery. Moreover, we show that the algorithm produces consistent results when tested on data from multiple winters. © 2018 Copernicus GmbH.

Spatial resolution is an element of crucial impact on the usage of remote sensing imagery. High spatial resolution means satellite images provide more detailed information. To improve the spatial resolution at the sensor level, many factors are ought to be taken into consideration, such as the manufacturing process. Moreover, once the satellite is launched, no further action can be taken from the perspective of hardware. Therefore, a more practical solution to improve the resolution of a satellite image is to use Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) techniques. This research proposal deals with the re-design, implementation, and evaluation of SISR technique using Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Skip Connections and Network in Network (DCSCN) for enlarging multispectral remote sensing images captured by DubaiSat-2 (DS-2) and estimating the missing high frequency details. The goal is to achieve high performance in terms of quality, and to test whether training the network using luminance channel only, which is extracted from YCbCr domain, can achieve high quality results. For this purpose, DCSCN is trained, evaluated, and tested using a dataset collected from DS-2. A single low resolution DS-2 image is used to construct its high resolution version by training the model from scratch and fine-tuning its hyper-parameters to produce optimal results. The performance is evaluated using various quality indices, such as Structural Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Wavelet domain Signal-to-Noise Ratio (WSNR). The performance is compared to other state-of-the-art methods, such as Bil-inear, Bi-cubic, and Lanczos interpolation. © 2019 SPIE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Quality control; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Multi-spectral; Peak signal to noise ratio; Structure similarity; Super resolution; Wavelet domain; Signal to noise ratio","Deep Learning; Image Reconstruction; Multispectral; Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR); Structure Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM).; Super Resolution; Wavelet domain Signal to Noise Ratio (WSNR)","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078179533"

Using remote sensing techniques and various satellite images, the objects are classified into different categories. Multi spectral characteristics and spectral response patterns are analyzed and studied. Using the information extracted across different decades, changes in land use have been derived. Furthermore, changes in different features e.g. built up, crops, water bodies etc. are analyzed and studied across years to factor out the zones that are experiencing recent urban growth.

The paucity is due, in part, to the lack of in situ measurements of pertinent information needed to tune water depth derivation algorithms. In many cases, the collection of the needed ground-truth data is often prohibitively expensive or logistically infeasible. We present an approach for deriving water depths up to 15 m in Case 1 waters, whose inherent optical properties can be adequately described by phytoplankton, using multi-spectral satellite imagery without the need for direct measurement of water depth, bottom reflectance, or water column properties within the site of interest. The reliability of the approach for depths up to 15 m is demonstrated for ten satellite images over five study sites. For this depth range, overall RMSE values range from 0.89 m to 2.62 m when using a chlorophyll concentration equal to 0.2 mg m−3 and a generic seafloor spectrum generated from a spectral library of common benthic constituents. Accuracy of water depth predictions drastically decreases beyond these depths. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is robust to selection of bottom reflectance inputs and sensitive to parameterization of chlorophyll concentration. © 2018","Anthozoa; Bathymetry; Chlorophyll; Optical properties; Reefs; Reflection; Remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Chlorophyll concentration; Coral reef; Digital terrain model; Inherent optical properties; Multi-spectral; Multi-spectral imagery; Remotely sensed imagery; Tropical carbonates; algorithm; bathymetry; coral reef; data assimilation; digital terrain model; in situ measurement; landscape ecology; phytoplankton; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spectral reflectance; water depth; Satellite imagery","Bathymetry; Coral reefs; Multispectral","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044460009"

By using of automatic extraction algorithm, various environmental resources information of tourist region can be obtained from remote sensing imagery. Combining with GIS spatial analysis and landscape pattern analysis, relevant environmental information can be quantitatively analysed and interpreted. In this study, taking the Chaohu Lake Basin as an example, Landsat-8 multi-spectral satellite image of October 2015 was applied. Integrated the automatic ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) classification results with the data of digital elevation model and slope information, human disturbance degree, land use degree, primary productivity, landscape evenness, vegetation coverage, DEM, slope and normalized water body index were used as the evaluation factors to construct the eco-sensitivity evaluation index based on AHP and overlay analysis. According to the value of eco-sensitivity evaluation index, by using of GIS technique of equal interval reclassification, the Chaohu Lake area was divided into four grades: very sensitive area, sensitive area, sub-sensitive areas and insensitive areas. The results of the eco-sensitivity analysis shows: the area of the very sensitive area was 4577.4378 km2 accounting for about 37.12%, the sensitive area was 5130.0522 km2 accounting for about 37.12%; the area of sub-sensitive area was 3729.9312 km2 accounting for 26.99%; the area of insensitive area was 382.4399 km2 accounting for about 2.77%. At the same time, it has been found that there were spatial differences in ecological sensitivity of the Chaohu Lake basin. The most sensitive areas were mainly located in the areas with high elevation and large terrain gradient. Insensitive areas were mainly distributed in slope of the slow platform area; the sensitive areas and the sub-sensitive areas were mainly agricultural land and woodland. Through the eco-sensitivity analysis of the study area, the automatic recognition and analysis techniques for remote sensing imagery are integrated into the ecological analysis and ecological regional planning, which can provide a reliable scientific basis for rational planning and regional sustainable development of the Chaohu Lake tourist area. © Authors 2018.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is one of the powerful methods for pan-sharpening. It first decomposes the image into a set of intrinsic mode functions and a residual component. These panchromatic and multi-spectral components are then fused to create an enhanced pan-sharpened image. This paper presents two efficient hybrid methods to enhance pan-sharpening of multi-spectral images. The new proposals combine the EMD with the two pan-sharpening methods: high-pass filtering and discrete wavelet transform to maximize the pan-sharpened image quality.

However, the traditional monitoring methods are mainly depend on visual inspection and manual investigation, which affects the efficiency and spatial scope of monitoring. Low altitude UAV remote sensing technology can effectively solve the problems of insufficient optical satellite images acquisition caused by cloudy and rainy weather in areca planting area, and improve the real-time monitoring of areca yellow leaf disease. In this paper, in order to identify the severities and spatial distribution of areca yellow leaf disease, five band(including blue, green, red, near-infrared and red-edge wavebands) multispectral images were obtained by using the MicaSense RedEdge-M multispectral camera mounted on the DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2.0. Based on the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), three sensitive features were selected from 15 potential vegetation indexes. Using Back Propagation Neural Network(BPNN), Random Forest(RF) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) classification algorithms respectively, a monitoring model of areca yellow leaf disease severity was constructed. A total sixty in-situ sampling points were selected and the disease index (DI) were obtained, according to the characteristics of the disease and the separability of remote sensing images, the severities of the disease were divided into three grades: health (DI<1%), slight (1%≤DI<10%) and serious (DI≥10%), and the number of samples was 18, 22 and 20 respectively. According to the priority principle of importance of feature variables, Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Modified Simple Ratio Index (MSR) and Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI) were finally selected. Two-tier neural networks including hidden layer and output layer were used to build the BPNN model. The results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) of BPNN model was 91.7%, which was 6.7% and 10.0% higher than that of RF model and SVM model, respectively. The Kappa coefficient of the BPNN model was 0.875, which was the highest among the three models. In general, the omission errors and commission errors of BPNN model were the smallest, the errors of health, slight and serous levels were 11.1%, 15.8%, 13.6%, 9.5% and 0, 0 respectively. Consequently, it is feasible to monitor the severities of arecanut yellow leaf disease based on the UAV multispectral image.

A convolutional neural network is used to segment water extent in these images, while clouds, cloud shadows and snow / ice are specifically handled by the network to remove potential bias from any downstream analysis. Atmospheric correction, post-processing and ancillary data are not required. To distinguish flood from permanent water we present a reference water mask that is derived by means of time-series analysis of archive imagery. Compared to widely-used mono-temporal reference water masks, it can be adapted to any area and time of interest. This study builds up on previous work of the authors and presents new results from recent flood disasters in Germany, Peru, China, India and Mozambique, as well as a flood monitoring application centred on the Indian state of Kerala. The processing chain produces very high overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient (>0.87) and shows consistent performance throughout a monitoring period of 12 months that covers 143 Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2 images. © Authors 2019.

At present, the monitoring methods of rice leaf folder damage is based on artificial investigation, which has the advantages of objective truth and high reliability, while there is a drawback of time-consuming, and it cannot used for a wide range of rice damage monitoring. An ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc.) Hand-held Spectroradiometer was used at jointing stage of rice. The results showed that, reflectance from rice canopy significantly decreased in the green (530-570 nm) and near infrared (700-1000 nm) regions, and significantly increased in the blue (450-520 nm) and red (580-700 nm) regions as the rice leaf folder population increased. Reflectance from rice canopy significantly decreased in the spectral regions from 737 to 1000 nm as the infestation scale of pest population increased, and the most correlation appeared at 941 nm. The more the numbers of rice leaf folder, the higher the changes of such characteristic parameters. The positive correlations were found between the damage of rice leaf folder and the discrepancy of characteristic parameters in these experimental fields. With China Remote Sensing career advancement, a large number of independent researches and development satellites have launched. Among a new generation of high-resolution satellites, GaoFen-1 (GF-1) stands out. It sets high spatial resolution (2 m-16 m), multi-spectral and high temporal resolution (4-day) with 60 km-800 km swath in a fusion technology with strategic significance. In order to explore the adaptability of Chinese GF-1 images in monitoring rice damage from rice leaf folder, nine rice fields were selected by damage severity in Xinghua City, Jiangsu Province at full heading stage in 2015, and the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), 2-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) were used to characterize the occurrence of rice leaf folder damages, which were calculated from the satellite GF-1 retrieval data. A series of analyses were performed to disclose the relationship among these six indices and the severity of rice leaf folder. Quantitative correlation analyses showed that NDVI, EVI, EVI2, SAVI, OSAVI and leaf folding population had a highly significant correlation (P<0.01), and SAVI had a highest correlation of 0.94. While there was no significant correlation between RVI and leaf folding population. Therefore, it was feasible to using hyperspectral data and GF-1 satellite images to monitor and warn the outbreak and development of rice leaf folder, which provided a new possible method to monitor dynamically the damage of rice leaf folder. © 2018 IEEE.","Image enhancement; Infrared devices; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Structural analysis; Vegetation; 2-band enhanced vegetation indices; Analytical spectral devices; GF-1 WFV image; High resolution satellites; Normalized difference vegetation index; Pest population; Rice leaf; Spectral characteristics; Remote sensing","GF-1 WFV image; pest population; rice leaf folder damage; spectral characteristics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055863279"

Does canopy gap size frequency distribution differ between new and old-growth forests? Can canopy gaps divert regenerating trajectories?. Location: Rehabilitating coastal dune forest, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods: We mapped canopy gaps in regenerating dune forest patches of varying age, which develop after seeding of the pioneer Vachellia kosiensis, and a reference forest by means of unsupervised classification of multi-spectral satellite images. We tested if gap formation can be explained by abiotic (exposure to winds) and/or biotic (tree density at early stages) variables. We calculated the scaling exponent of a power-law model to quantify if gap size frequency differed between new and old-growth forests. Finally, we measured canopy openness, tree height and number of stems to validate canopy gap classification and assess the consequences of canopy gaps on regenerating trajectories. Results: Exposure to winds and tree density at early stages were both significant predictors of gap presence. Gaps were more likely to be present along dune ridges and areas with low tree density than valleys and areas with high tree density at early stages. Large gaps were common in both new and old-growth forests. The scaling exponent was positively related to regeneration age, indicating a reduction in gap size as the forest aged. Areas with open canopies had shorter individual trees that were more likely to be multi-stemmed than areas with closed canopies. Conclusion: Canopy gaps are an important component of new and old-growth coastal dune forests dynamics. Although gaps are filled during forest development, changes in individual life-history strategies and morphology may alter regeneration trajectories. However, because their effect is partly controlled by the exposure to wind and tree density at early stages, it can also be manipulated by management to ensure nucleation, which could accelerate forest recovery. © 2018 International Association for Vegetation Science","","canopy openness; hierarchical Bayesian models; multi-stemming; random forest classification; size frequency distribution; SPOT6","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047401024"

Pixels are grouped using clustering and morphology based segmentation for region based spatial information. This is used to calculate the spatial features of the contiguous regions by classifying the region into the statistics of the pixel properties. In the proposed work, analysis of Google Earth images for identification of morphological patterns of the river flow is done for remote sensing image using graph-cuts. Multi-temporal satellite images acquired from Google Earth to identify the digital elevation is used to formulate the energy function from images to compare the displacement in pixel value using similarity measure. A method is proposed to solve non-rigid image transformation via graph-cuts algorithm by modeling the registration process as a discrete labeling problem. A displacement vector associated to each pixel in the source image indicates the corresponding position in the moving image. The transformation matrix produced from change in the intensity of the pixels for a region is then optimized for energy minimization by using the graph-cuts algorithm and demon registration technique. The proposed study enhances the advantages of regional segmentation in order to know homogeneous areas for optimal image segmentation and digital footprints for change in the river bed patterns by identifying the change in LANDSAT data from temporal satellite images. By applying the proposed multi-level registration method, the number of labels used in each level is greatly reduced due to lower image resolution being used in coarser levels.

A low-complexity pan-sharpening method is proposed to employ not only panchromatic images, but also multi-spectral images for enhancing the performance of the deep neural network. The high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) images are then fed into the proposed feature-level U-Net. The proposed feature-level U-Net consists of two-stages: a feature-level subtracting network and U-Net. The feature-level subtracting network is used to extract dynamic difference images (DI) for the use of low-level and high-level features. By employing this network, the performance of change detection algorithms can be improved with a smaller number of layers for U-Net with a low computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm detects small changes by taking benefits of both geometrical and spectral resolution enhancement and adopting an intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) pan-sharpening method. A modified of IHS pan-sharpening algorithm is introduced to solve spectral distortion problem by applying mean filtering in high frequency. We found that the proposed change detection on HRMS images gives a better performance compared to existing change detection algorithms by achieving an average F-1 score of 0.62, a percentage correct classification (PCC) of 98.78%, and a kappa of 61.60 for test datasets. © 2013 IEEE.","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Spectroscopy; Change detection; Change detection algorithms; Convolutional neural network; Intensity hue saturations; Low computational complexity; Resolution enhancement; Satellite images; Spectral distortions; Image enhancement","change detection; Convolutional neural network; deep learning; remote sensing; satellite images","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078704591"

Present study was focused on estimating the current and simulating the future LULC and LST trends in the alpine environment of lower Himalayan region of Pakistan. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images during 1987–2017 data period. The Cellular automata (CA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to simulate future (years 2032 and 2047) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. CA model was validated for the simulated and the estimated LULC for the year 2017 with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.77 using validation modules in QGIS and IDRISI software. ANN method was validated by correlating the observed and simulated LST for the year 2017 with correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 0.81 and 0.51, respectively. Results indicated a change in the LULC and LST for instance the built-up area was increased by 4.43% while agricultural area and bare soil were reduced by 2.74% and 4.42%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis of LST for different LULC classes indicated that built-up area has highest temperature followed by barren, agriculture and vegetation surfaces. Simulation of future LULC and LST showed that the built-up area will be increased by 2.27% (in 2032) and 4.13% (in 2047) which led 42% (in 2032) and 60% (in 2047) of the study area as compared to 26% area (in 2017) to experience LST greater than 27 °C. A strong correlation between built-up area changes and LST was thus found signifying major challenge to urban planners mitigating the consequent of Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon.

This poses the challenge of efficient discovery of imagery. One very important task in applications like urban planning and reconstruction is to automatically extract building footprints. The integration of different information, which is presently achievable due to the availability of high-resolution remote sensing data sources, makes it possible to improve the quality of the extracted building outlines. Recently, deep neural networks were extended from image-level to pixel-level labelling, allowing to densely predict semantic labels. Based on these advances, we propose an end-to-end U-shaped neural network, which efficiently merges depth and spectral information within two parallel networks combined at the late stage for binary building mask generation. Moreover, as satellites usually provide high-resolution panchromatic images, but only low-resolution multi-spectral images, we tackle this issue by using a residual neural network block. It fuses those images with different spatial resolution at the early stage, before passing the fused information to the Unet stream, responsible for processing spectral information. In a parallel stream, a stereo digital surface model (DSM) is also processed by the Unet. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method generalizes for use in cities which are not included in the training data. c 2019 by the authors.","","Building footprint extraction; Deep learning; Fully convolutional neural network; Pansharpening; Stereo DSM; Stereo imagery; Unet; World View-2 Imagery","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066441743"

In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes (“shadow”, “cloud”, “water”, “land” and “snow/ice”). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model's generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data. The rule-based Fmask method takes significantly longer (277.8 s/megapixel) and produces results with an accuracy of 0.75, Kappa of 0.60 and Dice coefficient of 0.72. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Clouds; Convolution; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Neural networks; Semantics; Statistical tests; Cloud shadows; Convolutional neural network; LANDSAT; Multispectral satellite image; Random forest classifier; Segmentation performance; Sentinel-2; State-of-the-art methods; artificial neural network; cloud cover; disaster management; image analysis; Landsat; remote sensing; satellite sensor; segmentation; Sentinel; testing method; training; Image segmentation","Cloud; Cloud shadow; Convolutional neural network; Landsat; Sentinel-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065926004"

The surface area of the earth provided by nature contains many different geographical locations divided into oceans, mountains, rivers, barren land, fertile land, ice caps and many more. The huge land masses and water bodies need to be observed and analyzed for optimum utilization of resources. Remote sensing is the best possible way to observe the earth's surface from a distance through different satellites and sensors. But most of the satellite images are not clear up to the extent to classify different terrain features accurately. Hence classification of image is needed to observe different terrain features in original images. In this study, the aim is to propose a branch of natural computation for SAR image classification into different terrain features with better information retrieval and accuracy measures as compared to traditional methods for satellite image classification. The object-based analysis has been used to extract spectral reflectance of five texture measures namely urban, rocky, vegetation, water and barren to generate training set. Minimum distance to mean classifier has been used with one of the Nature Inspired computation technique i.e. bacterial foraging optimization algorithm for the satellite image classification, to extract the more accurate information about land area of Alwar district, Rajasthan, India. In the proposed study a high-quality thematic map has been generated with the 7-band multi-spectral, medium-resolution satellite images. This approach provides the greater speed and accuracy in its computation with 97.43% overall accuracy (OA) and 0.96 Kappa co-efficient. © BEIESP.","","Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA); Land use land cover (LULC); Object-based image analysis (OBIA); Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Image","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071237526"

Mount Khakaborazi and Khakaborazi National Park is situated in this study area. It is the highest peak in Myanmar (19,315 feet or 5,887 meter) always covered with snow all the year round. This park is the most northerly, biggest and highest ecotourism site in Myanmar and Southeast Asia region (3,812 square kilometers). Mountains are among the most fragile environments on the earth. The purpose of this research was to study the environmental situation of mountain environment especially changes of land cover spatially and temporally (1995 and 2019). Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image data with 6 reflective bands, 30 meter spatial resolution is very excellent data source for image classification and mapping. There have four major steps for this image data analysis: image data pre-processing, image classification, accuracy assessment and chage detection analysis. In this analysis, selection of classification algorithm, training areas and post classification was done for smoothening classified image. Editing and checking was applied by using google earth and UTM maps for the validation of result. The result of satellite image analysis showing over 20 percent of vegetation disappeared within 24 years indicated the deforestation of this study area from 1995 to the year 2019. Overall accuracy of classification is estimated over 77 percent. Therefore, remote sensing is an effective method to implement the objective of this research paper. According to this method, estimate the vegetation cover with high accuracy without doing field experiments.

The goal of this study is to use the Fengyun meteorological satellite as the data source, and utilize the advantage of convolutional neural network (CNN) that can independently learn the deep correlation between input variables to obtain high-quality soil moisture data. Fengyun 3 meteorological satellite is China's second-generation meteorological satellite. The goal of Fengyun 3 is to acquire all-weather, multi-spectral and 3D observations of global atmospheric and geophysical elements, providing satellite observation data to medium-term numerical weather prediction; monitoring ecological environment and large-scale natural disasters; providing satellite meteorological information for global environmental change, global climate change research, and others. The medium-resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-II) is one of the main loads of Fengyun 3D (FY-3D) and is equipped with 25 channels, including 16 visible-near-infrared channels, 3 short-wave infrared channels, and 6 medium-long infrared channels. Among the 25 channels, 6 channels with 250 m ground resolution and 19 channels with 1 000 m ground resolution are obtained. The research used FY-3D to obtain high-precision soil moisture data and constructed a soil moisture monitoring technology system that can greatly reduce the dependence on foreign data, operating cost of large-scale monitoring systems, and improve system stability, safety, and monitoring timeliness. Improving the ability of meteorological services and level of domestic satellite applications is important. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture data using Fengyun satellite imagery, this study proposes a method of extracting soil moisture data using convolutional neural network(CNN). Method: CNN is a new machine learning technology that was newly developed in recent years and has attracted research attention because of its powerful autonomous learning ability. This technology has achieved great success in image classification, image segmentation, and other fields. This study constructed a soil moisture convolutional neural network (SMCNN) to achieve the goal of obtaining large-scale high-precision soil moisture monitoring using FY-3D remote sensing image. The SMCNN model includes seven parts, namely, input, temperature subnetwork, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extraction module, enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extraction module, surface albedo extraction module, soil moisture subnetwork, and output. The temperature and soil moisture subnetworks contain a feature extractor and an encoder. The feature extractor is used to generate a feature vector for each pixel, where the feature extractor of the temperature subnetwork has 11 convolutional layers, and the feature extractor of the humidity subnetwork consists of 9 convolutional layers, and the convolutional layer uses a 1×1 type convolution kernel. The encoder is used to fit the extracted features to the target variable. Both subnetworks use the average variance as a loss function. In the model training stage, the preprocessed FY-3D image and corresponding observation point data are used as inputs, and in the model test phase, only the preprocessed FY-3D image is used as the input. The temperature subnetwork is used to obtain the ground temperature from the FY-3D image, the NDVI extraction module is used to extract the NDVI from the FY-3D image, the EVI extraction module is used to extract the EVI from the FY-3D image, and the surface albedo extraction module is used to obtain surface albedo. The extraction results of the aforementioned four parts are used as input to the soil moisture subnetwork. The soil moisture subnetwork uses the extracted ground temperature, NDVI, EVI, and ground albedo to retrieve soil moisture. The output of the model is the pixel-by-pixel soil moisture value. The model is trained using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and finally the trained model is used to extract regional soil moisture data. Result: Ningxia was selected as the experimental area. The FY-3D used in this study is all from the satellite ground receiving station of Ningxia Meteorological Bureau, including 161 images in 2018 and 92 images in 2019, with a total of 253. After the images were stitched together, a total of 92 images covering the entire territory of Ningxia were formed. The ground observation data used in this study came from the automatic weather station deployed by the Ningxia Meteorological Bureau. The time range was from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2019. A total of 36 ground temperature stations and 37 soil moisture stations were observed. To verify the validity and rationality of this proposed method, we selected the linear regression and back propagation(BP) neural network models as the contrast models to conduct the data experiment. The mean square error was selected as the evaluation index. The comparison experimental results show that the RMSE of the SMCNN model is 0.006 7, which is higher than the comparison model. The experimental results show that the SMCNN model has advantages in extracting soil moisture from wind cloud images. Conclusion: The SMCNN model proposed in this paper fully utilizes deep learning technology to learn independently and improves the accuracy of obtaining soil moisture. The main contributions of this study are as follows: 1) Based on the analysis of the characteristics of FY-3D data, a step-by-step inversion strategy is established for the inversion of soil moisture requirements, and each step inversion uses a more relevant variable. The proposed strategy is an important reference for inverting other variables. 2) CNNs are used to construct network structures for inversion of surface temperature and soil moisture, and organized into a complete soil moisture inversion network structure. This structure enables direct access to soil moisture data from FY-3D data. 3) The feature value extracted by the 1×1 type convolution kernel used can be regarded as a spectral index and has a physical meaning. The main disadvantage of this study is that in the late stage of crop growth, the effect of vegetation index becomes invalid due to the saturation problem, which influences the inversion effect. This study aims to find other suitable supplementary parameters to introduce into the model to solve the effect of vegetation index saturation. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

To address these challenges, we, in this work, provide three contributions. 1) A brand new machine learning data-set, purposely developed for informal settlement detection. 2) We show that it is possible to detect informal settlements using freely available low-resolution (LR) data, in contrast to previous studies that use very-high resolution (VHR) satellite and aerial imagery, something that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs. 3) We demonstrate two effective classification schemes on our curated data set, one that is cost-efficient for NGOs and another that is cost-prohibitive for NGOs, but has additional utility.

Deep learning is a family of machine learning algorithms that have shown promise for the automation of such tasks. It has achieved success in image understanding by means of convolutional neural networks. In this paper we apply them to the problem of object and facility recognition in high-resolution, multi-spectral satellite imagery.

The development and distribution of remote sensing applications is also growing. The availability of extensive spatial and temporal data—enhanced by satellite remote sensing and open-source policies—provides an attractive opportunity to collect, analyze and use agricultural data at the farm scale and beyond. The division of individual fields into zones of differing yield potential (management zones (MZ)) is the basis of most offline and map-overlay precision farming applications. In the process of delineation, manual labor is often required for the acquisition of suitable images and additional information on crop type. The authors therefore developed an automatic segmentation algorithm using multi-spectral satellite data, which is able to map stable crop growing patterns, reflecting areas of relative yield expectations within a field. The algorithm, using RapidEye data, is a quick and probably low-cost opportunity to divide agricultural fields into MZ, especially when yield data is insufficient or non-existent. With the increasing availability of satellite images, this method can address numerous users in agriculture and lower the threshold of implementing precision farming practices by providing a preliminary spatial field assessment. © 2017, The Author(s).","agricultural land; algorithm; cellular automaton; climate change; farming system; food production; management practice; NDVI; policy implementation; precision agriculture; RapidEye; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; segmentation","Crop patterns; NDVI; RapidEye; Remote sensing; Segmentation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034035848"

In a major environmental disaster, the marshes of Iraq were drained, especially during the 1990s. Since then, droughts and the decrease in water imports from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers from Turkey and Iran have prevented them from regaining their former extent. The aim of this research is to extract the values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the period 1977-2017 from Landsat 2 MSS (multispectral scanner), Landsat 8 OLI (operational land imager) and Sentinel 2 MSI (multi-spectral imaging mission) satellite images and use supervised classification to quantify land and water cover change. The results from the two satellites (Landsat 2 and Landsat 8) are compared with Sentinel 2 to determine the best tool for detecting changes in land and water cover. We also assess the potential impacts of climate change through the study of the annual average maximum temperature and precipitation in different areas in the marshes for the period 1981-2016. The NDVI analysis and image classification showed the degradation of vegetation and water bodies in the marshes, as vast areas of natural vegetation and agricultural lands disappeared and were replaced with barren areas. The marshes were influenced by climatic change, including rising temperature and the diminishing amount of precipitation during 1981-2016. © 2019 by the authors.","","Climate change; Iraqi marshes; Satellites data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066468463"

In this work, we investigated the feasibility of automatic iceberg detection in Sentinel-1 Extra Wide Swath (EWS) SAR images which follow the preferred image mode in operational ice charting. As test region, we selected the Barents Sea where the size of many icebergs is on the order of the spatial resolution of the EWS-mode. We tested a new approach for a detection scheme. It is based on a combination of a filter for enhancing the contrast between icebergs and background, subsequent blob detection, and final application of a Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm. The filter relies mainly on the HV-polarized intensity which often reveals a larger difference between icebergs and sea ice or open water. The blob detector identifies locations of potential icebergs and thus shortens computation time. The final detection is performed on the identified blobs using the CFAR algorithm. About 2000 icebergs captured in fast ice were visually identified in Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Imager (MSI) data and exploited for an assessment of the detection scheme performance using confusion matrices. For our performance tests, we used four Sentinel-1 EWS images. For judging the effect of spatial resolution, we carried out an additional test with one Sentinel-1 InterferometricWide Swath (IWS) mode image. Our results show that only 8-22 percent of the icebergs could be detected in the EWS images, and over 90 percent of all detections were false alarms. In IWS mode, the number of correctly identified icebergs increased to 38 percent. However, we obtained a larger number of false alarms in the IWS image than in the corresponding EWS image. We identified two problems for iceberg detection: 1) with the given frequency-polarization combination, not all icebergs are strong scatterers at HV-polarization, and (2) icebergs and deformation structures present on fast ice can often not be distinguished since both may reveal equally strong responses at HV-polarization. © 2019 by the authors.","Alarm systems; Data visualization; Errors; Geometrical optics; Ice problems; Image resolution; Polarization; Sea ice; Small satellites; Space-based radar; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; CFAR; Constant false alarm rate algorithms; Deformation structure; iDPolRAD; Multi spectral imager; Number of false alarms; Operational ice charting; Optical image; Radar imaging","CFAR; Iceberg detection; iDPolRAD; Optical images; SAR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063990860"

The proposed CD criterion amounts to a large-scale non-convex optimization, which is first reformulated using the convex relaxation trick with associated change map interpreted in the probability sense, followed by adopting an efficient convex solver known as alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The resulted probabilistic change map would be more practical, and can be thresholded at 0.5 to yield the conventional binary-valued one.

During disasters such as flood, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of the situation as it occurs for effective response. In this paper, we address the problem of satellite image classification for urban floods using deep learning. We propose an encoder-decoder neural network based on the Efficient Residual Factorized Convnet(ERFNet), for multi-class segmentation of urban floods from multi-spectral satellite imagery. The ERFNet architecture capitalizes on skip connections and one dimensional convolutions to achieve the best possible trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Since time is of essence during a disaster, the choice of the ERFNet architecture on a high performance computing (HPC) platform is apt. Satellite imagery from WorldView-2 of floods in Srinagar, India during September 2014 have been used for this study. The tool ‘markGT’ has been developed to assist end-to-end annotation of satellite imagery. The urban flood dataset used for this study has been generated using markGT. The proposed deep learning model over urban flood satellite imagery gives promising results on Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU. We envisage that the proposed model could be extended and improved for real-time classification of urban floods, thereby aiding disaster response personnel in making informed decisions. © 2019 IEEE","Convolutional neural networks; Disasters; Economic and social effects; Floods; Network architecture; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Disaster response; High performance computing (HPC); Informed decision; Learning models; Multi-class segmentations; Multi-spectral imagery; Natural disasters; Satellite image classification; Deep learning","Classification; Flood; Multi-class; Neural networks; Segmentation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092287681"

Although there exist recent studies utilizing airborne LiDAR data for shoreline detection and water surface mapping, the majority of them only perform experimental testing on clipped data subset or rely on data fusion with aerial/satellite image. In addition, most of the existing approaches require manual intervention or existing tidal/datum data for sample collection of training data. To tackle the drawbacks of previous approaches, we propose and develop an automatic data processing workflow for land-water classification using multispectral airborne LiDAR data. Depending on the nature of the study scene, two methods are proposed for automatic training data selection. The first method utilizes the elevation/intensity histogram fitted with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to preliminarily split the land and water bodies. The second method mainly relies on the use of a newly developed scan line elevation intensity ratio (SLIER) to estimate the water surface data points. Regardless of the training methods being used, feature spaces can be constructed using the multispectral LiDAR intensity, elevation and other features derived from these parameters.

The results indicated that the concave-convex decision function is superior to traditional classification methods in distinguishing water and SAV, thus significantly improving SAV classification accuracy. The concave-convex decision function can be applied to waters with SAV coverage greater than 40% above 0.3 m and SAV coverage 40% above 0.1 m under 1.5 m transparency, which can provide new methods for the accurate extraction of SAV in other regions. © 2018 by the authors.","Banks (bodies of water); Data mining; Decision trees; Infrared devices; Lakes; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Vegetation; Water absorption; Aquatic vegetation; China; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Decision functions; High spatial resolution; Multispectral satellite image; Submerged aquatic vegetations; Extraction","Aquatic vegetation; China; Concave-convex decision function; GF-1 satellite; Lake Ulansuhai; Remote sensing extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051639293"

Many algorithms have been developed to obtain a better trade-off between spectral fidelity and spatial resolution enhancement. The recently developed techniques use sophisticated algorithms; however, three issues are often ignored. The first involves the progressively increasing amount of high-resolution satellite image data. Second, the designed method needs to be versatile to process a variety of complex terrain and surface features. The third is that the proposed method must satisfy the requirements of both visual inspection and classification. Based on the previous studies, this work proposes a generalized intensity-hue-saturation and Brovey transform framework (GF) to tackle these three problems. Eight modules are integrated into this GF: Four modules are designed for classification with a new intensity matching technique to improve the spectral quality; the other four modules are the spatial-enhancement version for visual inspection by adding more native spatial details. To verify the proposed technique, the experiments are conducted for QuickBird and WorldView-2 images. The results show that the GF modules can offer the maximal spatial information content while preserving good spectral information quality. © 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Economic and social effects; Image fusion; Image resolution; Satellite imagery; Brovey transforms; High resolution satellite imagery; High resolution satellite images; Intensity hue saturations; Multi-spectral imagery; Pan-sharpening; Spatial informations; Spatial-resolution enhancement; Image enhancement","Brovey transform; image fusion; intensity-hue-saturation; pansharpening","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055516809"

Consequently, the importance of clove trees as a provisioning service is increasing at the local level, particularly for smallholders cultivating clove trees as cash crops. Due to limited availability of data on local production, using remote sensing-based methods to quantify today's clove production is of key interest. We estimated the clove bud yield in a study site in northeastern Madagascar by detecting individual clove trees and determining relevant production systems, including pasture and clove, clove plantation and agroforestry systems. We implemented an individual tree detection method based on two machine learning approaches. Specifically, we proposed using a circular Hough transform (CHT) for the automated detection of individual clove trees. Subsequently, we implemented a tree species classification method using a random forests (RF) classifier based on a set of features extracted for relevant trees in the above production systems. Finally, we classified and mapped different production systems. Based on the number of detected clove trees growing in a clove production system, we estimated the production system-dependent clove bud yield. Our results show that 97.9% of all reference clove trees were detected using a CHT. Classifying clove and non-clove trees resulted in a producer accuracy of 70.7% and a user accuracy of 59.2% for clove trees. The classification of the clove production systems resulted in an overall accuracy of 77.9%. By averaging different clove tree yield estimates obtained from the literature, we estimated an average total yield of approximately 575 tons/year for our 25,600 ha study area. With this approach, we demonstrate a first step towards large-scale clove bud yield estimation using remote sensing data and methodologies. © 2018 The Authors","Madagascar; Syzygium aromaticum; Crops; Cultivation; Decision trees; Essential oils; Feature extraction; Hough transforms; International trade; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Satellites; Circular Hough transforms; Random forests; Tree detections; Tree species; Very high resolution satellite images; Yield estimation; accuracy assessment; agroforestry; algorithm; angiosperm; cash cropping; crop production; detection method; machine learning; Pleiades; remote sensing; satellite data; smallholder; spectral analysis; vegetation classification; yield response; Forestry","Circular Hough transform; Clove bud yield estimation; LULC classification; Pléiades satellite; Random forest; Single tree detection; Tree species classification; Very high-resolution satellite image","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056815301"

Pansharpening is prone to spectral distortions based on the nature of the panchromatic band. If the spatial features are unclear in the panchromatic image, the pan-sharpened image will not be able to produce clear images. Super-Resolution (SR) is a technique that enhances minute details of the features in the image, thereby improving spatial information in the image. By fusing the Multispectral image with the super-resolved panchromatic image, there is a chance for producing high-quality multispectral imagery (pan-sharpened image). In this paper, ten state-of-the-art super-resolution based on deep learning techniques are tested and analyzed using ten different publicly available panchromatic datasets. On analysis, a feedback network for image super-resolution (SRFBN) technique outperforms the other algorithms in terms of sharp edges and pattern clarity, which are not visible in the input image. The proposed method is the fusion of SR applied PAN image with the MS image using a benchmarked Band Depended Spatial Detail (BDSD) pansharpening algorithm. The proposed method experiments with six datasets from different sensors. On analysis, the proposed technique outperforms the other counterpart pansharpening algorithms in terms of enhanced spatial information in addition to sharp edges and pattern clarity at reduced spectral distortion. Hence, the super-resolution based pansharpening algorithm is recommended for high spatial image applications. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The limitations of current methods, together with the heavy pre-processing of input data they require, make them difficult to improve or apply to different satellite sensors. Here, we explore a deep learning approach based on daily sequences of multi-spectral images, as a promising and flexible technique that can be applicable to observations with various spatial and spectral resolutions. We test the proposed model for five regions around the globe using input data from VIIRS 750 m bands resampled to a 0.01° spatial resolution grid. The derived burned areas are validated against higher resolution reference maps and compared with the MCD64A1 Collection 6 and FireCCI51 global burned area datasets. We show that the proposed methodology achieves competitive results in the task of burned areas mapping, despite using lower spatial resolution observations than the two global datasets. Furthermore, we improve the task of burned areas dating for the considered regions of study when compared with state-of-the-art products. We also show that our model can be used to map burned areas for low burned fraction levels and that it can operate in near-real-time, converging to the final solution in only a few days. The obtained results are a strong indication of the advantage of deep learning approaches for the problem of mapping and dating of burned areas and provide several routes for future research. © 2020 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Currently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery are being assessed for analyzing within field spatial variability for agricultural precision management, because UAV imagery may be acquired quickly during critical periods of rapid crop growth. This study refers to the derivation of highland Kimchi cabbage growth prediction equation by using UAV derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and agro-meteorological factors. Anbandeok area in Gangneung, Gangwon-do, Korea is one of main producing district of highland Kimchi cabbage. UAV imagery was taken on the Anbandeok twelve times from early June to early September during the highland Kimchi cabbage growing season. Meanwhile, field reflectance spectra and three plant growth parameters, including plant height (P.H.), leaf height (L.H.) and leaf number (L.N.), were measured for about 40 plants (ten plants per plot) for each ground survey. The NDVIField for each of the 40 plants was measured using an active plant growth sensor (Crop CircleTM) at the same time. Six agro-meteorological factors include average temperature; maximum temperature; minimum temperature; accumulated temperature; rainfall and irradiation. The multiple linear regression models were suggested by using stepwise regression in the extraction of independent variables. Of the output independent variables of the stepwise regression, NDVIUAV performs best (r=0.933). And correlation coefficients of highland Kimchi cabbage growth parameters, accumulated temperature, irradiation and rainfall showed positive relationship; the results were respectively 0.931, 0.926, 0.893 (p<0.01). But minimum temperature had negative relationship; the results were respectively-0.789 (p<0.01). NDVIUAV and rainfall in the model explain 93% of the P.H. and L.H. with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.22, 1.90 cm. And NDVIUAV and accumulated temperature in the model explain 86% of the L.N. with a RMSE of 4.29. These lead to the result that the characteristics of variations in highland Kimchi cabbage growth according to NDVIUAV and other agro-meteorological factors were well reflected in the model. These results will also be useful in determining the UAV multi-spectral imagery necessary to estimate parameters of highland Kimchi cabbage. © SPIE.

Taking the Daquekou section of the Qiantang River as an observation target, four conventional fusion methods widely accepted in satellite image processing, including pan sharpening (PS), principal component analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS), and wavelet fusion (WF), are utilized to fuse MS and PAN images of GF-1. The results of subjective and objective evaluation methods application indicate that GS performs the best, followed by the PCA, the WF and the PS in the order of descending. The existence of a large area of the water body is a dominant factor impacting the fusion performance. Meanwhile, the ability of retaining spatial and spectral informations is an important factor affecting the fusion performance of different fusion methods. The fundamental difference of reflectivity information acquisition between water and land is the reason for the failure of conventional fusion methods for land observation such as the PS to be used in the presence of the large water body. It is suggested that the adoption of the conventional fusion methods in the observing water body as the main target should be taken with caution. The performances of the fusion methods need re-assessment when the large-scale water body is present in the remote sensing image or when the research aims for the water body observation. © 2019, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","fusion evaluation; fusion methods; GF-1 satellite image; inland water body","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061907814"

Effects of urbanisation include increases in surface runoff, frequency and magnitude of floods and urban water harvesting capacity. Accordingly, this study utilised multi-spectral and multi-resolution satellite images combined with field data to conduct a quantitative assessment of the impact of urbanisation on urban flooding for the period of 1975–2015 in Ajman City, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Results showed that urban areas in the city have increased by approximately 12-fold over the period 1975–2015, whilst the population increased by approximately 16-fold. Owing to a substantial increase in urbanisation (as impervious areas expanded), minimum precipitation to generate runoff in built areas dropped from approximately 16.37 mm in 1975 to approximately 13.3 mm in 2015, which caused a substantial increase in the surface runoff. To visualise the flooding potential, urban flooding maps were generated using a well-established decision analysis technique called Analytical Hierarchy Process. The latter adopted three thematic factors, namely excess rain, elevation and slope. Flooding potential was then found to have increased substantially, specifically in the downtown area. Finally, this study is expected to contribute highly to flood protection and sustainable urban storm water management in Ajman City. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Floods; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Satellite Imagery; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; United Arab Emirates; Urbanization; Water Movements; Ajman [Ajman (ADS)]; Ajman [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates; Flood control; Floods; Runoff; Water conservation; Water management; rain; rain; Ajman; Flood mapping; High resolution image; United Arab Emirates; Water harvesting; flood; flooding; mapping; spatiotemporal analysis; urban growth; urbanization; Article; controlled study; environmental impact; flooding; hurricane; precipitation; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; surface runoff; United Arab Emirates; urban area; urban growth; urbanization; city; environmental monitoring; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical model; water flow; Urban growth","Ajman; Flood mapping; High-resolution images; United Arab Emirates; Urban growth; Water harvesting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073628919"

Moreover, it greatly contributes to boost scientific researches, supports decision making process regarding important issues and has a tremendous potential to improve economic outcomes. However, the dramatic growth in the field of communication and the internet allows satellite imagery to be easily distributed, tampered and duplicated by unauthorized users. As a result, the protection of its intellectual property has become of a great demand. To overcome this issue, the concept of ""watermarking"" has been introduced as a potential solution for copyright protection and ownership authentication of satellite images. The principle of watermarking here is based on embedding a pattern of invisible identification information (for instance logo) into a satellite image so that it can be detected or extracted later to identify the copyright owner. Unlike other sorts of data, satellite images are complex in nature and contain very sensitive information which can be easily degraded by inserting additional information. This means that applying watermarking technique to satellite images would affect negatively on its quality, which totally interferes with the main purpose of building high resolution satellites. Thus, a proper technique should be developed to overcome this problem. Recently, digital watermarking has been a hot research topic in academia and industry, where a wide number of schemes have been proposed and evaluated. This paper deals with the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel watermarking model for preserving the copyright and authentication of DubaiSat-2 images. The proposed algorithm must be robust against intentional and non-intentional attacks such as compression, scaling, rotation, filtering, cropping, contrast enhancement etc. In addition, the algorithm should be fragile in such a way that it should be very sensitive to any minor tampering/modification and it should precisely detect tampered area on the satellite image. Moreover, the watermark should be imperceptible to the human eye. Five quality indices are used to assess the performance of the proposed prototype, which consist of the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), wavelet domain signal to noise ratio (WSNR), structure similarity index measurement (SSIM), normalized correlation (NC) and mean square error (MSE). © 2018 SPIE.","Authentication; Copyrights; Decision making; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Geology; Image coding; Image enhancement; Image watermarking; Mean square error; Remote sensing; Signal to noise ratio; Structural design; Content authentication; Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT); Mean Square Error (MSE); Multi-spectral; Normalized correlation; Panchromatic; Structure similarity; Wavelet domain; Satellite imagery","Content Authentication; Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT); Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Mean Square Error (MSE).; Multispectral; Normalized Correlation (NC); Panchromatic; Satellite imagery; Structure Similarity Index Measurement (SSIM); Wavelet domain Signal to Noise Ratio (WSNR)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057301272"

Therefore, an image of an area wider than the swath width (16 km) cannot be acquired with a single scanning. Thus, after scanning multiple areas in units of swath width, the acquired images should be made into one image. At this time, the necessary algorithm is called image mosaicking or image stitching, and is used for cartography. Mosaic algorithm generally consists of the following 4 steps: (1) Feature extraction and matching, (2) Radiometric balancing, (3) Seamline estimation, and (4) Image blending.

An increase in the amount of information acquired by satellite imaging systems, urges the need for automatic tools for classification. Satellite images exhibit spatial and/or temporal dependencies in which the conventional machine learning algorithms fail to perform well. In this paper, we propose an improved framework for automated land cover classification using Spatial Spectral Schroedinger Eigenmaps (SSSE) optimized by Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted for the final thematic map generation following dimensionality reduction and clustering by the proposed approach. The novelty of the proposed framework is that the applicability of optimized SSSE for land cover classification of medium and high resolution multi-spectral satellite images is tested for the first time. The proposed method makes land cover classification system fully automatic by optimizing the algorithm specific image dependent parameter α using CS algorithm. Experiments are carried out over publicly available high and medium resolution multi-spectral satellite image datasets (Landsat 5 TM and IKONOS 2 MS) and hyper-spectral satellite image datasets (Pavia University and Indian Pines) to assess the robustness of the proposed approach.

Specifically, red-edge (RE) satellite images can be used in this context to reduce the influence of soil background at early stages as well as saturation due to crop leaf area index (LAI) at later stages. However, the availability of high-resolution RE satellite image products for research and application globally remains limited.

The resultant fused image is highly correlated (R2 > 0.98) with Sentinel-2 image and clearly illustrates the persistent advantages of such products. This fused image was significantly more accurate than the originals when used to predict heterogeneous wheat LAI and therefore clearly illustrated the persistence of Sentinel-2 spectral and Planet spatial advantage, which indirectly proved that the fusion methodology of generating high-resolution red-edge products from Planet and Sentinel-2 images is possible.

Especially, satellite image registration is a challenging task due to the high resolution of images. In addition, demands for high resolution satellite imagery are increased for more detailed and precise information in land planning, urban planning, and Earth observation. Commonly, feature-based methods are applied for image registration. In these methods, first control or key points are detected using feature detector such as scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). The numbers and the distribution of these control points are important for the remaining steps of registration. These methods provide reasonable performance; however, they suffer from high computational cost and irregular distribution of control points. To overcome these limitations, we propose an area-based registration method using histogram matching and zero mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC). In multi-spectral satellite images, first, different spectral responses are adjusted by using histogram matching. Then, ZNCC is utilized to extract well-distributed control points. In addition, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and block-wise processing are applied to reduce the computational cost. The proposed method is evaluated through various input datasets. The results demonstrate its efficacy and accuracy in image registration. © 2019 by the authors.","","Area-based registration; Feature-based registration; Image registration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072244182"

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for researchers to use freely available multi-spectral optical images, with decametric spatial resolution and more frequent revisits for remote sensing applications such as land cover and crop classification (LC&CC), agricultural monitoring and management, environment monitoring.Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping can be categorized based on per-pixel based and object-based. However, it is still challenging when more classes of agricultural crops are considered at a massive scale.

The proposed methodology is capable of automated feature extraction by learning time correlation of multiple images, which reduces manual feature engineering and modeling crop phenological stages. Fifteen classes, including major agricultural crops, were considered in this study.

However, several works demonstrated that low-quality or noisy data (even including perceptually not visible noises) may have a huge impact on the accuracy of CNN models. Therefore, as inspired by biological perception systems, some recent works proposed the use of recurrent and feedback features in CNNs as an improvement to the existing feed-forward CNNs. These recent works on the integration of recurrence and/or feedback to CNNs mostly tested deep networks on natural scenes with relatively perceptually good resolution color images. In this work, we explored the effectiveness of CNNs with recurrent and feedback features for the solar-power plant classification task on mid-resolution (1 pixel - 30×30 square meters per pixel) multi-spectral satellite images. Experiments show promising results when using top-down signals (especially recurrent and feedback features together) on CNNs for multi-spectral image classification tasks, outperforming the baseline CNN model without any recurrent and feedback structure and other approaches in the literature including deep models. © 2018 The Authors.

Satellite images have increasingly been used to extract such information, yet the accuracy has been challenged by the spectral and spatial heterogeneity of urban land covers. This paper presents a framework to develop a more skilful and reliable model for estimating land cover fractions using a multi-model ensemble technique, named Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The BMA is a statistical technique that combines the estimates of different models using Bayesian probability theory. In the BMA, each individual estimate is assigned a weight that is optimised in such a way that the likelihood of an individual estimate given the observation is maximised. In this study, three methods, viz. Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Pre-screened and Normalised Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (PNMESMA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used to develop an Ensemble Model (EM). We used a cluster-based approach for applying the BMA to utilise the diverse advantages in individual models. First, the image pixels were separated into three clusters by applying Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds. Second, an ensemble of models for each cluster was derived using the BMA, and these ensembles were finally combined to derive the final output. The EM was tested in a heterogeneous urban area, viz. South Delhi, India, using two multi-spectral images, including Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER). The modelled land cover fractions were compared with the reference land cover fractions derived from a high-resolution (approximately 1 m) panchromatic image of the OrbitView-3 satellite. The accuracy assessment revealed that the EM estimates more accurate and reliable land cover fractions than the individual models on both the images. The performance of the EM in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and kappa coefficient (k) is generally superior to that of the best of the individual models. These findings can help improve the accuracy of land cover fractions in heterogeneous landscapes by combining the outputs of various diverse models. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Delhi; India; Bayesian networks; Edge detection; Mean square error; Orbits; Pixels; Probability; Spectroscopy; Sustainable development; Vegetation; Bayesian model averaging; Bayesian probability theory; Enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+); Heterogeneous landscapes; Land cover informations; Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis; Normalised difference vegetation index; Support vector regression (SVR); Bayesian analysis; heterogeneity; land cover; numerical model; pixel; urban area; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054837831"

Sentinel-2 images provide multi-spectral information every 5 days for each location. However, the maximum spatial resolution of its bands is 10m for RGB and near-infrared bands. Increasing the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images without additional costs, would make any posterior analysis more accurate. Most approaches on super-resolution for Sentinel-2 have focused on obtaining 10m resolution images for those at lower resolutions (20m and 60m), taking advantage of the information provided by bands of finer resolutions (10m). Otherwise, our focus is on increasing the resolution of the 10m bands, that is, super-resolving 10m bands to 2.5m resolution, where no additional information is available. This problem is known as single-image super-resolution and deep learning-based approaches have become the state-of-the-art for this problem on standard images. Obviously, models learned for standard images do not translate well to satellite images. Hence, the problem is how to train a deep learning model for super-resolving Sentinel-2 images when no ground truth exist (Sentinel-2 images at 2.5m). We propose a methodology for learning Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentinel-2 image super-resolution making use of images from other sensors having a high similarity with Sentinel-2 in terms of spectral bands, but greater spatial resolution. Our proposal is tested with a state-of-the-art neural network showing that it can be useful for learning to increase the spatial resolution of RGB and near-infrared bands of Sentinel-2. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

However, these hydrologic features remain poorly studied mainly because they are too narrow (typically <30 m) to be reliably delineated in conventional moderate-resolution satellite images (e.g., 30 m Landsat-8 imagery). This study demonstrates the utility of 10 m Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument images to map supraglacial rivers on the northwest Greenland Ice Sheet, Devon Ice Cap, and Barnes Ice Cap, covering a total area of ∼10,000 km2. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 both capture overall supraglacial drainage patterns, but Sentinel-2 images are superior to Landsat-8 images for delineating narrow and continuous supraglacial rivers. Sentinel-2 mapping across the three study areas reveals a variety of supraglacial drainage patterns. In northwest Greenland near Inglefield Land, subparallel supraglacial rivers up to 55 km long drain meltwater directly off the ice sheet onto the proglacial zone. On the Devon and the Barnes ice caps, shorter supraglacial rivers (up to 15–30 km long) are commonly interrupted by moulins, which drain internally drained catchments on the ice surface to subglacial systems. We conclude that Sentinel-2 offers strong potential for investigating supraglacial meltwater drainage patterns and improving our understanding of the hydrological conditions of ice masses globally. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arctic; Barnes Ice Cap; Canada; Canada; Devon Ice Cap; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Nunavut; catchment; glacial hydrology; image analysis; Landsat; meltwater; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Sentinel","Greenland Ice Sheet; Landsat-8; River remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Supraglacial River; Surface hydrology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062844448"

The reason is that forest plays an important role in ensuring overall ecosystem stability. Therefore, forest managers should continuously seek forest information quickly, accurately and cost-effectively. Difficulty faced in detecting forest cover changes using conventional method due to inaccessible sites and complexity of Malaysia tropical forest landscape. Conventional field verification of forest cover changes is costly and time consuming. Some of the forest changes are very small and undetectable even though using high resolution satellite imagery. Hence, usage of UAV equipped with high resolution sensor for data acquisition at the area of interest (AOI) is needed. Focus of this study is to monitor and assess deforestation and forest degradation in Sungai Menyala Forest Reserve, Negeri Sembilan through mapping and analysis of forest cover changes using geospatial approaches. Early information on forest cover change is extracted from Forest Monitoring Using Remote Sensing System (FMRS) equipped with latest satellite imageries, forestry and secondary data. Supervised classification of multi-spectral SPOT 7 image was carried out. Meanwhile, data acquired from UAV at the AOI is mosaic and analysed. Next, resultant classes changes is compared and verified for ground truthing and verification.

Mapping gully features from remote sensing imagery is crucial for assisting in understanding gully erosion mechanisms, predicting its development processes and assessing its environmental and socio-economic effects over large areas, especially under the increasing global climate extremes and intensive human activities. However, the potential of using increasingly available high-resolution remote sensing imagery to detect and delineate gullies has been less evaluated. Hence, 130 gullies occurred along a transect were selected from a typical watershed in the hilly and gully region of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and visually interpreted from a Pleiades-1B satellite image (panchromatic-sharpened image at 0.5 m resolution fused with 2.0 m multi-spectral bands). The interpreted gullies were compared with their measured data obtained in the field using a differential global positioning system (GPS). Results showed that gullies could generally be accurately interpreted from the image, with an average relative error of gully area and gully perimeter being 11.1% and 8.9%, respectively, and 74.2% and 82.3% of the relative errors for gully area and gully perimeter were within 15%. But involving field measurements of gullies in present imagery-based gully studies is still recommended. To judge whether gullies were mapped accurately further, a standard adopting one-pixel tolerance along the mapped gully edges was proposed and proved to be practical. Correlation analysis indicated that larger gullies could be interpreted more accurately but increasing gully shape complexity would decrease interpreting accuracy. Overall lower vegetation coverage in winter due to the withering and falling of vegetation rarely affected gully interpreting. Furthermore, gully detectability on remote sensing imagery in this region was lower than the other places of the world, due to the overall broken topography in the Loess Plateau, thus images with higher resolution than normally perceived are needed when mapping erosion features here. Taking these influencing factors (gully dimension and shape complexity, vegetation coverage, topography) into account will be favorable to select appropriate imagery and gullies (as study objects) in future imagery-based gully studies. Finally, two linear regression models were built to correct gully area (A                             ip                             , m                             2                             ) and gully perimeter (P                             ip                             , m) visually extracted, by connecting them with the measured area (A                             ms                             , m                             2                             ) and perimeter (P                             ms                             , m). The correction models were A                             ms                              = 1.021A                             ip                              + 0.139 and P                             ms                              = 0.949P                             ip                             + 0.722, respectively. These models could be helpful for improving the accuracy of interpreting results, and further accurately estimating gully development and developing more effective automated gully extraction methods on the Loess Plateau of China.                          © 2019 by the authors.

Images at a low resolution may contain relevant information that has to be integrated with the high resolution image to obtain the required information. This is being fulfilled by image fusion. Image fusion is merging of different resolution images into a single image. The output image contains more information, as the information is integrated from both the images Image fusion was conducted with two different algorithms: regression kriging and the LULU operators. First, regression Kriging estimates the value of a dependent variable at unsampled location with the help of auxiliary variables. Here we used regression Kriging with the Hyperion image band as the response variables and the LISS III image bands are the explanatory variables. The fused image thus has the spectral variables from Hyperion image and the spatial variables from the LISS III image. Second, the LULU operator is an image processing methods that can be used as well in image fusion technique. Here we explored to fuse the Hyperion and LISS III image. The LULU operators work in three stages of the process, viz the decomposition stage, the fusion and the reconstruction stage. Quality aspects of the fused image for both techniques have been compared for spectral quality (correlation) and spatial quality (entropy). The study concludes that the quality of the fused image obtained with regression kriging is better than that obtained with the LULU operator. © 2018 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

However, the effect of short-wavelength illumination, implicated by laboratory research and small-scale cohort studies as the main driving force behind BC–ALAN association, has not been supported by any population-level study carried out to date. We investigated a possible link between BC and ALAN of different subspectra using a multi-spectral year-2011 satellite image, taken from the International Space Station, and superimposing it with year-2013 BC incidence data available for the Great Haifa Metropolitan Area in Israel. The analysis was performed using both ordinary least square (OLS) and spatial dependency models, controlling for socioeconomic and locational attributes of the study area. The study revealed strong associations between BC and blue and green light subspectra (B = 0.336 ± 0.001 and B = 0.335 ± 0.002, respectively; p < 0.01), compared to a somewhat weaker effect for the red subspectrum (B = 0.056 ± 0.001; p < 0.01). However, spatial dependency models, controlling for spatial autocorrelation of regression residuals, confirmed only a positive association between BC incidence and short-wavelength (blue) ALAN subspectrum (z = 2.462, p < 0.05) while reporting insignificant associations between BC and either green (z = 1.425, p > 0.1) or red (z = −0.604, p > 0.1) subspectra. The obtained result is in line with the results of laboratory- and small-scale cohort studies linking short-wavelength nighttime illumination with circadian disruption and melatonin suppression.

Accuracy assessment of the derived thematic maps was based on the analysis of the classification confusion matrix statistics computed for each classified map, using for consistency the same set of validation points. We were analyzed and compared Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion hyperspectral data to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Advance Land Imager (ALI) multispectral data. Hyperspectral imagers, currently available on airborne platforms, provide increased spectral resolution over existing space based sensors that can document detailed information on the distribution of land cover classes, sometimes species level. Results indicate that KNN (95, 94, 88 overall accuracy and .91, .89, .85 kappa coefficient for Hyp, ALI, OLI respectively) shows better results than unsupervised classification (93, 90, 84 overall accuracy and .89, .87, .81 kappa coefficient for Hyp, ALI, OLI respectively). Development of spectral library for land cover classes is a key component needed to facilitate advance analytical techniques to monitor land cover changes. Different land cover classes in Samara were sampled to create a common spectral library for mapping landscape from remotely sensed data. The development of these libraries provides a physical basis for interpretation that is less subject to conditions of specific data sets, to facilitate a global approach to the application of hyperspectral imagers to mapping landscape. In addition, it is demonstrated that the hyperspectral satellite image provides more accurate classification results than those extracted from the multispectral satellite image. The higher classification accuracy by KNN supervised was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify optimal separating classes with low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes’ separation. © 2018, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum isnot suitable for detection and monitoring of flood during rainy season and clouds in the sky due to non-penetratingcapability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensorsin optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)Sensor is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surfacefrom the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and characterized by near all-weather/day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surfaceareas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in microwave spectrum and acts asspecular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from space borne SAR sensors resulting into darkpixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding area of earth surface. The change detection techniques using multitemporal SAR images based on the behavior of back-scattered signals for threshold value for detecting the floodbetween non-flooding and flooding period, and provide information related the status of water surface of river system.Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of space-borne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensorsdue its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the earth surface depending uponthe repeat orbit and SAR payloads on satellite. Space-borne SAR payloads can be placed in the orbit into fully active orsemi-active configuration based on both transmits and receives capability of signals.In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi-static space-borne SAR sensors has been described for developmentof real time space-borne SAR surveillance system for monitoring of various characteristics of river basins and detectionof flood using threshold/change detection techniques.

In the present study, an impact of urbanisation on the creeks of Mumbai, India namely Thane, Malad and Manori creeks, has been addressed. Multi-temporal satellite images of Landsat for the years 1972, 1994 and 2016 are considered to perform the changes in the mudflat and growth of the mangrove, as well as the changes in creeks width apart from the Land use Land cover (LULC). Object-based image analysis using multi-spectral resolution confirmed that there is an overall increase in the spatial extent of mangroves and reduction in the width of all the creeks. Mangroves around Thane creek and Manori creek have increased from 50.7 km2 to 57.6 km2 and 8.4 km2 to 25.2 km2respectively. However, there is a decrease in mangroves around Malad Creek from13.3 km2 to 9.7 km2during 1972 to 2016. The relationship between the creek geometry and LULC was also explored, and it has been revealed that the creek width has reduced due to urbanisation. Life expectancy analysis projected a further reduction in the width of the creeks for the years 2025 and 2050. The study suggests that there must be stringent bye-laws for disposal of sewage into the creeks and development activity near the creek areas. Further, upper stretches of the creeks require cleaning and dredging so that the tidal water will be approached up to the upper portion to maintain the creek ecosystem. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","India; Maharashtra; Malad Creek; Manori Creek; Mumbai; Thane Creek; Rhizophoraceae; coastal landform; geometry; GIS; image analysis; land use change; mangrove; spatial analysis; urbanization","Creek; GIS; LULC; Mangroves; Mumbai; OBIA","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077381794"

Bi-temporal change detection method is unable to indicate the continuous change occurring over a long period of time and thus to achieve this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral satellite images of same geographical region over a period of 2015 to 2018 are obtained and analyzed. SAR data from Sentinel-1 and multispectral image data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 are used. Statistical composite hypothesis technique is used for estimating pixel-based change detection. The well-established likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic is used for determining the pixel-wise change in a series of complex covariance matrices of multilooked polarimetric SAR data. In case of multispectral images, the approach used is to estimate a statistical model from series of multispectral image data over a long period of time, assuming there is no considerable change during that time period and then compare it with the multispectral image data obtained at a later time. The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is used to detect the target (changed pixel) from probabilistic estimated model of the corresponding background clutter (non-changed pixels). To minimize error due to co-registration, 8- neighborhood pixels around the pixel under test are also considered. There are different challenges in both the cases. SAR images have the advantage of being insensitive to atmospheric and light conditions, but it suffers the presence of speckle phenomenon. In case of multispectral, challenge is to get quite large number of datasets without cloud coverage in region of interest for multivariate distribution modelling. Due to imperfect modelling there will be high probability of false alarm. Co-registration is also an important criterion in multitemporal image analysis. © SPIE.

One of the important applications of image classification is in remote sensing, where it is used for land cover classification. In this paper we developed a SimpleCNN architecture for the classification of multi-spectral images from SAT-4 and SAT-6 airborne datasets. Two sets of experiments are conducted using the model by feeding it with different features. First level of experiment is done by providing the model with Near-Infrared (NIR) band information as it can sense vegetation health.

The method is commonly referred is unsupervised classification method to generate a Land cover class by reference to ground data and the satellite image. After superimposing in SAGA-GIS the image was categorized into five land-use land-cover types: water, wetland, forest, open land, built-up land. The reasons for the change were also analyzed. It was seen that significant changes in land-use land-cover occurred within the area over the study period. The comparison of LULC change pattern for the study area over a period of 45 years revealed that there was an increase of 72% in the built-up area while the open spaces, Forest, Wetland and water body had diminished by 83%, 25%, 48%, and 22%, respectively with reference to total catchment area, due to an uncontrolled increase in urbanization. To cater to the urbanization, industrialization and the enormous growth of population, most of the city was covered in concrete. The analysis of the data also revealed that there is a rise in peak discharge by 40% due to LULC change between the years 1973 and 2018. Overall, the total water logged area has witnessed a substantial increase over the years. The study demonstrates that the integration of remote sensing and GIS was an effective approach for analyzing the land-use land-cover change process. © IAEME Publication.","","LULC Change detection; Mumbai; Runoff; SAGA-GIS; Unsupervised classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058046238"

The images after fusion are provided with both the high-resolution feature of panchromatic images and the spectral characteristics of multi-spectral images, thereby strengthening the image information and facilitating its application. According to the characteristics of the aquaculture sea area in concern, five fusion algorithms, namely, Brovey Transform, Gram-Schmidt Transform, Principal Component Analysis, Pan Sharp, and Nearest Neighbor Diffusion PanSharpening were adopted to fuse the BJ-2 multi-spectral and panchromatic image data of the areas in the shallow sea raft culture, cage culture, and reclamation culture acquired in Zhangzhou coastal aquaculture sea area of the Fujian Province. Then the fusion images are evaluated subjectively and objectively to provide the best fusion scheme for monitoring aquaculture by remote sensing. The results showed that: (1) the five fusion algorithms are able to significantly improve both the spatial resolution and the utilization ratio of the BJ-2 satellite images; (2) the fusion effects of PSH method can provide the most optimum solution in terms of spectral retentivity and detail expression, and are the best in all the three fusion experiments on aquaculture sea information; (3) the acquired bright-color and high-contrast images make the fusion effects of NNDiffuse the best in terms of image contrast and information enhancement; (4) PSH algorithm is appropriate for use when BJ-2 is used for visual interpretation and thematic charting of shallow sea raft culture, cage culture and reclamation culture and other information; on the other hand, it is recommended to use NNDiffuse for automatic classification and identification. © 2019 IEEE.","Aquaculture; Classification (of information); Geology; Image enhancement; Quality control; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Automatic classification; BJ-2; Gram-Schmidt transform; Image fusion algorithms; Quality evaluation; Remote sensing technology; Sea areas; Spectral characteristics; Image fusion","Aquaculture sea area; BJ-2; Image fusion; Quality evaluation.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077685827"

In this work, machine learning models have been applied for crop classification of Sentinel-2 satellite temporal remote sensing image data. Guntur district region of Andhra Pradesh, India has been used as the study area. The main reasons for selecting this region are the diversity of agricultural crops and the availability of ground truth.

Classification accuracies are generally evaluated by using test data. In most cases the classification accuracy from test data is not commensurate to estimated crop areas from the classified image. Such methods limit the estimated crop areas acceptance for official purposes. The uniqueness of this work is the classification accuracy is evaluated by estimated crop areas.

Optical passive RS has been vastly explored for agricultural mapping and monitoring, in despite of cloud cover issue. This is observed even in the tropics, where frequency of clouds is very high. However, more studies are needed to better understand the high dynamism of tropical agriculture and its impact on the use of passive RS. In tropical countries, such as in Brazil, the use of current agricultural technologies, associated with favourable climate, allow the planting period to be wide and to have plants of varying phenological cycles. In this context, the main objective of the current study is to better understand the dynamics of a selected area in Southeast of São Paulo state, and its impact on the use of orbital passive RS. For that purpose, data (from field and satellite) from 55 agricultural fields, including annual, semi-perennial and perennial crops and silviculture, were acquired between July 2014 and December 2016. Field campaigns were conducted in a monthly base to gather information about the condition of the crops along their development (data available in a website).

Satellites are having their own technical property to its behavioral methods. Communication methodology and sensor techniques are very important to take earth imagery. Satellites take the images in various combinations of bands to produce the imagery with maximum details. The efficacy of the multispectral imagery is limitless. Multispectral imagery is having the details about a particular region using 11 band combinations. Grouping the pixels into the meaningful class is called as image classification. Satellite image classification is used to define the land surface segmentation and feature extraction. Weather forecasting, agriculture, air force department, and water department are the major departments which rely upon the satellite imagery. Remote sensing input for those real-time applications is endless. Satellite image classification falls with three categories as automatic, semi-automated, and hybrid methods. Medium resolution multi spectral imagery classification algorithms designed with Automatic and Manual classification method to reach the maximum accuracy. High and very high spectral imagery classification algorithms follow the hybrid- or object-based image analysis. Phonology index is designed to classify the multispectral satellite imagery based on the reflectance value of the passive sensor imagery. This paper provides a phenology-based method called shortwave infrared-based phenology index (SIPI) to classify the multispectral imagery with maximum accuracy. Confusion matrix and Kappa coefficient are the quality measures used to justify the classification efficiency. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Automation; Biology; Classification (of information); Image segmentation; Reflection; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Soft computing; Spectroscopy; Weather forecasting; Automated classification; Classification efficiency; Communication methodology; Multispectral classification; Multispectral satellite imagery; Object based image analysis; Phenology index; Satellite image classification; Image classification","Classification; Multispectral classification; Phenology index; Remote sensing; Semi-automated classification","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076848315"

The S2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) features two distinct arrays of 12 detectors mounted on each focal plane covering VNIR and SWIR channels respectively, in order to cover the whole instrument field of view. The configured operation of the 12 detectors introduces bidirectional reflectance effects on the S2 satellite images, which are more distinct over water bodies due to water inherent optical properties. In this study, three methods for the elimination of the bidirectional reflectance effects are evaluated: i) The c-factor approach along with the Ross-Li model, that simulates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for calculating the Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR), ii) an image-based method, which encompasses the acrosstrack reflectance variances, using for each column, the deviation between the column mean value and a polynomial trendline which is constructed to fit all the column mean values, and iii) a method which adjusts the reflectance values of each detector to those originated from the detector with the closest to nadir view zenith. Furthermore, the ACOLITE atmospheric correction software was evaluated in terms of reflectance variance elimination when S-2 images are processed. A mosaic of S2 images presenting the Ionian Sea, southwest of Greece has been used for the evaluation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NBAR methodology over ocean scenes proving that physical models adequately describe bidirectional causes and effects. The other two methods smooth variances between the detectors, however, they do not eliminate the BRDF effects. ACOLITE software did not achieve to reduce reflectance variances in S-2 images. © 2019 SPIE.

In this study, an unsupervised methodology based on OBIA paradigm for the estimation of multi-scale training sets for land cover classification is proposed. The proposed method consists of selection of valid region of interests in an unsupervised way and its characterization using some attributes in order to form meaningful and reliable training sets for supervised classification of different land covers of a satellite image. Multi-scale image segmentation is a prerequisite step for estimation of multi-scale training sets. However, scale selection remains a challenge in multi-scale segmentation. In this work, we propose a method to determine the appropriate segmentation scale for each land cover with the help of prior knowledge in the form of in-situ data. The proposed method is further discussed and validated through multi-scale segmentation using quick shift and random forest algorithms on two multi-spectral images captured using Worldview-2 sensor.

Despite these beneficial properties, RapidEye images with 5 m spatial resolution are not sufficiently useful for some applications. According to this problem, enhancing the spatial resolution of RapidEye images can significantly improve the results of the subsequent processes on these images. Fusion of high spatial resolution with high spectral resolution images is known as an effective way to enhance the quality of multispectral remotely sensed images. Unfortunately, the lack of panchromatic band with high spatial resolution has been faced the procedure of improving the spatial resolution of RapidEye images with major problems. In this paper, we have proposed using the free Google Earth (GE) images which have high spatial resolution and high-coverage of land surface to enhance the spatial information of RapidEye images. A simulated panchromatic image has been generated by three band GE image and with three different methods: Mean, principal component analysis (PCA) and weighted average of GE image bands. In the last method, the weights are extracted from the spectral response curve of the satellite which captured the GE image. The simulated panchromatic image has been utilized for pansharpening of RapidEye image in five well-known methods: Brovey, Gram-Schmidt (GS), intensity-hue-saturation (IHS), Pansharp1 and Pansharp2. The most important point is finding the GE image with lowest lag time with RapidEye image. By satisfying this condition, the experiments illuminated that the proposed method can effectively enhance the spatial quality of RapidEye image. Also, this study presented that Pansharp2 method, which used simulated panchromatic image generated by the spectral response curve information, has revealed the best results of RapidEye image pansharpening. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Image resolution; Principal component analysis; Spectral resolution; Spectroscopy; High spatial resolution; High spectral resolution images; Intensity hue saturations; Multi-spectral imagery; Panchromatic images; Remotely sensed images; Spatial enhancement; Spatial informations; image analysis; Internet; multispectral image; RapidEye; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; spatial resolution; Image enhancement","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060596083"

Complex surface textures mixed with strip noises in the high-resolution multi-spectral remote sensing of satellite are extremely difficult to remove, this paper analyzes the Markov random field prior model method, combines the Huber function to propose a universal, fast and effective Huber Markov destriping method. According to the statistical characteristics of the image gray level variation, the distribution features and mutual relationship between each pixel and its neighborhood pixels in the image, the co-occurrence matrix reflecting the contrast gray characteristics of the image is connected with the threshold T of Huber function, which is automatically iteratively determined during the noise removal process, and will be able to remove image noises as well as preserving its edges and details effectively. In order to solve the time complexity of the algorithm caused by the pixel space information introduced by the Huber Markov random field algorithm, the GPU adaptive partitioning technique is adopted to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results show that the destriping method based on Huber function Markov random field can remove the strip noise effectively, while preserving texture details of the image, which can be applied to a variety of noise-containing images. Meanwhile, GPUbased adaptive partitioning technology has been adopted, which has greatly improved the computational efficiency of processsing massive remote sensing images, and lays a foundation for the application of remote sensing satellite images in China. © SPIE.

However, certain context-dependent classes, such as urban areas, remain challenging to classify correctly with pixel-based methods. Including contextual information into the classification can either be done at the feature level with texture descriptors or object-based approaches, or in the classification model itself, as is done in Convolutional Neural Networks. This improves recognition rates of these classes, but sometimes deteriorates the fine-resolution geometry of the output map, particularly in sharp corners and in fine elements such as rivers and roads. However, the quality of the geometry is difficult to assess in the absence of dense training data, which is usually the case in land cover mapping, especially over wide areas. This work presents a framework for measuring the geometric precision of a classification map, in order to provide deeper insight into the consequences of the use of various contextual features, when dense validation data is not available. This quantitative metric, named the Pixel Based Corner Match (PBCM), is based on corner detection and corner matching between a pixel-based classification result, and a contextual classification result. The selected case study is the classification of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral image time series, with a rich nomenclature containing context-dependent classes. To demonstrate the added value of the proposed metric, three spatial support shapes (window, object, superpixel) are compared according to their ability to improve the classification performance on this challenging problem, while paying attention to the geometric precision of the result. The results show that superpixels are the best candidate for the local statistics features, as they modestly improve the classification accuracy, while preserving the geometric elements in the image. Furthermore, the density of edges in a sliding window provides a significant boost in accuracy, and maintains a high geometric precision. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification (of information); Edge detection; Geometry; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image segmentation; Neural networks; Spectroscopy; Superpixels; Textures; Time series; Classification performance; Contextual classification; Contextual feature; Convolutional neural network; Land cover mapping; Pixel based classifications; Satellite images; Superpixel segmentations; Mapping","Contextual features; Image processing; Image segmentation; Land cover mapping; Satellite image time series; Superpixel segmentation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071588830"

In fact, many reasons related to security respect, big data or limited bandwidth, the datasets cann't be centrally clustered by the FCM algorithm or its variants, so the collaborative clustering algorithms are efficiently used. The clustering algorithms have been applied to analyze the surface of the earth, specifically a variety of multispectral satellite image (MSI) classification. In this paper, a novel collaborative fuzzy clustering based framework is proposed, in particular, which is Multiple kernel Collaborative Fuzzy C-means Clustering with weighted super-pixel granulation technique (SMKCFCM algorithms) for satellite image classification. There are two phases consisting of (1) MSI are preprocessed by grouping of the similar pixels into super-pixels granules and then (2) the super-pixels granules are clustered using the collaborative fuzzy clustering with multiple kernels and the their weights. The granule's weight is determined based on its size. It means that amount of the considered objects reduces from a large amount of pixels to only a few hundred super-pixels. In the final step, the performance is improved by the collaborative clustering algorithm on multiple sites of image data. This method is combined with multiple kernels that implicitly convert the original feature space into a higher dimensional space via a non-linear map. This transformation leads to greatly increases the linear separability of the non-spherical and complex input patterns. Experiments were performed on the multi-spectral satellite image datasets and the validity indices were summarized with comparison between the SMKCFCM algorithm and some algorithms in the family of collaborative fuzzy clustering. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Data mining; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Granulation; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Large dataset; Linear transformations; Mathematical transformations; Pixels; Satellite imagery; Spectroscopy; Clustering-based framework; Collaborative clustering; Fuzzy C means clustering; Land cover classification; Multi-spectral imagery; Multiple kernels; Multispectral satellite image; Satellite image classification; Clustering algorithms","Collaborative fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy c-means clustering; Land-cover classification; Multiple kernels; Super-pixel based segmentation","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067225464"

To this aim, on April 2018, two airborne campaigns were carried out with the TASI-600 multispectral thermal sensor on the Petacciato (Molise, Italy) area. Simultaneously, soil samples were collected in different agricultural fields of the study area to determine their moisture content and the granulometric composition.

Prentice Hall, [2]). A significant obstacle of extracting information using satellite imagery is the presence of clouds. Removing these portions of image and then filling in the missing data is an important image-editing task. Traditionally, the objective is to cut the cloudy portions out from the frame and fill in the gaps with clear patches from similar images taken at different time. Remote sensing is providing opportunities in various branches of environmental research. The fields of application for multi-spectral remote sensing instruments in earth observation are monitoring the forests, oceans or urban areas over agricultural applications to the extent of natural resources. A significant prerequisite for analysis of earth observation data is the information that is free from external influences and disturbances. One possible cause of data loss is cloud cover of satellite imagery. Cloud cover is recognized as a significant loss of data and information quality by many scientific studies. The existence of cloud cover is the loss of meaningful data and information because they are a considerable source of uncertainty with regard to the application of any algorithm aiming for the retrieval of land surface (Zakaria, Ibrahim, Suandi in A review: image compensation techniques. pp. 404–408, [3], Sengee, Sengee, Choi in IEEE Trans Consum Electron 56(4):2727–2734, [4], Hardin, Jensen, Long, Remund in Testing two cloud removal algorithms for SSM/I [5]). © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","","Cloud detection; Cloud free image; Cloud removal; Colour conversion; Image reconstruction; Information extraction; Pixel-to-pixel correction; Reference image; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Thresholds","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078165087"

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides a library of algorithms and a powerful application programming interface (API) to produce flexible cloud-based applications that leverage Google's computing infrastructure for geospatial analysis. We introduce ”Spectral Point”, a new GUI tool developed in GEE that allows users to explore, process and extract multispectral data rapidly within a single browser window. The ability to access and measure spectral signals from surface deposits using the entire available Landsat and Sentinel 2 archive is of tremendous benefit to geomorphic research, removing the need to download and process terabytes worth of imagery. Spectral values from composite imagery collected in GEE that relate to changes in surface mineral composition agree with corresponding point values using conventional desktop Landsat processing. The ”Spectral Point” tool makes it fast and simple to extract quantitative, contrast-corrected brightness data from multispectral imagery compared conventional desktop-based approaches. At the same time, the user needs no experience developing code, proprietary third-party software or dedicated high-performance computing and only a modern web browser. The ”Spectral Point” tool has many potential applications in the remote study of Earth's surface; for example, we explore a case study from the western United States that demonstrates how the tool can be used for mapping, geochronology, and estimating weathering rates for Quaternary landforms. With increasing numbers of satellites, we are now faced with a growing deluge of geospatial data. Cloud-based solutions to mapping, field reconnaissance and image processing will be increasingly necessary to handle this valuable but untapped satellite image resource. ”Spectral Point” is an example of a new generation of web-based remote sensing tools available for Earth scientists, leveraging the revolution in cloud-based processing power and access to entire satellite image archives. © 2019","United States; Application programming interfaces (API); Cloud computing; Data handling; Data mining; Engines; Geochronology; Geomorphology; Landforms; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Web browsers; Cloud-based applications; Computing infrastructures; Geo-spatial analysis; Google earths; High performance computing; Multi-spectral data; Multi-spectral imagery; Western United States; geomorphology; GIS; image processing; Internet; Landsat; multispectral image; remote sensing; sampling; satellite imagery; Sentinel; software; Image processing","Cloud computing; Geomorphology; Google Earth Engine; Image processing; Multispectral data; Remote sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076860195"

It is well known that the applications of satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is not suitable for detection and monitoring of floods during rainy seasons with clouds in the sky due to non-penetrating capability of signals restricting its applications during clear sky condition. The other limitation of multi-spectral sensors in optical spectrum is its acquisition of satellite imageries during day time only. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is the preferred tool for flood detection and mapping from space due to continuous observation of earth surface from the polar orbit, where SAR sensors provides its own source of illumination and is characterised by near all-weather / day-night imaging capability independent of atmospheric conditions in the microwave spectrum. Open water surface areas during flooding period in rivers behave like flat water surface for radar bands in the microwave spectrum and act as specular reflector responsible for scattering of radar signals incident from spaceborne SAR sensors resulting into dark pixels in the radar image in contrast to non-flooding areas of the Earth surface. Change detection techniques using multi-temporal SAR images based on the behaviour of backscattered signals for threshold value for detecting the flood between nonflooding and flooding periods provide information related to the status of water surface of river systems. Recently, radar sensors have received interest in the development of spaceborne bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors due its potential to reduce the revisit (repeat orbit) time for monitoring the changes on the Earth surface depending upon the repeat orbit and SAR payloads on the satellites. Spaceborne SAR payloads can be placed in the orbit into fully active or semi-active configuration based on both transmit and receive capability of signals. In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi- static space-borne SAR sensors is described for the development of real time space-borne SAR surveillance system for monitoring of various characteristics of river basins and detection of floods using threshold / change detection techniques. Furthermore, the concept for the development of constellation of multi-static SAR satellite imaging receivers in LEO and geostationary radar illuminating system is described for real time detection and monitoring of floods. © 2019, Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence.","","Bi-static and multi-static SAR sensors; Detection and monitoring of floods; Radar backscattering coefficient; Rain drop size distribution (RDSD); Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072771355"

Generally, many image segmentation algorithms exploit specific spatial information between the pixel and its neighbors together with the color information to lengthen the cluster quality. Recently, a variety of clustering processes have been suggested to grasp data that is not linearly separable. The main issue in clustering algorithm is its inconsistency. To address this issue, the innovative spatial-spectral method for image segmentation and change detection based on Graph cut based clustering is proposed. In this hybrid approach, the Multispectral satellite images are preprocessed using Difference Of Offset Gaussian (DOOG) filters and then segmented by graph cut based clustering. Multi-class problems are highly expensive to solve, there is a need of a massive optimization problem. The changes between the classified images can be obtained by using image differencing method. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated with the temporal data sets of LANDSAT images.

The proposed technique is closer in approach to the other filtering-based pansharpening schemes existing in the literature. In the proposed method histogram equalized Pan image is transformed using the 2D-DFRFT and further used to generate the pansharpened image using appropriate pansharpening rule. The angle parameters associated with the 2D-DFRFT provide additional degrees of freedom which are optimized by single-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for finding better pansharpening results. Simulation results of the proposed technique carried out in MATLAB are presented for IKONOS and GeoEye-1 satellite images and compared with existing fusion methods in terms of both visual perception and objective metrics such as Q-index (Q4), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), relative dimensionless global error (ERGAS) and quality with-no reference (QNR). It is observed that the proposed pansharpening scheme provides improved spectral and spatial quality as compared with the existing schemes. The effects of aliasing and mis-registration errors on the proposed method are also investigated and compared with existing pansharpening methods. It is seen that the proposed method is robust against aliasing and mis-registration errors. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Errors; MATLAB; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Discrete fractional Fourier transforms; Objective metrics; Panchromatic (Pan) image; Pansharpened images; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Registration error; Spectral angle mappers; Visual perception; algorithm; data quality; Fourier transform; GeoEye; histogram; IKONOS; multispectral image; panchromatic image; remote sensing; satellite imagery; two-dimensional modeling; Image fusion","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062728488"

The present study investigates the effect of effluents released from an adjoining shrimp farm on the sustainability of a nearby mangrove woodland during operation and after closure of the farm. In addition, the consequences of dredging activities to fill coastal waters for land reclamation to develop a mega seaport at Jazan Economic City are explored. A band image-difference algorithm was applied to Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 08 Operational Land Imager satellite images obtained on different dates, which revealed a prominent vigour boom in the mangrove forest while the shrimp farm operated but a gradual decrease in vigour after its closure. During the investigation time frame of 2016 and 2017, spectral vegetation analysis of Sentinel-2A satellite images highlighted a strong negative correlation between dredging operations for seaport construction and the adjacent fragile mangrove forest. Dredging operations were responsible for a reduction of 19.30% in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, 27.5% in the Leaf Area Index, and 19.0% in the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. The results clearly show the potential application of spectral vegetation indices in the monitoring and analysis of anthropogenic impacts on coastal vegetation.

However, the classification and object extraction of radar image are very difficult because their imaging mechanism is quite different from that of multi spectral image. One of the largest limitations of radar automated classification is the occurrence of speckle noise. ALOS satellite obtained PALSAR radar data during floods by the emergency observation requests. The PALSAR data can easily detect the water surface because its wave length is L-band. Flood on 18th May 2010 at Attanagalu Oya basin in Gampaha District, Sri Lanka, shows the effectiveness and efficiency of this method. The results of the analysis were timely provided to the central and local governments to help them to make decision on the reduction of flood disasters. Remote sensing methods based on optical, medium resolution imagery, such as Landsat and SPOT, are limited in their applicability. This paper presents and compares a few techniques using remote sensing data which are used to flood mapping & eventually used to analyze flood propagation. Geometric correction and typical noise smoothing methods of the PALSAR data are used here and with the “not enough satisfaction” of speckle reduction, one more reduction method called wavelet thresholding was applied. The resulting images almost coincide with the reported flood regions. Fusion of satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolutions plays here an important role in visualizing information effectively. GIS relate technologies are very useful in flood monitoring and damage evaluation. In this study, GIS & Remote Sensing provide a better evaluation that useful for understanding overall situation & in an emergency rapid response to global disasters like flood is firmly established and flood monitoring has become an easy task with the advent of the said technology. © 2018 Proceedings - 39th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing: Remote Sensing Enabling Prosperity, ACRS 2018","Data flow analysis; Data reduction; Disasters; Feature extraction; Floods; Geographic information systems; Radar; Radar imaging; Space-based radar; Speckle; Spectroscopy; Synthetic aperture radar; ALOS PALSAR; Automated classification; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Geometric correction; Multispectral images; Special applications; Speckle reduction; Wavelet thresholding; Remote sensing","ALOS PALSAR; Radar; Remote Sensing; Speckle Reduction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071835852"

Due to a sharp rise of population and rapid economic development in coastal areas, the area of mangroves is declining globally in recent years. Remote sensing technology has a distinct advantage over traditional field survey, and has already been applied to the protection of mangrove ecosystem with spatial information. But previous studies, which used different data sources or methods of evaluation, haven't been systematically compared to each other. So they hardly prove that their results are reliable to practical project. We selected Dongzhai Harbor in Hainan Island as study area, satellite images from SPOT 5 (2.5 m resolution merged image and 10 m resolution multi-spectral image), Land-sat 8 (15 m resolution merged image) and GF-1 (16 m multi-spectral image) as data sources, and the maximum likelihood, support vector machine and object-oriented classification methods was applied to extract mangroves information in the study. The same training samples and testing samples were chosen to ensure comparability of different sources and methods. Considering that mangroves are always distributed in small clusters, F-measure was imported from data mining to describe imbalanced classification as evaluation indicator. The research results showed that mangroves bore typical spectral characteristics of plants, which made them clearly distinguished from non-vegetation objects such as water and bare land. But among other plants, mangroves could only be recognized in short infrared band. In the case of mangrove extraction, the results by maximum likelihood method and support vector machine had similar accuracies, and their results were in a strong correlation with information of characteristic bands of images. However, maximum likelihood method tended to find other plant clusters inside mangrove clusters and led to 'under-extraction', support vector machine usually mistaked other plants for mangroves and results in 'over-extraction', and F-measure of support vector machine was 1.6-3 percent higher than that of maximum likelihood method. Maximum likelihood method and support vector machine surpassed 80 percent extraction accuracy on 2.5 m resolution image from SPOT 5 and image from Landsat8, but failed to reach 80 percent extraction accuracy on multispectral image from SPOT 5 and image from GF-1. When using object-oriented classification method in meter-level spatial resolution images, a decrease in number of broken patches was found and the extraction accuracy was in positive correlation with spatial resolution of the images. On image from SPOT 5 and Landsat8, the extraction accuracy by objected-oriented classification method surpassed 85%. While image from GF-1 contained no helpful information to distinguish between mangroves and other plants, commission rate and omission rate were all very high.","China; Hainan; Rhizophoraceae; biodiversity; coastal zone; comparative study; economic development; image classification; image resolution; Landsat thematic mapper; mangrove; maximum likelihood analysis; remote sensing; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; SPOT-5; support vector machine","F-measure; Hainan Island; Mangrove; Maximum likelihood method; Multi-source remote sensing images; Object-oriented classification method; Support vector machine","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937418863"

The main goal of this study was to assess the crop mapping performance provided by the 100 m spatial resolution of PROBA-V compared to coarser resolution data (e.g., PROBA-V at 300 m) for a 2250 km2 test site in Bulgaria. The focus was on winter and summer crop mapping with three to five classes. For classification, single- and multi-date spectral data were used as well as NDVI time series. Our results demonstrate that crop identification using 100 m PROBA-V data performed significantly better in all experiments compared to the PROBA-V 300 m data. PROBA-V multispectral imagery, acquired in spring (March) was the most appropriate for winter crop identification, while satellite data acquired in summer (July) was superior for summer crop identification. The classification accuracy from PROBA-V 100 m compared to PROBA-V 300 m was improved by 5.8% to 14.8% depending on crop type. Stacked multi-date satellite images with three to four images gave overall classification accuracies of 74%-77% (PROBA-V 100 m data) and 66%-70% (PROBA-V 300 m data) with four classes (wheat, rapeseed, maize, and sunflower). This demonstrates that three to four image acquisitions, well distributed over the growing season, capture most of the spectral and temporal variability in our test site. Regarding the PROBA-V NDVI time series, useful results were only obtained if crops were grouped into two broader crop type classes (summer and winter crops). Mapping accuracies decreased significantly when mapping more classes. Again, a positive impact of the increased spatial resolution was noted. Together, the findings demonstrate the positive effect of the 100 m resolution PROBA-V data compared to the 300 m for crop mapping. This has important implications for future data provision and strengthens the arguments for a second generation of this mission originally designed solely as a ""gap-filler mission"". © 2015 by the authors.","Cluster analysis; Image acquisition; Image resolution; Mapping; Satellite imagery; Time series; Time series analysis; Classification accuracy; Crop identification; Environmental security; GSD; Implications for futures; Multi-spectral imagery; NDVI time series; Temporal variability; Crops","Cluster analysis; GSD; NDVI time series; PROBA-V; Single- and multi-date crop identification","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945942502"

It was launched from the International Space Station (ISS) and deployed into orbit last April 27, 2016. It is envisioned that a set of multi-spectral satellite images from DIWATA-1 will be collected and processed to monitor changes in vegetation and to oversee oceans' productivity in the Philippines. To meet these objectives, the images should be consistent enough to produce meaningful derivative products. The images taken by the sensor must be corrected to eliminate geometric and radiometric distortions and noises. Spectral extraterrestrial solar irradiance is attenuated while passing through the atmosphere by Rayleigh scattering, ozone, mixed gases, water vapor absorption and aerosol transmission. These conditions make it necessary to apply any correction to the atmosphere's effect. A spectral radiance model was applied to estimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance which can be predicted using the field data acquired through an airborne mission. The payload, a Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF) camera, was installed for an experimental airborne mission to acquire spectral images. The digital number in each pixel of the image was then converted to radiance by modelling the irradiance at the sensor and obtaining reflectance values of certain types of vegetation. The output provides an at-sensor radiance (airborne) accounting for the effects of the atmosphere and incoming solar irradiance. Initial results from the comparison of the irradiance data using the pyranometer and the model show a root mean square error (RMSE) of 90.67 W/m2/um in band 7 (0.64um) but also yields an RMSE of 980.66 W/m2/um in band 11 (0.75um) for the spectral irradiance, while an RMSE of 124.281 W/m2/um was computed for the broadband irradiance. For the normal operation of DIWATA-1, it is vital to include not only the atmospheric correction of the incoming solar irradiance at ground but the incoming radiance at the sensor (DIWATA-1) as well.","Extraterrestrial atmospheres; Liquid crystals; Mean square error; Reflection; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Space optics; Space stations; Spectroscopy; Vegetation; Water absorption; Water vapor; Atmospheric corrections; DIWATA-1; LCTF; Solar irradiances; TOA radiance; Orbits","Atmospheric correction; DIWATA-1; LCTF; Solar irradiance; TOA radiance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018375960"

Methodology: We used the methods of assessment of the state of vegetation on the burnt area, a complex of different vegetation indices and satellite image classification methods. The method of fire-sites decoding included the following main steps: selection of the image showing the area before and after a fire and calculation of vegetation indices. Findings: The efficient technology of automated estimation of the area affected by forest fires, using satellite imagery, has been suggested. The technique allows us to fulfill all the processing procedure by means of the web-service that provides current and reliable data about the fire effects. Using the developed method we analyzed the multispectral images with low spatial resolution from Terra and Aqua satellites (instrument MODIS) in order to identify areas and periods of active burning in the selected area (California). Then we processed the multispectral images with medium spatial resolution from Landsat 8 satellite (shooting device OLI) to define accurately the boundaries of the burnt areas and to calculate their size. The area of the forest burnt during the period from July 30 to August 12 in 2015 exceeds 41 477 ha. Originality: In contrast to the existing methods of determining the burned areas by means of satellite images and using the Differential Normalized Bum Index (dNBR), the proposed technology allows determining the areas burnt more accurately through independent determination of optimal binarization thresholds for each image. In addition it is possible to analyze the temporal changes in the affected forest areas for long periods of observation by using vector layers with attribute information. The essential advantage of the technique is the high degree of automation of the satellite images processing and the use of remote sensing data which are freely available on the Internet. Practical value: The developed technology allows creating a web service for regular space monitoring of the consequences of forest fires. The users of such a service may be state monitoring bodies, state and private insurance companies, energy and oil refining companies, municipal services, private companies, fanners, TV and radio companies and other mass media as well as population living close to the territories affected by forest fires. © Hnatushenko V.V., Hnatushenko Vik.V., Mozgovyi D.K., Vasiliev V.V.. 2016.","Automation; Deforestation; Fire hazards; Image resolution; Insurance; Oil well fires; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refining; Public utilities; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Space optics; Vegetation; Web services; Websites; Binarization threshold; Forest fires; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral satellite image; Private insurance company; Satellite image classification; Satellite monitoring; Spectral indices; Image processing","Forest fires; Image processing; Multispectral imagery; NBR; Remote sensing; Satellite monitoring; Spectral indexes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974727247"

Reflectance values of cirrus band are used for correcting red and near infra-red spectral channels based on standard cirrus correction algorithm. The NDVI values obtained after cirrus correction is found to be significantly more than that of NDVI values without cirrus correction. In the case of AFRI(2.1m), the difference in values between before and after cirrus correction is found to be considerably lower than that of NDVI variation. These outcomes show the suitability of AFRI(2.1m) over NDVI for cirrus affected satellite images.

The results are comparable to those of the traditional method (cross section method) and the method of building 3D profile from the field measurements with additional merits of the present approach that it is more flexible and cost-effective tool for bathymetry mapping. Moreover, the results indicated that the computed amount of sediment using the estimated depths from the RS data (the present approach) overestimated the results by 4.16% compared to those computed using the cross-section method adopted by AHDA.

The Lushan shock triggered a large number of landslides with various types, including highly disrupted shallow slides and rock falls, deep-seated landslides and large-scale rock avalanches. Post-earthquake high resolution aerial photographs and satellite images, as well as a series of pre-earthquake high resolution satellite images were collected to construct a detailed, accurate, objective, and complete coseismic landslide database/inventory, which was validated by field investigation in selected areas. Based on the aerial photographs (0.2 or 0.6m resolution) that partly cover the affected area and pre-earthquake satellite images, 14,580 coseismic landslides were recognized and mapped. In those areas without post-earthquake aerial photographs coverage, we mapped 7,948 more coseismic landslides based on post-earthquake satellite images (Rapideye images with 5m resolution and ZY-3 images including panchromatic images with 2.1m resolution and multi-spectral images with 5.8m resolution) and pre-earthquake satellite images. The 22,528 coseismic landslides, with a horizontal projection area of 18.88km2 and an estimated total volume of 41.56×106m3, were distributed in a nearly elliptic area of about 5,400km2. Correlations between coseismic landslide abundances and topographic, geologic, and seismic factors were analyzed on 15,546 landslides of area 100m2. Scatter plots between regional slope angle and landslide abundances in generalized homogeneous lithology combinations show no obvious relationship is present between them, which challenges the conclusions of previous studies. Combining the Lushan earthquake-triggered landslides with other events on reverse and/or thrust faults such as the 1999 Chi-Chi and 2008 Wenchuan shocks, we found that coseismic landslides tend to occur in areas enveloped by two or more imbricated reverse and/or thrust faults, rather than only along the seismogenic fault. The Lushan event shows a higher ability of triggering landslides compared with other earthquakes of similar magnitudes, which is likely due to the steep and rugged topography and fractured and densely jointed lithology resulted from long-term tectonic activity. The blind reverse seismogenic fault is likely also another significant factor. Based on detailed coseismic landslide inventory maps and databases of several recent major earthquakes such as the 2008 Wenchuan, 2010 Haiti, 2010 Yushu, and 2013 Lushan temblors, we suggest that the empirical correlations between earthquake magnitude and coseismic landslides need to be updated. © 2015 The Authors.","China; Lushan [Sichuan]; Sichuan; database; inventory; landslide; Lushan earthquake 2013; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; trigger mechanism","2013 Lushan earthquake; Landslide database; Landslide inventory; Satellite images; Spatial analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84938700127"

Due to the optical property of water, the decrease of intensity of each band is related to the increase of depth. This phenomenon can then be used for water depth estimation. Both regression and physical based models were established and documented in literature. In recent years, a number of new generation satellites carried sensors with more multispectral bands then before. Among these new bands, the Coastal band of Landsat 8 and A/C band of WorldView-2 are typical examples of those designed for potential applications in coastal water region. These bands could enhance the capability for retrieving water depth of satellite images. In this study, two scenes of WorldView-2 satellite images covered Dongsha atoll are applied for retrieving water depth based on the ratio transformation. Both blue/green and coastal/yellow ratio sets are investigated. Within the atoll, water depth ranges from zero to approximately 20 m.

Standard image display software typically provides satisfactory visualization of the ground through automated or user-driven scaling to enhance contrast; however, it does not perform well with these highly polluted scenes, where the haze is spatially non-uniform. Furthermore, estimation of surface reflectance using standard atmospheric correction software is highly problematic under these conditions due to very low visible transmission of the haze coupled with lack of knowledge of its optical properties, which may not conform to the haze or aerosol models in the software. In this paper we show that a version of the empirical Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC) algorithm, adapted for spatially dependent scattering, produces visually satisfying imagery of the entire ground in multispectral satellite scenes containing thick haze, and that the output reflectance spectra appear to be realistic enough for performing basic surface classification. The QUAC algorithm is applicable to multispectral and hyperspectral imagery with any number of wavelength bands, including true color (RGB) imagery, and does not require radiometrically calibrated data. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

This challenge is addressed by using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) along with Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF). It is shown that illumination variation gives some incorrect matches with SURF only which degrades image registration. Incorrect matches are reduced by using HOG as descriptor in SURF.

In many cases, existing approaches concentrate on single-time and multi- or hyper-spectral reflectance measurements observed by spaceborne and airborne sensors. However, land-cover classes, such as crops, change their reflective characteristics over time, thus complicating a classification at one particular observation time. Opposed to that, these characteristics change in a systematic and predictive manner, which should be utilized in a multi-temporal approach. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal characteristics from a sequence of SENTINEL 2A observations. We compared the performance of LSTM networks with other architectures and a support vector machine (SVM) baseline and show the effectiveness of dynamic temporal feature extraction. For our experiments, a large study area together with rich ground truth annotations provided by public authorities was used for training and evaluation.

In this work, three vulnerable ecosystems, including shrublands, coastal areas with dunes systems and areas of shallow water, are studied. As far as these resources’ reduction is concerned, remote sensing and image processing techniques could contribute to the management of these natural resources in a practical and cost-effective way, although some improvements are needed for obtaining a higher quality of the information available. An important quality improvement is the fusion at the pixel level. Hence, the objective of this work is to assess which pansharpening technique provides the best fused image for the different types of ecosystems. After a preliminary evaluation of twelve classic and novel fusion algorithms, a total of four pansharpening algorithms was analyzed using six quality indices. The quality assessment was implemented not only for the whole set of multispectral bands, but also for the subset of spectral bands covered by the wavelength range of the panchromatic image and outside of it. A better quality result is observed in the fused image using only the bands covered by the panchromatic band range. It is important to highlight the use of these techniques not only in land and urban areas, but a novel analysis in areas of shallow water ecosystems. Although the algorithms do not show a high difference in land and coastal areas, coastal ecosystems require simpler algorithms, such as fast intensity hue saturation, whereas more heterogeneous ecosystems need advanced algorithms, as weighted wavelet ‘à trous’ through fractal dimension maps for shrublands and mixed ecosystems. Moreover, quality map analysis was carried out in order to study the fusion result in each band at the local level. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of these pansharpening techniques, advanced Object-Based (OBIA) support vector machine classification was applied, and a thematic map for the shrubland ecosystem was obtained, which corroborates wavelet ‘à trous’ through fractal dimension maps as the best fusion algorithm for this ecosystem. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Classification (of information); Climate change; Coastal zones; Cost effectiveness; Fractal dimension; Hydrogeology; Image enhancement; Information management; Maps; Natural resources management; Quality control; Remote sensing; Ecosystem management; High resolution multi-spectral imagery; High resolution satellite images; Image processing technique; Intensity hue saturations; Pan-sharpening; Support vector machine classification; Worldview-2; Ecosystems","Classification; Ecosystem management; High resolution satellite images; Pansharpening; WorldView-2","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011016525"

The remote sensing satellite images of multi-spectral sensors in the optical spectrum are affected by weather conditions due to clouds and rains as well as climatic conditions, restricting its application during clear sky conditions apart from limiting its image acquisition during the day time only. The development in the space borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology and imaging techniques to reduce the repeat pass period using multi-SAR systems in orbits makes its suitable for real time monitoring and mapping of earth surface for the flood and water resource management due inherent cloud and rain penetrating capability as well as backscattering properties of radar signals in different frequency band. The recent development of space-borne SAR systems in bi-static and multi-static configuration by different space agencies ensures the availability of multi-sensor SAR in different microwave radar bands for the development of space-based flood disaster management system. The inherent characteristics to generate high contrast in SAR image between surfaces such as soil and water is due to very low backscattering coefficient of radar signals from water bodies acting as a mirror reflecting surface and earth surface gives higher backscattering coefficient due to surface roughness consisting of soil characteristics and vegetation, which increases the radar reflectivity of the surface. Major rivers in India like Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra are snow-fed as well as monsoon rainfall dependent, while the other river basins are purely rainfall dependent. A large variability in the characteristics of rainfall has been observed over the basin in different seasons and months. The southwest (SW) monsoon, which brings about 80% of the total precipitation over the country, is critical for the availability of freshwater for drinking and irrigation. Flooding in rivers are caused due to excessive rainfall and discharge of water in the river basins leading to the overflow of the water submerging the landmass depending upon its terrain profile, river bed characteristics, raindrop size distribution and rainfall characteristics. In this paper, the concept of the bi-static and multi-static space-borne SAR sensors has been described for development of real time space-borne surveillance system for Indian Sub-continent as Disaster Management System (DMS), which can be used for flood detection and flood disaster management.

Characterization of this variation is essential for understanding and modeling the functioning of the arctic tundra in global carbon cycling, as well as for evaluating the resolution requirements for remote sensing. Our objective was to quantify the seasonal development of the leaf-Area index (LAI) and its variation among plant communities in the arctic tundra near Tiksi, coastal Siberia, consisting of graminoid, dwarf shrub, moss, and lichen vegetation. We measured the LAI in the field and used two very-high-spatial resolution multispectral satellite images (QuickBird and WorldView-2), acquired at different phenological stages, to predict landscape-scale patterns. We used the empirical relationships between the plant community-specific LAI and degree-day accumulation (0 °C threshold) and quantified the relationship between the LAI and satellite NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Due to the temporal difference between the field data and satellite images, the LAI was approximated for the imagery dates, using the empirical model. LAI explained variation in the NDVI values well (R 2 adj. 0.42-0.92). Of the plant functional types, the graminoid LAI showed the largest seasonal amplitudes and was the main cause of the varying spatial patterns of the NDVI and the related LAI between the two images. Our results illustrate how the short growing season, rapid development of the LAI, yearly climatic variation, and timing of the satellite data should be accounted for in matching imagery and field verification data in the Arctic region. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia; Tiksi; Bryophyta; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Landforms; Plants (botany); Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; Arctic; Biogeochemical property; Empirical relationships; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite image; Normalized difference vegetation index; Very high spatial resolutions; VHSR; arctic environment; carbon cycle; ground-based measurement; growing season; leaf area index; NDVI; phenology; plant community; QuickBird; remote sensing; satellite imagery; seasonal variation; spatial variation; spectral analysis; spectral resolution; tundra; vegetation dynamics; WorldView; Satellite imagery","Arctic; LAI; Multispectral; Vegetation; VHSR","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030764299"

As a consequence, the frequency of obtaining new images can be increased and short-Term changes can be studied more effectively. In this paper, an algorithm is designed that is able to automatically detect clouds and shadows in medium-resolution optical multispectral images. The developed system is a frame-based image processing technique utilizing multiple spectral bands for feeding a cloud and shadow detector, where possible cloud contamination is recursively removed from the input images. The cloud detector utilizes Brightness Temperature Differences in the spectral regions of Far IR (FIR) and Thermal IR (TIR). After careful considerations, the reflective band FIR was adopted for usage in this Difference Image. The shadow detector uses Background Subtraction, which iteratively constructs its Reference Image automatically. This iterative nature is exploited to utilize timesequential characteristics among the input images. After experiments, 94.6% of the clouds are detected, with a precision of 86.5%, as determined using per-pixel ground-Truth data. For shadows, these statistics are 77.1% and 75.8%, respectively and may be further improved in future work.

Nowadays, different image matching approaches such as global matching and semi-global matching has been developed to obtain dense point clouds from multi-view images. The image-derived and lidar-derived dense point clouds are the two competitive products. Although LiDAR may provide reliable points, the multi-view image matching is more cost effective than lidar. The conventional semi-global matching (SGM) is mainly applied for center perspective frame images. SGM is rarely applied for linear pushbroom satellite stereo images. Besides, the spectral image is usually converted to intensity blind image in image matching. The spectral information might be a useful information in image matching for complex scene. This study develops a SGM for WorldView-3 high resolution satellite images. The research compares two different high density matching strategies: (1) RFM-based SGM for panchromatic stereo image, and (2) RFM-based SGM for multi-spectral stereo images. The RFM-based SGM utilizes quasi-epipolar images from rational function in matching cost computation. The RFM-based SGM compares the results using different spectral bands. The experiment images contain panchromatic and 8 band multi-spectral stereo images from WorldView-3 satellite. The experimental results indicated that the NIR band generated more reliable points than panchromatic in vegetated area. The selection of multispectral information for dense matching may improve the point density for different land covers.","Cost effectiveness; Image matching; Optical radar; Rational functions; Remote sensing; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Dense matching; Digital surface models; High resolution satellite images; Multispectral images; Semi-global matching; Spectral information; Stereo; Worldview-3; Stereo image processing","Dense matching; Multispectral image; Stereo; Worldview-3","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964026625"

In present work, a revised geological map of Mahakoshal Fold Belt (MFB) bounded by Son-Narmada north fault (SNNF) and Son-Narmada south fault (SNSF) along Chorhut-Sidhi-Chitrangi sector falling in Sidhi, Rewa and Shahdol districts of Madhya Pradesh has been prepared based on interpretation of digitally enhanced satellite images. The satellite image interpretation is supported by limited field works, radioelemental measurements (eU, eTh and % K) of in-situ rocks by four channel Portable Gamma Ray Spectrometer (PGRS) and existing published geological maps of Geological Survey of India. In search for mineral potential areas, accurate and up-to-date geological maps are essential as it represent the most basic information for carrying out further exploration activities. However, available geological maps of MFB and sedimentary formations ofVindhayan Supergroup along SNNF and Chhotanagpur Granite Gneissic Complex (CGGC) and Gondwana Supergroup along SNSF available in public domain are discontinuous and multi-scaled. Optical bands of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) PAN of the study area were used in mapping lithological units, structural features and small intrusive bodies. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Image Fusion, Linear Contrast Stretch, Histogram Equalisation and False Color Composite (FCC) of various band combination and ratio maps were performed in the digital image processing of geo-rectified satellite imageries. In analyzing and interpreting high resolution multi-spectral images, certain standard norms were employed to acquire information about litho-structural features such as topographic, geomorphic and tectonic facets. The main criteria are colour and tones, geomorphology, drainage patterns and vegetation anomalies. The processed Landsat ETM+ images were interpreted and classified to delineate detailed lithological units and structural features in order to update existing geological maps. To validate the prepared litho-structural map, ground survey was carried out along critical geological sections for checking the geological features like rocks, folds, faults, fractures and foliations. While comparing with the ground geological data to that obtained from the satellite imagery, it is observed that remote sensing interpreted litho-structural map is in a class with the ground observations. Various data sets such as unconformable geological contacts, fault breccias zone, lineaments and gamma ray spectrometric data (eU, eTh and % K) based on PGRS study were integrated and modelled using Geographical Information System (GIS) for identifying important prospective horizons for uranium mineralisation in the MFB of Son valley area. It is concluded that the revised large scale geological map is of practical use for not only for mapping of litho-structural architecture, but also in identifying potential areas for ‘vein–type’ uranium mineralisation along the structurally deformed zones of the SNNF, Asmi-Jiawan fault (AJF) and SNSF; and ‘unconformity- type’ of uranium mineralisation in the outliers of Jungel Group.

Based on this, an effective method of multi-spectral data processing is developed to obtain relevant information for calculating the cloud base height and the cloud top height, including ground temperature, cloud top temperature and cloud shadow. A lapse rate model is proposed to formulate cloud shape as an implicit function of temperature lapse rate and cloud base temperature.

Artificial neural networks are trained by hydrological cycle and are shown to be useful in estimating the physico-chemical parameters of water from reflectance of visible and NIR bands of satellite images, with better results for the period with little rain and few clouds in the analyzed region. © 2018 Electromagnetics Academy.

Yet, only about 35% of the total arable land is used properly. Most of the farmers that depend from subsistence-agriculture, nearly 80%, live under poverty conditions and are affected by malnutrition. Information about their crop's health would be valuable to considerably increase yields, reduce the use of fertilizer and reduce losses by early detecting diseases. Satellite images and unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are often used in conjunction with multi-spectral cameras to provide the spectral response of a specific crop, this response can be analyzed through vegetation indexes like the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which provides information about crops' health. The problem is that commercial NDVI solutions are extremely expensive for Guatemalan farmers, which restricts them from the benefits of the technology. In this paper, we describe the prototype development of a low-cost autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for crop analysis via NDVI. To reduce costs, a modified webcam was used for NDVI calculation. Off-the-shelf components were used to facilitate replication by other parties and a quadcopter topology was chosen given the irregularities of Guatemala's geography, Test flights were performed in sugar cane fields to evaluate the platform's autonomy and the NDVI calculation. The integration between subsystems and reliability of the NDVI results are discussed. © 2016 IEEE.","Agriculture; Costs; Crops; Sugar cane; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vegetation; Vehicles; Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles; Emerging economies; Multi-spectral cameras; Normalized difference vegetation index; Off-the-shelf components; Prototype development; Subsistence agriculture; Unmanned autonomous vehicles; Cost benefit analysis","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015198559"

To explore the potential of high-resolution satellite data in estimating forest vegetation diversity, we extracted the spatial pattern of Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) canopies, and estimated the arbor species diversity, supported by field large plot data in Jiaohe, Jilin Province. First, we extracted the Korean pine canopy distribution based on a GeoEye-1 winter image, which agreed well with individual tree position measured in situ. Then, we analyzed the spatial population distribution ofKorean pine using landscape ecology and geostatistics index, which was found to have a maximum autocorrelation scale of 30-40 m. Finally, we used a RapidEye satellite image with a special red edge band in autumn to establish multiple linear regression model with plot diversity data. The model linkedremote sensing image spectral values (5 m) and texture parameters (30 m window size) with species diversity. Results showed that red edge information did not significantly improve the ability of multi-spectral data in estimating vegetation biodiversity, but regional mapping results matched well with the stand age class. ©, 2015, Beijing Forestry University.

The Sentinel-2 mission is the constellation of two polar orbiting satellites Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, each one equipped with an optical imaging sensor MSI (Multi-Spectral Instrument). Sentinel-2A was launched on June 23rd, 2015 and Sentinel-2B followed on March 7th, 2017. With the beginning of the operational phase the constellation of both satellites enable image acquisition over the same area every 5 days or less. To use unique potential of the Sentinel-2 data for land applications and ensure the highest quality of scientific exploitation, accurate correction of satellite images for atmospheric effects is required. Therefore the atmospheric correction processor Sen2Cor was developed by Telespazio VEGA Deutschland GmbH on behalf of ESA. Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor which main purpose is to correct single-date Sentinel-2 Level-1C Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance product. Additional outputs are an Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) map, a Water Vapour (WV) map and a Scene Classification (SCL) map with Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Telespazio France and DLR have teamed up in order to provide the calibration and validation of the Sen2Cor processor. Here we provide an overview over the Sentinel-2 data, processor and products.

The different land types, man-made materials in natural backgrounds and vegetation cultures can be distinguished by their reflectance. Although remote sensing technology has great potential for acquisition of detailed and accurate information of landscape regions, the determination of land-use data with high accuracy is generally limited by the availability of adequate remote sensing data, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and digital image analysis techniques. Therefore, remote sensing with multi-spectral or/and hyper-spectral data derived from various satellites in combination with topographic variables is a valuable tool in landscape type classification. The different methods based on reflectance data from multi-spectral Landsat satellite image sets are used for automatic landscape type recognition. In order to characterize reflectance of landscape types represented in an image, construction of a multi-spectral descriptor, as a vector of acquired reflectance values by wavelength bands, is proposed. The applied algorithms for landscape type classification (artificial neural network, support vector machines and logistic regression) have been analysed and results are compared and discussed in terms of accuracy and time of execution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is influenced by many factors like optical distortion, sensor attitude change, satellite platform movement, curvature change of the earth, terrain fluctuation, and so on, which cause geometric distortion such as excursion, extension, and shrink compared with location of real ground objects, and the extent of distortion turns severe with the increase of distance between pixel and sub-satellite point. Therefore in practical application, correcting geometric distortion caused by terrain fluctuation or satellite platform, becomes one of the basic works. We analyzed data organizing mode and metadata structure of GF-1 satellite image data, and on that basis RPC (rational polynomial coefficient) model-based forward and inverse transformation was combined with the DEM (digital elevation model) data extraction; the process of RPC model-based images orthorectification was elaborately calculated; automatic orthorectification system (GF1AMORS) were designed and implemented, which could fit 2, 8 and 16 m resolution images. There are the critical questions: 1) Method for DEM data rapid extraction; 2) Strategy for image blocking. Firstly, DEM data were reorganized and coded based on 0.5°×0.5° geographic grid system in order that DEM data could be read to system memory rapidly according to coordinate range of image being rectified, and relevant test showed that our grid-based DEM data dynamical extraction method could achieve good efficiency with different image range, while the system memory might overflow when the image range turned larger than 3.5°×3.5°. Secondly, comparative experiments were done to study the relation between image block size and orthographic correction efficiency of GF-1 WFV (wide field of view, 16 m resolution) multi-spectral images. Experiments showed that the computational efficiency of single image converged to 98 s when the block size was set as from 384×384 to 480×480. To test the conversion accuracy of our automatic orthorectification process, 20 GF-1 PMS (Pansharpen/Multispectral Sensor, 8 m resolution) multi-spectral images that covered area with different terrain features (mountainous and plain terrain) in Heilongjiang Province with less cloud were extracted, and on that basis 400 control points were selected and compared to their homonymy points selected in Google Earth (by ENVI ""SPEAR Google Earth Bridge"") to analyze error and convergence. The experiment showed that our automatic orthorectification process exhibited a nice accuracy and stability in both mountainous terrain and plain terrain: For mountainous terrain, the maximum error in X orientation was less than 16.863 m and in Y orientation was less than 16.811 m, and the standard deviation in X orientation was less than 5.514 m while that in Y orientation was between 2.872 and 4.336 m; for plain terrain, the maximum error in X orientation was less than 10.959 m and in Y orientation was less than 13.546 m, and the standard deviation in X orientation was less than 3.051 m while that in Y orientation was less than 3.761 m. The maximum distance error was 23 m, and the distance error of 92.25% control points was less than 16 m (namely 2 pixels), and that of 38.75% control points was less than 8 m (namely 1 pixel). At last, we presented the limitation and our future work about our automatic orthorectification method. Considering that there is no physical significance for each parameter of RPC model, the calibration precision of our system needs to be improved (e.g. by integrating control points to weaken the system error) before it is used in some applications with higher accuracy requirement; furthermore, there is still a large optimization space of computational efficiency for our system, and high performance computing method (e.g. graphics processing unit) will be integrated based on data block feature to improve the calculating speed. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Low spatial resolution satellite images consist a lot of mixed pixels which degrade the detection and recognition performance in civil and military applications. In this paper, a satellite image resolution enhancement using Dyadic-Integer coefficients based bi-orthogonal wavelet filters is proposed. Dyadic-integer-coefficient based wavelet filters are derived from the construction of a half-band polynomial. The splitting approach is used to develop the integer-coefficient based half-band polynomial. The possibility of these dyadic-integer coefficients based wavelet filters is explored in the field of image enhancement using sub-pixel image registration. The two-resolution frames are registered at a specific shift from one another to restore the resolution lost by the sensors. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) obtained from the designed coefficients is applied on these two low-resolution images to obtain the high resolution image.

In order to perceive this complete information and to extract better features from the image, various image enhancement techniques have been developed. In multi-spectral satellite imagery, the images captured by the payload comprise of wide range of wavelengths, known as bands. This paper proposes a unique 'Adaptive Band Specific Image Enhancement Scheme based on Segmented Satellite Images' which operates on all the bands that are defined for satellite imagery. They cover a wide range of applications ranging from search & rescue images, environmental & landscape studying to hyper-spectral cosmic imagery etc. The proposed image enhancement technique facilitates better observation of satellite images by selecting and enhancing the particular region of image.

One important application of satellite data is the mapping of land cover and land use changes such as urbanization, deforestation, and desertification. This information should be obtained automatically, with high accuracy, and at the pixel level, which implies the need to classify millions of pixels even when only small regions are studied. Balancing runtime and accuracy for this task becomes even more challenging with the recent availability of multiple time points per pixel, created by periodically performed satellite scans. In this paper we describe a novel approach to classify land cover from series of multi-spectral satellite images based on multivariate time series analytics. The main advantage of our method is that it inherently models the periodic changes (seasons, agriculture etc.) underlying many types of land covers and that it is comparably robust to noise. Compared to a classical feature-based classifier, our new method shows a slightly superior overall accuracy, with an increase of up to 20% in accuracy for rare land cover classes, though at the cost of notably increased runtime. The highest accuracy is achieved by combining both approaches. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Deforestation; Image classification; Land use; Pixels; Satellites; Spectroscopy; Time series; Multi-spectral image data; Multispectral satellite image; Multivariate time series; Overall accuracies; Periodic changes; Satellite images; Spatial resolution; Temporal density; Classification (of information)","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045415272"

The advantage of unsupervised approach over the supervised one is that the generation of an appropriated ground truth is not required. Especially, when the ground truth is not available, the unsupervised approach is the fundamental one. The unsupervised change detection method used in this paper is based on the concept of kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The advantage of using kernel PCA over standard PCA is that it can handle non-linear relationships between data by projecting the data into higher dimension using kernel function. Assuming that relationship between data point after projecting data into higher dimensional space is linear, the principal basis vectors can then be extracted. A pixel is classified as unchanged if the absolute value of its second principal component is larger than a threshold. To improve the performance of kernel PCA, the ensemble approach is applied i.e., bootstrapped aggregating, which is also known as the bagging. The concept of bagging is to combine the change detection results from weak change detectors to improve overall performance. The proposed method begins with generating bootstrap samples. That is, the image pixels are random sampled with replacement. Each bootstrap sample is then used to construct a change detector using kernel PCA; a set of change detector is hence obtained. As a result, to classify a pixel as change or un-change, the change detection results from those change detectors are then fused by majority voting. By using random samples instead of using all image pixels at once for detecting change, the computation time is reduced. In other words, a large amount of computational resource is not required. To evaluated, the performance of the proposed methods, it was tested with multispectral satellite images i.e., Landsat 8. The experimental results will be illustrated as a change map. The analysis on principal basis vector extracted from the data using kernel PCA will be performed.","Pixels; Remote sensing; Signal detection; Space optics; Statistical methods; Vector spaces; Bagging; Change detection; Ensemble; Kernel PCA; Unsupervised; Principal component analysis","Bagging; Change detection; Ensemble; Kernel PCA; Unsupervised","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964066815"

These new sets offer improved specification to collect imagery on-demand over specific locations and for specific purposes. The Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite (KOMPSAT) series of satellites is a multi-purposed satellite system developed by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI). The recent satellite of the KOMPSAT series, KOMPSAT-3A, demonstrates high resolution multi-spectral imagery with infrared and high resolution electro-optical bands for geographical information systems applications in environmental, agricultural and oceanographic sciences as well as natural disasters. In this study, land cover classification of multispectral data was performed using four supervised classification methods: Mahalanobis Distance (MahD), Minimum Distance (MinD), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using a KOMPSAT-3A multi-spectral imagery with 2.2 m spatial resolution. The study area for this study was selected from southwestern region of South Korea, around Buan city. The training data for supervised classification was carefully selected by visual interpretation of KOMPSAT-3A imagery and field investigation. After classification, the results were then analyzed for the validation of classification accuracy by comparison with those of field investigation. For the validation, we calculated the User's Accuracy (UA), Producer's Accuracy (PA), Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa statistics from the error matrix to check the classification accuracy for each class obtained individually from different methods.

This paper proposes an intelligent extraction method for farmland irrigation and drainage system based on domestic high resolution satellite GF-2 images, which has considered both spectral features and geometry features of farmland irrigation and drainage system, and could be divided into four parts as: image scale converting, spectral model for canal identification, data extraction by spatial features and breakpoint connecting with morphology. The first step is to fuse the 1 meter panchromatic image and 4 meter multi-spectral image by Nearest Neighbor Diffusion pan sharpening algorithm that will output a high resolution multi-spectral image in 1meter. Then, construct a model of spectral relationship by red, green, blue and NIR (Near Infrared Reflection) bands, which will extract irrigation canals initially from images. Then, in order to distinguish roads with irrigation canals, we need to analyze the spatial features of them and design spatial rules to separate these two targets. The last problem is that there would be many disconnected irrigation channels as limited by the resolution of remote sensing images, the mathematical morphology method would be used for judging the topological relationships between breakpoints, which will be connected by dilation operators. This paper chose the Sanhulianjiang reservoir irrigation area to be experimental area, which is located in Hubei's Jiayu County. The main irrigation and drainage facilities in experimental area have been extracted through our method, and are contrasted to the water resource survey data.

One reason this ability has not yet been realized is that producing UAV based radiometrically calibrated images for the purpose of ensuring data reliability is difficult at the large scale. This paper presents an investigation of field-based image-mosaic calibration procedures using a commercial off-the-shelf fixed-wing small UAV and a five-band multispectral sensor. To determine the quality of the radiometric calibration procedure for UAV image mosaics, images were also collected with an identical camera on a manned aircraft, and ground based radiometric calibration tarps were used to produce high-quality calibrated field images. Satellite images were also collected on the same day as the aircraft images in a two-hour flight window centered on solar noon. The manned aircraft and satellite images were large enough for a single image to cover the entire field. The multispectral camera used enables two kinds of exposure settings; auto exposure allows the camera to automatically select exposure and gain settings for each image in a flight, and manual exposure allows the user to select settings preflight which are used for all the images in that flight. In this work we compare the radiometrically calibrated UAV images, collected with both auto-exposure and manual-exposure methods, to the radiometrically calibrated single-frame image generated with the manned aircraft, as well as to a satellite image. © 2018 SPIE.","Agriculture; Antennas; Calibration; Cameras; Fixed wings; Radiometry; Satellites; Auto exposure; Commercial off the shelves; manual exposure; mosaic; Multi-spectral cameras; Multispectral sensors; Radiometric calibrations; UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle); Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)","auto exposure; manual exposure; mosaic; radiometric calibration; UAV","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051217411"

Though there are different types of satellite images (e.g. optical, radar) these have not been combined for risk assessments. The characteristics of different remote sensing data type may be extremely valuable for monitoring and evaluating the impacts of disaster events, to extract additional information thus making it available for emergency situations. To base this approach, two different change detection methods, for two different sensor's data were used: Coherence Change Detection (CCD) for SAR data and Covariance Equalization (CE) for multispectral imagery. The CCD provides an identification of the stability of an area, and shows where changes have occurred. CCD shows subtle changes with an accuracy of several millimetres to centimetres. The CE method overcomes the atmospheric effects differences between two multispectral images, taken at different times. Therefore, areas that had undergone a major change can be detected. To achieve our goals, we focused on the urban areas affected by the tsunami event in Sendai, Japan that occurred on March 11, 2011 which affected the surrounding area, coastline and inland. High resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Landsat 7 images, covering the research area, were acquired for the period before and after the event. All pre-processed and processed according to each sensor. Both results, of the optical and SAR algorithms, were combined by resampling the spatial resolution of the Multispectral data to the SAR resolution. This was applied by spatial linear interpolation. A score representing the damage level in both products was assigned. The results of both algorithms, high level of damage is shown in the areas closer to the sea and shoreline. Our approach, combining SAR and multispectral images, leads to more reliable information and provides a complete scene for the emergency response following an event.","Coherent light; Data fusion; Disasters; Emergency services; Equalizers; Hazards; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Signal detection; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Atmospheric effects; Change detection; Covariance equalization; Linear Interpolation; Multi-spectral imagery; Multidimensional data; Multispectral images; Natural hazard; Radar imaging","Change detection; Coherence; Covariance equalization; Multi-dimensional data fusion; Natural hazards","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979561908"

In addition, it is demonstrated that the hyperspectral satellite image provides more accurate classification results than those extracted from the multispectral satellite image. The higher classification accuracy by KNN supervised was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify optimal separating classes with low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes' separation. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Reliable and updated road information thus calls for conventional on-site survey being replaced by more accurate and efficient remote sensing technology. Generally, this approach involves image enhancement and extraction of relevant features, such as elongate gradient and intersecting corners. Thus far, its implication is often impeded by wrongly extraction of other urban peripherals with similar pixel characteristics. This paper therefore proposes the fusion of THEOS satellite image and topographic derivatives, obtained from underlying Digital Surface Models (DSM). Multi-spectral indices in thematic layers and surface properties of designated roads were both fed into state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

Automated change detection algorithms play a significant role in analyzing large volumes of satellite data, which otherwise would be a manually laborious task. This paper deals with the evaluation of various change detection methods for detecting both structured and unstructured changes in multi-spectral satellite imagery. A comparison of the algorithm performance on both real and simulated satellite imagery is presented here. The real-world dataset (WorldView-2) required accurate geometric registration and manual ground-Truth labelling, while on the other hand, the simulated satellite imagery (generated with the RIT DIRSIG tool) has the advantage of prompt availability and included ground-Truth. A variety of structural spatial and spectral changes were incorporated into the simulated images according to the required complexity and the ground truth generated together with the imagery. An array of algorithms were evaluated and compared, including conventional methods such as differencing, ratioing, image transformation techniques; statistical methods such as chronochrome, covariance equalization; linear/non-linear distribution-based methods such as point density, simplex volume/complexity, mean-shift/outlier metrics, and non-linear graph-based methods. The Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC) curve and Area-Under-Curve (AUC) metrics were used to evaluate the algorithms. Finally, the performance of various algorithms on simulated vs real satellite images is also discussed, which may be helpful in further applications of the simulated imagery, such as for training deep-learning networks, where real imagery is not readily available. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The classification aim is to identify pixels as rainy or not, and to delineate precipitating areas for northern Algeria in real time. An SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is adopted in this work as the intelligent system used for the identification. Models are trained and validated against in situ rainfall measurements, collected during the rainy period of the year 2012, by automatic rain-gauge stations distributed over the study area (North of Algeria). Five statistical assessors are used to evaluate performances. Results of the classification by the SVM are compared to a statistical method, based on thresholding in histograms representing classes' features.

In many situations, change detection techniques aids in detecting such changes being taking place. The changes can be noticed from different kinds of low- and high-resolution satellite images of multi-spectral and multi-temporal images. There are different kinds of change detection techniques to observe changes in the images, like principal component analysis method, spectral change vector analysis, post-classification method, kernel method, etc. Machine learning (post-classification) method based change detection provides better accuracy, because these methods are based on pixel comparison in multi-temporal satellite images. The change detection accuracy depends on the classifier used for classification of multi-temporal images. Any misclassification in either images leads to poor detection in change, hence classifier selection is very important in this case. In the recent past, the performance of classification techniques is improved by combining the advantages of some of the classifiers as ensemble methods. In this work, ensemble based classifier is explored for images classification. Different parameters are considered to estimate the performance of ensemble based classifier. Finally, the changed pixels in two temporal images are observed and listed. The images are also shown in zoomed for easy observation of changes in the images. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The nature of this type of data is usually multi or hyperspectral with individual spectral bands stored in raster file structures of large size and global coverage. The elevated number of bands (on the order of 200 to 250 bands) requires data processing algorithms capable of extracting information content, removing redundancy. Conventional statistical methods have been devised to reduce dimensionality however they lack specific processing to handle data diversity. Hence, in this paper we propose a new data analytic technique to classify these complex multidimensional data cubes. Here, we use a well-known database consisting of multi-spectral values of pixels from satellite images, where the classification is associated with the central pixel in each neighborhood. The goal of our proposed approach is to predict this classification based on the given multi-spectral values. To solve this classification problem, we propose an improved decision tree (DT) algorithm based on a fuzzy approach. More particularly, we introduce a new hybrid classification algorithm that utilizes the conventional decision tree algorithm enhanced with the fuzzy approach. We propose an improved data classification algorithm that utilizes the best of a decision tree and multi-criteria classification. To investigate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method against other DT classifiers, a comparative and analytical study is conducted on well-known Landsat data. © 2015 The Authors.

To achieve this, firstly, a preprocessing strategy is used to remove illumination artifacts and results in less false detection than traditional threshold-based algorithms. Then, we use the corrected input data to define a new fitness function based on the difference image. The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i.e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images.

Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm and a majority zoning post-Treatment are used. This study emerges from the experience for multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10) conducted in 2010 on a mixed fanning area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. It is based on satellite images acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010, with radar images in the X, C and L-bands (HH polarization), optics image, delivered by Formosat-2 and concomitant field data acquired on April 14, 2010. The results show that the combination of images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and optical (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy = 0.85; kappa = 0.81) compared to the use of only radar or optical data. Furthermore, the F-score performance obtained for grass cover varies between 0.1 for Formosat-2 to 0.34 for the combination Formosat-2/Alos and 0.52 for Alos. Thus, the results show that the quality of the classification of grassland increases with the increase of the wavelength of the images used.","Agriculture; Classification (of information); Crops; Decision trees; Image acquisition; Image classification; Land use; Radar; Satellite imagery; Satellites; Space-based radar; Vegetation; Agricultural; ALOS PALSAR; Formosat-2; Grassland; Land cover; Optical; Radarsat-2; Random forests; TerraSAR-X; Radar imaging","Agricultural; Alos Palsar; Classification; Formosat-2; Grassland.; Land Cover; Land Use; Optical; Radar; Radarsat-2; Random Forest; TerraSAR-X","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029098344"

This helps in the monitoring and management of marine systems and coastal resources over large areas. The objective of this research is to utilized a 4 band (Red, Green, Blue, NIR) WorldView-2 satellite image of Guiuan, Eastern Samar to produce a benthic habitat map using object-based image analysis. The image had undergone two major steps: pre-processing and classification. The pre-processing comprised of several steps essential to correct the raw satellite image file for benthic habitat mapping. First, the image's reflected radiance was calibrated and corrected from water surface and atmospheric scattering. Then, land and cloud masking was performed. Next, Hedley's deglinting formula was applied to remove the effects of sun glint in the image by utilizing the NIR band of the dark pixels. The water column correction was adapted from Lyzenga to remove the effects of the absorption and scattering of photons in the water. A depth invariant matrix was calculated and applied to the band pairs of good water reflectors. The inputs for the multi-scale classification were the pre-processed WorldView-2 satellite image, and color transformation outputs from RGB to HSV and RGB to HLS outputted into 3 layers using Prinicipal Component Analysis. For the classification, a multiscale segmentation was applied using a hierarchical top to bottom scheme. Starting with a bigger scale parameter for shallow water region and smaller scale for the benthic community zones. Different segmentation parameters such as weights, shape, and compactness were performed to enhance the object found in each zones. A classification algorithm was utilized for the WorldView-2 Image called Support Vector Mechanics(SVM) using eCognition, an object image analysis software. By using the training data set, the mean layer values, their standard deviations and their textural characteristics were inputted for the benthic classes' object features. Ground measurements from video tows and sampling confirmed the accurate representation of the classified benthic habitat maps.","Color image processing; Ecosystems; Hydrophilicity; Image processing; Infrared devices; Mapping; Photomapping; Remote sensing; Satellites; Surface waters; Water absorption; Absorption and scatterings; Benthic habitats; Monitoring and management; Multispectral satellite image; Obia; Object based image analysis; Support vector mechanics; Worldview-2; Image analysis","Benthic habitats; Obia; Remote sensing; Worldview-2","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964048028"

There are not many studies demonstrating such algorithm for the multispectral images, especially when the image consists of 4 bands (Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared) as in DubaiSat-2 satellite images. The proposed approach utilizes both unsupervised and supervised classification schemes sequentially to identify four classes in the image, namely, water bodies, vegetation, land (developed and undeveloped areas) and paved areas (i.e. roads). The unsupervised classification concept is applied to identify two classes; water bodies and vegetation, based on a well-known index that uses the distinct wavelengths of visible and near-infrared sunlight that is absorbed and reflected by the plants to identify the classes; this index parameter is called «Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)». Afterward, the supervised classification is performed by selecting training homogenous samples for roads and land areas. Here, a precise selection of training samples plays a vital role in the classification accuracy. Post classification is finally performed to enhance the classification accuracy, where the classified image is sieved, clumped and filtered before producing final output. Overall, the supervised classification approach produced higher accuracy than the unsupervised method.

Secondly, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) transforms the images into the frequency domain. Thirdly, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to obtain an adaptive weight of the fusion rule. Then, the adaptive fusion rule is applied to the DCT coefficients. Finally, the fused image is obtained through the inverse of principal component analysis (IPCA) and the inverse of the discrete cosine transform (IDCT).

Hence, they need to be processed cautiously. This paper presents a 4-Level DWT based Sub-Band Replacement (SR-DWT) Image Compression scheme, for LANDSAT satellite images. The algorithm is designed to compress various color band images captured by the satellite payload. By performing compression on these images and converting them to unique textured images, it exploits the sub-bands generated by the wavelet transform. Since the algorithm is a reversible process, it facilitates retrieval of the images back to colored format at the receiver. Due to the property of possessing spatial-frequency decomposition, the recovered images are of high quality with improved Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 20dB and correspondingly very low MSE value. Using an astrophysical image database, the performance analysis of the 4-Level SR-DWT algorithm is illustrated. © 2015 IEEE.","Discrete wavelet transforms; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Satellite imagery; Signal reconstruction; Signal to noise ratio; Textures; Compression scheme; LANDSAT satellite images; Peak signal to noise ratio; Performance analysis; Reversible process; Satellite images; Satellite payloads; Spatial-frequency decomposition; Image compression","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940702978"

However, scale selection in multi-scale segmentation and OBIA remains a challenge, which directly reduces efficiency of land cover mapping. In this study, we presented an object-based land cover mapping using adaptive scale segmentation. Central to our method is the use of inherent features of segmented objects to determine whether an object should be segmented with a small scale in a top-down segmentation procedure. We firstly used inherent features of a segmented object to determine whether this object should be segmented with a smaller scale in a top-down segmentation procedure, producing a segmentation map with optimal scales. Then, an object-based SVM classifier was applied on the adaptive-scale segmentation map to yield a land-cover map. We have applied this method on a ZY-3 multi-spectral satellite image to produce land cover map, compared with the results using the traditional mean shift algorithm with fixed scales. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method is practically helpful and efficient to improve the performance of land cover mapping. © 2017 IEEE.","","LUCC; multi-scale segmentation; OBIA; scale selection; ZY-3 satellite image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041826508"

Initially preprocessing is done using Gaussian filter and transformed to a suitable form using Wavelet transform. Subsequently, segmentation is performed in the wavelet transformed image using fuzzy hybrid with hierarchical clustering technique. Then the proposed sparse SVM classifier is trained by the features obtained from the clustered output. Thus the multispectral image of various satellite images can be classified into different land classes comparing with the training data given to sparse SVM. The performance is evaluated by comparing with the existing classifiers for different multi-spectral satellite images which provides accurate results. The classification accuracy is measured from the performance analysis graph where the results demonstrate that the proposed sparse SVM classifier can optimally enhance the classification accuracy of any multispectral satellite image.","","Fuzzy-hierarchial clustering; Multispectral satellite images; Sparse SVM; Wavelet transform","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961639789"

Recent applications in the surveying industry have proved the usefulness of Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) as a low cost source of good quality bathymetry data. In order to support ADNOC's efforts to fast track new field development projects and timely delivery of high value data, ZADCO as part of its survey campaign selected SDB as a tool to source quality near shore hydrographic data. Offshore bathymetry derivation was realized using WorldView-3 satellite scenes. These scenes were processed by following a rigorous processing methodology for the correction of atmospheric adjacency. The processed and corrected satellite image provided a spatial resolution of nearly four metres and covered depths from the 0m depth contours up to the 15m depth contours. The accuracy and reliability of the satellite images are dependent on the optical conditions of the satellite scene, the sensitivity of the satellite's sensor and the accuracy of the calibration. After detailed multi-level quality checks for various systematic and non-systematic errors, the most reliable bathymetry that was found to meet ZADCO selection criteria was noted to be between 0m and 3m water depths, with an error of ±0.3m. Water depths between 3m and 5m presented themselves with an error of ±0.4m, whereas for depths between 5m and 10m, the errors varied between 0.5m to 1.0m. It was found that in the extreme nearshore areas with depths between 0m and 3m water depths, SDB could be accepted for use as it was falling within the tolerance limits of ±0.3m, with most areas having a tolerance of ±0.2m. While satellite derived bathymetry between the 0m to 5m water depths was found to be of acceptable quality, those over drying heights were found to be completely unreliable. The reliability factor that could be established for SDB data between 0m and 3m implied that dangerous and logistically challenging nearshore survey operations using conventional methods, that is, using shallow draught survey motor boats could be done away with. This also presented an interesting corollary in that it can also remove a huge HSE risk factor associated with shallow water survey boat operations, which are otherwise a significant risk due to the presence of underwater obstacles such as corals, rocks, reefs and surface dangers such as wave action and tidal influences. In conclusion, high resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery corrected for atmospheric and underwater refraction effects combined with the correct processing techniques and multi-level quality control mechanism provides a reliable source for bathymetry in extreme nearshore areas. Based on the results achieved it was concluded that SDB data can be used for engineering planning and estimation applications, for quick turnaround.

The rapid development of remote sensing technology provides a possibility of spatial continuous monitoring of crop diseases over a large area. In this study, to monitor powdery mildew in winter wheat in an area where a severe disease infection occurred, the capability of high resolution (6 m) multi-spectral satellite imagery, SPOT-6, in disease mapping was assessed and validated using field survey data. Based on a rigorous feature selection process, five disease sensitive spectral features: green band, red band, normalized difference vegetation index, triangular vegetation index, and atmospherically-resistant vegetation index were selected from a group of candidate spectral features/variables. A spectral correction was processed on the selected features to eliminate possible baseline effect across different regions. Then, the disease mapping method was developed based on a spectral angle mapping technique. By validating against a set of field survey data, an overall mapping accuracy of 78 % and kappa coefficient of 0.55 were achieved.

Accurate and up-to-date estimation of urban tree canopy cover (UTC) is a basic need for the management of green spaces in cities, providing a metric from which variation can be understood, change monitored and areas prioritised. Random point sampling methods, such as i-Tree canopy, provide a cheap and quick estimation of UTC for a large area. Remote sensing methods using airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and multi-spectral images produce accurate UTC maps, although greater processing time and technical skills are required. In this paper, random point sampling and remote sensing methods are used to estimate UTC in Williamstown, a suburb of Melbourne, Australia. High resolution multi-spectral satellite images fused with LiDAR data with pixel-level accuracy are employed to produce the UTC map. The UTC is also estimated by categorising random points (a) automatically using the LiDAR derived UTC map and (b) manually using Google Maps and i-Tree canopy software. There was a minimum 1% difference between UTC estimated from the map derived from remotely sensed data and only 1000 random points automatically categorised by that same map, indicating the level of error associated with a random sampling approach. The difference between UTC estimated by remote sensing and manually categorised random point sampling varied in range of 4.5% using a confidence level of 95%.

It is important to restore shadow radiance information for improving information extraction from remote-sensing images. Several shadow-restoration methods have been developed using complex statistical relationships between shadowed areas and their nearby sunlit areas. In this study, a simple shadow-restoration approach was proposed based on the surface reflectance equality relationship (RER) under the assumption that the surface reflectance of a feature in the shadowed area is equal to that of the same feature in the nearby sunlit area. This approach reduces the number of parameters, thus reducing the error propagated by the uncertainties of extra parameters. The new RER method was tested with three multispectral images with different shadow features. By comparing RER with the widely used mean and variance transformation, the RER was shown to be capable of restoring the image colours, texture, tone, and brightness of the shadowed areas to a visually satisfactory level. Quantitative analysis suggests that RER can help to restore the reflectance of shadow features accurately and has robust performance for a variety of land-surface types. Moreover, RER can be effectively used to restore the spectral shape information of shadow features, which is particularly important when applying RER to the restoration of multispectral imagery for the purpose of image classification. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Classification (of information); Image enhancement; Reflection; Remote sensing; Restoration; Multi-spectral imagery; Multispectral images; Optical satellite images; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing technology; Restoration methods; Statistical relationship; Surface reflectance; color; image classification; multispectral image; quantitative analysis; spectral analysis; surface reflectance; Image reconstruction","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940055293"

All satellite images are affected at some level by lightwave scattering and absorption from aerosols, water vapor and particulates in the atmosphere. For generating high-quality scientific data, atmospheric correction is required to remove atmospheric effects and to convert digital number (DN) values to surface reflectance (SR). Every optical satellite in orbit observes the earth through the same atmosphere, but each satellite image is impacted differently because atmospheric conditions are constantly changing. A physics-based detailed radiative transfer model 6SV requires a lot of key ancillary information about the atmospheric conditions at the acquisition time. This paper investigates to achieve the simultaneous acquisition of atmospheric radiation parameters based on the multi-spectral information, in order to improve the estimates of surface reflectance through physics-based atmospheric correction. Ancillary information on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total water vapor (TWV) derived from the multi-spectral information based on specific spectral properties was used for the 6SV model. The experimentation was carried out on images of Sentinel-2, which carries a Multispectral Instrument (MSI), recording in 13 spectral bands, covering a wide range of wavelengths from 440 up to 2200 nm. The results suggest that per-pixel atmospheric correction through 6SV model, integrating AOD and TWV derived from multispectral information, is better suited for accurate analysis of satellite images and quantitative remote sensing application. © 2018 SPIE.","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric radiation; Orbits; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellites; Space optics; Water absorption; Water vapor; Atmospheric corrections; Multi-spectral; Quantitative remote sensing; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing images; Remote sensing","Atmospheric correction; Multi-spectral information; Quantitative remote sensing; Radiative transfer model; Remote sensing image","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045138461"

Although rapid progress in remote sensing techniques has been witnessed in recent years, the resolution of the available satellite images remains limited compared with the general images acquired using a common camera. On the other hand, a satellite image usually has a greater number of spectral bands than a general image, thereby permitting the multi-spectral analysis of different land materials and promoting low-resolution satellite scene recognition. This study advocates multi-spectral analysis and explores the middle-level statistics of spectral information for satellite scene representation instead of using spatial analysis. This approach is widely utilized in general image and natural scene classification and achieved promising recognition performance for different applications. The proposed multi-spectral analysis firstly learns the multi-spectral prototypes (codebook) for representing any pixel-wise spectral data, and then, based on the learned codebook, a sparse coded spectral vector can be obtained with machine learning techniques. Furthermore, in order to combine the set of coded spectral vectors in a satellite scene image, we propose a hybrid aggregation (pooling) approach, instead of conventional averaging and max pooling, which includes the benefits of the two existing methods, but avoids extremely noisy coded values. Experiments on three satellite datasets validated that the performance of our proposed approach is very impressive compared with the state-of-the-art methods for satellite scene classification. © 2017 by the authors.

Each satellite is designed to provide optical images to civilian and defense users. Images are simultaneously acquired in Panchromatic (PA) and multi-spectral (XS) mode, which allows, in nadir acquisition condition, to deliver 20 km wide, false or natural colored scenes with a 70 cm ground sampling distance after PA+XS fusion. Coverage is almost world-wide with a revisit interval of 24 h for the 2 satellites. The assessment of the image quality and the calibration operation has been performed by CNES Image Quality team during the 6 month commissioning phases that followed each satellite launch. These activities cover many topics such as absolute calibration, the normalization coefficients computation, the refocusing operations, the MTF assessment, the estimation of signal to noise ratio, the geometric model calibration, the assessment of localization accuracy, multispectral overlapping, static and dynamic stability, planimetric and altimetric accuracy. These operations required specific control of the payload and dedicated guidance of the satellite platform.

First, input MS image decomposes into a sequence of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and residues using BEMD to remove large amounts of redundancies and carries their spatial and frequency components of all pixels. Second, decompose IMFs component and detail coefficient of Pan image using Curvelet Transform (CT), which are directional. Then, we use linear dependency to decide which detail coefficient of Pan should be injected into MS coefficient. Finally, we perform the inverse curvelet and inverse of BEMD to get high-resolution MS image.

Our goal was to test whether satellite remote sensing, which has been successful in locating large archaeological features associated with sedentary peoples, could be applied to arctic interior sites associated with mobile hunter-gatherers. In particular, we strove to develop a relatively straightforward and inexpensive model using existing data which could be used to help guide archaeology surveys. Using 1-m resolution IKONOS imagery of Lake Matcharak along the upper Noatak River, we produced a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tasseled cap transformation of the study area and stacked these five vegetation indices into one image. We then applied unsupervised and supervised classifications to the image first, to test for the presence of a site-specific spectral class and second, determine the nature of that class. Through a visual analysis of the unsupervised classification, a spectral phenomenon was seen to co-occur with archaeological sites in the study area. The supervised classification provided a high-resolution land cover map used to identify the signature as the ecotone between un-vegetated sediments and dense willow (Salix sp.) stands. Dense willow stands along the Lake Matcharak shore visually correlate with most of the known archaeological sites, possibly reflecting landform and/or vegetation characteristics that would have appealed to past inhabitants.

The input time series of such sequential tests is typically a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI), which uses two or three bands and ignores all other bands. Being limited to a vegetation index will not benefit from the richer spectral information provided by newly launched satellites and will bring two bottle-necks for deforestation monitoring. Firstly, it is hard to select a suitable vegetation index a priori. Secondly, a single vegetation index is typically affected by seasonal signals, noise and other natural dynamics, which decrease its power for deforestation detection. A novel multispectral time series change monitoring method that combines dimension reduction methods with a sequential hypothesis test is proposed to address these limitations. For each location, the proposed method automatically chooses a ""suitable"" index for deforestation monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we implemented it in two study areas: a dry tropical forest in Bolivia (time series length: 444) with strong seasonality and a moist tropical forest in Brazil (time series length: 225) with almost no seasonality. Our method significantly improves accuracy in the presence of strong seasonality, in particular the temporal lag between disturbance and its detection. © 2017 by the authors.","Bottles; Deforestation; Forestry; Satellites; Time series; Vegetation; Dimension reduction; Dimension reduction method; Dry tropical forests; Landsat time series; Monitoring methods; Multi-spectral; Multispectral satellite image; Spectral information; Image enhancement","Deforestation monitor; Dimension reduction; Landsat time series; Multi-spectral","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032861716"

However, many scientific studies demonstrate that visual perception in primates rely on both bottom-up and top-down connections. Therefore, in this work, we propose a CNN network with feedback structure for solar power plant detection on middle-resolution satellite images. To express the strength of the top-down connections, we introduce feedback CNN network (FB-Net) to a baseline CNN model used for solar power plant classification on multi-spectral satellite data. Moreover, we introduce a method to improve class activation mapping (CAM) to our FB-Net, which takes advantage of multi-channel pulse coupled neural network (m-PCNN) for weakly-supervised localization of the solar power plants from the features of proposed FB-Net. For the proposed FB-Net CAM with m-PCNN, experimental results demonstrated promising results on both solar-power plant image classification and detection task. © 2017.

However, there are still a lot of problems appearing in the process of land consolidation, for instance, the project funds are not used as what is required, the plans of land consolidation are not carried out completely, and there are even Jerry-built projects and false and concealed accounts. Because of these existing problems, the goals of the land consolidation cannot be achieved as expected. To solve the problems, Ministry of Land and Resources of the People's Republic of China developed and used the monitoring and controlling system of land consolidation project as early as in 2009, which monitors and manages the results of land consolidation all over the country. The procedures are as follows: the local authorities that are in charge of the project management will report the results to the higher authorities after land consolidation, and then the competent department will arrange to check the results on the spot. There are some certain problems, for instance, the distribution of land consolidation is wide and the area is large, yet the amount of samples is limited, therefore, the specific results of land consolidation cannot be obtained thoroughly and the system cannot be applied widely. So, it is necessary and urgent for land resources management sectors (LRMS) to find an effective and reliable technical method, with which the LRMS can monitor and evaluate the project results of land consolidation. Based on the panchromatic images and multi-spectral images with high resolution got by the High-1 satellite and the software tools including ENVI, AutoCAD and ArcGIS, the paper puts forward the complete technical method and operation procedures for land consolidation monitoring and evaluation, and also studies the ways of extracting the information of newly increased farmlands, newly-added roads and newly-dug ditches by using vector map, which is made after the land consolidation by project undertaker. Furthermore, from the specific monitoring instance of a land consolidation project along Han River i.e. South-to-North Water Transfer Project, by using the method introduced in this paper, we can find the monitoring ratio of newly increased farmlands is 88.40%, newly-added roads 97.34%, and newly-dug ditches 98.26% in the study area. After monitoring, the paper analyzed the causes of the differences of monitoring ratio between the 3, and especially explains the causes of the lower monitoring ratio of newly increased farmlands in details. They are as follows: first, part of newly-cultivated land is got by means of the landfill of ridges, roads and ditches; second, some project areas haven't made vector maps properly, and the layer names can't match the actual objects in the maps, which causes that the extracted information of new land isn't complete; third, the project undertaker cheats on the area of newly-cultivated land. From all above, we can draw a few conclusions. Firstly, High-1 remote satellite images have both panchromatic images of 2 m resolution and multi-spectral images of 8 m resolution, and after processing the images in the early stage, we have used the algorithm of Gram-Schmidt to fuse the 2 types of images and obtained ideal images in space and spectrum resolution, which can satisfy the requirements of monitoring results in land consolidation. Secondly, we have got the monitoring ratio of newly-cultivated land, new roads and new ditches from one project in the land consolidation along Han River. And the specific example shows that the technical methods in the paper are reasonable and effective. Finally, The ArcGIS software platform is used to process remote sensing images, vector maps of land consolidation results and other reference maps, so that different data from different sources can be unified to GIS. During the process of remote sensing monitoring, we can use various graphics files efficiently, and at the same time it's convenient to modify the maps and print the interpreted maps, which can improve the efficiency greatly. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

In this research, pixel - base classification method is performed according to the value of spectral pixels with Multi-Spectral Scanner satellite image and used data corresponds to a 3×3 square neighborhoods.

Despite the presence of improved spatial resolution for better ocean color interpretation within coastal zones; differences among the OCM-2 detectors lead to striping artifacts in the along-track direction limiting the ocean color observations. Existing calibration methods do not characterize the striping noise efficiently. Destriping algorithms are generally applied to Level 2 radiance or biogeochemical products (i.e., post-radiometric and atmospheric correction), to remove the striping artifacts in order to ensure quality products. The present study focuses to reveal a robust method which effectively removes the striping effects in the TOA radiance products. Preliminary results obtained from this approach have been highlighted which show significant improvement in image quality for Level 1B (TOA radiance) and Level 2 (Water leaving radiance (Lw) and biogeochemical) products.

Monitoring is essential for assessment and comprehensive overview of water status. Annex V of WFD define tree type of water quality parameters which need to be monitored (biological and two supported one-hydro morphological and physic chemical) in order to assess ecological status of water bodies. Remote sensing data can be used for monitoring and identification of water bodies over large scale regions in a more effective and efficient manner. However, this technique must to be integrated with traditions in situ sampling method and field surveying in order to provide precise results. Various empirical, semi-Analytics and machine learning algorithms exist to derive relationship between multi spectral image surface reflectance and water quality indicators derived from in situ measurement. In this study we evaluate the capabilities of Landsat 8 satellite image for assessment of abundance of phytoplankton's (biological parameters) and Turbidity, Dissolved oxygen, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen (physic chemical parameters) in region of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia. The Neuron Networks are used to analyzing correlation between in situ measurements and 7 Landsat 8 atmospherically corrected satellite images acquired in 2013. In situ data are obtained from Agency for environment protection of Serbia. Our results shows that satellite-based monitoring, in combination with in situ data, provide an improved basis for more effective monitoring of large number of water bodies over large geographical area.

In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site's topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data.

The KIFCM algorithm is built on a basis of the kernel learning method and the interval-valued fuzzy sets with intent to overcome some drawbacks existing in the ""conventional"" Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. The development of the method is motivated by two factors. First, uncertainty is inherent in clustering problems due to some information deficiency, which might be incomplete, imprecise, fragmentary, not fully reliable, vague, contradictory, etc. With this regard, interval-valued fuzzy sets exhibit advantages when handling such aspects of uncertainty. Second, kernel methods form a new class of pattern analysis algorithms which can cope with general types of data and detect general types of relations (geometric properties) by embedding input data in a vector space based on the inner products and looking for linear relations in the space. However, as the clustering problems may involve various input features exhibiting different impacts on the obtained results, we introduce a new MKIFCM algorithm, which uses a combination of different kernels (giving rise to a concept of a composite kernel). The composite kernel was built by mapping each input feature onto individual kernel space and linearly combining these kernels with the optimized weights of the corresponding kernel. The experiments were completed for several well-known datasets, land cover classification from multi-spectral satellite image and Multiplex Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (MFISH) classification problem.

A special application is for using low resolution multi-spectral image with high resolution panchromatic image to obtain an image having both spectral and spatial information. Alignment of images to be fused is a step prior to image fusion. This is achieved by registering the images. This paper proposes the methods involving Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (FANN) for automatic registration of satellite image (reference image) prior to fusion of low spatial resolution multi-spectral QuickBird satellite image (sensed image) with high spatial resolution panchromatic QuickBird satellite image. In the registration steps, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used to extract key points from both images. The keypoints are then matched using the automatic tuning algorithm, namely, FANN. This algorithm automatically selects the most appropriate indexing algorithm for the dataset. The indexed features are then matched using approximate nearest neighbor. Further, Random Sample Consensus (RanSAC) is used for further filtering to obtain only the inliers and co-register the images. The images are then fused using Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS) transform based technique to obtain a high spatial resolution multi-spectral image. The results show that the quality of fused images obtained using this algorithm is computationally efficient. © 2016, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.","algorithm; data set; image analysis; image resolution; multispectral image; panchromatic image; QuickBird; remote sensing; satellite data; satellite imagery; spatial resolution","Fast approximate nearest Neighbor; Image fusion; Scale invariant feature transform","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965057566"

SPIHT is an intensive progressive capability, and it can interrupt the decoding (or coding) at any time and a result of maximum possible detail can be reconstructed with one-bit precision.Huffman coding is based on the frequency of occurence of a data item (pixel in images) and the principle is to use a lower number of bits to encode the data that occurs more frequently.

Because of this advantage, enormous efforts have been made by researchers and application specialists to delineate vegetation indexes from local scale to global scale by applying remote sensing imagery. <br><br> In this work, four band images have been considered, which are involved in these vegetation indexes, and were taken by satellites Ikonos-2 and Landsat-7 of the same geographic location, to study the effect of both spatial (pixel size) and radiometric (number of bits coding the image) resolution on these wavelength bands as well as two vegetation indexes: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). <br><br> In order to do so, a multi-fractal analysis of these multi-spectral images was applied in each of these bands and the two indexes derived.

In this research, the RGB and NIR sensors carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were applied to the trophic state mapping of Tain-Pu reservoir, which is one of the small reservoirs in Kinmen, Taiwan.

A new pansharpening method is proposed in this paper. First, 8-band multispectral imagery is resampled by nearest neighbor interpolation. According to the relative spectral responses between the multispectral band and the panchromatic band, a low spatial resolution panchromatic image is evaluated through multivariate linear regression. The spatial details are extracted from the original panchromatic image, and then injected into the component space of multispectral imagery. Finally, the pansharpened results are produced by employing inverse correspondence analysis transform.

Conversely, it is estimated that more than 2.5 billion people depend directly on the agricultural sector. Earth Observation has been a tool for agronomists with ever-increasing capability, however, the case of agriculture in low-income countries imposes challenges, for instance in recognizing mixed- and inter-cropping, the small size of the farm plots and lack of sound crop management systems, which increase the uncertainty of information derived from remotely sensed data. The Spurring a Transformation for Agriculture through Remote Sensing (STARS) project aims to investigate the potential of Very High Spatial Resolution remote sensing in delivering data products that can better inform decisions around smallholder agriculture. Data are collected throughout the growing season via in-situ measurements, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles equipped with NIR and multispectral cameras and VHSR satellite images. One important STARS' objective is to analyze the spectral information of this multi-scale and multi-temporal dataset and establish implementation flows to support stakeholders in their decision making and economic development. In this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of VHSR images in mapping and monitoring smallholder crop fields in Bangladesh. UAV-based and satellite data at a variety of spatial scales are presented and the degree to which delineation of crop fields and related agronomical information can be extracted is discussed.

Among a new generation of high-resolution satellites, GF-1 stands out. It sets high spatial resolution, multi-spectral and high temporal resolution in a fusion technology with strategic significance. To explore Chinese GF-1 satellite images' adaptability of agricultural growth monitoring, its images for the region of Xuchange China for maize growth were compared with the same period of Landsat-8 satellite images in three aspects of sensor spectral response characteristics, the accuracy of empirical regression model and LAI space consistency. There were a total of 24 sampling points for the study. First, graphs described the sample located pixels' spectral reflectance of near-infrared band, red band, green band and blue band of the two types of sensors. It directly reflected the spectral reflectance differences between sensors in the same place, and differences between maize in different area. The reflectance of near-infrared and red band of Landsat-8 was higher compared with GF-1. The blue and green band's reflectance of GF-1 was similar to that of Landsat-8. The linear correlation of two sensors' reflectivity could be calculated at the same time. Second, four bands of two types of images were separately combined into seven kinds of normalized difference vegetation index to further eliminate the influence of atmospheric correction process. Like NDVI, the red band was replaced by blue or green or three visible bands' combination of two by two or sum of them. Then, the empirical regression models were used to calculate the ability of inversing LAI among the vegetation index. Based on comparison of R2 and RMSE among models, high fitting models were selected. The optimal model for Landsat-8 was based on BRNDVI, it was an index model. The best model for GF-1was based on NDVI, and model type was an index model. The reserved samples were used to test model's fitting accuracy. The final result showed a good correlation between inversed LAI and measured LAI for all images. Third, LAI distribution of Xuchang district was reversed by the optimal model of two images, due to the variance in spatial resolution, GF-1 data did downscale process by resampling to 30 m scale. In total, maize LAI spatial distribution in two images was more consistent, and had a west to east high transition trend. For further research, the range for LAI unified into <3.0, ≥3.0-4.0, ≥4.0-5.0, ≥5.0 pixels is needed in a visual display. High values greater than 5.0 were concentrated in Xuchang county, Yanling county and the eastern half of Changge city, the two distributions were more consistent; <3.0 pixels were rarely low in both. There were difference in the distribution of Yuzhou, western Changge city and Xiangcheng County, ≥4.0-5.0 range had a wider distribution in Landsat-8 product of LAI, and ≥3.0-4.0 pixels were more in GF-1 LAI product. In this paper, the application indicated that GF-1 satellite's high time resolution provides more chances to get cloudless data, and high spatial and spectral resolution features and it can replace the traditional medium resolution remote sensing of agricultural growth monitoring data to a certain extent. This research shows that GF-1is an important data source and the data's application in other areas of agriculture is the focus of future research. ©, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The HTM method is substantially improved by employing the 1.38-μ m cirrus band. The top-of-atmosphere reflectance cirrus band is used as an additional source of information. The method restores the information in highly inhomogeneous surfaces attenuated by a low-altitude haze and high-altitude cirrus, improving the interpretation of the scene content while preserving the shape of the spectral signatures.

However, method development for discrimination between spectrally highly similar crop species remains a challenge in remote sensing. Calculation of vegetation indices is a frequently applied option to amplify the most distinctive parts of a spectrum. Since no vegetation index exist, that is universally best-performing, a method is presented that finds an index that is optimized for the classification of a specific satellite data set to separate two cereal crop types. The η2 (eta-squared) measure of association – presented as novel spectral separability indicator – was used for the evaluation of the numerous tested indices. The approach is first applied on a RapidEye satellite image for the separation of winter wheat and winter barley in a Central German test site. The determined optimized index allows a more accurate classification (97%) than several well-established vegetation indices like NDVI and EVI (<87%). Furthermore, the approach was applied on a RapidEye multi-spectral image time series covering the years 2010–2014. The optimized index for the spectral separation of winter barley and winter wheat for each acquisition date was calculated and its ability to distinct the two classes was assessed. The results indicate that the calculated optimized indices perform better than the standard indices for most seasonal parts of the time series. The red edge spectral region proved to be of high significance for crop classification. Additionally, a time frame of best spectral separability of wheat and barley could be detected in early to mid-summer. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; cereal; classification; imagery; multispectral image; optimization; RapidEye; remote sensing; spectral analysis; time series analysis; vegetation index","Crop classification; RapidEye; Spectral separability; Time series; Vegetation index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997840794"

Since research studies have shown the outstanding absolute geometric accuracy of high resolution radar satellites images like TerraSAR-X, the importance of SAR images as source for geolocation enhancement has increased. Due to this fact, multi-sensor image to image registration of optical and SAR images can be used for the improvement of the absolute geometric processing and accuracy of optical ima ges with TerraSAR-X as reference. In comparison to the common optical and SAR image registration methods the proposed method is a combination of intensity-based and feature-based approaches. The proposed method avoids the direct and often difficult detection of features from the SAR images. SAR-like templates are generated from features detected from the optical image. These templates are used for an intensity-based matching with the SAR image. The results of the matching process are ground control points, which are used for the estimation of translation parameters followed by a subpixel translation of the optical image.

The literature survey shows most of the work for image segmentation based on the properties that is looking for complex land surfaces, particularly when sensed using multi-spectral high resolution satellite imagery, the image scene is usually not easily partitioned correctly using a single feature channel (property) due to the complicated nature of the image scene. From survey it is clear that integrated processing of the multiple features is essential to obtaining more reliable segmentation. For speedy processing of information an automatic segmentation of these high resolution images will be useful for getting more timely and accurate information. Benefits of the high resolution images are that it provides, through the use of a variety of analysis methods, extraction of more detailed information’s. This paper strives to develop a methodological framework for automatically segmenting the images into different regions corresponding to various features such as texture, intensity, and color. A comparative study of survey shows that different segmentation techniques have to be studied in detail. One such method is watershed algorithm which is realized by comparing similarities between different features of sub-regions. Since it is not possible to apply the watershed algorithm on an image directly, the image must be preprocessed before the segmentation process. © Research India Publications.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926430225"

The image time series, as results of the satellite revisiting period, gives you insights not only on a certain area, but also on its representation at different moments of time. In order to limit the issues that might arise due to irregular time sampling of multispectral data, the authors propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series for analysis. To this point, the main goal is to mine the satellite image time series (SITS) for understanding the temporal behaviour of an area in terms of evolution and persistency. The paper introduces an analytical approach, combining coherent and no coherent analysis of SAR SITS content. We propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract categories of evolution from the SAR SITS and techniques which study statistical and coherent proprieties of the targets to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic characteristics over time, named Persistent Scatterers (PS).

Crop nitrogen content estimation by remote sensing technique has been being a topic research in remote sensing monitoring of agricultural parameters. Hyper-spectral remote sensing with wealth of spectral information has been widely used in crop physiological and biochemical information extraction. It provides theoretical basis for estimating crop biochemical parameters based on multi-spectral satellite data. In terms of multi-spectral satellite remote sensing, spectral reflectances and spectral indices are effective ways to establish estimation models of biochemical parameters, but which bands and spectral indices are more effective and reliable for leaf nitrogen concentration monitoring in winter wheat is still debatable. In this article, ground-based canopy spectral reflectance and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) of winter wheat were measured from field and plot experiments including varied nitrogen fertilization levels and winter wheat varieties across the whole growth stages. Multi-spectral broadband reflectance was simulated by using the measured hyper-spectral reflectance and spectral response functions of multi-spectral camera of GF-1 satellite with a spatial resolution of 8 m, and then, they were used for the establishment of spectral index (SI). Eight spectral indices significantly correlated with LNC at the 0.01 probability level were used to construct the LNC estimation models in a linear, quadratic polynomial and exponential regression model respectively. Considering the influence factors in evaluating the efficiency of the SI-LNC model, i.e., the stability of the SI to other perturbing factors, the sensitivity of the SI to a unit change of LNC, and the dynamic range of the SI, the improved sensitivity index was proposed based on the NE and TVI index models. The optimal LNC estimation model was given according to the sensitivity and accuracy analysis, and the model was used to inverse the LNC in greenup growth period based on the GF-1 satellite image. The results showed that: 1) The simulated multi-spectral reflectance was highly correlated with the spectral reflectance from remote sensing images in visible and near infrared bands. They were consistent with each other keeping a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.95. It was concluded that the simulated broadband SI considering the spectral response function could be used to analyze the quantitative relationship with leaf nitrogen in both different growth periods and whole growth stage. 2) The SI based on the simulated spectral reflectance was significantly related with the LNC at 0.01 probability level with the correlation coefficient of greater than 0.6. A different pattern of the best combinations was found for 6 two-band spectral indices. The selection of 610-690 nm paired with 750-900 nm was the most effective two-band combination in RVI index, which was also the center wavelengths of the red and near infrared bands for GF-1 satellite data. 3) The sensitivity analysis indicated that all the regression models of selected SI passed the significance test at 0.01 probability level. The TCARI/OSAVI and RVI indices linearly related with LNC implied a stable response to the LNC changes. The first-order differentials of RVI and TCARI/OSAVI with respect to LNC were 9.44 and 3.08, and the sensitivity indices were 0.0671 and 0.1979 respectively. The RVI index was regarded as the most suitable index for LNC estimation. 4) The TCARI/OSAVI and RVI indices performed well in accuracy test, and the RVI index was more excellent in remote sensing mapping based on the GF-1 satellite image. Taking all factors into consideration, we believed the model based on the RVI index was optimal for LNC estimation with the determination coefficient of 0.6. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Fusion is a technique that enables the merging of two satellite cameras: panchromatic and multi-spectral, to produce higher quality satellite images to address agricurtural and vegetation issues such as soiling, floods and crop harvesting. Recent studies show Chebyshev polynomials to be effective in image fusion mainly in medium to high noise conditions, as per real-life satellite conditions. However, its application was limited to heuristics. In this research, we have proposed a way to adaptively select the optimal CPA parameters according to user specifications. Support vector machines (SVM) is used as a classifying tool to estimate the noise parameters, from which the appropriate CPA degree is utilised to perform image fusion according to a look-up table. Performance evaluation affirms the approach’s ability in reducing the computational complexity to perform fusion. Overall, adaptive CPA fusion is able to optimize an image fusion system’s resources and processing time. It therefore may be suitably incorporated onto real hardware for use on vegetation satellite imagery. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

The probable reasons for not having accurate and transparent statistics on Indian agronomy would be the existing inadequate facilities, unstable mechanism, and sluggish government functionaries. With the advent of remote sensing technologies, researchers are optimistic towards addressing such problems. It would be great challenge to classify multi-spectral satellite images due to its complexity, processing skills, and classification. The reviews on problems and prospects of supervised and unsupervised classification techniques, is highlighted in this paper. Literatures stated that one of such statistical learning model is support vector machine algorithm, which reveals to be the best suitable algorithm for vegetation discrimination using remote sensing images.

The approach aims at investigating improvement corners on SVM classification for estimating agricultural area using remote sensing data and explores futuristic research in this domain too.

Although a number of methods for producing mosaics has been proposed, most of them are dependent on the order in which tiles to normalized are presented to the algorithm and suffer from loss of input scenes' variance which can substantially reduce the carbon credits. In this study we propose a variance-preserving mosaic (VPM) algorithm that considers all images at the same time, minimizes overall error of the normalization and aims to preserve average variance of input images.

This paper introduces an approach, which exploits local spatial information between the pixel and its neighbors to compute the membership degree by using an interval type-2 fuzzy clustering algorithm, called IIT2-FCM.

Hyperspectral imagers, currently available on airborne platforms, provide increased spectral resolution over existing space based sensors that can document detailed information on the distribution of land cover classes, sometimes species level. Development of spectral library for land cover classes is a key component needed to facilitate advance analytical techniques to monitor land cover changes. Different land cover classes in Samara were sampled to create a common spectral library for mapping landscape from remotely sensed data. The development of these libraries provides a physical basis for interpretation that is less subject to conditions of specific data sets, to facilitate a global approach to the application of hyperspectral imagers to mapping landscape.

Automatic detection and removal of clouds which hide significant information in the image is an important task in remote sensing. Hence, our aim is to detect clouds and restore the missing information in order to make the image ready for further analysis and applications. Due to the difference in nature and appearance, thick and thin clouds are dealt separately. Thick cloud is detected using an efficient Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm, while thin cloud is detected using a simple region growing technique. In order to reconstruct the missing pixels, we utilize the prior knowledge about the statistics of the specific image class. Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)-based image model is obtained using a set of training images. Missing area in the image is restored after an iterative projection operation and gradient descent algorithm. In short, an image lying out of the modelled image space is iteratively modified to obtain the restored image and that would be in the image space according to the obtained nonlinear low-dimensional and sparse KPCA image model. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, a thorough experimental analysis on FORMOSAT multi-spectral images is done using MATLAB platform. When compared to the two recent existing techniques, our proposed method is superior and makes a promising tool for thick and thin cloud removal in multi-spectral satellite images. © 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","algorithm; automation; cloud cover; detection method; fuzzy mathematics; image analysis; information processing; principal component analysis; reconstruction; remote sensing; satellite imagery; software","Cloud removal; Image modelling; KPCA; Remote sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961255253"

RASAT and Göktürk-2 satellites are still operational and continuously acquire images of the Earth. Their images are processed before sharing with end users. Pansharpening, at which high resolution pan and low resolution multi-spectral images are fused, is an important step in image processing chain. As the resolution and number of images increase, pansharpening of satellite images take considerable amount of time. Multithread programming and General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming implementation improve performance of image processing applications, where most operations carried out on individual pixels. In this paper, we compared pansharpening applications and their CPU and GPU implementations for RASAT images. GPU implementations of pansharpening algorithms provides 20-25 times speed-up compared to CPU implementations. © 2015 IEEE.","Multitasking; Program processors; Satellites; Spectroscopy; CUDA; Earth observation satellites; Image processing applications; Image processing chains; Multispectral images; Multithread programming; Pan-sharpening; RASAT; Image processing","CUDA; GPU; image processing; pansharpening; RASAT","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959875967"

For the same reasons, it's not advisable the use of classical aerial photogrammetry, so it was obvious to think to the use of multispectral Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Nowadays VHR satellite images resolutions are very near airborne photogrammetrical images and usually they are acquired in multispectral mode. The combination of the various bands of the images is called pan-sharpening and it can be carried on using different algorithms and strategies. The correct pansharpening methodology, for a specific image, must be chosen considering the specific multispectral characteristics of the satellite used and the particular application. In this paper a first definition of guidelines for the use of VHR multispectral imagery to detect monument destruction in unsafe area, is reported. The proposed methodology, agreed with UNESCO and soon to be used in Libya for the coastal area, has produced a first report delivered to the Iraqi authorities. Some of the most evident examples are reported to show the possible capabilities of identification of damages using VHR images.","Damage detection; Historic preservation; Photogrammetry; Remote sensing; Satellites; Iraq; Multi-spectral; Nineveh; Pan-sharpening; Very high resolution; WorldView-3; Satellite imagery","Iraq; Multispectral; Nineveh; Pan sharpening; Remote sensing; Very high resolution (VHR); WorldView-3","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020751938"

This work is carried on as part of the obstacle risk assessment and risk mitigation operations in the aviation security context. Specifically, this paper presents a novel methodology to change detection (CD) in pairs of high resolution (HR) ortho-rectified multi-spectral satellite images acquired on the same geographical area at different times. Within this framework, orograph-ic/topographic changes potentially associated with variations in the obstacles to air navigation in wide areas are addressed. In fact, the developed CD strategy consists in a pre-screening technique offering a low-cost and fast solution to strongly reduce the terrain area to be deeply investigated through more expensive very HR imagery or/and detailed ground surveys. © 2015 IEEE.","","Change detection; multi-spectral imagery; photogrammetry","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962485213"

In the visible range MSI measures radiance with 10 m resolution at 490, 560 and 665 nm; with 20 m resolution at 705 nm; and with 60 m resolution at 443 nm.

Unfortunately, more often than not, decision boundaries derived in this manner do not extrapolate well from one image to another. This happens for several reasons, most having to do with the fact that different satellite images correspond to different view angles on the earth's surface, different sun angles, different seasons, and so on. In this paper, we get around these limitations of the current state-of-the-art by first proposing a new integrated representation for all of the images, overlapping and non-overlapping, that cover a large geographic ROI (Region of Interest). In addition to helping understand the data variability in the images, this representation also makes it possible to create the ground truth that can be used for ROI-based wide-area learning of the classifiers. We use this integrated representation in a new Bayesian framework for data classification that is characterized by: (1) learning of the decision boundaries from a sampling of all the satellite data available for an entire geographic ROI; (2) probabilistic modeling of within-class and between-class variations, as opposed to the more traditional probabilistic modeling of the “feature vectors” extracted from the measurement data; and (3) using variance-based ML (maximum-likelihood) and MAP (maximum a posteriori) classifiers whose decision boundary calculations incorporate all of the multi-view data for a geographic point if that point is selected for learning and testing. We show results with the new classification framework for an ROI in Chile whose size is roughly 10,000 square kilometers. This ROI is covered by 189 satellite images with varying degrees of overlap. We compare the classification performance of the proposed ROI-based framework with the results obtained by extrapolating the decision boundaries learned from a single image to the entire ROI. Using a 10-fold cross-validation test, we demonstrate significant increases in the classification accuracy for five of the six land-cover classes. In addition, we show that our variance based Bayesian classifier outperforms a traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach to classification for four out of six classes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Classification (of information); Extrapolation; Image segmentation; Maximum likelihood; Satellites; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Classification accuracy; Classification framework; Classification performance; Integrated representations; Land cover classification; Multi-spectral imagery; Probabilistic modeling; Satellite imagery","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992299640"
