It is commonly assumed that radar pulses from satellite-mounted Ku-band altimeters penetrate through the snow and reflect from the snow-ice interface. We would therefore expect a negative correlation between snow accumulation and radar freeboard measurements, as increased snow loading weighs the ice floe down. In this study we produce daily resolution radar freeboard products from the CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 altimeters via a recently developed optimal interpolation scheme. We find statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between radar freeboard anomalies and modeled snow accumulation. This suggests that, in the period after snowfall, radar pulses are not scattering from the snow-ice interface as commonly assumed. Our results offer satellite-based evidence of winter Ku-band radar scattering above the snow-ice interface, violating a key assumption in sea ice thickness retrievals. © 2023.

Current spatio-temporal resolution of radar freeboard is limited as 30ĝ€¯d are required in order to generate pan-Arctic coverage from CryoSat-2 and 27ĝ€¯d are required from Sentinel-3 satellites. This therefore hinders our ability to understand physical processes that drive sea ice thickness variability on sub-monthly timescales. In this study we exploit the consistency between CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-3B radar freeboards in order to produce daily gridded pan-Arctic freeboard estimates between December 2018 and April 2019. We use the Bayesian inference approach of Gaussian process regression to learn functional mappings between radar freeboard observations in space and time and to subsequently retrieve pan-Arctic freeboard as well as uncertainty estimates. We also employ an empirical Bayesian approach towards learning the free (hyper)parameters of the model, which allows us to derive daily estimates related to radar freeboard spatial and temporal correlation length scales. The estimated daily radar freeboard predictions are, on average across the 2018-2019 season, equivalent to CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards to within 1ĝ€¯mm (standard deviationsĝ€¯<6ĝ€¯cm), and cross-validation experiments show that errors in predictions are, on average, ≤ĝ€¯4ĝ€¯mm across the same period. We also demonstrate the improved temporal variability of a pan-Arctic daily product by comparing time series of the predicted freeboards, with 31ĝ€¯d running means from CryoSat-2 and Sentinel-3 freeboards, across nine sectors of the Arctic, as well as making comparisons with daily ERA5 snowfall data. Pearson correlations between daily radar freeboard anomalies and snowfall are as high as +0.52 over first-year ice and +0.41 over multi-year ice, suggesting that the estimated daily fields are able to capture real physical radar freeboard variability at sub-weekly timescales.  © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic Ocean; Satellites; Bayesian analysis; CryoSat; observational method; satellite data; sea ice; Sentinel","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108713285"

To improve sea ice thickness retrieval, a new method was developed to match the Cryosat‐2 radar waveform. Additionally, an automated sea ice drift detection scheme was developed and tested on Sentinel‐1 data, and the sea ice drifty capability of Gaofen‐4 geostationary optical data was evaluated. A second topic included implementation and validation of a prototype of a Fully‐Focussed SAR processor adapted for Sentinel‐3 and Sentinel‐6 altimeters and evaluation of its performance with Sentinel‐3 data over the Yellow Sea; the assessment of sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH), and wind speed measurements using different altimeters and CFOSAT SWIM; and the fusion of SSH measurements in mapping sea level anomaly (SLA) data to detect mesoscale eddies. Thirdly, the investigations on the retrieval of SSS include simulations to analyse the performances of the Chinese payload configurations of the Interferometric Microwave Radiometer and the Microwave Imager Combined Active and Passive, SSS retrieval under rain conditions, and the combination of active and passive microwave to study extreme winds. © 2021 by the authors.
