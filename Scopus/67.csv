However, depending on instrumentation, parameters related to BC such as aerosol absorption coefficient (babs) have been measured instead. Most ground-based measurements of babs in the Arctic have been made by filter-based absorption photometers, including particle soot absorption photometers (PSAPs), continuous light absorption photometers (CLAPs), Aethalometers, and multi-Angle absorption photometers (MAAPs). The measured babs can be converted to mass concentrations of BC (MBC) by assuming the value of the mass absorption cross section (MAC; MBCCombining double low lineg babs/g MAC). However, the accuracy of conversion of babs to MBC has not been adequately assessed. Here, we introduce a systematic method for deriving MAC values from babs measured by these instruments and independently measured MBC. In this method, MBC was measured with a filter-based absorption photometer with a heated inlet (COSMOS). COSMOS-derived MBC (MBC (COSMOS)) is traceable to a rigorously calibrated single particle soot photometer (SP2), and the absolute accuracy of MBC (COSMOS) has been demonstrated previously to be about 15g % in Asia and the Arctic. The necessary conditions for application of this method are a high correlation of the measured babs with independently measured MBC and long-Term stability of the regression slope, which is denoted as MACcor (MAC derived from the correlation). In general, babs-MBC (COSMOS) correlations were high (r2Combining double low lineg 0.76-0.95 for hourly data) at Alert in Canada, Ny-Ålesund in Svalbard, Barrow (NOAA Barrow Observatory) in Alaska, Pallastunturi in Finland, and Fukue in Japan and stable for up to 10 years. We successfully estimated MACcor values (10.8-15.1g m2g g-1 at a wavelength of 550g nm for hourly data) for these instruments, and these MACcor values can be used to obtain error-constrained estimates of MBC from babs measured at these sites even in the past, when COSMOS measurements were not made. Because the absolute values of MBC at these Arctic sites estimated by this method are consistent with each other, they are applicable to the study of spatial and temporal variation in MBC in the Arctic and to evaluation of the performance of numerical model calculations. © 2021 The Author(s).","Alaska; Alert; Arctic; Asia; Barrow; Canada; Canada; Ellesmere Island; Finland; Japan; Nunavut; Queen Elizabeth Islands; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; United States; absorption; black carbon; cross section; deposition; emission; instrumentation; photometer; transportation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117602721"

This includes the U.S. Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System ReAnalysis version 1 (NAAPS-RA v1), the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service ReAnalysis (CAMSRA). Spaceborne remote-sensing retrievals of AOD are considered from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Ground-based data include sun photometer data from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites and oceanic Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) measurements. Aerosol reanalysis AODs and spaceborne retrievals show consistent climatological spatial patterns and trends for both spring and summer seasons over the lower Arctic (60-70N). Consistent AOD trends are also found for the high Arctic (north of 70° N) from reanalyses. The aerosol reanalyses yield more consistent AOD results than climate models, can be verified well with AERONET, and corroborate complementary climatological and trend analysis. Speciated AODs are more variable than total AOD among the three reanalyses and a little more so for March-May (MAM) than for June-August (JJA). Black carbon (BC) AOD in the Arctic comes predominantly from biomass burning (BB) sources in both MAM and JJA, and BB overwhelms anthropogenic sources in JJA for the study period. AOD exhibits a multi-year negative MAM trend and a positive JJA trend in the Arctic during 2003-2019, due to an overall decrease in sulfate/anthropogenic pollution and a significant JJA increase in BB smoke. Interannual Arctic AOD variability is significantly large, driven by fine-mode and, specifically, BB smoke, with both smoke contribution and interannual variation larger in JJA than in MAM. It is recommended that climate models should account for BB emissions and BB interannual variabilities and trends in Arctic climate change studies. © 2022 Peng Xian et al.","aerosol composition; aerosol formation; climate modeling; optical depth; polarization; summer; trend analysis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135626010"

GEOS-Chem is a chemical transport model driven by assimilated meteorological data that is used to probe a variety of scientific questions related to atmospheric composition, including the role of biomass burning. This paper presents the development and implementation of a new global biomass burning emissions injection scheme in the GEOS-Chem model. The new injection scheme is based on monthly gridded Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) global plume-height stereoscopic observations in 2008. To provide specific examples of the impact of the model updates, we compare the output from simulations with and without the new MISR-based injection height scheme to several sets of observations from regions with active fires. Our comparisons with Arctic Research on the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) aircraft observations show that the updated injection height scheme can improve the ability of the model to simulate the vertical distribution of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and carbon monoxide (CO) over North American boreal regions in summer. We also compare a simulation for October 2010 and 2011 to vertical profiles of CO over the Amazon Basin. When coupled with larger emission factors for CO, a simulation that includes the new injection scheme also better matches selected observations in this region. Finally, the improved injection height improves the simulation of monthly mean surface CO over California during July 2008, a period with large fires. © Author(s) 2018.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054976253"

Snow liquid-water and its melt/refreeze are retrieved from microwave antenna temperatures measured with the ground-based L-band radiometer ELBARA-III. The emission model (EM) used in the retrieval is a two-layer configuration of the 'L-Band Specific Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpack'. Consistent snow wetness retrievals were achieved from both single-and multi-Angle CR observations of L-band antenna temperatures. This suggests that multi-Angle observation is not a pre-requisite for snow wetness retrieval. Therefore, in addition to soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) multi-Angle measurements, snow wetness can be estimated from spaceborne L-band brightness temperatures measured at a single observation angle, such as from NASA's SMAP satellite. Our results provide partial validation of a recently presented snow wetness retrieval approach based on the same EM and applied over Greenland using multi-Angle SMOS brightness temperatures. Agreement between measured CR antenna temperatures and SMOS brightness temperatures is found to be within the 95% confidence intervals of ELBARA-III and SMOS measurement uncertainties. Our measurements confirm the modeled response of antenna temperatures to diurnal variations of snow wetness. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

Field reflectance data were acquired with an ASD FieldSpec (305-1075 nm) and used to simulate CHRIS Mode1 spectra (411-997 nm). Multi-angle measurements were taken corresponding to CHRIS view zenith angles (VZA) (-55°, -36°, 0°, +36°, +55°). Empirical modelling compared parametric regression based on vegetation indices (VIs) to non-parametric Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR). In physical modelling, PROSAIL was inverted using numerical optimization and look-up table (LUT) approaches. Cross-validation of the empirical models ranked GPR as best, followed by simple ratio (SR) with optimally selected NIR and red wavelengths, and then ROSAVI using its published wavelengths (mean r2                         cv = 0.62, 0.58, and 0.54, respectively across all sites, variables, and VZAs). However, the best predictive performance was achieved by SR followed by GPR and ROSAVI (NRMSEcv = 0.12, 0.16, 0.16, respectively). PROSAIL simulated the multi-angle top-of-canopy reflectance well with numerical optimization (r2 = ~0.99, RMSE = 0.004 ± 0.002), but best performing LUT models of LCC, CCC and PAI were poorer than the empirical approaches (mean r2 = 0.48, mean NRMSE = 0.22). PROSAIL performed best at the high Arctic sparsely vegetated site (r2 = 0.57-0.86 for all parameters). Overall, the best performing VZA was -55° for empirical modelling and 0° and ±55° for physical modelling; however, these were not significantly better than the other VZAs. Overall, this study demonstrates that, for Arctic vegetation, nadir narrowband reflectance data used to derive simple empirical VIs with optimally selected bands is a more efficient approach for modelling chlorophyll and PAI than more complex empirical and physical approaches. © 2020 by the authors.","Chlorophyll; Forestry; Optimization; Reflection; Table lookup; Vegetation; Bioclimatic gradients; Gaussian processes regressions (GPR); Hyperspectral sensors; Numerical optimizations; Parametric regression; Physical approaches; Predictive performance; Vegetation properties; Learning to rank","Arctic ecosystems; Empirical modelling; Field spectroscopy; Inversion; Multi-angle spectroscopy; Physical modelling; Plant traits; Vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092268471"

High-resolution roughness estimates from airborne laser measurements are limited in spatial and temporal coverage while pan-Arctic satellite roughness does not extend over multi-decadal timescales. Launched on the Terra satellite in 1999, the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument acquires optical imagery from nine near-simultaneous camera view zenith angles. Extending on previous work to model surface roughness from specular anisotropy, a training dataset of cloud-free angular reflectance signatures and surface roughness, defined as the standard deviation of the within-pixel lidar elevations, from near-coincident operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne laser data is generated and is modelled using support vector regression (SVR) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel selected. Blocked k-fold cross-validation is implemented to tune hyperparameters using grid optimisation and to assess model performance, with an (Formula presented.) (coefficient of determination) of 0.43 and MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.041 m. Product performance is assessed through independent validation by comparison with unseen similarly generated surface-roughness characterisations from pre-IceBridge missions (Pearson’s r averaged over six scenes, r = 0.58, p < 0.005), and with AWI CS2-SMOS sea-ice thickness (Spearman’s rank, (Formula presented.) = 0.66, p < 0.001), a known roughness proxy.

Very low aerosol concentrations prevailed during the campaign, which posed a challenge for the instruments' detection capabilities. The campaign provided a real-world test for different absorption measurement techniques supporting the goals of the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) Black Carbon (BC) project in developing aerosol absorption standard and reference methods. In this study we compare the results from five filter-based absorption techniques - aethalometer models AE31 and AE33, a particle soot absorption photometer (PSAP), a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP), and a continuous soot monitoring system (COSMOS) - and from one indirect technique called extinction minus scattering (EMS). The ability of the filter-based techniques was shown to be adequate to measure aerosol light absorption coefficients down to around 0.01g¯Mm-1 levels when data were averaged to 1-2g¯h. The hourly averaged atmospheric absorption measured by the reference MAAP was 0.09g¯Mm-1 (at a wavelength of 637g¯nm). When data were averaged for >1g¯h, the filter-based methods agreed to around 40g¯%. COSMOS systematically measured the lowest absorption coefficient values, which was expected due to the sample pre-treatment in the COSMOS inlet. PSAP showed the best linear correlation with MAAP (slopeCombining double low line0.95, R2Combining double low line0.78), followed by AE31 (slopeCombining double low line0.93). A scattering correction applied to PSAP data improved the data accuracy despite the added noise. However, at very high scattering values the correction led to an underestimation of the absorption. The AE31 data had the highest noise and the correlation with MAAP was the lowest (R2Combining double low line0.65). Statistically the best linear correlations with MAAP were obtained for AE33 and COSMOS (R2 close to 1), but the biases at around the zero values led to slopes clearly below 1. The sample pre-treatment in the COSMOS instrument resulted in the lowest fitted slope. In contrast to the filter-based techniques, the indirect EMS method was not adequate to measure the low absorption values found at the Pallas site. The lowest absorption at which the EMS signal could be distinguished from the noise was >0.1g¯Mm-1 at 1-2g¯h averaging times. The mass absorption cross section (MAC) value measured at a range 0-0.3g¯Mm-1 was calculated using the MAAP and a single particle soot photometer (SP2), resulting in a MAC value of 16.0±5.7g¯m2g-1. Overall, our results demonstrate the challenges encountered in the aerosol absorption measurements in pristine environments and provide some useful guidelines for instrument selection and measurement practices. We highlight the need for a calibrated transfer standard for better inter-comparability of the absorption results. © Author(s) 2021.","Arctic; Finland; Lappi [Finland]; Pallas; absorption coefficient; aerosol; concentration (composition); COSMOS; cross section; detection method; instrumentation; monitoring system; wavelength","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112210463"

Global climate change exhibits diversity characteristics on both temporal and spatial scales. Since the Moon-based earth observation platform could provide large-scale, multi-angle, and long-term measurements complementary to the satellite-based Earth observation data, it is necessary to study the observation characteristics of this new platform. With deepening understanding of Moon-based observations, we have seen its good observation ability in the middle and low latitudes of the Earth's surface, but for polar regions, we need to further study the observation characteristics of this platform. Based on the above objectives, we used the Moon-based Earth observation geometric model to quantify the geometric relationship between the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Assuming the sensor is at the center of the nearside of the Moon, the coverage characteristics of the earth feature points are counted. The observation intervals, access frequency, and the angle information of each point during 100 years were obtained, and the variation rule was analyzed. The research showed that the lunar platform could carry out ideal observations for the polar regions. For the North and South poles, a continuous observation duration of 14.5 days could be obtained, and as the latitude decreased, the duration time was reduced to less than one day at the latitude of 65ff in each hemisphere. The dominant observation time of the North Pole is concentrated from mid-March to mid-September, and for the South Pole, it is the rest of the year, and as the latitude decreases, it extends outward from both sides.

This study also proves that the Moon-based observation has multi-angle observation advantages for the Arctic and the Antarctic areas, which can help better understand large-scale geoscientific phenomena.

Previous studies using remote sensing to model Arctic vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties have generally involved empirical modelling with nadir looking broadband sensors and have typically been conducted at the field scale in one study area. Satellite hyperspectral remote sensing has not been previously investigated for retrieving leaf and canopy biochemical and biophysical properties of Arctic vegetation across multiple sites using either empirical or physically-based modelling approaches. Furthermore, multi-angle hyperspectral sensors (CHRIS/PROBA), which can provide insight into vegetation reflectance anisotropy and potentially improve vegetation parameter estimation, have also not been investigated for this purpose. In this study, three modelling approaches previously investigated with field spectroscopy data (Kennedy et al., 2020) were used with CHRIS Mode-1 imagery to predict leaf chlorophyll content, plant area index and canopy chlorophyll content across a bioclimatic gradient in the Western Canadian Arctic. Modelling approaches included: parametric linear regression based on vegetation indices (VI), non-parametric machine learning Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model using a look-up table approach (LUT). CHRIS imagery was acquired with −55◦, −36◦, 0◦, +36◦, +55◦ view zenith angles (VZA) between 2011 and 2014 over three field sites extending from the Richardson Mountains in central Yukon, Canada to the north end of Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. Field measurements were acquired within several weeks of satellite acquisitions. GPR had the best model fit (mean cross-validated (cv ) coefficient of determination, r2 cv = 0.61 across all vegetation variables, sites and VZAs vs. 0.59 for the simple ratio, SR) and predictive performance (normalized root mean square error, NRMSEcv = 0.13 vs. 0.14 for SR). The revised optimized soil adjusted VI (ROSAVI) performance was slightly poorer (r2 cv = 0.51; NRMSEcv = 0.15). The physically-based PROSAIL model performed poorer than all empirical models (r2 = 0.50; NRMSE = 0.18). This ranking of model performance is similar to that found in the previous field spectroscopy study, where empirical model fits and predictive performance were only slightly worse. With respect to view angle performance, NRMSE varied only slightly, indicating no distinct advantage for any one VZA. Overall, strong potential has been demonstrated for empirical modelling of Arctic vegetation chlorophyll and plant area index using hyperspectral data combined with band selection/optimization procedures in the Arctic. Recently launched and future hyperspectral satellites, including next generation airborne sensors, will likely provide improvements to the model performance reported here. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of energy efficiency of ice-going ships. Firstly, a data-driven model based on neural network theory is developed to predict the energy efficiency of ships in the Arctic. Then, a route with optimum energy efficiency is presented, intended to cut costs and be as environmentally friendly as possible. Finally, a case study is carried out to analyze the performance of a case study ship sailing at various environmental conditions. The results indicate that when planning the route for such an Arctic ship, it would be shortsighted only to focus on distance rather than energy efficiency. Moreover, the model shows good agreement between the simulation and real-life navigation. It is expected that the construction of this multi-angle, energy efficiency optimization model could help to improve Arctic navigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic Ocean; Navigation; Optimization; Ships; Comprehensive analysis; Data-driven model; Energy efficiency analysis; Energy efficiency optimizations; Energy efficient; Environmental conditions; Optimization modeling; Route planning; artificial neural network; energy efficiency; merchant ship; model; navigation; optimization; transportation planning; Energy efficiency","Arctic navigation; Optimization model; Route planning; Ship energy efficiency","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067263440"

The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI. Linear regression models are created for the estimation of FYI and MYI roughness from NDAI, and FYI roughness from backscatter. Results suggest that using a combination of Sentinel-1 backscatter for FYI and MISR NDAI for MYI may be optimal for mapping winter sea-ice roughness in the CAA. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

We have developed a method for mapping sea ice surface roughness using angular reflectance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness < 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice. Because of its coarser spatial scale, MISR-estimated roughness data have a variance about half that of ATM roughness data. © 2019 by the authors.","","MISR; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059938096"

We present an evaluation of changes in tall shrub (>0.5 m) fractional cover on the North Slope of Alaska between 2000 and 2010, using a new mapping approach that uses satellite imagery from the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor, ancillary topographic and geographic variables, derived Ross-Li Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) kernel (scattering function) weights, and a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model. After training and validating the BRT model, 10 predictor variables explained 53% of the variation in tall shrub fractional cover. The isotropic kernel weight from the BRDF model, topographic slope, nadir camera red reflectance, and latitude were the variables that contributed to the model the most as they were used more frequently to generate the regression trees. At a spatial resolution of 250 m, predicted tall shrub fractional cover on the North Slope ranged from 0.00 to 0.21 (RMSE = 0.03), with the vast majority of sites having fractional cover <0.02. High shrub fractional cover values were predicted along floodplains, creeks, and sloped terrain. Temporal comparisons of estimated tall shrub abundance indicated that shrubs expanded during the period 2000–2010. The extent of the area that experienced a change in tall shrub fractional cover >0.06 was <1% (808 km2) of the total area of the North Slope of Alaska (176,524 km2). Tall shrubs may have expanded throughout a larger area but there is insufficient precision in the MISR-based estimates to make an indisputable determination. Nevertheless, 94% of the locations that exhibited a robust change showed a positive trend toward an increase in shrub cover.

The non-refractory composition data from the AMS were measured during three intensive measurements campaigns in autumn 2012, 2014 and 2016, whereas the continuous long-term measurements on equivalent black carbon were conducted in 2012–2017. According to observations, the highest concentrations of particulate organics, sulphate, ammonium and black carbon originated from western parts of Russia and Eastern Europe, whereas Central Europe showed lesser contribution. In addition, exceptionally high concentrations of sulphate and ammonium were associated with the Timan-Pechora basin located in north-western Russia. Assumingly, this phenomenon could be linked to intensive gas flaring activities taking place in the area. We also performed positive matrix factorization analysis of organic fraction measured by the AMS. The trajectory analysis revealed increased concentration fields (CF) for low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosol (LVOOA) and hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA) in the same areas as for sulphate and ammonium. Meanwhile, the CF of semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) suggested a local origin. To summarize, our results suggest that Western Russia and Eastern Europe are the most important source regions of several long-range transported aerosol constituents for Eastern Finland. Besides influencing the air quality and aerosol chemical composition on a local scale, these regions may also play a crucial role as the pollutants are transported further north, towards the vulnerable Arctic region. © Tellus B: 2020. © 2020 The Author(s).

Average measured concentrations were about 0.067 ± 0.071 for the winter and 0.011 ± 0.009 for the summer period. These data were obtained using a multi-angle absorption photometer (MAAP). A similar seasonal pattern was found for sulfate concentrations with a maximum level during winter and spring analyzed by ion chromatography. Here, measured average concentrations were about 0.485 ± 0.397 for the winter and 0.112 ± 0.072 for the summer period. A correlation between EBC and sulfate concentrations was observed over the years 2011 to 2013 stating a correlation coefficient of R2 Combining double low line 0.72. This finding gives the hint that most likely transport of primary emitted BC particles to the Arctic was accompanied by aging of the aerosols through condensational processes. BC and sulfate are known to have only partly similar sources with respect to their transport pathways when reaching the high Arctic. Aging processes may have led to the formation of secondary inorganic matter and further transport of BC particles as cloud processing and further washout of particles is less likely based on the typically observed transport patterns of air masses arriving at VRS. Additionally, concentrations of EC (elemental carbon) based on a thermo-optical method were determined and compared to EBC measurements. EBC measurements were generally higher, but a correlation between EC and EBC resulted in a correlation coefficient of R2 Combining double low line 0.64. Model estimates of the climate forcing due to BC in the Arctic are based on contributions of long-range transported BC during spring and summer. The measured concentrations were here compared with model results obtained by the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model, DEHM. Good agreement between measured and modeled concentrations of both EBC/BC and sulfate was observed. Also, the correlation between BC and sulfate concentrations was confirmed based on the model results observed over the years 2011 to 2013 stating a correlation coefficient of R2 Combining double low line 0.74.

Arctic-wide maps that represent spatial patterns of sea ice roughness can be used to better characterize spatial patterns of ice convergence and divergence processes. Sea ice surface roughness can also control and quantify turbulent exchange between sea ice surface and atmosphere and therefore influence surface energy balance at the basin scale. We have developed a data processing system that produces georeferenced sea ice roughness rasters that can be mosaicked to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness. This approach starts with Top-of-Atmosphere radiance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We used red-band angular data from three MISR cameras (Ca, Cf, An). We created a training data set in which MISR pixels were matched with co-located and concurrent lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We used a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with the training data to calibrate the multi-angle data to values of surface roughness and then applied the algorithm to Arctic-wide MISR data for two 16-day periods in April (spring) and July (summer). After georeferencing the roughness rasters, we then mosaicked each 16-day roughness dataset to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness for spring and summer. Assessment of the results shows good agreement with independent ATM roughness data, not used in model development. A preliminary exploration of spatial and seasonal changes in sea ice roughness for two locations shows the ability to characterize the roughness of different ice types and the results align with previous studies. This processing system and its data products can help the sea ice research community to gain insights into the seasonal and interannual changes in sea ice roughness over the Arctic. © 2022 by the authors.","Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Surface roughness; Data-processing system; Ice age; Ice convergences; Ice surface roughness; Ice surfaces; Ice thickness; Influence surfaces; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Remote-sensing; Spatial patterns; Remote sensing","MISR; remote sensing; sea ice; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140027596"

The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC), which photographs hydrometeors in freefall from three different angles while simultaneously measuring their fall speed, has been used in the field at multiple midlatitude and polar locations both with and without wind shielding. Here, we present an analysis of Arctic field observations-with and without a Belfort double Alter shield-and compare the results to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the airflow and corresponding particle trajectories around the unshielded MASC. MASC-measured fall speeds compare well with Ka-band Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Zenith Radar (KAZR) mean Doppler velocities only when winds are light (= 5ms-1) and the MASC is shielded. MASC-measured fall speeds that do not match KAZR-measured velocities tend to fall below a threshold value that increases approximately linearly with wind speed but is generally < 0:5ms-1. For those events with wind speeds = 1:5ms-1, hydrometeors fall with an orientation angle mode of 12° from the horizontal plane, and large, low-density aggregates are as much as 5 times more likely to be observed. Simulations in the absence of a wind shield show a separation of flow at the upstream side of the instrument, with an upward velocity component just above the aperture, which decreases the mean particle fall speed by 55 % (74 %) for a wind speed of 5ms-1 (10ms-1). We conclude that accurate MASC observations of the microphysical, orientation, and fall speed characteristics of snow particles require shielding by a double wind fence and restriction of analysis to events where winds are light (= 5ms-1). Hydrometeors do not generally fall in still air, so adjustments to these properties' distributions within natural turbulence remain to be determined. © 2021 Author(s).
