When multiresolution imagery is collected simultaneously, high quality spatial and spectral image fusion techniques can be applied to the different sensor field of views that helps to improve detection of earth surface features and targets. Multispectral imagery fused with hyperspectral imagery described and results shown in this paper indicates the ability to detect subsurface water features along Florida littoral zones and coastal water regions. The use of multiresolution imaging from the same remote sensing platform provides a valuable approach for detecting sun glint regions and reflectance due to water wave facets and the presence of breaking waves. In littoral regions along Space Coast Florida and the Indian River Lagoon, surface bidirectional reflectance increases 5-6 times the background water surface reflectance, making typical water column constituent estimation questionable. The detection of the influence of surface water gravity waves can be modeled or easily detected using ground sampling distances or spatial resolutions less than or near 0.3 m. Spatial resolutions of approximately one meter or greater do not allow suitable detection of pixels affected by water waves. Satellite imagery based directional reflectance using ground sampling distance greater than 1 meter is contaminated by water wave facet reflection, breaking waves and sun glint effects. Thus bio-geophysical variables such as chlorophyll pigments, suspended matter, dissolved organic matter and light attenuation depths are biased. This bias effect can only be estimated reliably by using small spatial resolution imagery with knowledge gained from analytical and Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling and multiresolution fused imagery. Application of transferable remote sensing algorithms for water quality applications require bidirectional reflectance corrections for water waves, sun glint, and wave facet effects. Example high quality WorldView-3 multispectral and panchromatic clearly shows the water wave facet reflectance effects that is imbedded into larger GSD imagery of water regions and littoral zones and as shown in hyperspectral Monte Carlo model results. © Copyright 2018 SPIE.","Biological materials; Coastal zones; Feature extraction; Hydrophilicity; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Monte Carlo methods; Radiative transfer; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Space optics; Spectroscopy; Surface waters; Water quality; Water waves; coastal; Dissolved organic matters; Ground sampling distances; HyperSpectral; Multi-spectral; Remote sensing algorithms; Spatial resolution imagery; Surface bidirectional reflectances; Remote sensing","coastal; hyperspectral; image fusion; Monte Carlo; multispectral; radiative transfer; water quality","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056485855"

The locality preserving fusion arises from two-fold, i.e., the local characterization in both spatial and feature domains. We commence by simultaneously learning a projection matrix, which preserves spatial localities, and a similarity matrix, which encodes feature similarities. We map the pixels of multi-source images by the projection matrix to a set fusion vectors that preserve spatial localities of the image. On the other hand, by applying the Laplacian eigen-decomposition to the similarity matrix, we obtain another set of fusion vectors that preserve the feature local similarities. We concatenate the fusion vectors for both spatial and feature locality preservation and obtain the fusion image. Finally, we classify the fusion image pixels by a novel sliding ensemble strategy, which enhances the locality preservation in classification. Our locality preserving fusion framework is effective in classifying multi-source sea-ice images (e.g., multi-spectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images) because it not only comprehensively captures the spatial neighboring relationships but also intrinsically characterizes the feature associations between different types of sea-ices. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our framework. © 2019, Chinese Society for Oceanography and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","","ensemble classification; multi-source image fusion; sea-ice classification","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068752284"

Its monitoring has become a routine task for the maritime sector. Remote sensing, which depends mainly on SAR and optical sensors, has become the primary means for sea-ice research. Optical images contain abundant sea-ice multi-spectral information, whereas SAR images contain rich sea-ice texture information. If the characteristic advantages of SAR and optical images could be combined for sea-ice study, the ability of sea-ice monitoring would be improved. In this study, in accordance with the characteristics of sea-ice SAR and optical images, the transformation and fusion methods for these images were chosen. Also, a fusion method of optical and SAR images was proposed in order to improve sea-ice identification. Texture information can play an important role in sea-ice classification. Haar wavelet transformation was found to be suitable for the sea-ice SAR images, and the texture information of the sea-ice SAR image from Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) loaded on ENVISAT was documented. The results of our studies showed that, the optical images in the hue-intensity-saturation (HIS) space could reflect the spectral characteristics of the sea-ice types more efficiently than in the red-green-blue (RGB) space, and the optical image from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-02B) was transferred from the RGB space to the HIS space. The principal component analysis (PCA) method could potentially contain the maximum information of the sea-ice images by fusing the HIS and texture images. The fusion image was obtained by a PCA method, which included the advantages of both the sea-ice SAR image and the optical image. To validate the fusion method, three methods were used to evaluate the fused image, i.e., objective, subjective, and comprehensive evaluations. It was concluded that the fusion method proposed could improve the ability of image interpretation and sea-ice identification. © 2015, The Chinese Society of Oceanography and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","","HIS transform; optical remote sensing image; PCA method; SAR remote sensing image; sea ice; wavelet transform","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924975294"

The use of radar fusion images for sea ice concentration calculation could get more accurate and reliable results than the estimations by artificial observation method. The drawing of sea ice risk heat map and contour map was helpful to quickly grasp the current near-field sea ice risk distributions. Considering the concentration of sea ices and the degree of yaw, the proposed course decision method in ice area could obtain the appropriate course angle. After collecting the marine radar and ice radar images of the polar research icebreaker Xuelong 2 during the maiden voyage to Antarctica, the experimental results of dense ice field and sparse ice field show that the proposed near-field sea ice perception and course decision method may obtain the risk distributions of near-field sea ice and give the appropriate course change suggestions to provide effective support for the safety of polar autonomous navigation. © 2022, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

To solve this problem, a technique based on the fusion of optical image and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image for the extraction of sea ice is proposed in this paper. The Band 2 (B2) image of Sentinel-2 (S2) in the research area is selected as optical image data. Preprocessing on the optical image, such as resampling, projection transformation and format conversion, are conducted to the S2 dataset before fusion. Imaging characteristics of the sea ice have been analyzed, and a new deep learning (DL) model, OceanTDL5, is built to detect sea ices. The fusion of the Sentinel-1 (S1) and S2 images is realized by solving the optimal pixel values based on deriving Poisson Equation. The experimental results indicate that the use of a fused image improves the accuracy of sea ice detection compared with the use of a single data source. The fused image has richer spatial details and a clearer texture compared with the original optical image, and its material sense and color are more abundant. © 2021, Ocean University of China, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","","image fusion; optical image; Poisson Equation; SAR image; sea ice detection","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103348455"

Sea ice classification is an important part of sea ice detection. Hyperspectral imagery and multispectral imagery contain rich spectral information and spatial information and provide important data support for sea ice classification. At present, most sea ice classification methods mainly focus on shallow learning based on spectral features, and the good performance of the deep learning method in remote sensing image classification provides a new idea for sea ice classification. However, the level of deep learning is limited due to the influence of input size in sea ice image classification, and the deep features in the image cannot be fully mined, which affects the further improvement of sea ice classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes an image classification method based on multilevel feature fusion using residual network. First, the PCA method is used to extract the first principal component of the original image, and the residual network is used to deepen the number of network layers. The FPN, PAN, and SPP modules increase the mining between layer and layer features and merge the features between different layers to further improve the accuracy of sea ice classification. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, sea ice classification experiments were performed on the hyperspectral image of Bohai Bay in 2008 and the multispectral image of Bohai Bay in 2020. The experimental results show that compared with the algorithm with fewer layers of deep learning network, the method proposed in this paper utilizes the idea of residual network to deepen the number of network layers and carries out multilevel feature fusion through FPN, PAN, and SPP modules, which effectively solves the problem of insufficient deep feature extraction and obtains better classification performance.  © 2021 Yanling Han et al.","Classification (of information); Disasters; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Network layers; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Spectroscopy; Bohai Bay; Bohai Sea; Classification methods; Economic development; Features fusions; Ice disaster; Images classification; Multilevels; Remote-sensing; Sea ice classification; Learning systems","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116670023"

Then, using the fused radar images, this study proposes a set of near-field sea ice risk assessment and warning processes applicable to both low-and high-sea-ice-concentration situations. The sea ice risk indexes in these two situations are constructed by using four variables: sea ice area, sea ice grayscale, distance between sea ice and the own-ship, and relative bearing of sea ice and the own-ship. Finally, visualization processing is carried out according to the size of the risk index values of each piece of sea ice to achieve a better near-field sea ice risk assessment and warning effect. According to the example demonstration results, through the radar image fusion process and the set of near-field sea ice risk assessment and warning processes proposed in this study, the sea ice risk distribution in the near-field area of the ship can be well obtained, which provides effective support for the assisted deci-sion-making of autonomous navigation in the polar region. © 2022 by the authors.

Sea ice image classification is an important component of sea ice detection. Optical data contain rich spectral information, but they do not allow one to easily distinguish between ground objects with a similar spectrum and foreign objects with the same spectrum. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data contain rich texture information, but the data usually have a single source. The limitation of single-source data is that they do not allow for further improvements of the accuracy of remote sensing sea ice classification. In this paper, we propose a method for sea ice image classification based on deep learning and heterogeneous data fusion. Utilizing the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in terms of depth feature extraction, we designed a deep learning network structure for SAR and optical images and achieve sea ice image classification through feature extraction and a feature-level fusion of heterogeneous data. For the SAR images, the improved spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network was used and texture information on sea ice at different scales was extracted by depth. For the optical data, multi-level feature information on sea ice such as spatial and spectral information on different types of sea ice was extracted through a path aggregation network (PANet), which enabled low-level features to be fully utilized due to the gradual feature extraction of the convolution neural network. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two sets of heterogeneous sentinel satellite data were used for sea ice classification in the Hudson Bay area. The experimental results show that compared with the typical image classification methods and other heterogeneous data fusion methods, the method proposed in this paper fully integrates multi-scale and multi-level texture and spectral information from heterogeneous data and achieves a better classification effect (96.61%, 95.69%). © 2021 by the authors.
