The Normalized Difference Angular Index (NDAI) roughness proxy derived from MISR, and backscatter from Sentinel-1 are intercompared. NDAI and backscatter are also compared to surface roughness derived from an airborne LiDAR track covering a subset of FYI and MYI (no DFYI). Overall, NDAI and backscatter are significantly positively correlated when all ice type samples are considered. When individual ice types are evaluated, NDAI and backscatter are only significantly correlated for DFYI. Both NDAI and backscatter are correlated with LiDAR-derived roughness (r = 0.71 and r = 0.74, respectively). The relationship between NDAI and roughness is greater for MYI than FYI, whereas for backscatter and ice roughness, the relationship is greater for FYI than MYI. Linear regression models are created for the estimation of FYI and MYI roughness from NDAI, and FYI roughness from backscatter. Results suggest that using a combination of Sentinel-1 backscatter for FYI and MISR NDAI for MYI may be optimal for mapping winter sea-ice roughness in the CAA. &copy; 2020 The Author(s).

High-resolution roughness estimates from airborne laser measurements are limited in spatial and temporal coverage while pan-Arctic satellite roughness does not extend over multi-decadal timescales. Launched on the Terra satellite in 1999, the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument acquires optical imagery from nine near-simultaneous camera view zenith angles. Extending on previous work to model surface roughness from specular anisotropy, a training dataset of cloud-free angular reflectance signatures and surface roughness, defined as the standard deviation of the within-pixel lidar elevations, from near-coincident operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne laser data is generated and is modelled using support vector regression (SVR) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel selected. Blocked k-fold cross-validation is implemented to tune hyperparameters using grid optimisation and to assess model performance, with an (Formula presented.) (coefficient of determination) of 0.43 and MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.041 m. Product performance is assessed through independent validation by comparison with unseen similarly generated surface-roughness characterisations from pre-IceBridge missions (Pearson’s r averaged over six scenes, r = 0.58, p < 0.005), and with AWI CS2-SMOS sea-ice thickness (Spearman’s rank, (Formula presented.) = 0.66, p < 0.001), a known roughness proxy. We present a derived sea-ice roughness product at 1.1 km resolution (2000–2020) over the seasonal period of OIB operation and a corresponding time-series analysis. Both our instantaneous swaths and pan-Arctic monthly mosaics show considerable potential in detecting surface-ice characteristics such as deformed rough ice, thin refrozen leads, and polynyas. © 2022 by the authors.","NASA; Optical radar; Radial basis function networks; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Time series analysis; Arctic sea ice; Climate studies; Crucial parameters; Ice surface roughness; Icebridge; Melt ponds; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Oceanographic study; Pan-Arctic; Support vector regressions; Surface roughness","icebridge; multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer; sea ice; support vector regression; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144825486"

We have developed a method for mapping sea ice surface roughness using angular reflectance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). Using an empirical data modeling approach, we derived estimates of Arctic sea ice roughness ranging from centimeters to decimeters within the MISR 275-m pixel size. Using independent ATM data for validation, we find that histograms of lidar and multi-angular roughness values were nearly identical for areas with a roughness < 20 cm, but for rougher regions, the MISR-estimated roughness had a narrower range of values than the ATM data. The algorithm was able to accurately identify areas that transition between smooth and rough ice. Because of its coarser spatial scale, MISR-estimated roughness data have a variance about half that of ATM roughness data. © 2019 by the authors.","","MISR; Remote sensing; Sea ice; Surface roughness","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059938096"

Compared with the traditional remote sensing which only views the ground surface in one direction, multi-angle remote sensing provides angle-dimensional information and improves the capability of obtaining vegetation structure parameters. It helps to improve the retrieval accuracy of key biophysical parameters and provides better data support for the research of ecological environment and climate change. After a detailed analysis of the publications in multi-angle remote sensing, we summarize the basic concepts, characteristics, advantages and developments of multi-angle remote sensing. Multi-angle remote sensing platforms vary from ground-based, airborne to spaceborne observation equipment. The first ground-based observation equipment appeared in 1952. All the ground-based equipment is classified as the fixed field of view mode or the changeable field of view mode. For the airborne or spaceborne platforms, only the fixed field of view mode is acceptable due to the heterogeneity of the land surfaces. With the development of UAV technique, the airborne multi-angle remote sensing is becoming more and more popular due to its flexibility and high spatial resolution. The multi-angle models play important roles in parameters inversion. Classic multi-angle remote sensing models include radiative transfer models, geometric optical models, hybrid models, and computer simulation models. They are all physical models which are developed based on some assumptions and theoretical analysis. Semi-empirical models combine the advantages of the empirical model and the physical model, as a result, they are simple and stable in inversion. The most widely used semi-empirical model is the linear kernel driven model used by the operational MODIS BRDF/albedo products algorithm. With the development of observing equipment and models, multi-angle remote sensing is widely used in many applications. Due to the anisotropic reflection characteristic, land surface albedo can only be retrieved by multi-angle remote sensing with high accuracy. Multi-angle remote sensing shows great potentials in vegetation structural parameters inversion which include the clumping index, LAI, FVC profile and canopy height. It has been found to be superior in vegetation type identification than the traditional vertical observation. Multi-angle remote sensing is also very useful in the cloud and aerosol parameters retrieval, such as the cloud albedo, height and types, as well as the aerosol optical depth and shapes. Large difference of optical scattering between the cloud and ice/snow in different viewing directions makes the identification of these covers easier with multi-angle remote sensing. The sea ice roughness can also be retrieved by multi-angle observations. In the last of this paper, we put forward the prospects of multi-angle optical quantitative remote sensing. As the multi-angle remote sensing observation data based on spaceborne, airborne, and ground platforms become more and more abundant, the main research direction of multi-angle remote sensing in the future should focus on the following aspects: developing multi-angle reflection/radiation models for complex surfaces, enhancing the preprocessing capabilities of multi-angle remote sensing data, and promoting the comprehensive abilities of multi-source data integration in application, etc. © 2021, Science Press.

One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22. The best performing set will be implemented operationally in the next V23 MISR AOD product release. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Antarctica; Aerosols; Atmospheric aerosols; Cameras; Clouds; Lenses; Light scattering; Luminance; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Sea ice; Stray light; Aerosol optical depths; Internal reflections; Light coefficient; Maritime aerosols; MODIS; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Operational retrievals; Spectro-radiometers; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; correction; light; light effect; light scattering; MISR; model; optical depth; reflectivity; remote sensing; wavelength; Air pollution","Air pollution; remote sensing; spectroradiometers; stray light","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038858480"

The two Harmony satellites will fly in a reconfigurable formation with Sentinel-1D. Both will be equipped with a multi-angle thermal infrared sensor and a passive radar receiver, which receives the reflected Sentinel-1D signals using two antennas. During the lifetime of the mission, two different formations will be flown. In the stereo formation, the Harmony satellites will fly approximately 300km in front and behind Sentinel-1, which allows for the estimation of instantaneous sea-ice drift vectors. We demonstrate that the addition of instantaneous sea-ice drift estimates on top of the daily integrated values from feature tracking have benefits in terms of interpretation, sampling and resolution. The wide-swath instantaneous drift observations of Harmony also help to put high-temporal-resolution instantaneous buoy observations into a spatial context. Additionally, it allows for the extraction of deformation parameters, such as shear and divergence. As a result, Harmony's data will help to improve sea-ice statistics and parametrizations to constrain sea-ice models. In the cross-track interferometry (XTI) mode, Harmony's satellites will fly in close formation with an XTI baseline to be able to estimate surface elevations. This will allow for improved estimates of sea-ice volume and also enables the retrieval of full, two-dimensional swell-wave spectra in sea-ice-covered regions without any gaps. In stereo formation, the line-of-sight diversity allows the inference of swell properties in both directions using traditional velocity bunching approaches. In XTI mode, Harmony's phase differences are only sensitive to the ground-range direction swell. To fully recover two-dimensional swell-wave spectra, a synergy between XTI height spectra and intensity spectra is required. If selected, the Harmony mission will be launched in 2028.  © 2021 Marcel Kleinherenbrink et al.","Satellites; abundance estimation; detection method; estimation method; measurement method; radar; sea ice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109380130"

MISR deploys nine cameras each at different view angles, which allow a near-simultaneous angular sampling of the surface anisotropy. This is particularly important to measure the near-instantaneous albedo of dynamic surface features such as clouds or sea ice. However, MISR's cloud mask over snow or sea ice is not yet sufficiently robust because MISR's spectral bands are only located in the visible and the near infrared. To overcome this obstacle, we performed data fusion using a specially processed MISR sea ice albedo product (that was generated at Langley Research Center using Rayleigh correction) combining this with a cloud mask of a sea ice mask product, MOD29, which is derived from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is also, like MISR, onboard the Terra satellite. The accuracy of the MOD29 cloud mask has been assessed as > 90% due to the fact that MODIS has a much larger number of spectral bands and covers a much wider range of the solar spectrum. Four daily sea ice products have been created, each with a different averaging time window (24 h, 7 days, 15 days, 31 days). For each time window, the number of samples, mean and standard deviation of MISR cloud-free sea ice albedo is calculated. These products are publicly available on a predefined polar stereographic grid at three spatial resolutions (1 km, 5 km, 25 km). The time span of the generated sea ice albedo covers the months between March and September of each year from 2000 to 2016 inclusive. In addition to data production, an evaluation of the accuracy of sea ice albedo was performed through a comparison with a dataset generated from a tower based albedometer from NOAA/ESRL/GMD/GRAD. This comparison confirms the high accuracy and stability of MISR's sea ice albedo since its launch in February 2000. We also performed an evaluation of the day-of-year trend of sea ice albedo between 2000 and 2016, which confirm the reduction of sea ice shortwave albedo with an order of 0.4-1%, depending on the day of year and the length of observed time window. © 2018 by the authors.","Calibration; Climate change; Data fusion; Infrared devices; Radiometers; Solar radiation; Spectrometers; Albedo; Langley research centers; Mean and standard deviations; MISR; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Spatial resolution; Surface anisotropy; Sea ice","Albedo; Calibration; Climate change; MISR; MODIS, Sea ice","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059942496"

Basal melting under ice shelves has been increasingly well constrained in recent work, but changes in iceberg calving rates remain poorly quantified. Here we examine the processes that precede iceberg calving, and focus on initiation and propagation of ice-shelf rifts. Using satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), we monitored five active rifts on the Amery Ice Shelf, Antarctica, from 2002 to 2014. We found a strong seasonal component: propagation rates were highest during (austral) summer and nearly zero during winter. We found substantial variability in summer propagation rates, but found no evidence that the variability was correlated with large-scale environmental drivers, such as atmospheric temperature, winds or sea-ice concentration. We did find a positive correlation between large propagation events and the arrival of tsunamis in the region. The variability appears to be related to visible structural boundaries within the ice shelf, e.g. suture zones or crevasse fields. This suggests that a complete understanding of rift propagation and iceberg calving needs to consider local heterogeneities within an ice shelf. © 2015, International Glaciology Society.

Arctic-wide maps that represent spatial patterns of sea ice roughness can be used to better characterize spatial patterns of ice convergence and divergence processes. Sea ice surface roughness can also control and quantify turbulent exchange between sea ice surface and atmosphere and therefore influence surface energy balance at the basin scale. We have developed a data processing system that produces georeferenced sea ice roughness rasters that can be mosaicked to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness. This approach starts with Top-of-Atmosphere radiance data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). We used red-band angular data from three MISR cameras (Ca, Cf, An). We created a training data set in which MISR pixels were matched with co-located and concurrent lidar-derived roughness measurements from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM). We used a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with the training data to calibrate the multi-angle data to values of surface roughness and then applied the algorithm to Arctic-wide MISR data for two 16-day periods in April (spring) and July (summer). After georeferencing the roughness rasters, we then mosaicked each 16-day roughness dataset to produce Arctic-wide maps of sea ice roughness for spring and summer. Assessment of the results shows good agreement with independent ATM roughness data, not used in model development. A preliminary exploration of spatial and seasonal changes in sea ice roughness for two locations shows the ability to characterize the roughness of different ice types and the results align with previous studies. This processing system and its data products can help the sea ice research community to gain insights into the seasonal and interannual changes in sea ice roughness over the Arctic. © 2022 by the authors.","Data handling; Nearest neighbor search; Satellite imagery; Sea ice; Spectrometers; Surface roughness; Data-processing system; Ice age; Ice convergences; Ice surface roughness; Ice surfaces; Ice thickness; Influence surfaces; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Remote-sensing; Spatial patterns; Remote sensing","MISR; remote sensing; sea ice; surface roughness","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140027596"

In this paper, we introduce the University College London (UCL) MAGiGAN super-resolution restoration (SRR) system based on multi-angle feature restoration and deep SRR networks. We explore the application of MAGiGAN SRR to a set of 9 MISR red band images (275 m) to produce up to a factor of 3.75 times resolution enhancement. We show SRR results over four different test sites containing different types of image content including urban and rural targets, sea ice and a cloud field. Different image metrics are introduced to assess the overall SRR performance, and these are employed to compare the SRR results with the original MISR input images and higher resolution Landsat images, where available. Significant resolution improvement over various types of image content is demonstrated and the potential of SRR for different scientific application is discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep learning; Image reconstruction; Image resolution; Optical resolving power; Restoration; Sea ice; Urban growth; Adversarial networks; Feature matching; Gotcha; MISR; Super-resolution restoration; Image enhancement","Deep learning; Feature matching; GAN; Generative adversarial network; Gotcha; GPT; MISR; SRR; Super-resolution restoration","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059950995"
