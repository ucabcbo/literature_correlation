  Data","  In machine learning based single image super-resolution, the degradation
model is embedded in training data generation. However, most existing satellite
image super-resolution methods use a simple down-sampling model with a fixed
kernel to create training images. These methods work fine on synthetic data,
but do not perform well on real satellite images. We propose a realistic
training data generation model for commercial satellite imagery products, which
includes not only the imaging process on satellites but also the post-process
on the ground. We also propose a convolutional neural network optimized for
satellite images. Experiments show that the proposed training data generation
model is able to improve super-resolution performance on real satellite images.

  Satellite Images","  The major drawbacks with Satellite Images are low resolution, Low resolution
makes it difficult to identify the objects present in Satellite images. We have
experimented with several deep models available for Single Image
Superresolution on the SpaceNet dataset and have evaluated the performance of
each of them on the satellite image data. We will dive into the recent
evolution of the deep models in the context of SISR over the past few years and
will present a comparative study between these models. The entire Satellite
image of an area is divided into equal-sized patches. Each patch will be used
independently for training. These patches will differ in nature. Say, for
example, the patches over urban areas have non-homogeneous backgrounds because
of different types of objects like vehicles, buildings, roads, etc. On the
other hand, patches over jungles will be more homogeneous in nature. Hence,
different deep models will fit on different kinds of patches. In this study, we
will try to explore this further with the help of a Switching Convolution
Network. The idea is to train a switch classifier that will automatically
classify a patch into one category of models best suited for it.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00878v1,2020,"Fusion of Deep and Non-Deep Methods for Fast Super-Resolution of
  Satellite Images","  In the emerging commercial space industry there is a drastic increase in
access to low cost satellite imagery. The price for satellite images depends on
the sensor quality and revisit rate. This work proposes to bridge the gap
between image quality and the price by improving the image quality via
super-resolution (SR). Recently, a number of deep SR techniques have been
proposed to enhance satellite images. However, none of these methods utilize
the region-level context information, giving equal importance to each region in
the image. This, along with the fact that most state-of-the-art SR methods are
complex and cumbersome deep models, the time taken to process very large
satellite images can be impractically high. We, propose to handle this
challenge by designing an SR framework that analyzes the regional information
content on each patch of the low-resolution image and judiciously chooses to
use more computationally complex deep models to super-resolve more
structure-rich regions on the image, while using less resource-intensive
non-deep methods on non-salient regions. Through extensive experiments on a
large satellite image, we show substantial decrease in inference time while
achieving similar performance to that of existing deep SR methods over several
evaluation measures like PSNR, MSE and SSIM.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04098v3,2018,"The Effects of Super-Resolution on Object Detection Performance in
  Satellite Imagery","  We explore the application of super-resolution techniques to satellite
imagery, and the effects of these techniques on object detection algorithm
performance. Specifically, we enhance satellite imagery beyond its native
resolution, and test if we can identify various types of vehicles, planes, and
boats with greater accuracy than native resolution. Using the Very Deep
Super-Resolution (VDSR) framework and a custom Random Forest Super-Resolution
(RFSR) framework we generate enhancement levels of 2x, 4x, and 8x over five
distinct resolutions ranging from 30 cm to 4.8 meters. Using both native and
super-resolved data, we then train several custom detection models using the
SIMRDWN object detection framework. SIMRDWN combines a number of popular object
detection algorithms (e.g. SSD, YOLO) into a unified framework that is designed
to rapidly detect objects in large satellite images. This approach allows us to
quantify the effects of super-resolution techniques on object detection
performance across multiple classes and resolutions. We also quantify the
performance of object detection as a function of native resolution and object
pixel size. For our test set we note that performance degrades from mean
average precision (mAP) = 0.53 at 30 cm resolution, down to mAP = 0.11 at 4.8 m
resolution. Super-resolving native 30 cm imagery to 15 cm yields the greatest
benefit; a 13-36% improvement in mAP. Super-resolution is less beneficial at
coarser resolutions, though still provides a small improvement in performance.

  neural networks","  Super-resolution aims at increasing image resolution by algorithmic means and
has progressed over the recent years due to advances in the fields of computer
vision and deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks based on a variety of
architectures have been applied to the problem, e.g. autoencoders and residual
networks. While most research focuses on the processing of photographs
consisting only of RGB color channels, little work can be found concentrating
on multi-band, analytic satellite imagery. Satellite images often include a
panchromatic band, which has higher spatial resolution but lower spectral
resolution than the other bands. In the field of remote sensing, there is a
long tradition of applying pan-sharpening to satellite images, i.e. bringing
the multispectral bands to the higher spatial resolution by merging them with
the panchromatic band. To our knowledge there are so far no approaches to
super-resolution which take advantage of the panchromatic band. In this paper
we propose a method to train state-of-the-art CNNs using pairs of
lower-resolution multispectral and high-resolution pan-sharpened image tiles in
order to create super-resolved analytic images. The derived quality metrics
show that the method improves information content of the processed images. We
compare the results created by four CNN architectures, with RedNet30 performing
best.

adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder
whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this
study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote
sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a
theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and
reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is
not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are
not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action
variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling.
We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free
environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze
the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote
sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement
over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a
reinforcement learning framework.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06697v1,2019,On training deep networks for satellite image super-resolution,"  The capabilities of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR)---techniques for
enhancing image spatial resolution---have been recently improved significantly
by the use of deep convolutional neural networks. Commonly, such networks are
learned using huge training sets composed of original images alongside their
low-resolution counterparts, obtained with bicubic downsampling. In this paper,
we investigate how the SRR performance is influenced by the way such
low-resolution training data are obtained, which has not been explored up to
date. Our extensive experimental study indicates that the training data
characteristics have a large impact on the reconstruction accuracy, and the
widely-adopted approach is not the most effective for dealing with satellite
images. Overall, we argue that developing better training data preparation
routines may be pivotal in making SRR suitable for real-world applications.

  Network","  Multi-image super-resolution, which aims to fuse and restore a
high-resolution image from multiple images at the same location, is crucial for
utilizing satellite images. The satellite images are often occluded by
atmospheric disturbances such as clouds, and the position of the disturbances
varies by the images. Many radiometric and geometric approaches are proposed to
detect atmospheric disturbances. Still, the utilization of detection results,
i.e., quality maps in deep learning was limited to pre-processing or
computation of loss. In this paper, we present a quality map-associated
attention network (QA-Net), an architecture that fully incorporates QMs into a
deep learning scheme for the first time. Our proposed attention modules process
QMs alongside the low-resolution images and utilize the QM features to
distinguish the disturbances and attend to image features. As a result, QA-Net
has achieved state-of-the-art results in the PROBA-V dataset.

used in medical imaging, satellite imaging, target recognition, etc. In this
paper, we conduct continuous modeling and assume that the unknown image
intensity function is defined on a continuous domain and belongs to a space
with a redundant basis. We propose a new iterative model for single image
super-resolution based on an observation: an image is consisted of smooth
components and non-smooth components, and we use two classes of approximated
Heaviside functions (AHFs) to represent them respectively. Due to sparsity of
the non-smooth components, a $L_{1}$ model is employed. In addition, we apply
the proposed iterative model to image patches to reduce computation and
storage. Comparisons with some existing competitive methods show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

and degradation monitoring. For a precise quantification of forest land cover
changes, the availability of spatially fine resolution data is a necessity.
Since 1972, NASAs LANDSAT Satellites are providing terrestrial images covering
every corner of the earth, which have been proved to be a highly useful
resource for terrestrial change analysis and have been used in numerous other
sectors. However, freely accessible satellite images are, generally, of medium
to low resolution which is a major hindrance to the precision of the analysis.
Hence, we performed a comprehensive study to prove our point that, enhancement
of resolution by Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) will
lessen the chance of misclassification of pixels, even under the established
recognition methods. We tested the method on original LANDSAT-7 images of
different regions of Sundarbans and their upscaled versions which were produced
by bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, and SRCNN respectively and it
was discovered that SRCNN outperforms the others by a significant amount.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02745v2,2022,MuS2: A Real-World Benchmark for Sentinel-2 Multi-Image Super-Resolution,"  Insufficient image spatial resolution is a serious limitation in many
practical scenarios, especially when acquiring images at a finer scale is
infeasible or brings higher costs. This is inherent to remote sensing,
including Sentinel-2 satellite images that are available free of charge at a
high revisit frequency, but whose spatial resolution is limited to 10 m ground
sampling distance. The resolution can be increased with super-resolution
algorithms, in particular when performed from multiple images captured at
subsequent revisits of a satellite, taking advantage of information fusion that
leads to enhanced reconstruction accuracy. One of the obstacles in multi-image
super-resolution consists in the scarcity of real-world benchmarks - commonly,
simulated data are exploited which do not fully reflect the operating
conditions. In this paper, we introduce a new MuS2 benchmark for
super-resolving multiple Sentinel-2 images, with WorldView-2 imagery used as
the high-resolution reference. Within MuS2, we publish the first end-to-end
evaluation procedure for this problem which we expect to help the researchers
in advancing the state of the art in multi-image super-resolution.

  Super-Resolution","  Many applications such as forensics, surveillance, satellite imaging, medical
imaging, etc., demand High-Resolution (HR) images. However, obtaining an HR
image is not always possible due to the limitations of optical sensors and
their costs. An alternative solution called Single Image Super-Resolution
(SISR) is a software-driven approach that aims to take a Low-Resolution (LR)

triplet-based adversarial loss function that exploits the information provided
in the LR image by using it as a negative sample. Allowing the patch-based
discriminator with access to both HR and LR images optimizes to better
differentiate between HR and LR images; hence, improving the adversary.
Further, we propose to fuse the adversarial loss, content loss, perceptual
loss, and quality loss to obtain Super-Resolution (SR) image with high
perceptual fidelity. We validate the superior performance of the proposed
method over the other existing methods on the RealSR dataset in terms of
quantitative and qualitative metrics.

methods for object detection in Remote Sensing (RS) images. In most cases, the
datasets for small object detection in remote sensing images are inadequate.
Many researchers used scene classification datasets for object detection, which
has its limitations; for example, the large-sized objects outnumber the small
objects in object categories. Thus, they lack diversity; this further affects
the detection performance of small object detectors in RS images. This paper
reviews current datasets and object detection methods (deep learning-based) for
remote sensing images. We also propose a large-scale, publicly available
benchmark Remote Sensing Super-resolution Object Detection (RSSOD) dataset. The
RSSOD dataset consists of 1,759 hand-annotated images with 22,091 instances of

exactly reproduce the low resolution inputs under 2D-average downsampling while
improving performance of the SR schemes. The method is demonstrated across

Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR), is the recovery of finer texture details
when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. This issue is particularly
related to the choice of the objective loss function. In particular, recent
works proposed the use of a VGG loss which consists in minimizing the error
between the generated high resolution images and ground-truth in the feature
space of a Convolutional Neural Network (VGG19), pre-trained on the very
""large"" ImageNet dataset. When considering the problem of super-resolving
images with a distribution ""far"" from the ImageNet images distribution
(\textit{e.g.,} satellite images), their proposed \textit{fixed} VGG loss is no
longer relevant. In this paper, we present a general framework named
\textit{Generative Collaborative Networks} (GCN), where the idea consists in
optimizing the \textit{generator} (the mapping of interest) in the feature
space of a \textit{features extractor} network. The two networks (generator and
extractor) are \textit{collaborative} in the sense that the latter ""helps"" the
former, by constructing discriminative and relevant features (not necessarily
\textit{fixed} and possibly learned \textit{mutually} with the generator). We
evaluate the GCN framework in the context of SISR, and we show that it results
in a method that is adapted to super-resolution domains that are ""far"" from the

http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08197v1,2019,"Lightweight and Robust Representation of Economic Scales from Satellite
  Imagery","  Satellite imagery has long been an attractive data source that provides a
wealth of information on human-inhabited areas. While super resolution
satellite images are rapidly becoming available, little study has focused on
how to extract meaningful information about human habitation patterns and
economic scales from such data. We present READ, a new approach for obtaining
essential spatial representation for any given district from high-resolution
satellite imagery based on deep neural networks. Our method combines transfer
learning and embedded statistics to efficiently learn critical spatial
characteristics of arbitrary size areas and represent them into a fixed-length
vector with minimal information loss. Even with a small set of labels, READ can
distinguish subtle differences between rural and urban areas and infer the
degree of urbanization. An extensive evaluation demonstrates the model
outperforms the state-of-the-art in predicting economic scales, such as
population density for South Korea (R^2=0.9617), and shows a high potential use
for developing countries where district-level economic scales are not known.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04310v2,2021,Context-self contrastive pretraining for crop type semantic segmentation,"  In this paper, we propose a fully supervised pre-training scheme based on
contrastive learning particularly tailored to dense classification tasks. The
proposed Context-Self Contrastive Loss (CSCL) learns an embedding space that
makes semantic boundaries pop-up by use of a similarity metric between every
location in a training sample and its local context. For crop type semantic
segmentation from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) we find performance at
parcel boundaries to be a critical bottleneck and explain how CSCL tackles the
underlying cause of that problem, improving the state-of-the-art performance in
this task. Additionally, using images from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite
missions we compile the largest, to our knowledge, SITS dataset densely
annotated by crop type and parcel identities, which we make publicly available
together with the data generation pipeline. Using that data we find CSCL, even
with minimal pre-training, to improve all respective baselines and present a
process for semantic segmentation at super-resolution for obtaining crop
classes at a more granular level. The code and instructions to download the
data can be found in https://github.com/michaeltrs/DeepSatModels.

  Material Label Transfer","  Urban material recognition in remote sensing imagery is a highly relevant,
yet extremely challenging problem due to the difficulty of obtaining human
annotations, especially on low resolution satellite images. To this end, we
propose an unsupervised domain adaptation based approach using adversarial
learning. We aim to harvest information from smaller quantities of high
resolution data (source domain) and utilize the same to super-resolve low
resolution imagery (target domain). This can potentially aid in semantic as
well as material label transfer from a richly annotated source to a target
domain.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02549v3,2017,Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Two-stream Fusion Network,"  Remote sensing image fusion (also known as pan-sharpening) aims at generating
high resolution multi-spectral (MS) image from inputs of a high spatial
resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution
multi-spectral image. Inspired by the astounding achievements of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) in a variety of computer vision tasks, in this paper, we
propose a two-stream fusion network (TFNet) to address the problem of
pan-sharpening. Unlike previous CNN based methods that consider pan-sharpening
as a super resolution problem and perform pan-sharpening in pixel level, the
proposed TFNet aims to fuse PAN and MS images in feature level and reconstruct
the pan-sharpened image from the fused features. The TFNet mainly consists of
three parts. The first part is comprised of two networks extracting features
from PAN and MS images, respectively. The subsequent network fuses them
together to form compact features that represent both spatial and spectral
information of PAN and MS images, simultaneously. Finally, the desired high
spatial resolution MS image is recovered from the fused features through an
image reconstruction network. Experiments on Quickbird and \mbox{GaoFen-1}
satellite images demonstrate that the proposed TFNet can fuse PAN and MS
images, effectively, and produce pan-sharpened images competitive with even
superior to state of the arts.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16644v1,2020,"Rethinking CNN-Based Pansharpening: Guided Colorization of Panchromatic
  Images via GANs","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based approaches have shown promising
results in pansharpening of satellite images in recent years. However, they
still exhibit limitations in producing high-quality pansharpening outputs. To
that end, we propose a new self-supervised learning framework, where we treat
pansharpening as a colorization problem, which brings an entirely novel
perspective and solution to the problem compared to existing methods that base
their solution solely on producing a super-resolution version of the
multispectral image. Whereas CNN-based methods provide a reduced resolution
panchromatic image as input to their model along with reduced resolution
multispectral images, hence learn to increase their resolution together, we
instead provide the grayscale transformed multispectral image as input, and
train our model to learn the colorization of the grayscale input. We further
address the fixed downscale ratio assumption during training, which does not
generalize well to the full-resolution scenario. We introduce a noise injection
into the training by randomly varying the downsampling ratios. Those two
critical changes, along with the addition of adversarial training in the
proposed PanColorization Generative Adversarial Networks (PanColorGAN)
framework, help overcome the spatial detail loss and blur problems that are
observed in CNN-based pansharpening. The proposed approach outperforms the
previous CNN-based and traditional methods as demonstrated in our experiments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01473v3,2020,Spatial Frequency Bias in Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks,"  As the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on natural images
quickly propels them into various real-life applications across different
domains, it becomes more and more important to clearly understand their
limitations. Specifically, understanding GANs' capability across the full
spectrum of spatial frequencies, i.e. beyond the low-frequency dominant
spectrum of natural images, is critical for assessing the reliability of GAN
generated data in any detail-sensitive application (e.g. denoising, filling and
super-resolution in medical and satellite images). In this paper, we show that
the ability of convolutional GANs to learn a distribution is significantly
affected by the spatial frequency of the underlying carrier signal, that is,
GANs have a bias against learning high spatial frequencies. Crucially, we show
that this bias is not merely a result of the scarcity of high frequencies in
natural images, rather, it is a systemic bias hindering the learning of high
frequencies regardless of their prominence in a dataset. Furthermore, we
explain why large-scale GANs' ability to generate fine details on natural
images does not exclude them from the adverse effects of this bias. Finally, we
propose a method for manipulating this bias with minimal computational
overhead. This method can be used to explicitly direct computational resources
towards any specific spatial frequency of interest in a dataset, extending the
flexibility of GANs.
