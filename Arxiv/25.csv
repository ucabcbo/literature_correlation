http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12590v1,2019,Assimilation of semi-qualitative sea ice thickness data with the EnKF-SQ,"  A newly introduced stochastic data assimilation method, the Ensemble Kalman
Filter Semi-Qualitative (EnKF-SQ) is applied to a realistic coupled ice-ocean
model of the Arctic, the TOPAZ4 configuration, in a twin experiment framework.
The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness
measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect
to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or
assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ
are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness
threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential
appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties
prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice
data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables,
lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is
adjusted for best performance of the system at hand. The sensitivity tests
reveal that the results do not depend critically on the choice of this tuning
parameter. The EnKF-SQ makes overall a valid approach for assimilating
semi-qualitative observations into high-dimensional nonlinear systems.
