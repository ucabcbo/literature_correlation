  illuminations","  Speckle based imaging consists of forming a super-resolved reconstruction of
an unknown sample from low-resolution images obtained under random
inhomogeneous illuminations (speckles). In a blind context where the
illuminations are unknown, we study the intrinsic capacity of speckle-based
imagers to recover spatial frequencies outside the frequency support of the
data, with minimal assumptions about the sample. We demonstrate that, under
physically realistic conditions, the covariance of the data has a
super-resolution power corresponding to the squared magnitude of the imager
point spread function. This theoretical result is important for many practical
imaging systems such as acoustic and electromagnetic tomographs, fluorescence
and photoacoustic microscopes, or synthetic aperture radar imaging. A numerical
validation is presented in the case of fluorescence microscopy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06958v1,2022,Two-dimensional gridless super-resolution method for ISAR imaging,"  We are focused on improving the resolution of images of moving targets in
Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging. This could be achieved by
recovering the scattering points of a target that have stronger reflections
than other target points, leading to increasing the higher Radar Cross Section
(RCS) of a target. These points, however, are sparse and when the received data
is incomplete, moving targets would not be properly recognizable in ISAR
images. To increase the resolution in ISAR imaging, we propose the
2-Dimensional Reweighted Trace Minimization (2D-RWTM) method to retrieve
frequencies of sparse scattering points in both range and cross-range
directions. This method is a gridless super-resolution method, which does not
depend on fitting the scattering point on the grids, leading to less complexity
compared to the other methods. Using computer simulations, the proposed 2D-RWTM
is compared to the Atomic Norm Minimization (ANM) in terms of the Mean Squared
Errors (MSE). The results show that using the proposed method, the scattering
points of a target are successfully recovered. It is shown that by selecting
different weighting matrices and scattering points adjacent to each other, the
recovery in ISAR imaging is still successful.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00270v1,2016,"New wavelet-based superresolution algorithm for speckle reduction in SAR
  images","  This paper describes a novel projection algorithm, the Projection Onto Span
Algorithm (POSA) for wavelet-based superresolution and removing speckle (in
wavelet domain) of unknown variance from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.
Although the POSA is good as a new superresolution algorithm for image
enhancement, image metrology and biometric identification, here one will use it
like a tool of despeckling, being the first time that an algorithm of
super-resolution is used for despeckling of SAR images. Specifically, the
speckled SAR image is decomposed into wavelet subbands, POSA is applied to the
high subbands, and reconstruct a SAR image from the modified detail
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method compares
favorably to several other despeckling methods on test SAR images.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03232v1,2017,Performance Analysis of Convex LRMR based Passive SAR Imaging,"  Passive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) uses existing signals of opportunity
such as communication and broadcasting signals. In our prior work, we have
developed a low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR) method that can reconstruct scenes
with extended and densely distributed point targets, overcoming shortcomings of
conventional methods. The approach is based on correlating two sets of bistatic
measurements, which results in a linear mapping of the tensor product of the
scene reflectivity with itself. Recognizing this tensor product as a rank-one
positive semi-definite (PSD) operator, we pose passive SAR image reconstruction
as a LRMR problem with convex relaxation. In this paper, we present a
performance analysis of the convex LRMR-based passive SAR image reconstruction
method. We use the restricted isometry property (RIP) and show that exact
reconstruction is guaranteed under the condition that the pixel spacing or
resolution satisfies a certain lower bound. We show that for sufficiently large
center frequencies, our method provides superior resolution than that of
Fourier based methods, making it a super-resolution technique. Additionally, we
show that phaseless imaging is a special case of our passive SAR imaging
method. We present extensive numerical simulation to validate our analysis.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01759v1,2018,"A fast and accurate basis pursuit denoising algorithm with application
  to super-resolving tomographic SAR","  $L_1$ regularization is used for finding sparse solutions to an
underdetermined linear system. As sparse signals are widely expected in remote
sensing, this type of regularization scheme and its extensions have been widely
employed in many remote sensing problems, such as image fusion, target
detection, image super-resolution, and others and have led to promising
results. However, solving such sparse reconstruction problems is
computationally expensive and has limitations in its practical use. In this
paper, we proposed a novel efficient algorithm for solving the complex-valued
$L_1$ regularized least squares problem. Taking the high-dimensional
tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) as a practical example, we
carried out extensive experiments, both with simulation data and real data, to
demonstrate that the proposed approach can retain the accuracy of second order
methods while dramatically speeding up the processing by one or two orders.
Although we have chosen TomoSAR as the example, the proposed method can be
generally applied to any spectral estimation problems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08658v1,2018,Fast Super-resolution 3D SAR Imaging Using an Unfolded Deep Network,"  For 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, one typical approach is to
achieve the cross-track 1D focusing for each range-azimuth pixel after
obtaining a stack of 2D complex-valued images. The cross-track focusing is the
main difficulty as its aperture length is limited and the antenna positions are
usually non-uniformly distributed. Sparsity regularization methods are widely
used to tackle these problems. However, these methods are of obvious
limitations. The most well-known ones are their heavy computational burdens and
unsatisfied stabilities. In this letter, an efficient deep network-based
cross-track imaging method is proposed. When trained, the imaging process, i.e.
the forward propagation of the network, is made up of simple matrix-vector
calculations and element-wise nonlinearity operations, which significantly
speed up the imaging. Also, we find that the deep network is of good robustness
against noise and model errors. Comprehensive simulations and experiments have
been carried out, and the superiority of the proposed method can be clearly
seen.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00657v2,2020,"On Solving SAR Imaging Inverse Problems Using Non-Convex Regularization
  with a Cauchy-based Penalty","  Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery can provide useful information in a
multitude of applications, including climate change, environmental monitoring,
meteorology, high dimensional mapping, ship monitoring, or planetary
exploration. In this paper, we investigate solutions to a number of inverse
problems encountered in SAR imaging. We propose a convex proximal splitting
method for the optimization of a cost function that includes a non-convex
Cauchy-based penalty. The convergence of the overall cost function optimization
is ensured through careful selection of model parameters within a
forward-backward (FB) algorithm. The performance of the proposed penalty
function is evaluated by solving three standard SAR imaging inverse problems,
including super-resolution, image formation, and despeckling, as well as ship
wake detection for maritime applications. The proposed method is compared to
several methods employing classical penalty functions such as total variation
($TV$) and $L_1$ norms, and to the generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty.
We show that the proposed Cauchy-based penalty function leads to better image
reconstruction results when compared to the reference penalty functions for all
SAR imaging inverse problems in this paper.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15745v1,2022,"Super-resolving multiple scatterers detection in SAR Tomography assisted
  by correlation information","  This paper proposes a method for detecting multiple scatterers (targets) in
the elevation direction for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography. The
proposed method can resolve closely spaced targets through a twostep procedure.
In the first step, coarse detection is performed with a successive cancellation
scheme in which possible locations of targets are marked. Then, in the second
step, by searching in the reduced search space which is finely 10 gridded, the
accurate location of the targets is found. For estimating the actual number of
targets, a model order selection scheme is used in two cases of known and
unknown noise variance. Also, by analytical investigation of the probability of
detection for the proposed method, the effect of the influential parameters on
the detection ability is explicitly demonstrated. Compared to the
super-resolution methods based on compressed sensing (CS), the proposed method
has a lower computational cost and higher estimation accuracy, especially at
low signal-to-noise ratio regime. 15 Simulation results show the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of both 3D scatterer reconstruction and detection
ability

http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12091v1,2022,"Gridless Tomographic SAR Imaging Based on Accelerated Atomic Norm
  Minimization with Efficiency","  Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) enables the
reconstruction and three-dimensional (3D) localization of targets based on
multiple two-dimensional (2D) observations of the same scene. The resolving
along the elevation direction can be treated as a line spectrum estimation
problem. However, traditional super-resolution spectrum estimation algorithms
require multiple snapshots and uncorrelated targets. Meanwhile, as the most
popular TomoSAR imaging method in modern years, compressed sensing (CS) based
methods suffer from the gridding mismatch effect which markedly degrades the
imaging performance. As a gridless CS approach, atomic norm minimization can
avoid the gridding effect but requires enormous computing resources. Addressing
the above issues, this paper proposes an improved fast ANM algorithm to TomoSAR
elevation focusing by introducing the IVDST-ANM algorithm, which reduces the
huge computational complexity of the conventional time-consuming semi-positive
definite programming (SDP) by the iterative Vandermonde decomposition and
shrinkage-thresholding (IVDST) approach, and retains the benefits of ANM in
terms of gridless imaging and single snapshot recovery. We conducted
experiments using simulated data to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method, and reconstruction results of an urban area from the SARMV3D-Imaging
1.0 dataset are also presented.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02445v1,2022,TomoSAR-ALISTA: Efficient TomoSAR Imaging via Deep Unfolded Network,"  Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has attracted remarkable
interest for its ability in achieving three-dimensional reconstruction along
the elevation direction from multiple observations. In recent years, compressed
sensing (CS) technique has been introduced into TomoSAR considering for its
super-resolution ability with limited samples. Whereas, the CS-based methods
suffer from several drawbacks, including weak noise resistance, high
computational complexity and complex parameter fine-tuning. Among the different
CS algorithms, iterative soft-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) is widely used as a
robust reconstruction approach, however, the parameters in the ISTA algorithm
are manually chosen, which usually requires a time-consuming fine-tuning
process to achieve the best performance. Aiming at efficient TomoSAR imaging, a
novel sparse unfolding network named analytic learned ISTA (ALISTA) is proposed
towards the TomoSAR imaging problem in this paper, and the key parameters of
ISTA are learned from training data via deep learning to avoid complex
parameter fine-tuning and significantly relieves the training burden. In
addition, experiments verify that it is feasible to use traditional CS
algorithms as training labels, which provides a tangible supervised training
method to achieve better 3D reconstruction performance even in the absence of
labeled data in real applications.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04211v1,2021,"$\boldsymbolγ$-Net: Superresolving SAR Tomographic Inversion via
  Deep Learning","  Synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) has been extensively employed
in 3-D reconstruction in dense urban areas using high-resolution SAR
acquisitions. Compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms are generally
considered as the state of the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in
the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra
computational burdens, because of the sparse reconstruction, which cannot be
solved analytically and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative
solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving
TomoSAR inversion approach, $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net, to tackle this
challenge. $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned
iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative
optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height
estimate from a well-trained $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net approaches the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound while improving the computational efficiency by 1 to 2
orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also
shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the
state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more
computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically,
$\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-Net reaches more than $90\%$ detection rate in moderate
super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at
limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
second-order CS-based method by a fair margin. Test on real TerraSAR-X data
with just 6 interferograms also shows high-quality 3-D reconstruction with
high-density detected double scatterers.
