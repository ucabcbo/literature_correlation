http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04056v2,2022,"Exploiting Digital Surface Models for Inferring Super-Resolution for
  Remotely Sensed Images","  Despite the plethora of successful Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR)
models applied to natural images, their application to remote sensing imagery
tends to produce poor results. Remote sensing imagery is often more complicated
than natural images and has its peculiarities such as being of lower
resolution, it contains noise, and often depicting large textured surfaces. As
a result, applying non-specialized SRR models on remote sensing imagery results
in artifacts and poor reconstructions. To address these problems, this paper
proposes an architecture inspired by previous research work, introducing a
novel approach for forcing an SRR model to output realistic remote sensing
images: instead of relying on feature-space similarities as a perceptual loss,
the model considers pixel-level information inferred from the normalized
Digital Surface Model (nDSM) of the image. This strategy allows the application
of better-informed updates during the training of the model which sources from
a task (elevation map inference) that is closely related to remote sensing.
Nonetheless, the nDSM auxiliary information is not required during production
and thus the model infers a super-resolution image without any additional data
besides its low-resolution pairs. We assess our model on two remotely sensed
datasets of different spatial resolutions that also contain the DSM pairs of
the images: the DFC2018 dataset and the dataset containing the national Lidar
fly-by of Luxembourg. Based on visual inspection, the inferred super-resolution
images exhibit particularly superior quality. In particular, the results for
the high-resolution DFC2018 dataset are realistic and almost indistinguishable
from the ground truth images.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03879v1,2020,Monte-Carlo Siamese Policy on Actor for Satellite Image Super Resolution,"  In the past few years supervised and adversarial learning have been widely
adopted in various complex computer vision tasks. It seems natural to wonder
whether another branch of artificial intelligence, commonly known as
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can benefit such complex vision tasks. In this
study, we explore the plausible usage of RL in super resolution of remote
sensing imagery. Guided by recent advances in super resolution, we propose a
theoretical framework that leverages the benefits of supervised and
reinforcement learning. We argue that a straightforward implementation of RL is
not adequate to address ill-posed super resolution as the action variables are
not fully known. To tackle this issue, we propose to parameterize action
variables by matrices, and train our policy network using Monte-Carlo sampling.
We study the implications of parametric action space in a model-free
environment from theoretical and empirical perspective. Furthermore, we analyze
the quantitative and qualitative results on both remote sensing and non-remote
sensing datasets. Based on our experiments, we report considerable improvement
over state-of-the-art methods by encapsulating supervised models in a
reinforcement learning framework.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12547v1,2021,A new public Alsat-2B dataset for single-image super-resolution,"  Currently, when reliable training datasets are available, deep learning
methods dominate the proposed solutions for image super-resolution. However,
for remote sensing benchmarks, it is very expensive to obtain high spatial
resolution images. Most of the super-resolution methods use down-sampling
techniques to simulate low and high spatial resolution pairs and construct the
training samples. To solve this issue, the paper introduces a novel public
remote sensing dataset (Alsat2B) of low and high spatial resolution images (10m
and 2.5m respectively) for the single-image super-resolution task. The
high-resolution images are obtained through pan-sharpening. Besides, the
performance of some super-resolution methods on the dataset is assessed based
on common criteria. The obtained results reveal that the proposed scheme is
promising and highlight the challenges in the dataset which shows the need for
advanced methods to grasp the relationship between the low and high-resolution
patches.

  Feature Attention Deep Neural Networks","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been consistently proved
state-of-the-art results in image Super-Resolution (SR), representing an
exceptional opportunity for the remote sensing field to extract further
information and knowledge from captured data. However, most of the works
published in the literature have been focusing on the Single-Image
Super-Resolution problem so far. At present, satellite based remote sensing
platforms offer huge data availability with high temporal resolution and low
spatial resolution. In this context, the presented research proposes a novel
residual attention model (RAMS) that efficiently tackles the multi-image
super-resolution task, simultaneously exploiting spatial and temporal
correlations to combine multiple images. We introduce the mechanism of visual
feature attention with 3D convolutions in order to obtain an aware data fusion
and information extraction of the multiple low-resolution images, transcending
limitations of the local region of convolutional operations. Moreover, having
multiple inputs with the same scene, our representation learning network makes
extensive use of nestled residual connections to let flow redundant
low-frequency signals and focus the computation on more important
high-frequency components. Extensive experimentation and evaluations against
other available solutions, either for single or multi-image super-resolution,
have demonstrated that the proposed deep learning-based solution can be
considered state-of-the-art for Multi-Image Super-Resolution for remote sensing
applications.

results in image processing tasks including super-resolution (SR). However,
most CNN-based SR methods treat low-resolution (LR) inputs and features equally

Firstly, the channel attention mechanism is used to adaptively recalibrate the

Secondly, we propose the Local Memory Connection (LMC) to enhance the

  and State of the Art","  For the past two decades, there have been significant efforts to develop
methods for object detection in Remote Sensing (RS) images. In most cases, the
datasets for small object detection in remote sensing images are inadequate.
Many researchers used scene classification datasets for object detection, which
has its limitations; for example, the large-sized objects outnumber the small
objects in object categories. Thus, they lack diversity; this further affects
the detection performance of small object detectors in RS images. This paper
reviews current datasets and object detection methods (deep learning-based) for
remote sensing images. We also propose a large-scale, publicly available
benchmark Remote Sensing Super-resolution Object Detection (RSSOD) dataset. The
RSSOD dataset consists of 1,759 hand-annotated images with 22,091 instances of
very high resolution (VHR) images with a spatial resolution of ~0.05 m. There
are five classes with varying frequencies of labels per class. The image
patches are extracted from satellite images, including real image distortions
such as tangential scale distortion and skew distortion. We also propose a

Residual feature aggregation (MCGR) and auxiliary YOLOv5 detector to benchmark

satisfactory compared to large objects, especially in low-resolution and noisy

  via Pixel and Output Level Aligning","  Recently, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has attracted increasing
attention to address the domain shift problem in the semantic segmentation
task. Although previous UDA methods have achieved promising performance, they
still suffer from the distribution gaps between source and target domains,
especially the resolution discrepany in the remote sensing images. To address
this problem, this paper designs a novel end-to-end semantic segmentation

can simultaneously achieve the super-resolution task and the domain adaptation

SRDA-Net includes three parts: a Super-Resolution and Segmentation (SRS) model
which focuses on recovering high-resolution image and predicting segmentation
map, a Pixel-level Domain Classifier (PDC) for determining which domain the
pixel belongs to, and an Output-space Domain Classifier (ODC) for
distinguishing which domain the pixel contribution is from. By jointly
optimizing SRS with two classifiers, the proposed method can not only
eliminates the resolution difference between source and target domains, but
also improve the performance of the semantic segmentation task. Experimental
results on two remote sensing datasets with different resolutions demonstrate

generator contains two blocks; one is the pyramidal convolution in the
residual-dense block (PCRDB), and the other is the attention-based upsample
(AUP) block. The attentioned pyramidal convolution (AttPConv) in the PCRDB
block is a module that combines multi-scale convolution and channel attention
to automatically learn and adjust the scaling of the residuals for better
results. The AUP block is a module that combines pixel attention (PA) to
perform arbitrary multiples of upsampling. These two blocks work together to
help generate better quality images. For the loss function, we design a loss

and advances the state of the art for guided depth super-resolution. The edge
transferring/enhancing properties of the diffusion are boosted by the
contextual reasoning capabilities of modern networks, and a strict adjustment
step guarantees perfect adherence to the source image. We achieve unprecedented
results in three commonly used benchmarks for guided depth super-resolution.
The performance gain compared to other methods is the largest at larger scales,
such as x32 scaling. Code for the proposed method will be made available to

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00440v1,2019,Deep Learning for Multiple-Image Super-Resolution,"  Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) is a process aimed at enhancing spatial
resolution of images, either from a single observation, based on the learned
relation between low and high resolution, or from multiple images presenting
the same scene. SRR is particularly valuable, if it is infeasible to acquire
images at desired resolution, but many images of the same scene are available
at lower resolution---this is inherent to a variety of remote sensing
scenarios. Recently, we have witnessed substantial improvement in single-image
SRR attributed to the use of deep neural networks for learning the relation
between low and high resolution. Importantly, deep learning has not been
exploited for multiple-image SRR, which benefits from information fusion and in
general allows for achieving higher reconstruction accuracy. In this letter, we
introduce a new method which combines the advantages of multiple-image fusion
with learning the low-to-high resolution mapping using deep networks. The
reported experimental results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art SRR methods, including these that operate from a single image,
as well as those that perform multiple-image fusion.

""downscaling"" in the atmospheric sciences: improving the spatial resolution of
low-resolution images. The ability of conditional GANs to generate an ensemble
of solutions for a given input lends itself naturally to stochastic
downscaling, but the stochastic nature of GANs is not usually considered in
super-resolution applications. Here, we introduce a recurrent, stochastic
super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving
high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution

consisting of radar-measured precipitation from Switzerland, the other of cloud

super-resolution sequences for both datasets. The statistical properties of the
generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from
ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate that the GAN produces
close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator
is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger

  Large-Scale Building Extraction using Airborne LiDAR Data and Optical Image","  Automatic extraction of buildings in urban and residential scenes has become
a subject of growing interest in the domain of photogrammetry and remote
sensing, particularly since mid-1990s. Active contour model, colloquially known
as snake model, has been studied to extract buildings from aerial and satellite
imagery. However, this task is still very challenging due to the complexity of
building size, shape, and its surrounding environment. This complexity leads to
a major obstacle for carrying out a reliable large-scale building extraction,
since the involved prior information and assumptions on building such as shape,
size, and color cannot be generalized over large areas. This paper presents an
efficient snake model to overcome such challenge, called Super-Resolution-based
Snake Model (SRSM). The SRSM operates on high-resolution LiDAR-based elevation
images -- called z-images -- generated by a super-resolution process applied to
LiDAR data. The involved balloon force model is also improved to shrink or
inflate adaptively, instead of inflating the snake continuously. This method is
applicable for a large scale such as city scale and even larger, while having a
high level of automation and not requiring any prior knowledge nor training
data from the urban scenes (hence unsupervised). It achieves high overall
accuracy when tested on various datasets. For instance, the proposed SRSM
yields an average area-based Quality of 86.57% and object-based Quality of
81.60% on the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark datasets. Compared to other methods

  Saliency-Aware Dynamic Routing Strategy","  Deep learning-based algorithms have greatly improved the performance of
remote sensing image (RSI) super-resolution (SR). However, increasing network
depth and parameters cause a huge burden of computing and storage. Directly
reducing the depth or width of existing models results in a large performance
drop. We observe that the SR difficulty of different regions in an RSI varies
greatly, and existing methods use the same deep network to process all regions
in an image, resulting in a waste of computing resources. In addition, existing
SR methods generally predefine integer scale factors and cannot perform
stepless SR, i.e., a single model can deal with any potential scale factor.
Retraining the model on each scale factor wastes considerable computing
resources and model storage space. To address the above problems, we propose a
saliency-aware dynamic routing network (SalDRN) for lightweight and stepless SR
of RSIs. First, we introduce visual saliency as an indicator of region-level SR
difficulty and integrate a lightweight saliency detector into the SalDRN to
capture pixel-level visual characteristics. Then, we devise a saliency-aware

select feature extraction paths of appropriate depth according to the SR
difficulty of sub-image patches. Finally, we propose a novel lightweight

  Stochastic Normalizing Flows","  Remote sensing images (RSIs) in real scenes may be disturbed by multiple
factors such as optical blur, undersampling, and additional noise, resulting in
complex and diverse degradation models. At present, the mainstream SR
algorithms only consider a single and fixed degradation (such as bicubic
interpolation) and cannot flexibly handle complex degradations in real scenes.
Therefore, designing a super-resolution (SR) model that can cope with various
degradations is gradually attracting the attention of researchers. Some studies
first estimate the degradation kernels and then perform degradation-adaptive SR
but face the problems of estimation error amplification and insufficient
high-frequency details in the results. Although blind SR algorithms based on
generative adversarial networks (GAN) have greatly improved visual quality,
they still suffer from pseudo-texture, mode collapse, and poor training
stability. In this article, we propose a novel blind SR framework based on the
stochastic normalizing flow (BlindSRSNF) to address the above problems.
BlindSRSNF learns the conditional probability distribution over the
high-resolution image space given a low-resolution (LR) image by explicitly
optimizing the variational bound on the likelihood. BlindSRSNF is easy to train
and can generate photo-realistic SR results that outperform GAN-based models.
Besides, we introduce a degradation representation strategy based on
contrastive learning to avoid the error amplification problem caused by the
explicit degradation estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that the
proposed algorithm can obtain SR results with excellent visual perception

Inspired by the specific properties of model, we make the first attempt to

  Variation","  Hyperspectral imaging is a cutting-edge type of remote sensing used for
mapping vegetation properties, rock minerals and other materials. A major
drawback of hyperspectral imaging devices is their intrinsic low spatial
resolution. In this paper, we propose a method for increasing the spatial
resolution of a hyperspectral image by fusing it with an image of higher
spatial resolution that was obtained with a different imaging modality. This is
accomplished by solving a variational problem in which the regularization
functional is the directional total variation. To accommodate for possible
mis-registrations between the two images, we consider a non-convex blind
super-resolution problem where both a fused image and the corresponding
convolution kernel are estimated. Using this approach, our model can realign
the given images if needed. Our experimental results indicate that the
non-convexity is negligible in practice and that reliable solutions can be
computed using a variety of different optimization algorithms. Numerical
results on real remote sensing data from plant sciences and urban monitoring
show the potential of the proposed method and suggests that it is robust with
respect to the regularization parameters, mis-registration and the shape of the
kernel.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02549v3,2017,Remote Sensing Image Fusion Based on Two-stream Fusion Network,"  Remote sensing image fusion (also known as pan-sharpening) aims at generating
high resolution multi-spectral (MS) image from inputs of a high spatial
resolution single band panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution
multi-spectral image. Inspired by the astounding achievements of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) in a variety of computer vision tasks, in this paper, we
propose a two-stream fusion network (TFNet) to address the problem of
pan-sharpening. Unlike previous CNN based methods that consider pan-sharpening
as a super resolution problem and perform pan-sharpening in pixel level, the
proposed TFNet aims to fuse PAN and MS images in feature level and reconstruct
the pan-sharpened image from the fused features. The TFNet mainly consists of
three parts. The first part is comprised of two networks extracting features
from PAN and MS images, respectively. The subsequent network fuses them
together to form compact features that represent both spatial and spectral
information of PAN and MS images, simultaneously. Finally, the desired high
spatial resolution MS image is recovered from the fused features through an
image reconstruction network. Experiments on Quickbird and \mbox{GaoFen-1}
satellite images demonstrate that the proposed TFNet can fuse PAN and MS
images, effectively, and produce pan-sharpened images competitive with even
superior to state of the arts.

data are receiving a growing interest from the remote sensing community.
However, a misaligned integration between these datasets may fail to fully
profit the potential of both sensors. In this regard, an optimum fusion of
optical imagery and LiDAR data requires an accurate registration. This is a
complex problem since a versatile solution is still missing, especially when
considering the context where data are collected at different times, from
different platforms, under different acquisition configurations. This paper
presents a coarse-to-fine registration method of aerial/satellite optical
imagery with airborne LiDAR data acquired in such context. Firstly, a coarse
registration involves extracting and matching of buildings from LiDAR data and
optical imagery. Then, a Mutual Information-based fine registration is carried
out. It involves a super-resolution approach applied to LiDAR data, and a local
approach of transformation model estimation. The proposed method succeeds at
overcoming the challenges associated with the aforementioned difficult context.
Considering the experimented airborne LiDAR (2011) and orthorectified aerial
imagery (2016) datasets, their spatial shift is reduced by 48.15% after the
proposed coarse registration. Moreover, the incompatibility of size and spatial
resolution is addressed by the mentioned super-resolution. Finally, a high
accuracy of dataset alignment is also achieved, highlighted by a 40-cm error
based on a check-point assessment and a 64-cm error based on a check-pair-line
assessment. These promising results enable further research for a complete

a long skip-connection between inputs and outputs. The second step aims to
distinguish SR bands from their ground truth bands. This is achieved by the
proposed discriminator network, which alternately characterizes the high level
features of the two sets of bands and applying binary classification on the
extracted features. Then, we formulate the adversarial learning of the
generator and discriminator networks as a min-max game. In this learning

HSI and MSI are unmixed into endmembers and abundances based on the linear
unmixing model. Two special convolutional layers are designed to act as a
bridge that coordinates with the three autoencoder nets, and the PSF and SRF

attention in various practical applications. Due to limitations of bandwidth

considerably low, largely limiting their potentials in scenarios that require
spatially explicit information. To improve image resolution, numerous
approaches based on training low-high resolution pairs have been proposed to

random noise maps are fed into a designed generative adversarial network (GAN)
for reconstruction. Then, the proposed method converts the reference image to
latent space as the migration image prior. Finally, we update the input noise
via an implicit method, and further transfer the texture and structured

$l_{2,1}$ norm is employed as the reconstruction error instead of the more
common $l_2$ norm, so that individual pixels can be recovered as accurately as
possible. With this design, the network allows to extract correlated spectral
and spatial information from unregistered images that better preserves the
spectral information. The proposed method is referred to as unregistered and
unsupervised mutual Dirichlet Net ($u^2$-MDN). Extensive experimental results
using benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate the superior performance of $u^2$-MDN
as compared to the state-of-the-art.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13351v1,2022,"SuperYOLO: Super Resolution Assisted Object Detection in Multimodal
  Remote Sensing Imagery","  In this paper, we propose an accurate yet fast small object detection method
for RSI, named SuperYOLO, which fuses multimodal data and performs high
resolution (HR) object detection on multiscale objects by utilizing the
assisted super resolution (SR) learning and considering both the detection
accuracy and computation cost. First, we construct a compact baseline by
removing the Focus module to keep the HR features and significantly overcomes
the missing error of small objects. Second, we utilize pixel-level multimodal
fusion (MF) to extract information from various data to facilitate more
suitable and effective features for small objects in RSI. Furthermore, we
design a simple and flexible SR branch to learn HR feature representations that
can discriminate small objects from vast backgrounds with low-resolution (LR)
input, thus further improving the detection accuracy. Moreover, to avoid
introducing additional computation, the SR branch is discarded in the inference
stage and the computation of the network model is reduced due to the LR input.
Experimental results show that, on the widely used VEDAI RS dataset, SuperYOLO
achieves an accuracy of 73.61% (in terms of mAP50), which is more than 10%
higher than the SOTA large models such as YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x and RS designed
YOLOrs. Meanwhile, the GFOLPs and parameter size of SuperYOLO are about 18.1x
and 4.2x less than YOLOv5x. Our proposed model shows a favorable accuracy-speed
trade-off compared to the state-of-art models. The code will be open sourced at

http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11154v1,2023,"Multitemporal and multispectral data fusion for super-resolution of
  Sentinel-2 images","  Multispectral Sentinel-2 images are a valuable source of Earth observation
data, however spatial resolution of their spectral bands limited to 10 m, 20 m,
and 60 m ground sampling distance remains insufficient in many cases. This
problem can be addressed with super-resolution, aimed at reconstructing a
high-resolution image from a low-resolution observation. For Sentinel-2,
spectral information fusion allows for enhancing the 20 m and 60 m bands to the
10 m resolution. Also, there were attempts to combine multitemporal stacks of
individual Sentinel-2 bands, however these two approaches have not been
combined so far. In this paper, we introduce DeepSent -- a new deep network for
super-resolving multitemporal series of multispectral Sentinel-2 images. It is
underpinned with information fusion performed simultaneously in the spectral
and temporal dimensions to generate an enlarged multispectral image. In our
extensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our solution outperforms
other state-of-the-art techniques that realize either multitemporal or
multispectral data fusion. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of DeepSent
results from how these two fusion types are combined in a single architecture,
which is superior to performing such fusion in a sequential manner.
Importantly, we have applied our method to super-resolve real-world Sentinel-2
images, enhancing the spatial resolution of all the spectral bands to 3.3 m
nominal ground sampling distance, and we compare the outcome with very
high-resolution WorldView-2 images. We will publish our implementation upon
paper acceptance, and we expect it will increase the possibilities of
exploiting super-resolved Sentinel-2 images in real-life applications.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04271v2,2018,"Super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images: Learning a globally applicable
  deep neural network","  The Sentinel-2 satellite mission delivers multi-spectral imagery with 13
spectral bands, acquired at three different spatial resolutions. The aim of
this research is to super-resolve the lower-resolution (20 m and 60 m Ground
Sampling Distance - GSD) bands to 10 m GSD, so as to obtain a complete data
cube at the maximal sensor resolution. We employ a state-of-the-art
convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform end-to-end upsampling, which is
trained with data at lower resolution, i.e., from 40->20 m, respectively
360->60 m GSD. In this way, one has access to a virtually infinite amount of
training data, by downsampling real Sentinel-2 images. We use data sampled
globally over a wide range of geographical locations, to obtain a network that
generalises across different climate zones and land-cover types, and can
super-resolve arbitrary Sentinel-2 images without the need of retraining. In
quantitative evaluations (at lower scale, where ground truth is available), our
network, which we call DSen2, outperforms the best competing approach by almost
50% in RMSE, while better preserving the spectral characteristics. It also
delivers visually convincing results at the full 10 m GSD. The code is

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10341v1,2019,Single-photon computational 3D imaging at 45 km,"  Long-range active imaging has a variety of applications in remote sensing and
target recognition. Single-photon LiDAR (light detection and ranging) offers
single-photon sensitivity and picosecond timing resolution, which is desirable
for high-precision three-dimensional (3D) imaging over long distances. Despite
important progress, further extending the imaging range presents enormous
challenges because only weak echo photons return and are mixed with strong
noise. Herein, we tackled these challenges by constructing a high-efficiency,
low-noise confocal single-photon LiDAR system, and developing a
long-range-tailored computational algorithm that provides high photon
efficiency and super-resolution in the transverse domain. Using this technique,
we experimentally demonstrated active single-photon 3D-imaging at a distance of
up to 45 km in an urban environment, with a low return-signal level of $\sim$1
photon per pixel. Our system is feasible for imaging at a few hundreds of
kilometers by refining the setup, and thus represents a significant milestone
towards rapid, low-power, and high-resolution LiDAR over extra-long ranges.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06792v2,2020,Learning Enriched Features for Real Image Restoration and Enhancement,"  With the goal of recovering high-quality image content from its degraded
version, image restoration enjoys numerous applications, such as in
surveillance, computational photography, medical imaging, and remote sensing.
Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved dramatic
improvements over conventional approaches for image restoration task. Existing
CNN-based methods typically operate either on full-resolution or on
progressively low-resolution representations. In the former case, spatially
precise but contextually less robust results are achieved, while in the latter
case, semantically reliable but spatially less accurate outputs are generated.
In this paper, we present a novel architecture with the collective goals of
maintaining spatially-precise high-resolution representations through the
entire network and receiving strong contextual information from the
low-resolution representations. The core of our approach is a multi-scale
residual block containing several key elements: (a) parallel multi-resolution
convolution streams for extracting multi-scale features, (b) information
exchange across the multi-resolution streams, (c) spatial and channel attention
mechanisms for capturing contextual information, and (d) attention based
multi-scale feature aggregation. In a nutshell, our approach learns an enriched
set of features that combines contextual information from multiple scales,
while simultaneously preserving the high-resolution spatial details. Extensive
experiments on five real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method,
named as MIRNet, achieves state-of-the-art results for a variety of image
processing tasks, including image denoising, super-resolution, and image
enhancement. The source code and pre-trained models are available at

http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16644v1,2020,"Rethinking CNN-Based Pansharpening: Guided Colorization of Panchromatic
  Images via GANs","  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based approaches have shown promising
results in pansharpening of satellite images in recent years. However, they
still exhibit limitations in producing high-quality pansharpening outputs. To
that end, we propose a new self-supervised learning framework, where we treat
pansharpening as a colorization problem, which brings an entirely novel
perspective and solution to the problem compared to existing methods that base
their solution solely on producing a super-resolution version of the
multispectral image. Whereas CNN-based methods provide a reduced resolution
panchromatic image as input to their model along with reduced resolution
multispectral images, hence learn to increase their resolution together, we
instead provide the grayscale transformed multispectral image as input, and
train our model to learn the colorization of the grayscale input. We further
address the fixed downscale ratio assumption during training, which does not
generalize well to the full-resolution scenario. We introduce a noise injection
into the training by randomly varying the downsampling ratios. Those two
critical changes, along with the addition of adversarial training in the
proposed PanColorization Generative Adversarial Networks (PanColorGAN)
framework, help overcome the spatial detail loss and blur problems that are
observed in CNN-based pansharpening. The proposed approach outperforms the
previous CNN-based and traditional methods as demonstrated in our experiments.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07414v1,2022,"Trustworthy modelling of atmospheric formaldehyde powered by deep
  learning","  Formaldehyde (HCHO) is one one of the most important trace gas in the
atmosphere, as it is a pollutant causing respiratory and other diseases. It is
also a precursor of tropospheric ozone which damages crops and deteriorates
human health. Study of HCHO chemistry and long-term monitoring using satellite
data is important from the perspective of human health, food security and air
pollution. Dynamic atmospheric chemistry models struggle to simulate
atmospheric formaldehyde and often overestimate by up to two times relative to
satellite observations and reanalysis. Spatial distribution of modelled HCHO
also fail to match satellite observations. Here, we present deep learning
approach using a simple super-resolution based convolutional neural network
towards simulating fast and reliable atmospheric HCHO. Our approach is an
indirect method of HCHO estimation without the need to chemical equations. We
find that deep learning outperforms dynamical model simulations which involves
complicated atmospheric chemistry representation. Causality establishing the
nonlinear relationships of different variables to target formaldehyde is
established in our approach by using a variety of precursors from meteorology
and chemical reanalysis to target OMI AURA satellite based HCHO predictions. We
choose South Asia for testing our implementation as it doesnt have in situ
measurements of formaldehyde and there is a need for improved quality data over
the region. Moreover, there are spatial and temporal data gaps in the satellite
product which can be removed by trustworthy modelling of atmospheric
formaldehyde. This study is a novel attempt using computer vision for
trustworthy modelling of formaldehyde from remote sensing can lead to cascading
societal benefits.
