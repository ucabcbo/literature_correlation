geometric space for image fusion. Focusing on the characteristics and
differences of multi-source remote sensing images, a feature-based registration
algorithm is implemented. The key technologies include image scale-space for
implementing multi-scale properties, Harris corner detection for keypoints
extraction, and partial intensity invariant feature descriptor (PIIFD) for
keypoints description. Eventually, a multi-scale Harris-PIIFD image
registration algorithm framework is proposed. The experimental results of four
sets of representative real data show that the algorithm has excellent, stable
performance in multi-source remote sensing image registration, and can achieve
accurate spatial alignment, which has strong practical application value and
certain generalization ability.

photography, computational imaging and remote sensing, to name but a few.
Recently, deep learning has emerged as an important tool for image fusion. This
paper presents three deep convolutional sparse coding (CSC) networks for three
kinds of image fusion tasks (i.e., infrared and visible image fusion,
multi-exposure image fusion, and multi-modal image fusion). The CSC model and
the iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm are generalized into
dictionary convolution units. As a result, all hyper-parameters are learned
from data. Our extensive experiments and comprehensive comparisons reveal the
superiority of the proposed networks with regard to quantitative evaluation and
visual inspection.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09465v1,2020,Remote sensing image fusion based on Bayesian GAN,"  Remote sensing image fusion technology (pan-sharpening) is an important means
to improve the information capacity of remote sensing images. Inspired by the
efficient arameter space posteriori sampling of Bayesian neural networks, in
this paper we propose a Bayesian Generative Adversarial Network based on
Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (PGSLD-BGAN) to improve
pan-sharpening tasks. Unlike many traditional generative models that consider
only one optimal solution (might be locally optimal), the proposed PGSLD-BGAN
performs Bayesian inference on the network parameters, and explore the
generator posteriori distribution, which assists selecting the appropriate
generator parameters. First, we build a two-stream generator network with PAN
and MS images as input, which consists of three parts: feature extraction,
feature fusion and image reconstruction. Then, we leverage Markov discriminator
to enhance the ability of generator to reconstruct the fusion image, so that
the result image can retain more details. Finally, introducing Preconditioned
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics policy, we perform Bayesian inference on
the generator network. Experiments on QuickBird and WorldView datasets show
that the model proposed in this paper can effectively fuse PAN and MS images,
and be competitive with even superior to state of the arts in terms of
subjective and objective metrics.

  Accounting for Seasonal Spectral Variability","  Image fusion combines data from different heterogeneous sources to obtain
more precise information about an underlying scene. Hyperspectral-multispectral
(HS-MS) image fusion is currently attracting great interest in remote sensing
since it allows the generation of high spatial resolution HS images,
circumventing the main limitation of this imaging modality. Existing HS-MS
fusion algorithms, however, neglect the spectral variability often existing
between images acquired at different time instants. This time difference causes
variations in spectral signatures of the underlying constituent materials due
to different acquisition and seasonal conditions. This paper introduces a novel
HS-MS image fusion strategy that combines an unmixing-based formulation with an
explicit parametric model for typical spectral variability between the two

  Restoration and Fusion","  In the fields of image restoration and image fusion, model-driven methods and
data-driven methods are the two representative frameworks. However, both
approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The model-driven
methods consider the imaging mechanism, which is deterministic and
theoretically reasonable; however, they cannot easily model complicated
nonlinear problems. The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge
learning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical
features; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are
over-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate
the coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been
considered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We
are the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three
categories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational
models with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning
methods. The typical existing and potential coupling methods for remote sensing

http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00440v1,2019,Deep Learning for Multiple-Image Super-Resolution,"  Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) is a process aimed at enhancing spatial
resolution of images, either from a single observation, based on the learned
relation between low and high resolution, or from multiple images presenting
the same scene. SRR is particularly valuable, if it is infeasible to acquire
images at desired resolution, but many images of the same scene are available
at lower resolution---this is inherent to a variety of remote sensing
scenarios. Recently, we have witnessed substantial improvement in single-image
SRR attributed to the use of deep neural networks for learning the relation
between low and high resolution. Importantly, deep learning has not been
exploited for multiple-image SRR, which benefits from information fusion and in
general allows for achieving higher reconstruction accuracy. In this letter, we
introduce a new method which combines the advantages of multiple-image fusion
with learning the low-to-high resolution mapping using deep networks. The
reported experimental results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the

conventional image fusion methods typically degrade the performance of the land

profiles. Then, the feature fusion model assumes that both the extracted
morphological profiles and the HS image can be described as a feature matrix
lying in different subspaces. An algorithm based on combining alternating
optimization (AO) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is
developed to solve efficiently the feature fusion problem. Finally, extensive
simulations were run to evaluate the performance of the proposed feature fusion
approach for two data sets. In general, the proposed approach exhibits a
competitive performance compared to other feature extraction methods.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11329v3,2021,Multispectral image fusion based on super pixel segmentation,"  Multispectral image fusion is a computer vision process that is essential to
remote sensing. For applications such as dehazing and object detection, there
is a need to offer solutions that can perform in real-time on any type of
scene. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art approaches do not meet these
criteria as they need to be trained on domain-specific data and have high
computational complexity. This paper focuses on the task of fusing color (RGB)
and near-infrared (NIR) images as this the typical RGBT sensors, as in
multispectral cameras for detection, fusion, and dehazing. Indeed, the NIR
channel has the ability to capture details not visible in RGB and see beyond
haze, fog, and clouds. To combine this information, a novel approach based on
superpixel segmentation is designed so that multispectral image fusion is
performed according to the specific local content of the images to be fused.
Therefore, the proposed method produces a fusion that contains the most
relevant content of each spectrum. The experiments reported in this manuscript
show that the novel approach better preserve details than alternative fusion
methods.

properties, therefore treating them equally will lead to inadequate feature
extracting. Besides, multi-scaled networks capture information more
sufficiently than single-scaled models in pixel-wised problems. In light of
these factors, we propose a source-aware spatial-spectral-integrated double
U-shaped network called $\rm{(SU)^2}$Net. The network is mainly composed of a
spatial U-net and a spectral U-net, which learn spatial details and spectral
characteristics discriminately and hierarchically. In contrast with most
previous works that simply apply concatenation to integrate spatial and
spectral information, a novel structure named the spatial-spectral block

different sources effectively. Experiment results show that our method
outperforms the representative state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations for a variety of image fusion
missions, including remote sensing pansharpening and hyperspectral image

which are supplied by different sensors become incomprehensible. For better
visual perception of these images, it is essential to operate series of
pre-processing and elementary corrections and then operate a series of main
processing steps for more precise analysis on the images. There are several
approaches for processing which are depended on the type of remote sensing
images. The discussed approach in this article, i.e. image fusion, is the use
of natural colors of an optical image for adding color to a grayscale satellite
image which gives us the ability for better observation of the HR image of OLI
sensor of Landsat-8. This process with emphasis on details of fusion technique
has previously been performed; however, we are going to apply the concept of
the interpolation process. In fact, we see many important software tools such
as ENVI and ERDAS as the most famous remote sensing image processing tools have
only classical interpolation techniques (such as bi-linear (BL) and
bi-cubic/cubic convolution (CC)). Therefore, ENVI- and ERDAS-based researches
in image fusion area and even other fusion researches often dont use new and
better interpolators and are mainly concentrated on the fusion algorithms
details for achieving a better quality, so we only focus on the interpolation
impact on fusion quality in Landsat-8 multispectral images. The important
feature of this approach is to use a statistical, adaptive, and edge-guided

selection operator (LASSO) to perform variable selection and regularization.
Computational time is reduced by applying the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), as well as initializing the fusion image by estimating it
using maximum a posteriori (MAP) based on Hardie's method. We demonstrate that
the proposed sparse fusion and reconstruction provides quantitatively superior
results when compared to existing methods on publicly available images.
Finally, we show how the proposed method can be practically applied in
biomedical infrared spectroscopic microscopy.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07987v1,2020,Interpolation and Gap Filling of Landsat Reflectance Time Series,"  Products derived from a single multispectral sensor are hampered by a limited
spatial, spectral or temporal resolutions. Image fusion in general and
downscaling/blending in particular allow to combine different multiresolution
datasets. We present here an optimal interpolation approach to generate
smoothed and gap-free time series of Landsat reflectance data. We fuse MODIS
(moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) and Landsat data globally using
the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The optimal interpolator exploits GEE
ability to ingest large amounts of data (Landsat climatologies) and uses simple
linear operations that scale easily in the cloud. The approach shows very good
results in practice, as tested over five sites with different vegetation types
and climatic characteristics in the contiguous US.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11979v2,2022,"Robust Hyperspectral Image Fusion with Simultaneous Guide Image
  Denoising via Constrained Convex Optimization","  The paper proposes a new high spatial resolution hyperspectral (HR-HS) image
estimation method based on convex optimization. The method assumes a low
spatial resolution HS (LR-HS) image and a guide image as observations, where
both observations are contaminated by noise. Our method simultaneously
estimates an HR-HS image and a noiseless guide image, so the method can utilize
spatial information in a guide image even if it is contaminated by heavy noise.
The proposed estimation problem adopts hybrid spatio-spectral total variation
as regularization and evaluates the edge similarity between HR-HS and guide
images to effectively use apriori knowledge on an HR-HS image and spatial
detail information in a guide image. To efficiently solve the problem, we apply
a primal-dual splitting method. Experiments demonstrate the performance of our
method and the advantage over several existing methods.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15938v1,2022,"Segment-based fusion of multi-sensor multi-scale satellite soil moisture
  retrievals","  Synergetic use of sensors for soil moisture retrieval is attracting
considerable interest due to the different advantages of different sensors.
Active, passive, and optic data integration could be a comprehensive solution
for exploiting the advantages of different sensors aimed at preparing soil
moisture maps. Typically, pixel-based methods are used for multi-sensor fusion.
Since, different applications need different scales of soil moisture maps,
pixel-based approaches are limited for this purpose. Object-based image
analysis employing an image object instead of a pixel could help us to meet
this need. This paper proposes a segment-based image fusion framework to
evaluate the possibility of preparing a multi-scale soil moisture map through
integrated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
data. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology was able to improve
soil moisture estimation in different scales up to 20% better compared to
pixel-based fusion approach.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03951v1,2022,"Efficient and Accurate Hyperspectral Pansharpening Using 3D VolumeNet
  and 2.5D Texture Transfer","  Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have obtained promising results
in single-image SR for hyperspectral pansharpening. However, enhancing CNNs'
representation ability with fewer parameters and a shorter prediction time is a
challenging and critical task. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-spectral
image fusion method using a combination of the previously proposed 3D CNN model
VolumeNet and 2.5D texture transfer method using other modality high resolution
(HR) images. Since a multi-spectral (MS) image consists of several bands and
each band is a 2D image slice, MS images can be seen as 3D data. Thus, we use
the previously proposed VolumeNet to fuse HR panchromatic (PAN) images and
bicubic interpolated MS images. Because the proposed 3D VolumeNet can
effectively improve the accuracy by expanding the receptive field of the model,
and due to its lightweight structure, we can achieve better performance against
the existing method without purchasing a large number of remote sensing images
for training. In addition, VolumeNet can restore the high-frequency information
lost in the HR MR image as much as possible, reducing the difficulty of feature
extraction in the following step: 2.5D texture transfer. As one of the latest
technologies, deep learning-based texture transfer has been demonstrated to
effectively and efficiently improve the visual performance and quality
evaluation indicators of image reconstruction. Different from the texture
transfer processing of RGB image, we use HR PAN images as the reference images
and perform texture transfer for each frequency band of MS images, which is
named 2.5D texture transfer. The experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms the existing methods in terms of objective accuracy
assessment, method efficiency, and visual subjective evaluation.
