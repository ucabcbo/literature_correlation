Considering the `satellite passive microwave remote sensing data' as functional
data, we studied daily observation of sea ice cover of each year as a smooth
continuous function of time. We investigated the mean function for the sea ice
area for following decades and computed the corresponding $95\%$ bootstrap
confidence interval for the both Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. We found the mean
function for the sea ice area dropped statistically significantly in recent
decades for the Arctic Ocean. However, no such statistical evidence was found
for the Antarctic ocean. Essentially, the mean function for sea ice area in the
Antarctic Ocean is unchanged. Additional evidence of the melting of sea ice
area in the Arctic Ocean is provided by three types of phase curve (namely,
Area vs. Velocity, Area vs. Acceleration, and Velocity Vs. Acceleration). In
the Arctic Ocean, during the summer, the current decades is observing the size
of the sea ice area about $30\%$ less, than what it used to be during the first
decade. In this article, we have taken a distribution-free approach for our
analysis, except the data generating process, belongs to the Hilbert space.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00133v1,2019,ArcticNet: A Deep Learning Solution to Classify Arctic Wetlands,"  Arctic environments are rapidly changing under the warming climate. Of
particular interest are wetlands, a type of ecosystem that constitutes the most
effective terrestrial long-term carbon store. As permafrost thaws, the carbon
that was locked in these wetland soils for millennia becomes available for
aerobic and anaerobic decomposition, which releases CO2 and CH4, respectively,
back to the atmosphere.As CO2 and CH4 are potent greenhouse gases, this
transfer of carbon from the land to the atmosphere further contributes to
global warming, thereby increasing the rate of permafrost degradation in a
positive feedback loop. Therefore, monitoring Arctic wetland health and
dynamics is a key scientific task that is also of importance for policy.
However, the identification and delineation of these important wetland
ecosystems, remain incomplete and often inaccurate. Mapping the extent of
Arctic wetlands remains a challenge for the scientific community. Conventional,
coarser remote sensing methods are inadequate at distinguishing the diverse and
micro-topographically complex non-vascular vegetation that characterize Arctic
wetlands, presenting the need for better identification methods. To tackle this
challenging problem, we constructed and annotated the first-of-its-kind Arctic
Wetland Dataset (AWD). Based on that, we present ArcticNet, a deep neural
network that exploits the multi-spectral, high-resolution imagery captured from
nanosatellites (Planet Dove CubeSats) with additional DEM from the ArcticDEM
project, to semantically label a Arctic study area into six types, in which
three Arctic wetland functional types are included. We present multi-fold
efforts to handle the arising challenges, including class imbalance, and the
choice of fusion strategies. Preliminary results endorse the high promise of
ArcticNet, achieving 93.12% in labelling a hold-out set of regions in our
Arctic study area.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07436v1,2021,"Snowcover Survey over an Arctic Glacier Forefield: Contribution of
  Photogrammetry to Identify ""Icing"" Variability and Processes","  Current climate shift has significant impacts on both quality and quantity of
snow precipitation. This directly influences spatial variability of the
snowpack as well as cumulative snow height. Contemporary glacier retreat
reorganizes periglacial morphology: while the glacier area decreases, the
moraine area increases. The latter is becoming a new water storage potential
almost as important as the glacier itself, but with a much more complex
topography. This work hence fills one of the missing variables of the
hydrological budget equation of an arctic glacier basin by providing an
estimate of the snow water equivalent (SWE) of the moraine contribution. Such a
result is achieved by investigating Structure from Motion (SfM) image
processing applied to pictures collected from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
as a method to produce snow depth maps over the proglacial moraine area.
Several UAV campaigns were carried out on a small glacial basin in Spitsbergen
(Arctic): measurements were made at the maximum snow accumulation season (late
April) while reference topography maps were acquired at the end of hydrological
year (late September) when the moraine is mostly free of snow. Snow depth is
determined from Digital Surface Model (DSM) subtraction. Using dedicated and
natural ground control points for relative positioning of the DSMs, the
relative DSM georeferencing with sub-meter accuracy removes the main source of
uncertainty when assessing snow depth. For areas where snow is deposited on
bare rock surfaces, the correlation between avalanche probe in-situ snow depth
measurements and DSM differences is excellent. Differences in ice covered areas
between the two measurement techniques are attributed to the different
quantities measured.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13613v1,2022,"Deep Learning Models for River Classification at Sub-Meter Resolutions
  from Multispectral and Panchromatic Commercial Satellite Imagery","  Remote sensing of the Earth's surface water is critical in a wide range of
environmental studies, from evaluating the societal impacts of seasonal
droughts and floods to the large-scale implications of climate change.
Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from
satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by 1) the spatial
resolution of public satellite imagery, 2) classification schemes that operate
at the pixel level, and 3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the
state-of-the-art by 1) using commercial imagery with panchromatic and
multispectral resolutions of 30 cm and 1.2 m, respectively, 2) developing
multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the
morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral
properties, and 3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery.
This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird,
WorldView, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at
such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the RGB, and
NIR bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve
excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly
preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel
approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training
data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more
is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a
precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained
model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide
range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and
2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.

  Remote Sensing Data","  Deep Learning is gaining traction with geophysics community to understand
subsurface structures, such as fault detection or salt body in seismic data.
This study describes using deep learning method for iceberg or ship recognition
with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Drifting icebergs pose a potential
threat to activities offshore around the Arctic, including for both ship
navigation and oil rigs. Advancement of satellite imagery using
weather-independent cross-polarized radar has enabled us to monitor and
delineate icebergs and ships, however a human component is needed to classify
the images. Here we present Transfer Learning, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) designed to work with a limited training data and features, while
demonstrating its effectiveness in this problem. Key aspect of the approach is
data augmentation and stacking of multiple outputs, resulted in a significant
boost in accuracy (logarithmic score of 0.1463). This algorithm has been tested
through participation at the Statoil/C-Core Kaggle competition.

  ecosystems","  The Alaskan landscape has undergone substantial changes in recent decades,
most notably the expansion of shrubs and trees across the Arctic. We developed
a dynamic statistical model to quantify the impact of climate change on the
structural transformation of ecosystems using remotely sensed imagery. We used
latent trajectory processes in a hierarchical framework to model dynamic state
probabilities that evolve annually, from which we derived transition
probabilities between ecotypes. Our latent trajectory model accommodates
temporal irregularity in survey intervals and uses spatio-temporally
heterogeneous climate drivers to infer rates of land cover transitions. We
characterized multi-scale spatial correlation induced by plot and subplot
arrangement in our study system. We also developed a Polya-Gamma sampling
strategy to improve computation. Our model facilitates inference on the
response of ecosystems to shifts in the climate and can be used to predict
future land cover transitions under various climate scenarios.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07612v2,2019,"Wave measurements from ship mounted sensors in the Arctic marginal ice
  zone","  Increased research interest and economic activity in the Arctic raise the
need for new observations of sea ice dynamics. Remote sensing as well as
mathematical and numerical models of wave propagation in sea ice would benefit
from more in situ data for validation. This study presents wave measurements in
the marginal ice zone (MIZ) obtained from ship mounted sensors. The system
combines altimeter readings from the ship bow with ship motion correction data
to provide estimated single point ocean surface elevation. Significant wave
height and mean wave period, as well as one-dimensional wave spectra are
derived from the combined measurements. The results are compared with
integrated parameters from a spectral wave model over a period of eight days in
the open ocean, and with spectra and integrated parameters derived from motion
detecting instruments placed on ice floes inside the MIZ. Mean absolute errors
of the integrated parameters are in the range 15.0-18.9% when comparing with
the spectral wave model and 1.0-9.6% when comparing with valid motion detecting
instruments. The spatial wave damping coefficient is estimated by looking at
the change in spectral wave amplitude found at discrete frequency values as the
ship was moving along the longitudinal direction of the MIZ within time
intervals where the wave field is found to be approximately constant in time.
As expected from theory, high frequency waves are effectively dampened by the
presence of sea ice. The observed wave attenuation rates compare favourably
with a two-layer dissipation model. Our methodology can be regarded as a simple
and reliable way to collect more waves-in-ice data as it can be easily added to
any ship participating to ice expeditions, at little extra cost.

  Northwest European Shelf Seas from Top of Atmosphere Ocean Colour Reflectance","  Chlorophyll-a (Chl) retrieval from ocean colour remote sensing is problematic
for relatively turbid coastal waters due to the impact of non-algal materials
on atmospheric correction and standard Chl algorithm performance. Artificial
neural networks (NNs) provide an alternative approach for retrieval of Chl from
space and results in northwest European shelf seas over the 2002-2020 period
are shown. The NNs operate on 15 MODIS-Aqua visible and infrared bands and are
tested using bottom of atmosphere (BOA), top of atmosphere (TOA) and Rayleigh
corrected TOA reflectances (RC). In each case, a NN architecture consisting of
3 layers of 15 neurons improved performances and data availability compared to
current state-of-the-art algorithms used in the region. The NN operating on TOA
reflectance outperformed BOA and RC versions. By operating on TOA reflectance
data, the NN approach overcomes the common but difficult problem of atmospheric
correction in coastal waters. Moreover, the NN provides data for regions which
other algorithms often mask out for turbid water or low zenith angle flags. A
distinguishing feature of the NN approach is generation of associated product
uncertainties based on multiple resampling of the training data set to produce
a distribution of values for each pixel, and an example is shown for a coastal
time series in the North Sea. The final output of the NN approach consists of a
best-estimate image based on medians for each pixel and a second image
representing uncertainty based on standard deviation for each pixel, providing
pixel-specific estimates of uncertainty in the final product.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12590v1,2019,Assimilation of semi-qualitative sea ice thickness data with the EnKF-SQ,"  A newly introduced stochastic data assimilation method, the Ensemble Kalman
Filter Semi-Qualitative (EnKF-SQ) is applied to a realistic coupled ice-ocean
model of the Arctic, the TOPAZ4 configuration, in a twin experiment framework.
The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness
measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect
to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or
assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ
are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness
threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential
appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties
prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice
data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables,
lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is
adjusted for best performance of the system at hand. The sensitivity tests
reveal that the results do not depend critically on the choice of this tuning
parameter. The EnKF-SQ makes overall a valid approach for assimilating
semi-qualitative observations into high-dimensional nonlinear systems.
