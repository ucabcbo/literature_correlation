http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00047v1,2021,Super Resolution of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration,"  Arctic sea ice concentration is often coarsely observed and numerically
computed despite its importance for polar climate system. In this work we
present three machine-learning methods to recover the original high-resolution
images from the coarse-grained low-resolution counterparts. The promising
results indicate a possibility of extending the application to a broad range of
geophysical variables.
