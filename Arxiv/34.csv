data and obtain products with multiple data advantages. To solves the problem
of reduced resolution of PolSAR images due to system limitations, we propose a
fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images and
single-polarization synthetic aperture radar SAR (SinSAR) images fusion network
to generate high-resolution PolSAR (HR-PolSAR) images. To take advantage of the
polarimetric information of the low-resolution PolSAR (LR-PolSAR) image and the
spatial information of the high-resolution single-polarization SAR (HR-SinSAR)
image, we propose a fusion framework for joint LR-PolSAR image and HR-SinSAR
image and design a cross-attention mechanism to extract features from the joint
input data. Besides, based on the physical imaging mechanism, we designed the
PolSAR polarimetric loss function for constrained network training. The
experimental results confirm the superiority of fusion network over traditional
algorithms. The average PSNR is increased by more than 3.6db, and the average
MAE is reduced to less than 0.07. Experiments on polarimetric decomposition and
polarimetric signature show that it maintains polarimetric information well.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01759v1,2018,"A fast and accurate basis pursuit denoising algorithm with application
  to super-resolving tomographic SAR","  $L_1$ regularization is used for finding sparse solutions to an
underdetermined linear system. As sparse signals are widely expected in remote
sensing, this type of regularization scheme and its extensions have been widely
employed in many remote sensing problems, such as image fusion, target
detection, image super-resolution, and others and have led to promising
results. However, solving such sparse reconstruction problems is
computationally expensive and has limitations in its practical use. In this
paper, we proposed a novel efficient algorithm for solving the complex-valued
$L_1$ regularized least squares problem. Taking the high-dimensional
tomographic synthetic aperture radar (TomoSAR) as a practical example, we
carried out extensive experiments, both with simulation data and real data, to
demonstrate that the proposed approach can retain the accuracy of second order
methods while dramatically speeding up the processing by one or two orders.
Although we have chosen TomoSAR as the example, the proposed method can be
generally applied to any spectral estimation problems.
