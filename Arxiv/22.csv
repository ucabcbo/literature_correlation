Considering the `satellite passive microwave remote sensing data' as functional
data, we studied daily observation of sea ice cover of each year as a smooth
continuous function of time. We investigated the mean function for the sea ice
area for following decades and computed the corresponding $95\%$ bootstrap
confidence interval for the both Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. We found the mean
function for the sea ice area dropped statistically significantly in recent
decades for the Arctic Ocean. However, no such statistical evidence was found
for the Antarctic ocean. Essentially, the mean function for sea ice area in the
Antarctic Ocean is unchanged. Additional evidence of the melting of sea ice
area in the Arctic Ocean is provided by three types of phase curve (namely,
Area vs. Velocity, Area vs. Acceleration, and Velocity Vs. Acceleration). In
the Arctic Ocean, during the summer, the current decades is observing the size
of the sea ice area about $30\%$ less, than what it used to be during the first
decade. In this article, we have taken a distribution-free approach for our
analysis, except the data generating process, belongs to the Hilbert space.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12590v1,2019,Assimilation of semi-qualitative sea ice thickness data with the EnKF-SQ,"  A newly introduced stochastic data assimilation method, the Ensemble Kalman
Filter Semi-Qualitative (EnKF-SQ) is applied to a realistic coupled ice-ocean
model of the Arctic, the TOPAZ4 configuration, in a twin experiment framework.
The method is shown to add value to range-limited thin ice thickness
measurements, as obtained from passive microwave remote sensing, with respect
to more trivial solutions like neglecting the out-of-range values or
assimilating climatology instead. Some known properties inherent to the EnKF-SQ
are evaluated: the tendency to draw the solution closer to the thickness
threshold, the skewness of the resulting analysis ensemble and the potential
appearance of outliers. The experiments show that none of these properties
prove deleterious in light of the other sub-optimal characters of the sea ice
data assimilation system used here (non-linearities, non-Gaussian variables,
lack of strong coupling). The EnKF-SQ has a single tuning parameter that is
adjusted for best performance of the system at hand. The sensitivity tests
reveal that the results do not depend critically on the choice of this tuning
parameter. The EnKF-SQ makes overall a valid approach for assimilating
semi-qualitative observations into high-dimensional nonlinear systems.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07612v2,2019,"Wave measurements from ship mounted sensors in the Arctic marginal ice
  zone","  Increased research interest and economic activity in the Arctic raise the
need for new observations of sea ice dynamics. Remote sensing as well as
mathematical and numerical models of wave propagation in sea ice would benefit
from more in situ data for validation. This study presents wave measurements in
the marginal ice zone (MIZ) obtained from ship mounted sensors. The system
combines altimeter readings from the ship bow with ship motion correction data
to provide estimated single point ocean surface elevation. Significant wave
height and mean wave period, as well as one-dimensional wave spectra are
derived from the combined measurements. The results are compared with
integrated parameters from a spectral wave model over a period of eight days in
the open ocean, and with spectra and integrated parameters derived from motion
detecting instruments placed on ice floes inside the MIZ. Mean absolute errors
of the integrated parameters are in the range 15.0-18.9% when comparing with
the spectral wave model and 1.0-9.6% when comparing with valid motion detecting
instruments. The spatial wave damping coefficient is estimated by looking at
the change in spectral wave amplitude found at discrete frequency values as the
ship was moving along the longitudinal direction of the MIZ within time
intervals where the wave field is found to be approximately constant in time.
As expected from theory, high frequency waves are effectively dampened by the
presence of sea ice. The observed wave attenuation rates compare favourably
with a two-layer dissipation model. Our methodology can be regarded as a simple
and reliable way to collect more waves-in-ice data as it can be easily added to
any ship participating to ice expeditions, at little extra cost.

http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10839v1,2019,"Drift of pancake ice floes in the winter Antarctic marginal ice zone
  during polar cyclones","  High temporal resolution in--situ measurements of pancake ice drift are
presented, from a pair of buoys deployed on floes in the Antarctic marginal ice
zone during the winter sea ice expansion, over nine days in which the region
was impacted by four polar cyclones. Concomitant measurements of wave-in-ice
activity from the buoys is used to infer that pancake ice conditions were
maintained over at least the first seven days. Analysis of the data shows:
(i)~unprecedentedly fast drift speeds in the Southern Ocean; (ii)~high
correlation of drift velocities with the surface wind velocities, indicating
absence of internal ice stresses $>$100\,km in from the edge in 100\% remotely
sensed ice concentration; and (iii)~presence of a strong inertial signature
with a 13\,h period. A Langrangian free drift model is developed, including a
term for geostrophic currents that reproduces the 13\,h period signature in the
ice motion. The calibrated model is shown to provide accurate predictions of
the ice drift for up to 2\,days, and the calibrated parameters provide
estimates of wind and ocean drag for pancake floes under storm conditions.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01416v1,2021,Joint Characterization of the Cryospheric Spectral Feature Space,"  Hyperspectral feature spaces are useful for many remote sensing applications
ranging from spectral mixture modeling to discrete thematic classification. In
such cases, characterization of the feature space dimensionality, geometry and
topology can provide guidance for effective model design. The objective of this
study is to compare and contrast two approaches for identifying feature space
basis vectors via dimensionality reduction. These approaches can be combined to
render a joint characterization that reveals spectral properties not apparent
using either approach alone. We use a diverse collection of AVIRIS-NG
reflectance spectra of the snow-firn-ice continuum to illustrate the utility of
joint characterization and identify physical properties inferred from the
spectra. Spectral feature spaces combining principal components (PCs) and
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embeddings (t-SNEs) provide physically
interpretable dimensions representing the global (PC) structure of cryospheric
reflectance properties and local (t-SNE) manifold structures revealing
clustering not resolved in the global continuum. Joint characterization reveals
distinct continua for snow-firn gradients on different parts of the Greenland
Ice Sheet and multiple clusters of ice reflectance properties common to both
glacier and sea ice in different locations. Clustering revealed in t-SNE
feature spaces, and extended to the joint characterization, distinguishes
differences in spectral curvature specific to location within the snow
accumulation zone, and BRDF effects related to view geometry. The ability of
PC+t-SNE joint characterization to produce a physically interpretable spectral
feature spaces revealing global topology while preserving local manifold
structures suggests that this characterization might be extended to the much
higher dimensional hyperspectral feature space of all terrestrial land cover.

http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06371v1,2022,"Deep learning based automatic detection of offshore oil slicks using SAR
  data and contextual information","  Ocean surface monitoring, especially oil slick detection, has become
mandatory due to its importance for oil exploration and risk prevention on
ecosystems. For years, the detection task has been performed manually by
photo-interpreters using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with the help of
contextual data such as wind. This tedious manual work cannot handle the
increasing amount of data collected by the available sensors and thus requires
automation. Literature reports conventional and semi-automated detection
methods that generally focus either on oil slicks originating from
anthropogenic (spills) or natural (seeps) sources on limited data collections.
As an extension, this paper presents the automation of offshore oil slicks on
an extensive database with both kinds of slicks. It builds upon the slick
annotations of specialized photo-interpreters on Sentinel-1 SAR data for 4
years over 3 exploration and monitoring areas worldwide. All the considered SAR
images and related annotation relate to real oil slick monitoring scenarios.
Further, wind estimation is systematically computed to enrich the data
collection. Paper contributions are the following : (i) a performance
comparison of two deep learning approaches: semantic segmentation using
FC-DenseNet and instance segmentation using Mask-RCNN. (ii) the introduction of
meteorological information (wind speed) is deemed valuable for oil slick
detection in the performance evaluation. The main results of this study show
the effectiveness of slick detection by deep learning approaches, in particular
FC-DenseNet, which captures more than 92% of oil instances in our test set.
Furthermore, a strong correlation between model performances and contextual
information such as slick size and wind speed is demonstrated in the
performance evaluation. This work opens perspectives to design models that can
fuse SAR and wind information to reduce the false alarm rate.
