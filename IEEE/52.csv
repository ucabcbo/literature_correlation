While previous studies based on other satellites show some important spatial and temporal limitations, the use of operational Sentinel-2 data still remains unexplored in this regard. As a result, this work investigates the viability of using the Sentinel-2 instrument for a precise rice crop classification in Nepal. Initially, we define a dataset made of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data from the Terai region of Nepal. Then, we conduct several classification experiments to provide empirical evidences about the suitability of different classification models when identifying rice crops in developing countries, where only limited ground-truth data could be available. The experiments reveal the suitability of using Sentinel-2 for accurately mapping rice crops in Nepal with a CNN-based classification model.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323771","Sentinel-2 (S2);rice crop classification;deep learning;convolutional neural networks (CNN)","Agriculture;Spatial resolution;Support vector machines;Remote sensing;Earth;Feature extraction;Artificial satellites","crops;geophysical equipment;vegetation mapping","ground-truth data;accurately mapping rice crops;CNN-based classification model;Sentinel-2 multitemporal data;global coverage;monitoring key crops;emerging countries;Nepal's rice production;spatial limitations;temporal limitations;operational Sentinel-2 data;Sentinel-2 instrument;precise rice crop classification;classification experiments;Terai region","","","","12","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we address the problem of mites infestation detection using temporal hyperspectral data and also evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data for mites infestation detection. The reflectance data from grape leaves with healthy and low infestations of mites have been collected using spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral remote sensing data is collected from 213 bands with wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 1052 nm during 15th Jan - 18th Feb 2017. Variations observed in the spectral reflectance over time makes the detection based on multitemporal data difficult. Data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis but this large feature set may cause the over-fitting problem and also poses the requirement of large storage and greater processing time. To avoid this, feature selection using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) has been carried out to get the optimum band set. Features selected by LASSO were fed to classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to evaluate their performance. Results suggest that LR based model provides maximum accuracy of 93.24%. In addition to this, to investigate the potential of using Sentinel-2, data in 213 narrow bands were simulated to Sentinel-2. Data has been simulated to 10 and 20m spatial resolution bands available in 350-1050nm range. This simulated 8 band feature set has been fed to the same set of classifiers to evaluate their performance. Results suggests that LR provides maximum classification accuracy of 89.12% using simulated Sentinel-2 bands. Further to validate the algorithm using actual ground observations from the field, we have implemented simulated Sentinel-2 based algorithm on two Sentinel-2 images available during the study period and results are compared with actual ground observations about mites infestation. Results suggest mites detection accuracy of 83.33% which shows the good agreement and potential of Sentinel-2 for mites infestation detection.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519071","Hyperspectral Remote Sensing;Sentinel-2;Pest Infestation;Classification;Multi-temporal Sensing","Pipelines;Hyperspectral imaging;Spectroradiometers;Agriculture;Sensors;Radio frequency","data analysis;geophysical image processing;image resolution;neural nets;remote sensing;spectral analysis;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","Mite;temporal hyperspectral data;Sentinel-2 data;reflectance data;grape leaves;healthy infestations;low infestations;hyperspectral remote sensing data;multitemporal data;hyperspectral data analysis;feature selection;LR based model;Sentinel-2 bands;actual ground observations;Sentinel-2 based algorithm;Sentinel-2 images;mites detection;band feature set;optimum band set;narrow contiguous bands;mites infestation detection;Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator;LASSO;wavelength 350.0 nm to 1052.0 nm;size 350.0 nm to 1050.0 nm;size 10.0 m;size 20.0 m","","","","15","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the traditional means of ground survey and statistics method, remote sensing technology has the characteristics of macroscopic and real-time, which could quickly obtain the distribution of regional scale Astragalus sinicus planting. How to establish distinguishable remote sensing features is the basis of its recognition and extraction. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images covering the main growing period of the Astragalus sinicus from December 2019 to June 2020 were selected as data source. The variation of spectral characteristics of Astragalus sinicus were studied in the typical pilot area of green manure crop rotation in Liuhe District, Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province. On this basis, the multi-temporal vegetation index data set was constructed. The recursive feature elimination and random forest algorithm were used to analyze the influence of feature composition on recognition accuracy, and then the effective recognition feature set of Astragalus sinicus at different time phases was established. Through this study, we explored the recognition ability of multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images for Astragalus sinicus, and provided a theoretical basis for the study of regional-scale Astragalus sinicus remote sensing monitoring.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530363","Astragalus sinicus;Sentinel-2;multi-temporal remote sensing images;feature selection;Random Forest","Image recognition;Green products;Urban areas;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Soil;Feature extraction","agriculture;crops;ecology;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing;soil;statistical analysis;sustainable development;vegetation;vegetation mapping","regional-scale Astragalus sinicus;remote sensing feature selection;green manure crop Astragalus sinicus;multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery;main planting;crop rotation planting;soil microecological environment;farmland ecological environment;promoting agricultural sustainable development;remote sensing technology;regional scale Astragalus sinicus;distinguishable remote sensing features;multitemporal Sentinel 2 images;green manure crop rotation;multitemporal vegetation index data;effective recognition feature","","1","","21","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Sundarbans is called the shelter of Bangladesh as it protects southern coastal regions from natural disasters such as Cyclones, and typhoons. However, the mighty Sundarbans are dying because of climate changes, excessive human activities and the overwhelming consumption of natural forest resources. The primary objective of this study is to classify and detect deforested areas due to natural and anthropogenic causes. This study used Sentinel 2A Imageries of year 2016 & 2022 to detect forest cover changes in between the time period. In this study, the transfer learning method was applied to classify deforested areas. The transfer learning method uses the knowledge of a pre-trained model to build the new model. The UNet was the base model where weight from the pre-trained ResNet34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset (https://www.image-net.org/) was used as the backend. The dataset was divided into two sets where 80% of data was used in training and 20% was used for model validation. Average training and validation accuracy for both 2016 and 2022 data were close to 98%. The predicted images and ground truth data were similar and the model captured rivers, deforested areas, and vegetation approximately. We found that there were 1426.71 sq. mi of forest covers in the year-2016 which reduced to 1394.26 sq. mi in 2022 (3.5% of total area). This study also found interesting information about natural reforestation. We found that between 2016–2022, 56.89 sq. mi of forest cover was deforested whereas 24.44 sq. mi of deforested land cover was converted back into forest cover.

The scenes were unmixed using a non-negative least square (nnls) algorithm for different landcover components per pixel. The results were validated with a SVM classification of UAV-based hyperspectral mosaics acquired in March 2016. The results show that it is possible to map the coverage of the Pinus radiata class up to an accuracy of R2 ~ 0.6 and RMSE of ~10 %. Generally, a higher number of Sentinel-2 images increased the performance of the model, while there was no significant dependency on a specific acquisition date.

These dynamics could, in principle, be exploited to classify different types of crops. Thus, this study aims to investigate methodologies and results of crop type classification making use of phenological information extracted from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. Vegetation indices (VI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 imagery are evaluated to track the year-round vegetation behavior. Starting from a multi-temporal image series of the same scene, the phenological profiles can be extracted and introduced into a supervised classification process to detect crop fields, discriminating among different species. Following this, we propose a cross-correlation based model that, using a priori information from ground training data, searches for the best matching phenology. When compared to machine learning models for crop classification, the one proposed in this study can provide useful information about phenology that can be stored and used for better monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crops species through the future years and guiding agricultural management accordingly. Our case studies are the regions of Bothaville and Harrismith, located in South Africa, and the region of Jendouba in Tunisia. The results for the Bothaville region show 89.19% of user accuracy on the main crop type classification (maize crops). For beans and sorghum, the confusion matrix attests 93% and 74% of accuracy respectively, even if their statistics are less significant due to the limited number of available ground data for secondary crops.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884724","Sentinel-2;agriculture;classification;phenology;cross-correlation","Satellites;Crops;Vegetation mapping;Training data;Machine learning;Data models;Behavioral sciences","agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;time series;vegetation;vegetation mapping","cross-correlation phenology-based crop fields classification;Sentinel-2 time-series;agricultural areas;relatively short time intervals;growing season;crop type classification making use;phenological information;high spatial resolution satellite imagery;vegetation indices;Sentinel-2 imagery;year-round vegetation behavior;multitemporal image series;phenological profiles;supervised classification process;cross-correlation based model;matching phenology;machine learning models;crop classification;monitoring spatio-temporal variations;crops species;future years;guiding agricultural management;main crop type classification;maize crops;secondary crops","","","","17","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is of significance to accurately and timely obtain the LULC maps on the earth’s surface, in particular for those regions where dramatic LULC changes are undergoing. Since 2017 April, a new state-level new area, Xiong’an New Area, was established in China, which would inevitably lead to some LULC changes in this region. In order to better understand what kinds of LULC change in this region with more details and further evaluate the potential impacts that the LULC changes will bring, this study makes full use of the 10-m multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images on the cloud-computing Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the powerful classification capability of Random Forest (RF) models, to generate the continuous LULC maps in Xiong’an New Area from 2017 to 2020. The derived LULC map for each year in Xiong’an New Area achieves high accuracy, with OA and Kappa values less than 0.9. Based on the obtained LULC maps, this study analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of LULC types in the last four years. It revealed that the estimated dry farmland has decreased from 2017 to 2018 and then kept almost stable, and the majority of it has converted to non-cropland, especially to the tree seedlings and landscape dual-use regions. The estimated impervious areas that were mainly composed of buildings and transport infrastructures first increased due to the newly constructed Xiong’an Station with some high-speed roads and then decreased from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the relocation of some small villages. Accordingly, some building groups and aggregations were going to show in this region, and are expected to further developed in the future. Other LULC types such as lakes and forests have not changed dramatically, indicating that the environmental protection in Xiong’an New Area was, to date, satisfactory. The obtained 10-m and 4-year LULC maps in this study can provide some valuable information on the monitoring and understanding of what kinds of changes were and will be undergoing in Xiong’an New Area, and can also be used for evaluating the potential impacts and challenges such as environmental protection. Additionally, the utilization of GEE and the multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images can help to achieve LULC mapping in this region in an accurate and timely manner, which can be used in future studies.","","978-1-7281-6561-5","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics50104.2021.9530306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530306","Land Use and Land Cover Change;Xiong’an New District;Google Earth Engine;Multi-temporal classification","Earth;Roads;Climate change;Vegetation mapping;Land surface;Radiometry;Internet","cloud computing;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;land use;remote sensing;terrain mapping","Xiongan New Area;LULC mapping;state-level new area;Sentinel-2 images;cloud computing;Google Earth Engine;Land Use and Land Cover change analysis;AD 2017 to 2020;China;GEE;random forest;tree seedlings;lakes;forests","","","","26","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While hyperspectral exploratory sensors are demonstrating their potential, satellite remote sensing has simultaneously entered a new era. Multispectral sensors with short revisiting period are now acquiring free, open, global and systematic high resolution visible and infrared imagery. More specifically, Sentinel-2 sensors broke down the barrier between hyper- and multispectral imaging. This sensor optimizes its number of potential applications thanks to numerous narrow bands spanning on a significant range of the spectrum at a high spatial resolution. The recent release of this high performance multispectral instrument calls thus the relevance of hyperspectral spaceborne imaging of medium spatial resolution into question and suggests potential synergies between those two kinds of data. In order to clarify this concern, we tried to identify through a comprehensive review the current and future applications for hyperspectral sensors in the Sentinel-2 context. This study therefore reviews 20 years of researches and applications in satellite hyperspectral remote sensing through the analysis of Earth observation (EO) hyperspectral sensors' publications that cover the Sentinel-2 spectrum range: Hyperion, TianGong-1, PRISMA, HYSI, EnMAP, HISUI, Shalom and HyspIRI. More specifically, this study (i) identifies the most useful wavelengths that are not available on Sentinel-2 and (ii) assesses the assets and the limitations of hyperspectral spaceborne sensors for operational EO. Applications using Sentinel-2 are still uncovered, including some demonstrations made with hyperspectral systems. However, the medium spatial resolution and the long revisit time of hyperspectral sensors, and the low signal-to-noise ratio in the short-wave infrared of Hyperion were highlighted as major limitations for hyperspectral applications compared to the Sentinel-2 system. Forthcoming hyperspectral sensors will probably overcome these constraints. This study is putting forward the compatibility of hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 systems for resolution enhancement techniques, and thus for increasing even more the panel of hyperspectral uses, but also the promising future of hyperspectral remote sensing.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035244","hyperspectral imaging;hyperspectral applications;Hyperion;EnMAP;HISUI;PRISMA;TianGong-1;Shalom;HyspIRI;Sentinel-2;Earth observation;multi-temporal data","Hyperspectral imaging;Spatial resolution;Sensors;Vegetation mapping;Signal to noise ratio","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;infrared imaging;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar","hyperspectral Earth observation application;hyperspectral exploratory sensor;systematic high resolution visible imagery;systematic high resolution infrared imagery;Sentinel-2 sensor;hyperspectral spaceborne imaging;hyperspectral Earth observation remote sensing technique;systematic high resolution visible imagery;systematic high infrared imagery resolution;multispectral sensor;multispectral imaging;multispectral instrument;satellite hyperspectral remote sensing;Earth observation hyperspectral sensor;Sentinel-2 spectrum range;hyperspectral spaceborne sensor;HISUI;EnMAP;HYSI;PRISMA;TianGong-1;HyspIRI;signal-to-noise ratio;hyperspectral remote sensing","","2","","106","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate maps of grazing lawn distribution is essential to enhance understanding of important ecosystem processes such as mega-herbivore population dynamics, nutrient cycling and plant community composition. The inherent heterogeneity of savannah landscapes however creates significant challenges for accurate discrimination of vegetation components and thus grazing lawn detection. Recent studies favour very high spatial resolution (VHR) multi-spectral imagery for dealing with this challenge. However, such data are costly for use in operational management. Planet Labs, through Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), now grant free access to high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics over the tropics, with great potential for fine-scale vegetation mapping. However, the spectral characteristics of these data are limited and fail to resolve the spectral similarity of different savannah vegetation components. We address these issues using Gram-Schmidt transformation to fuse Planet Basemaps and Sentinel-2A images for grazing lawn detection within the Lower Sabie region of Kruger National Park, South Africa. The original and fused images were classified using a random forest approach. Overall, the fused image achieved the best grazing lawn detection accuracy (0.85) and general map accuracy (0.72) results compared to Sentinel-2 (0.67 and 0.62) and Planet basemap (0.64 and 0.62 respectively). Our findings provide a foundation for cost-effective and accurate high spatial resolution vegetation mapping in heterogenous savannah landscapes.

Satellite remote sensing data, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery, have been used for identifying landslides. SAR data possess several benefits, such as the ability to penetrate the clouds, operate day and night, and regular revisit time. However, processing SAR data require large amounts of data downloaded to the local system to be processed on a local computer. This study explored the SAR-based amplitude change detection approach using multi-temporal and multi-orbit (ascending and descending) Sentinel-1 data to identify landslides utilizing the cloud computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE), which aimed to assist in rapid response in mapping and inventorying landslide location data. This study took two case studies in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province, and Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province. Additional topographic data was used to filter out the flat areas which were unlikely to suffer from landslides. For comparison, this study also identified landslides using Sentinel-2 supported optical images on the GEE platform. In this study, the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy is 97.66% on Sentinel-2 and 68.75% on Sentinel-1 for the case study in the Lebak Regency, Banten Province. In comparison, the case study in the Masamba Regency, South Sulawesi Province, shows the overall value of landslide mapping accuracy of 96.69% in Sentinel-2 and 87.6% on Sentinel-1. Thus, the benefits of Sentinel-2 over Sentinel-1 are associated with the resulting accuracy. Still, optical-based images have a weakness in quick response efforts because optical images require sunlight and cloud/shadow-free conditions to spot landslides accurately.","2474-2333","978-1-7281-7333-7","10.1109/APSAR52370.2021.9688356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9688356","Landslide Mapping;Synthetic Aperture Radar;Google Earth Engine;Sentinel-1;Sentinel-2","Optical filters;Earth;Cloud computing;Laser radar;Satellites;Optical imaging;Terrain factors","cloud computing;disasters;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","landslide mapping accuracy;Sentinel-2 data;landslides identification;Google Earth Engine;accurate landslide mapping;landslide events;satellite remote sensing data;optical imagery;identifying landslides;SAR data;SAR-based amplitude change detection approach;Sentinel-1 data;inventorying landslide location data;South Sulawesi Province;additional topographic data;identified landslides;Sentinel-2 supported optical images","","","","46","IEEE","26 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results revealed that the multi-temporal coherence approach has the promising capability to map building damage but is not as accurate for detecting building damage under a vegetation canopy. Meanwhile, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) still provides meaningful damage maps independent of the canopy, however, the accuracy was slightly lower than the multi-temporal coherence approach for the buildings not covered by the canopy.

We propose a supervised Deep-Learning (DL) classification method that jointly performs a multi-scale and multi-temporal analysis of RS multi-temporal images acquired by different sensors. The proposed method processes Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images using a Residual Network (ResNet) with a wide receptive field that handles geometrical details and multi-temporal High-Resolution (HR) image using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) that analyzes both the spatial and temporal information. The multi-scale and multi-temporal features are processed together in a decoder to retrieve a land-cover map. We tested the proposed method on two multi-sensor and multi-temporal datasets. One is composed of VHR orthophotos and Sentinel-2 multi-temporal images for pasture classification, and another is composed of VHR orthophotos and Sentinel-1 multi-temporal images.

For a sustainable agricultural production, continuous monitoring of crops and trees is critical to have updated information and producing effective agricultural plans. Remote sensing is an efficient option for this purpose and is a very popular technique. Olive is an essential agricultural product for the economy of Mediterranean countries such as Turkey. Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and}{Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products. In this study, combinations of time series of Sentinel-1 satellite images, Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI products obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to investigate the classification accuracy of olive trees. According to analysis results, a significant correlation with R2 = 0.67 found between NDVI and SAR data (sigma nought VH/VV in decibel scale). This result pointed out probable accuracy improvement in classification of fused data from different sensors. In the next step, supervised random forest classification was applied on the fused data combinations and results showed that Sentinel-1 - Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 - NDVI and Sentinel-2 - NDVI combinations achieved the highest overall accuracy with 73 %, while standalone Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series classification accuracies are 48 % and 68 % respectively.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820712","Olive tree determination;Multi-sensor data fusion;Multi-temporal satellite image;Sentinel-1 image;Sentinel2 image;Random forest classification","Vegetation;Agriculture;Satellites;Data integration;Correlation;Sensors;Production","agricultural products;agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar;time series;vegetation mapping","olive trees;multisensor data fusion;sustainable agricultural production;Mediterranean countries;Sentinel-1 satellite images;Sentinel-2 satellite images;NDVI products;fused data combinations;agricultural product;NDVI data;Sentinel-2 image time series classification;Sentinel-1 image time series classification;agricultural plans;crop continuous monitoring","","3","","9","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike previous work using generative networks, we design the feature extractor to maintain the weight of the cloudless region while reducing the weight of the cloudy region, and we pass the extracted features to a conformer module to find the most critical representations. Mean-while, to address the lack of datasets, we collected a new dataset named Sen2_MTC from the Sentinel-2 satellite and manually labeled each cloudy and cloud-free image. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on FS-2, the STGAN dataset, and Sen2_MTC.

However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoacán, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images. The obtained land cover maps with forests at different stage of degradation were compared to derive information of forest degradation and regeneration.","","978-1-5386-6642-5","10.1109/EORSA.2018.8598620","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8598620","Forest degradation;regeneration;MODIS;LANDSAT-8;Sentinel-2","Forestry;Degradation;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Agriculture;Earth;Artificial satellites","forestry;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","national forest;forest degradation patterns;national forest cover monitoring;remote sensing;forest regeneration;land cover map;MODIS data;Sentinel-2;Landsat-8;Michoacán;Mexico","","","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Burn area mapping is a major parameter in carrying out mitigation measures and regrowth activities by forest officials or fire managers post fire event. In this study, multi-temporal satellite datasets such as images acquired from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) missions are used to map the burn areas. Two thematic indices such as Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR) are implemented on the study area. The entire analysis, i.e., accessing the datasets, preprocessing, and calculation of indices for brunt area mapping is carried out on Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Rather than ground survey, the active fire product VIIRS product (VNP14IMGTDL) is used as a proxy for the actual fire indices in accuracy assessment. Results revealed that RBR showed better accuracy than dNBR for both the datasets (S2 and L8). S2 burn severity maps of dNBR and RBR showed better accuracy than L8 burn severity maps because of S2 having a higher spatial resolution. Thus, S2 datasets can be useful for rapid mapping of burn areas with improved spatial as well as temporal resolution.","","978-1-7281-5970-6","10.1109/ICSIDEMPC49020.2020.9299625","Ministry of Human Resource Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299625","Sentinel-2;Forest fires;Rapid Mapping;Google Earth Engine","Remote sensing;Earth;Forestry;Vegetation mapping;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Artificial satellites","fires;geophysical image processing;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping;wildfires","Burn area mapping;Google Earth Engine cloud platform;2019 forest fires;eastern Australia;rainforests;disastrous bush fire event;forest officials;fire managers;multitemporal satellite datasets;Sentinel-2;Landsat-8 missions;burn areas;brunt area mapping;active fire product VIIRS product;actual fire indices;S2 burn severity maps;L8 burn severity maps;rapid mapping","","","","25","IEEE","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Methods for detecting changes in multi-temporal satellite images are very useful tools when characterization and monitoring of urban growth patterns is concerned. Increasing worldwide availability of multispectral images with a high revisit frequency opened up more possibilities in the study of urban CD. Even though there exists several deep learning methods for CD, most of these available methods fail to predict the edges and preserve the shape of the changed area from multispectral images. This article introduces a deep learning model called urban CD network (UCDNet) for urban CD from bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images. The model is based on an encoder–decoder architecture which uses modified residual connections and the new spatial pyramid pooling (NSPP) block, giving better predictions while preserving the shape of changed areas. The modified residual connections help locate the changes correctly, and the NSPP block can extract multiscale features and will give awareness about global context. UCDNet uses a proposed loss function which is a combination of weighted class categorical cross-entropy (WCCE) and modified Kappa loss. The Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD) dataset is used to train, evaluate, and compare the proposed model with the benchmark models. UCDNet gives better results from the reference models used here for comparison. It gives an accuracy of 99.3%, an  $F1$  score ( $F1$ ) of 89.21%, a Kappa coefficient (Ka) of 88.85%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 80.53% on the OSCD dataset.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3161337","RESPOND Scheme of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Government of India (December 30, 2019)(grant numbers:ISRO/RES/4/683/19-20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740122","Change detection (CD);deep learning;multi-spectral satellite images;spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)","Feature extraction;Convolution;Satellites;Remote sensing;Deep learning;Streaming media;Shape","deep learning (artificial intelligence);entropy;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;object detection;remote sensing;town and country planning","JI;Jaccard index;Kappa coefficient;OSCD dataset;F1 score;Onera satellite change detection dataset;modified Kappa loss;WCCE;weighted class categorical cross-entropy;NSPP block;new spatial pyramid pooling block;encoder-decoder architecture;earth observation;urban change detection;modified residual connections;bi-temporal multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images;UCDNet;urban CD network;deep learning model;multitemporal satellite images","","1","","55","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a new unsupervised change detection framework based on the joint use of SAR and optical images. The framework exploits a contrastive learning algorithm and the assumption of the scarcity of relevant changes. The proposed architecture is a pseudo-Siamese network, which is trained to regress the feature vector of bi-temporal concatenated SAR-optical input data. The output feature vectors from two branches of the pseudo-Siamese network are used to calculate change intensity maps. Then, the binary change map is obtained by setting a proper threshold. The proposed method is validated by using a multi-sensor dataset made up of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images that is also compared with the single use of each modality image. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of the multisensor approach over single modality and confirm the potentiality of the joint use of SAR and optical images in change detection.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553542","Change Detection;Data Fusion;Self-supervised Learning;Sentinel-1/-2;Remote Sensing","Change detection algorithms;Geoscience and remote sensing;Optical imaging;Feature extraction;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","6","","7","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatio-temporal contextual information has been recognized as useful features in identification of urban land expansion. This paper adopts a multi-band temporal texture measure with pseudo cross multivariate variogram (PCMV) to quantify local spatiotemporal dependence between bi-temporal multispectral images. The multi-band temporal texture features obtained are combined with bi-temporal multispectral images to detect urban built-up area change using direct multi-temporal image classification. One-class random forest (OCRF), a recently proposed one-class classifier, is used in multi-temporal image classification by sampling one specific class of interest, i.e., built-up area expansion. Experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of multi-band temporal textures outperformed that using spectral features alone, with increases of 10.55% and 1.74% in overall accuracy, for SPOT-5 and Sentinel-2 data, respectively. Similarly, its overall accuracy is 11.08% and 0.24% higher than incorporating single-band temporal textures. The inclusion of PCMV multi-band temporal texture in direct multi-temporal image classification by OCRF is found effective in urban built-up area change detection.","","978-1-7281-4615-7","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2019.8866936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8866936","multi-temporal data;multi-band temporal texture;PCMV;OCRF;built-up area change","","geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;pattern classification;remote sensing;spatiotemporal phenomena;vegetation mapping","PCMV multiband temporal texture;direct multitemporal image classification;area change detection;one-class random forest;high spatial resolution multitemporal data;urban land change;spatio-temporal contextual information;urban land expansion;multiband temporal texture measure;bi-temporal multispectral images;multiband temporal texture features;area expansion;single-band temporal textures","","2","","13","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Crop discrimination as an agricultural monitoring system is a critical step regarding to estimate the area allocated to each crop type, computing statistics for crop control of area-based subsidies or crop production forecasting, environmental impact analysis and some other applications. Integrating both optical (reflectance) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (backscatter) multi-temporal features provides some advantages in terms of a more reliable crop map. We utilize multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Sentinel-2 optical datasets in order to investigate the performance of the sensors backscatter and reflectance for temporal crop type mapping and the sustainable management of agricultural activities.

Obtaining multi-temporal data via satellite images in different spatial domains with various scales is one of the key developments of monitoring spatial variability of soil salinity. In addition, geo-statistical methods have the capability of producing prediction surfaces from limited sample data. This study aims to map spatial distribution of soil salinity in the selected pilot area which is located in the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, by applying geo-statistical methods. A kriging based map and three different co-kriging based maps were produced using electrical conductivity (EC) measurements as primary variable and three different soil salinity index values as secondary variable. Three soil salinity indices were created by using Sentinel-2A image that were acquired in the same date of field measurements to generate 3 various soil salinity prediction maps. Salinity maps obtained from geo-statistical methods were compared and validated to understand the performance of these approaches for soil salinity prediction. The results of this study demonstrated that co-kriging can provide promising estimation of spatial variability of soil salinity especially when there is relevant and abundant set of secondary data derived from satellite images.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820609","Soil Salinity;Co-kriging;Remote Sensing;Salinity Indices;Sentinel 2-A;Urmia Lake Basin","Salinity (geophysical);Soil;Lakes;Indexes;Monitoring;Graphical models;Distribution functions","electrical conductivity;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;lakes;remote sensing;salinity (geophysical);soil;statistical analysis","geo-statistical methods;soil sustainability;geo-statistical approaches;economic prediction;different spatial domains;spatial variability;map spatial distribution;different co-kriging based maps;primary variable soil salinity index values;three different soil salinity index values;soil salinity indices;soil salinity prediction;salinity maps;current 2.0 A","","","","25","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As well, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were used. The NDVI products obtained from these three sensors were validated and compared with land cover and land use map of the same area for visual interpretation. The main results of this study showed that the NDVI in the mid-2010 was low within area-of-the interests in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant, but the vegetated area continued to expand until 2021. It can be interpreted as a result of a decrease in human activities. In particular, the map of differences between the mid-2010 and 2021 of high-resolution images revealed detailed spatial features rather than those of the mid-resolution images. In disaster areas where access is restricted, such as the areas around the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and where it is difficult to collect field data, obtaining classification products with high accuracy using satellite images is challenging. It helps to analyze them using primary products such as vegetation indices exactly determined from the high-resolution satellite imagery.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883313","KOMPSAT-3/3A;Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant;NDVI;Surface Reflectance","Reflectivity;Earth;Visualization;Satellites;Artificial satellites;Vegetation mapping;Sensors","disasters;geophysical image processing;image resolution;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","disaster areas;Fukushima nuclear power plant;vegetation indices;high-resolution satellite imagery;temporal change;space-borne Vegetation Index;Fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant;high-resolution satellite images;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;vegetation changes;Sentinel-2 images;NDVI products;land cover;land use map;area-of-the interests;vegetated area;high-resolution images;mid-resolution images;wavelength 3.0 A","","","","12","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents a framework for automatic corn phenology characterization based on high spatial and temporal resolution time series. By using the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) estimated from Sentinel-2 data over Iowa (US), independent phenological models were optimized using Gaussian Processes regression. Their respective performances were assessed based on simulated phenological indicators estimated with double logistic approach. The results showed good model performances for the estimation of different phenological phases such as Start-of-Season and End-of-Season, with a mean RMSE and $R^{2}$ values of about 3.50 days and 0.86, respectively, and this with a gain in runtime of about 380 times faster than the double logistic method.

The glaciers are melting faster than expected which has resulted in global mean sea level rise and increased the risk of floods. The development of modern remote sensing technology has made it possible to obtain images more frequently than ever before. On the other side, the availability of high-performance computing hardware and processing techniques have made it possible to provide a cost-effective solution to monitor the temporal changes of glaciers at a large scale. In this study, supervised machine learning methods are investigated for automatic classification of glacier covers from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery using texture, topographic, and spectral data. Three most commonly used supervised machine learning techniques were investigated: support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF). The proposed method was employed on the data obtained from Passu watershed in Hunza Basin located along the Hunza river in Pakistan. Three main classes were considered: glaciers, debris-covered glaciers and non-glaciated areas. The data was split into training (70%) and testing datasets (30%). Finally, an area-based accuracy assessment was performed by comparing the results obtained for each classifier with the reference data. Experiments showed that the results produced for all classifiers were highly accurate and visually more consistent with the depiction of glacier cover types. For all experiments, random forest performed the best (Kappa = 0.95, f-measure = 95.06%) on all three classes compared to ANN (Kappa = 0.92, f-measure = 92.05) and SVM (Kappa = 0.89, f-measure = 91.86% on average). The high classification accuracy obtained to distinguished debris-covered glaciers using our approach will be useful to determine the actual available water resources which can be further helpful for hazard and water resource management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965768","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955892","Artificial neural network (ANN);glacier mapping and remote sensing;random forest (RF);support vector machine (SVM)","Remote sensing;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Support vector machines;Global warming;Earth;Vegetation mapping;Artificial neural networks;Random forests","floods;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;glaciology;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;random forests;rivers;support vector machines;terrain mapping;topography (Earth);water resources","machine-learning algorithms;mapping debris-covered glaciers;Hunza Basin case study;global warming;global mean sea level rise;modern remote sensing technology;high-performance computing hardware;cost-effective solution;temporal changes;supervised machine learning methods;automatic classification;glacier covers;multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery;spectral data;commonly used supervised machine learning techniques;SVM;ANN;random forest;Hunza river;main classes;nonglaciated areas;testing datasets;area-based accuracy assessment;reference data;glacier cover types;high classification accuracy;texture data;topographic data;support vector machine;artificial neural network;Passu watershed;Pakistan;debris-covered glaciers","","29","","41","CCBY","10 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we develop a novel crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology. However, for crop mapping, the selection and labeling of training samples is expensive and time consuming. Therefore, we propose a fully automated training-sample-selection method. First, we design the method according to image processing algorithms and the concept of a sliding window. Second, we develop the Geo-3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and Geo-Conv1D for crop classification using time-series Sentinel-2 imagery. Specifically, we integrate geographic information of crops into the structure of deep-learning networks. Finally, we apply an active learning strategy to integrate the classification advantages of Geo-3D CNN and Geo-Conv1D. Experiments conducted in Northeast China show that the proposed sampling method can reliably provide and label a large number of samples and achieve satisfactory results for different deep-learning networks. Based on the automatic selection and labeling of training samples, the crop classification method based on spatiotemporal deep-learning fusion technology can achieve the highest overall accuracy (OA) with approximately 92.50% as compared with Geo-Conv1D (91.89%) and Geo-3D CNN (91.27%) in the three study areas, indicating that the proposed method is effective and efficient in multi-temporal crop classification.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3113014","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871225,41871248,41771400); Project of Jilin Province Development and Reform Commission(grant numbers:2021C044-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9563080","Active learning;Crops;Classification algorithms;Data fusion;Deep learning;Training samples","Crops;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Training;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution","agriculture;crops;geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;remote sensing;sampling methods","Geo-3D convolutional neural network;Geo-Conv1D;time-series Sentinel-2 imagery;deep-learning networks;active learning strategy;classification advantages;Geo-3D CNN;sampling method;automatic selection;fusion technology;multitemporal crop classification;timely crop mapping;deep-learning methods;remotely sensed data sources;novel crop classification method;fully automated training-sample-selection method;image processing algorithms","","1","","54","IEEE","7 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
