This paper presents a novel method for earthquake damage assessment by using multi-angle SAR images. The scatter of building, especially for the damaged buildings, will change with the elevation angle and squint angle, which means a serious lack of information. In order to get more information, the multi-angle SAR images should be obtained. Moreover, a fast and accurate image information algorithm should be used.

A novel azimuth multi-angle spaceborne SAR imaging mode is introduced to get sequential images, and effects of azimuth velocity on targets are presented as well. Moreover, azimuth velocity measurement method is derived to get the initial estimation value of the azimuth velocity. By using the initial estimation value, a refocusing approach is given, by compensating the quadratic residual phase and the time-shift phase caused by object moving. Consequently, a more precise azimuth velocity estimation result can be get by implementing the azimuth velocity measurement method again.

To solve this problem, by introducing the improved attributed scattering model into the traditional SAR echo model, we propose our multi-angle sparse image reconstruction method (MASIRM). Through modeling the illuminated scene with point scatterers and line-segment-scatterers, a multi-angle echo model is first presented. By generating an adaptive mixed dictionary and applying the pattern-coupled sparse Bayesian learning, the MASIRM obtains more geometric information of the distributed target with higher quality sparse SAR images.

When the phase contributions from surface deformation, topography, and ionospheric delays are negligible or known, the interferogram can be used to estimate the differential tropospheric delay (DTD), which can help to improve tropospheric delay predictions from weather models and in situ measurements. In conventional repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR), however, the estimation of the DTD can still be significantly hindered by baseline errors. In addition, a single interferogram provides only relative DTDs, as the delays can be retrieved up to an unknown offset. To address such issues, this article presents a method for the estimation of DTDs on large scales by using repeat-pass simultaneous multi-angle SAR systems. Complementary simultaneous observations of the correlated troposphere from multiple angles are used to retrieve estimates of the absolute DTD and, at the same time, to mitigate the effect of baseline knowledge errors. Finally, a performance evaluation is presented for the Harmony Earth Explorer 10 candidate mission. A centimeter-level absolute accuracy and a submillimeter-level relative accuracy of the DTD estimation are achieved under the multistatic Harmony case when at least one companion satellite has an inter-satellite distance longer than 300 km to provide enough sensitivity.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3105007","European Space Agency Earth Explorer 10 Candidate Mission Harmony Phase 0 Science Studies; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61960206009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521670","Interferometric phase error;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);multi-angle observation system;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);troposphere","Delays;Atmospheric modeling;Satellites;Estimation;Synthetic aperture radar;Strain;Terrestrial atmosphere","atmospheric techniques;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;troposphere","weather models;tropospheric delay predictions;ionospheric delays;surface deformation;phase contributions;synthetic aperture radar interferometry;interferometric phase;tropospheric delays;simultaneous multiangle repeat-pass InSAR;differential tropospheric delay estimation;DTD estimation;submillimeter-level relative accuracy;baseline knowledge errors;absolute DTD;multiple angles;correlated troposphere;complementary simultaneous observations;multiangle SAR systems;relative DTDs;single interferogram;baseline errors;conventional repeat-pass interferometric SAR","","","","39","IEEE","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limitations of these estimators lead to unclear contour of the disturbed region, and even the omission of fine change targets. In this paper, a CCD approach is proposed to detect fine scene changes from multi-temporal and multi-angle SAR image pairs. Multi-angle CCD estimator can improve the contrast between the change target and the background clutter by jointly accumulating singleangle alternative estimator results without further loss of image resolution.

The distance between transmit and receiving antenna is fixed, and the location of the antennas is changed to obtain 2D or 3D SA-GPR images. On the other hand, multi-angle SA-GPR is new methods to obtain a clear image. In this technique, the distance between the transmitting and the receiving antennas are also changed.

The problem of sparse scatterer imaging is formulated as an optimization problem of reconstructing group sparse signals. A logistic Gaussian kernel model, which involves a logistic function and location-dependent Gaussian kernel, and takes the correlation between entire scatterers into account, is then used to encourage the underlying continuity structure of illuminated target scene in a nonparametric Bayesian learning framework.

Our team has previously proposed the logarithm background subtraction algorithm for moving target detection in single-channel circular SAR. Its principle is that the background image (static clutter) is obtained by median filtering of the image sequence, and the foreground image (moving target) is obtained by subtraction. To further improve the performance of background and foreground separation, we introduce the low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD) method into the previous framework. A new algorithm based on LRSD and adaptive threshold detector (ATD) is proposed in this letter. First, this letter introduces entropy metric to optimize parameters in LRSD to obtain better background and foreground separation. Second, since the statistical distribution of the foreground image is unknown, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector cannot be applied to the foreground image. Therefore, an adaptive threshold detector (ATD) built on Otsu is presented in this letter, which is independent of image statistical properties. The final detection result is obtained via clustering using the modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by the experimental results on the airborne X-band Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3153092","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61860206013); North China University of Technology Research Startup Funds(grant numbers:110051360002); Fundamental Research Fund of Beijing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:110052972027/119); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718099","Circular synthetic aperture radar (SAR);adaptive threshold detector (ATD);low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD);moving target detection;single channel","Object detection;Synthetic aperture radar;Clutter;Sparse matrices;Image sequences;Image segmentation;Detectors","entropy;image reconstruction;image sequences;motion estimation;object detection;pattern clustering;radar detection;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","single-channel circular SAR ground moving target detection;LRSD;adaptive threshold detector;multiangle observation;circular synthetic aperture radar;logarithm background subtraction algorithm;background image;image sequence;foreground image;foreground separation;low-rank sparse decomposition method;constant false alarm rate detector;image statistical properties;final detection result;airborne X-band Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data","","1","","16","IEEE","21 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the conventional SAR with low-squint narrow beams, the azimuth antenna pattern and the elevation antenna pattern play separate roles in scattering measurements. In recent years, a novel spaceborne SAR imaging mode — azimuthal multi-angle observation — has been proposed based on the capability of beam steering. However, in the case of squint and high resolution, the antenna pattern becomes two-dimensional (2-D) inseparable along with the beam steering. Therefore, a spatially varying radiometric error is induced, which makes the calibration more complicated. This paper analyzed the impact of 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. First, the antenna pattern angles varying with the observation angles are analyzed. Then, an equivalent antenna pattern model for squint steering beam seen by an on-ground point scatterer is proposed. Finally, the relative radiometric error induced by the 2-D antenna pattern is assessed based on the integral method. The results show that the impact is related to the squint angle and azimuth resolution. The larger the squint angle, the higher the resolution, and the higher the impact of the 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. In addition, the beam steering needs to be controlled not only in azimuth but also in elevation. Otherwise, the radiometric error can increase several times.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-7247-7","10.1109/PIERS53385.2021.9694847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9694847","","Antenna measurements;Beam steering;Azimuth;Spaceborne radar;Two dimensional displays;Radiometry;Calibration","antenna radiation patterns;beam steering;calibration;radar antennas;radar imaging;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","radiometric error;radiometric calibration;azimuthal multiangle observation spaceborne SAR;azimuth antenna pattern;elevation antenna pattern play separate roles;beam steering;antenna pattern angles;equivalent antenna pattern model;squint angle","","2","","6","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm proposed in this paper extracts the width of target persistence angle which is defined as target azimuth-angle sensitivity. It is an effective parameter to distinguish different types of anisotropic targets. And it is independent of azimuth orientations for its measurement of width of target persistence angle.

To figure it out, a THz radar security screening method for walking human torso is proposed with multi-angle synthetic aperture. In this method, the echo data of walking human torso component is assumed as a rigid motion model within a short time. Particularly, the torso component has the maximum ratio of surface area and echo energy, which means that its motion phase error can be detected after fractional Fourier transform processing. Besides, after the correction and imaging processing, the imaging results under different angles are fused by coherent integration with registration processing to improve the integrity of scattering information, which is incomplete within a short aperture due to self-occlusion and the changes in incident angles. The simulation experiments are conducted to verify the imaging quality and feasibility of the proposed method. Moreover, the real small aperture echo data of moving torso collected by our THz radar (that operates at 330GHz with the bandwidth of 30GHz and the output peak power of 5mW) is processed via the proposed method to indicate the significance of multi-angle imaging.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3083816","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2021NQNCZ18); Science and technology research program of Chongqing Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN201900603); Fundamental and Frontier Research Project of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyjmsxmX0635,cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0635); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9440943","Walking human imaging;THz radar;synthetic aperture radar;phase error correction;security screening","Radar imaging;Radar;Legged locomotion;Imaging;Security;Apertures;Synthetic aperture radar","image fusion;image motion analysis;image registration;microwave imaging;millimetre wave imaging;millimetre wave radar;radar imaging;submillimetre wave imaging;terahertz wave imaging","fractional Fourier transform processing;walking human torso;THz radar imaging;multiangle imaging processing;rigid motion model;human torso component;terahertz radar imaging;multiangle synthetic aperture;THz radar security screening method;frequency 330.0 GHz;power 5.0 mW;bandwidth 30.0 GHz","","3","","36","IEEE","26 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this frame, the paper addresses the problem of the estimation of the ship dynamics, i.e., yaw, pitch, and roll rotation motions, exploiting the signals collected by such multiplatform radar imaging systems providing angular diversity in order to enable the focusing of the distributed ISAR images. Specifically, in this work a multi-angle formation of sensors is considered and the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator and Cramer Rao bound are derived. Then, a new Doppler matching based technique is proposed as a suboptimal approach exploiting only the linear component of the phase of the received signals. The performance analysis proves the effectiveness of the proposed techniques to separately estimate the horizontal, radial, and vertical components of the rotation vector, therefore making possible both the focusing and accurate cross-range scaling of the distributed ISAR products (as well as of the low-resolution ISAR images regarding the different sensors) and, as a further advantage, providing knowledge of the orientation of the corresponding image projection planes. The analysis of experimental multisensor datasets confirms the feasibility of the proposed techniques.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2017.2714960","Selex Galileo CTO - Innovative Projects Analysis & Demonstrations Group, Pomezia, Italy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947191","Radar imaging;Inverse SAR (ISAR);multiplatform;multistatic;motion estimation","Sensors;Estimation;Marine vehicles;Image resolution;Radar imaging;Three-dimensional displays","distributed sensors;Doppler radar;image fusion;image matching;image sensors;marine radar;maximum likelihood estimation;motion measurement;radar imaging;radar receivers;ships;synthetic aperture radar;vectors","ship dynamic estimation;multiplatform radar imaging system;distributed inverse synthetic aperture radar;data acquisition;multiple radar sensor;cross range resolution;single platform system;distributed ISAR imaging;maximum likelihood estimator;Cramer Rao bound;Doppler matching based technique;horizontal component estimation;radial component estimation;vertical component estimation;rotation vector;cross-range scaling;low-resolution ISAR imaging;image projection plane;multisensor dataset","","15","","51","IEEE","13 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This imaging system is constituted of several transceivers to get multi-angle echo data. Through aperture synthesis and target detection processing of the multi-angle radar echo data, the multi-target scene can be segmented into several subscenes with each single target inside. In order to fast reconstruct the images of subscenes without the hypothesis of plane wave decomposition, which can cause severe defocus and distortion at the edge of THz radar near-field imaging results, wavenumber domain algorithm is modified for parallel processing of all subscenes data with the center locations of subscenes. Furthermore, convolution integral in slow time is used to speed up the processing of subscenes imaging with fast Fourier transform. Simulation results are analyzed and compared to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of our method. Moreover, verifiable experiments are designed for proof-of-concept, where imaging scenes are rotating along with a fixed speed turntable. The experimental data are transmitted and received by a stationary THz radar, which operates at 340 GHz with the bandwidth of 28.8 GHz and the output peak power of 5 mW.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2018.2889884","Project 2011 for Collaborative Innovation Center of Information Sensing and Understanding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8590683","Radar imaging;terahertz(THz) radar;multi-target security screening;adaptive scene segmentation;wavenumber domain algorithm","Security;Radar imaging;Transceivers;Imaging;Sensors;Image segmentation","distortion;fast Fourier transforms;image reconstruction;image segmentation;object detection;radar cross-sections;radar detection;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;telecommunication security","imaging system;multiangle echo data;aperture synthesis;target detection processing;multitarget scene;parallel processing;imaging scenes;experimental data;stationary THz radar;multitarget screening;adaptive scene segmentation;terahertz radar;radar security imaging method;THz radar near-field imaging;multiangle radar echo data processing;image reconstruction;wavenumber domain algorithm;convolution integral;subscene imaging processing;fast Fourier transform;fixed speed turntable;subscene data processing;frequency 340.0 GHz;frequency 28.8 GHz;power 5.0 mW","","23","","37","IEEE","27 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, this paper introduces two kinds of universal registration methods. Combined with the characteristics of multi view SAR images, feature-based matching methods are selected for research; Secondly, sift, brisk and surf features are used as descriptors for feature selection and extraction, and the feature points extracted from SAR images with different viewing angles are matched by Euclidean distance matching method and random sampling consistency algorithm (RANSAC); Finally, the affine transformation model is used to realize the image transformation, and the registration accuracy of the three operators is quantitatively analyzed by calculating the maximum mean square error (RMSE). The results show that the registration algorithm based on surf feature has higher tolerance to scene complexity and stronger robustness,; Brisk based feature is the second; The registration algorithm based on SIFT features is most easily affected by the scene, and the matching effect is the worst.","","978-7-0000-0000-1","10.23919/CISS51089.2021.9652227","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652227","SAR;image registration;feature extraction;affine transformation;random sampling","Analytical models;Mean square error methods;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Robustness;Complexity theory","affine transforms;feature extraction;image matching;image registration;mean square error methods;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","multiview SAR image registration;feature extraction;SAR image interpretation;registration algorithm;feature operators;multiangle SAR images;universal registration methods;feature-based matching methods;feature selection;Euclidean distance matching method;random sampling consistency algorithm;image transformation;registration accuracy;Brisk based feature;SIFT features;SURF features;RANSAC;maximum mean square error;RMSE;scene complexity","","","","9","","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
