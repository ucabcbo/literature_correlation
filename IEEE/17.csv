Knowledge of sea ice type is important for climate research and safety in Arctic offshore operations.First-year ice is characterised by a low SAR backscatter intensity in both HH and HV polarisation compared to multi-year ice, while the altimeter waveform parameters show high pulse peakiness and peak power compared to multi-year ice.Thus SAR imagery and altimetry can principally discriminate different ice types. The complexity of the backscattered radar signal however impedes a clear separation of the two types for all cases.

However, they are currently poorly represented in circulation models. One of the reasons is the lack of reliable large-scale observations. A challenge encountered during melt pond retrieval from optical satellite observations is the filtering of cloud which in the visible range of spectrum look similarly bright as the sea ice surface. Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR. The AATSR swath only covers the central half of the MERIS swath but the masking procedure extends the filtering scheme to the outer parts of the MERIS swath so that the full swath can be used for melt pond retrieval.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7731000","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7731000","Melt ponds;sea ice;remote sensing;cloud filtering;MERIS;AATSR;Sentinel-3","Clouds;Sea ice;MODIS;Arctic;Integrated optics;Sea surface","Bayes methods;clouds;oceanographic regions;sea ice","cloud filtering;melt pond detection;Arctic summer sea ice;local radiative balance;circulation models;reliable large-scale observations;melt pond retrieval;optical satellite observations;spectrum visible range;sea ice surface;undetected cloud;Bayesian classifier;coincident infrared observations;MERIS swath;filtering scheme","","","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its main objectives are to measure sea-surface topography, sea- and land-surface temperature and ocean- and land-surface colour in support of ocean forecasting systems, and for environmental and climate monitoring. The series of Sentinel-3 satellites will ensure global, frequent and near-real time ocean, ice and land monitoring, with the provision of observation data in routine, long term (up to 20 years of operations) and continuous fashion, with a consistent quality and a high level of reliability and availability. The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating the following instruments, building on experience and heritage from the ERS and ENVISAT missions: •A dual frequency, delay-Doppler Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, and a Precise Orbit Determination package. This combined package provides measurements of sea-surface height and topography measurements over sea ice, ice sheets, rivers and lakes. •A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multichannel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces. With 21 bands, compared to the 15 on Envisat's MERIS, a design optimised to minimise sun-glint and, a resolution of 300 m over all surfaces, OLCI marks a new generation of measurements over the ocean and land. The swath of OCLI and nadir SLSTR fully overlap. •A dual-view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) delivering accurate surface ocean, land, and ice temperature, with an accuracy better than 0.3 K. SLSTR measures in 9 spectral channels and two additional bands optimised for fire monitoring. SLSTR has a spatial resolution in the visible and shortwave infrared channels of 500 m and 1 km in the thermal infrared channels.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8518877","","Flexible printed circuits;Ocean temperature;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Extraterrestrial measurements;Sea measurements","artificial satellites;atmospheric techniques;land surface temperature;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;topography (Earth)","ESA's Sentinel-3 mission;Sentinel-3 mission forms part;Copernicus Space Component;sea-surface topography;land-surface temperature;land-surface colour;ocean forecasting systems;environmental climate monitoring;Sentinel-3 satellites;ENVISAT missions;delay-Doppler Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter instrument;dual frequency passive microwave radiometer;Precise Orbit Determination package;sea-surface height;topography measurements;sea ice;ice sheets;highly sensitive Ocean;wide-swath optical measurements;dual-view Sea;Land Surface Temperature Radiometer;ice temperature;surface ocean;SLSTR measures;Ocean and Land Colour Imager;thermal infrared channels","","1","","3","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The classification of altimeter waveforms is generally performed using statistical parameters on the echo power or machine learning approaches directly on the waveforms. The validation and optimization of such algorithms can be carried out using a set of reference cases provided by Earth Observation images. In this paper, we first developed a new lead detector based on Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A robust and consistent methodology for the joint assessment of Altimeter and SAR leads detector is then provided. We propose to fully account for the 2-D geometric problem when comparing the 1-D altimeter track and 2-D SAR image. The surface of the lead intersecting the altimeter footprint and its distance to nadir are considered here. Based on collocated Sentinel-3 (S-3) altimeter data and S-1 images, the performance of our S-3 lead detector is fully assessed. A new parameterization is found resulting in a better tradeoff between good detection and false alarm rate. A similar analysis is performed using AltiKa altimeter data, showing enhanced performance for S-3 altimeter data acquired in Delay-Doppler mode with reduced off-nadir returns.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2889519","European Space Agency; PEACHI SARAL Contract; French Space Agency CNES; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626038","Altimetry;lead;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice;Lead;Detectors;Sea measurements;Europe","altimeters;geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice lead detection;SAR imagery;ice freeboard;altimeter waveforms;echo power;Earth Observation images;synthetic aperture radar images;S-3 lead detector;AltiKa altimeter data;S-3 altimeter data;2D SAR images;Sentinel-3 images;Sentinel-1 images;Sentinel-3 images;1D altimeter track","","14","","31","IEEE","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This process, similar to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems, reduces the along-track resolution down to the theoretical limit equal to half the antenna length. We call this the fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) altimetry processing. The technique is directly applicable to SAR altimetry missions such as CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, or Sentinel-6/Jason-CS. The footprint of an FF-SAR altimeter measurement is a narrow strip on the surface, which is pulse limited across track and SAR focused along track. Despite the asymmetry of the altimeter footprint, the fully focused technique may be useful for applications in which one needs to separate specific targets within highly heterogeneous scenes, such as in the case of sea ice lead detection, hydrology, and coastal altimetry applications. In addition, over rough homogeneous surfaces, such as the ocean or ice sheets, the improved multilooking capability of FF-SAR leads to a significant increase in the effective number of looks with respect to the delay/Doppler processing, resulting in better geophysical parameter estimation. The proposed processing technique was verified by processing full bit rate CryoSat-2 SAR mode data over the Svalbard transponder. Hydrology, sea ice, and open ocean applications are also demonstrated in this paper, showing the improvement of this technique with respect to conventional and delay/Doppler altimetry.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2607122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579570","Altimetry;delay/Doppler altimetry;SAR altimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Altimetry;Radar tracking;Spaceborne radar;Satellites;Radar imaging","Doppler radar;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","fully focused coherent pulse echo processing;nadir-looking pulse-limited radar altimeter;synthetic aperture radar;SAR imaging system;antenna length;fully focused SAR altimetry processing;SAR altimetry mission;Sentinel-3;Sentinel-6-Jason-CS;sea ice lead detection;hydrology;coastal altimetry;ocean;ice sheet;CryoSat-2 SAR mode data;Svalbard transponder;delay-Doppler altimetry","","51","","30","OAPA","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
