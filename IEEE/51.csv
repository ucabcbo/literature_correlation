Specifically, a new classification methodology based on collaborative representation is proposed, in which extended multi-attribute profiles (EMAPs) is used to model spatial context information, and the spatial information are taken as inputs features for the collaborative representation of Tikhonov classifier (EMAPs-CRT).

This research applies remote sensing and Geographical Information System for investigating historical land cover changes in Sebubus Forest through analysis of Landsat images during period 1995 until 2016. The purpose is to understand how land cover of the “Productive Forest”, as it is classified by Indonesian Regulations on forestry, has been changing over time and the times when its dramatic transformation were happened. A matrix derived from multitemporal satellite image analysis is presented to understand land cover transitions and intensity. This investigation found that the forest were trees' covered until 2005 when some dramatic land cover changes began.

We pair patches from sensed and reference images, and directly learn the mapping relationship between those image patch pairs and their matching labels. This end-to-end network architecture helps us optimize the entire network, which is what traditional methods lack.

This paper describes a pixel based crops and land cover classification originating from one source satellite imagery represented by Sentinel satellite and based on several dates for the same agricultural season. We propose a DCNN architecture based on multi-temporal data that was fed to a one-dimension (1-D DCNN). The proposed architecture is compared with other methods of satellite image classification algorithms; such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests (RFs) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NNs).

The main objective of this paper is to exploit the temporal correlation between the images. The recent image will be predicted from the historical image that is already available to the user. This will substantially reduce the load in transmitting the images. This paper actually emphasis on the process of increasing temporal correlation, which consequently improves the compression gain. In sequential transmission, the transmitted data will be used in future as a reference.

Focusing on land cover classification (or mapping) tasks, the majority of approaches dealing with SITS data only considers the temporal dimension, while the integration of the spatial context is frequently neglected. In this work, we propose an attentive spatial temporal graph convolutional neural network that exploits both spatial and temporal dimensions in SITS.

Determination of olive trees, which are expanded all around Aegean and}{Mediterranean regions of the country, is critical to assess the production capacity and the quality of products. In this study, combinations of time series of Sentinel-1 satellite images, Sentinel-2 satellite images and NDVI products obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to investigate the classification accuracy of olive trees. According to analysis results, a significant correlation with R2 = 0.67 found between NDVI and SAR data (sigma nought VH/VV in decibel scale).

In the next step, supervised random forest classification was applied on the fused data combinations and results showed that Sentinel-1 - Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 - NDVI and Sentinel-2 - NDVI combinations achieved the highest overall accuracy with 73 %, while standalone Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image time series classification accuracies are 48 % and 68 % respectively.","","978-1-7281-2116-1","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8820712","Olive tree determination;Multi-sensor data fusion;Multi-temporal satellite image;Sentinel-1 image;Sentinel2 image;Random forest classification","Vegetation;Agriculture;Satellites;Data integration;Correlation;Sensors;Production","agricultural products;agriculture;crops;geophysical image processing;image classification;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar;time series;vegetation mapping","olive trees;multisensor data fusion;sustainable agricultural production;Mediterranean countries;Sentinel-1 satellite images;Sentinel-2 satellite images;NDVI products;fused data combinations;agricultural product;NDVI data;Sentinel-2 image time series classification;Sentinel-1 image time series classification;agricultural plans;crop continuous monitoring","","3","","9","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This task is usually achieved by modeling accurate decision criteria that capture the user's intention while being resilient to many irrelevant changes including acquisition conditions. Among existing change detection solutions, correlation-based models - such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - are particularly successful, but their success is very dependent on the quality of alignments used to train these models. In this paper, we introduce a novel interactive change detection algorithm based on a new variant of CCA, referred to as misalignment resilient CCA. Given a small sample of “changes” and “no-changes” labeled by an oracle (user), our method learns transformation matrices that map these data from different input spaces, related to multi-temporal images, into a common latent space which is sensitive to relevant changes while being resilient to irrelevant ones including misalignments. These CCA transformations correspond to the optimum of a particular constrained maximization problem that mixes a new soft-alignment term and a context-based regularization criterion. Extensive experiments conducted in interactive satellite image change detection, show that our misalignment resilient CCA approach is highly effective.","","978-1-5090-4847-2","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7900147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7900147","","Correlation;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Linear programming;Covariance matrices;Robustness;Radio frequency","image processing;matrix algebra;optimisation","context-based regularization criterion;soft-alignment term;constrained maximization problem;transformation matrices;canonical correlation analysis;interactive satellite image change detection;misalignment resilient CCA","","3","","21","IEEE","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As satellite data, a Landsat 8 OLI image acquired on April 10, 2017 was used. The ground-truth points that were collected in surveying, and additionally field information taken from farmer registration system provided by local administrations were used as references. The application was done by classification of the satellite image using four different methods (Maximum Likelihood, Support Vector Machine, Condition-Based and Nearest Neighbor). After the results were obtained, the wheat classes obtained were transformed to vector format to overlay on the satellite image for visual analysis. The area of wheat class obtained from each method was presented and compared. The results were also evaluated by comparing with the data taken from Turkish Statistical Institute. All of the methods provided results close to the Turkish Statistical Institute records. Even the results were not significantly different from each other, wheat area determined using Support Vector Machine classification was better than others. The accuracy assessments were performed by calculating the total accuracy and KAPPA/KIA coefficient. The accuracy assessment analysis showed that the three supervised methods were better than the unsupervised one.

This study aims to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of dense rainforests using remote sensing data. Many previous studies have attempted to determine the area of forest cover in Côte d'Ivoire ([2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and [7]). Most of these studies were conducted from either aerial photographs or satellite images of low spatial resolutions such as NOAA / AVHRR [8]. However, through these studies, methods of estimates of the area of forest cover generally vary from one author to another, thus causing an inconsistency in the results [9]. Remote sensing allows a better assessment of the scope and scale of the problem of deforestation. Using multi-temporal data, one can better detect and analyze changes in the forest cover. By comparing images of previous years with recent scenes, it becomes possible to effectively measure the differences in the extent of deforestation and loss of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire ([10] and [11]). In a first phase, the country's dense forest cover of the 1960s was determined from the digitization of existing vegetation map. In a second phase, the dense forest cover of the 1980s and 2000s were obtained by processing of Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite images. First the geometric correction of the satellite images was performed. Then, series of supervised classifications based on the maximum likelihood method were done to generate maps of land cover, with overall accuracies of 90%. From these land cover maps, the class of dense forests was extracted and converted into a map layer in vector format. By crossing dense forests covers of the 1980s and 2000 with those of the 1960s, the specific characterizations of those forests were derived (Figure 1, 2, 3). The results show a dense humid forest cover of about 8.4 million ha in 1960, with the presence of large blocks. The 1980s and 2000s have dense forest cover of 2.6 million ha and 1.35 million ha, respectively (Tables 1, 2, 3). These latter periods are characterized by high loss and fragmentation of rainforests in Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, since its independence, the country has lost more than 80% of its forest cover. The results of this study show that clearing associated with industrial agriculture mainly cocoa, coffee and rubber farming as well as demographic pressure and abusive exploitation of valuable wood species for export are the main causes of deforestation in Cote d'Ivoire. This study advocates the restoration of forests through the implementation of an awareness policy and reforestation one hand, and an efficient monitoring and protection of national protected areas and parks.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7729337","Tropical forest;multitemporal monitoring;image classification;three;four;five","Satellites;Remote sensing;Monitoring;Sea measurements;Earth;Loss measurement;Africa","geophysical image processing;maximum likelihood estimation;photogrammetry;vegetation mapping","AD 1960 to 2000;forest cover multitemporal monitoring;Cote Divoire;deforestation phenomenon;colonial period;spatial dense rainforests evolution;temporal dense rainforests evolution;remote sensing data;aerial photograph;low spatial resolution;NOAA;AVHRR;forest cover area estimate;multitemporal data;vegetation map digitization;Landsat TM satellite image;Landsat ETM+ satellite image;maximum likelihood method;land cover map layer;vector format;rainforest fragmentation;cocoa farming;coffee farming;rubber farming;demographic pressure;wood species;reforestation;awareness policy;national protected area;national protected park","","1","","11","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose of using Self-Adaptive Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization-Genetic Algorithm (SAPSOGA) is to combine two meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to search and find the feasible solution in the NP-hard change detection problem rapidly and efficiently. The hybrid algorithm is employed by letting the GA and PSO run simultaneously and similarities of GA and PSO have been considered to implement the algorithm, i.e. the population. In the SAPSOGA employed, in each iteration/generation the two population based algorithms share different amount of information or individual(s) between themselves. Thus, each algorithm informs each other about their best optimum results (fitness values and solution representations) which are obtained in their own population. The fitness function is minimized by using binary based SAPSOGA approach to produce binary change detection masks in each iteration to obtain the optimal change detection mask between two multi temporal multi spectral landsat images. The proposed approach effectively optimizes the change detection problem and finds the final change detection mask.","","978-1-4673-8460-5","10.1109/SAI.2016.7556007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556007","Remote sensing;Image processing;Optimization;Self-adaptive hybrid algorithm;Genetic algorithm;Binary particle swarm optimization","Satellites;Change detection algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Lighting;Genetic algorithms;Cost function","computational complexity;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image processing;particle swarm optimisation;remote sensing","self-adaptive hybrid particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm;SAPSOGA;unsupervised satellite change detection;contrast condition;satellite image;illumination change;illumination artifact removal;metaheuristic optimization algorithm;NP-hard change detection problem","","7","","21","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An automatic procedure has been developed to calibrate and validate the production in near-real time of daily maps of expected good fishing grounds to be provided to the FEDERPESCA fleet. The same procedure could be optimized also for other seas.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326256","Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ);Upwelling;Ocean Color Analysis;Multi-sensor data fusion","Ocean temperature;MODIS;Sea surface;Forecasting;Satellites;Data integration","geophysical image processing;gradient methods;image fusion;microorganisms;ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;seawater;sensor fusion","fishing forecasting system;Adriatic sea;normalized scalar product;SST gradient vector;CHL gradient vector;chlorophyll-a concentration;surface temperature;marine water;complex dynamics;potential fishing area;CPUE;multitemporal data fusion;MODIS-TERRA sensor;MODIS-AQUA sensor;VIIRS sensor;sea water upwelling;phytoplankton;antiparallel orientation;near-real daily map time production;FEDERPESCA;high pelagic fish concentration;fishing grounds","","4","","9","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is very difficult to identify land cover classification manually from a satellite image. The remotely-sensed images are invaluable sources of information for various investigations since they provide spatial and temporal information about the nature of earth surface materials and objects. This study aims to determine the level of contributions of multi-temporal and multi-sensor data together with their principal components for Artificial Neural Network classifiers. The suitability of Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) for classification of remote sensing images is explored in this paper. Automatic image classification is one of the challenging problems of recent year. BPN is self-adaptive dynamic system which is widely connected with the large amount of neurons. It can solve the regular problem arise from remote sensing images. This paper discusses about the BPNN method to improve the high resolution remote sensing image. The principle and learning algorithm of BPNN is analyzed and high resolution imagery of Beijing has been used. Back Propagation Neural Network classifies the remote sensing image into the classified image of their pattern recognition.","","978-1-4673-8343-1","10.1109/CCIE.2015.7399300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7399300","landcover classification;artificial neural networks;remote sensing;normalization","Roads;Buildings;Monitoring;Image resolution;Image recognition;Vegetation mapping;Neural networks","backpropagation;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;neural nets;remote sensing","land cover classification;satellite images;normalization technique;artificial neural network;thematic map extraction;natural resource recognition;natural resource monitoring;natural resource management;remotely-sensed image;spatial information;temporal information;earth surface materials;earth surface objects;backpropagation neural network;BPNN;automatic image classification;Beijing;China;pattern recognition","","4","","16","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, several conventional techniques for controlling and monitoring anarchic urban expansion have been initiated but they remain not sufficient to overcome this issue.This paper proposes an automatic method of detection and monitoring of anarchic urban expansions starting from multi-sources and multi-temporal data (VHR satellite images and geographic information data). First, the illegal urban areas are extracted using an original SVM based technique integrating expert knowledge and auxiliary data by means of ontology construction. This leads to the formalization of the expert semantic information and the urban construction rules (often in sentences form) and their confrontation with the classification results.Secondly, the SITS classified images are modeled using Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs (SOTAG) constructed for each region of the first image. These graphs are then classified using a Marginalized Graph Kernel (MGK) SVM based classification in order to extract regions with similar temporal evolution. We are focusing mainly on monitoring legal and illegal urban expansions. The resulted spatio-temporal map describes urban areas types and their changes over time.","2379-190X","978-1-4799-8131-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8683526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8683526","VHR images;SITIS monitoring;SVM classification;ontology;concepts;SOTAG;MGK;etc","","geographic information systems;geophysical image processing;graph theory;image classification;image segmentation;ontologies (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;support vector machines;time series","anarchic urban expansion detection;expert knowledge;high spatial resolution satellites;spectral, resolution satellites;temporal resolution satellites;SITS;monitoring anarchic urban expansion;automatic method;anarchic urban expansions;multitemporal data;VHR satellite images;geographic information data;illegal urban areas;original SVM based technique;auxiliary data;ontology construction;expert semantic information;urban construction rules;Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs;monitoring legal expansions;illegal urban expansions;urban areas types;temporal evolution;spatio-temporal map","","1","","7","IEEE","17 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The image time series, as results of the satellite revisiting period, gives you insights not only on a certain area, but also on its representation at different moments of time. In order to limit the issues that might arise due to irregular time sampling of multispectral data, the authors propose a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series for analysis. To this point, the main goal is to mine the satellite image time series (SITS) for understanding the temporal behaviour of an area in terms of evolution and persistency. The paper introduces an analytical approach, combining coherent and no coherent analysis of SAR SITS content. We propose the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract categories of evolution from the SAR SITS and techniques which study statistical and coherent proprieties of the targets to identify the structures with stable electromagnetic characteristics over time, named Persistent Scatterers (PS). The obtained results indicate an evolutionary character hidden inside the persistent class. The results obtained on 30 ERS images encourages further analysis on Sentinel 1 data.","","978-1-5386-3327-4","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2017.8035260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8035260","SAR image time series;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;categories of evolution;Persistent Scatterers","Synthetic aperture radar;Time series analysis;Visualization;Image resolution;Coherence;Monitoring;Optical interferometry","land cover","SAR imagery temporal analysis;Earth land cover behavior assessment;Earth Observation data collections;data analysis;satellite missions resolution;image time series;latent dirichlet allocation model","","","","12","IEEE","14 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Land Cover Clustering for Change Detection using Deep Belief Network","A. Sivasankari; S.

The application of change detection in remote sensing is considered complicated due to continuous interaction of humans with nature. Further, the change detection in land cover and water bodies plays a major role in global change. Manual change detection process via experts consumes more time to survey the land, whereas detection of changes in land cover and water bodies via an artificial intelligence (AI) model enables faster change detection. However, multi-sensor and multi-temporal satellite data calibration poses a serious problem in remote-sensing application. It makes the entire clustering process a difficult one and hence the accuracy of change detection degrades. In this paper, we apply the task of unsupervised learning to a deep learning model namely deep belief network. Here, the land cover images are clustered using the unlabeled data, where the algorithms are trained in unsupervised manner. The intelligent decisions are made available via deep belief network that clusters the uncategorized the land covers and water bodies images from the satellite image database. The dataset includes Landsat sensors’ datasets in dry semi-arid river basin in Western India. The performance of the unsupervised deep belief network is evaluated in terms of various performance metrics that includes accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, geometric mean, peak signal noise ratio and mean average percentage error.","","978-1-6654-8425-1","10.1109/ICEARS53579.2022.9752379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9752379","Land Cover;Clustering;Change Detection;Deep Belief Network","Deep learning;Measurement;Renewable energy sources;Satellites;Image databases;Rivers;Artificial intelligence","belief networks;calibration;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;remote sensing;rivers;terrain mapping;unsupervised learning;visual databases","land cover clustering;water bodies;global change;manual change detection process;change detection degrades;land cover images;unsupervised deep belief network","","","","26","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
