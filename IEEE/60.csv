The GMNCC can detect the angle-offsets (AOs) of object images to reference image by determining the maximum of correlation coefficients between the two images with genetic algorithm, and complete the rotation offset correction. Then SIFT is used to extract the feature points and feature matching, which is subsequently refined by RANSAC to eliminate the false matched control points. Two Woldview-2 (WV2) images of Beijing Olympic Forest Park were used for testing the GMNCC-SIFT registration.

With the resolution up to 0.8m, the original geo-positioning accuracy of the Chinese Gaofen(GF-2) multi-angle imagery is about 90m which means a limited application in geometric processing. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the geometric performance of the multi-angle satellite imagery based on the geometric error sources of this experimental dataset without GCPs. Under the condition of weak intersection of our test dataset, we use a DEM-assisted approach to acquire a more accurate initial position accuracy of all tie points, and all extracted data is clustered by the Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN) algorithm in order to eliminate points or impages with large positioning error automatically. Then, the error-based block adjustment model are proposed and investigated to improved the geometric performance of the experimental dataset. Based on our proposed method, 142 multi-angle GF-2 satellite images covering the western Beijing area are experimented and the root mean square error(RMSE) of the geometric accuracy is improved up to about 12m in plane and 6m in height, which shows a significantly improvement in geo-positioning accuracy of these multi-angle GF-2 remote sensing imagery.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899036","geometric performance;error-based block adjustment;RFM;multi-angle;DBSCAN","Satellites;Image resolution;Mathematical model;Unified modeling language;Remote sensing;Clustering algorithms;Cameras","geophysical techniques;remote sensing","Beijing area;density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm;DEM-assisted approach;multiangle GF-2 satellite images;Chinese Gaofen;multiangle GF-2 remote sensing imagery;geometric accuracy;error-based block adjustment model;positioning error;tie points;accurate initial position accuracy;experimental dataset;geometric error sources;geometric performance;geometric processing;multiangle imagery;original geo-positioning accuracy;financial resources;manpower;GCPs;remote sensing image preprocessing;geo-positioning accuracy improvement;ground control points;multiangle satellite imagery;error-based block adjustment method;size 90.0 m;size 12.0 m;size 6.0 m;size 0.8 m","","1","","9","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the phase contributions from surface deformation, topography, and ionospheric delays are negligible or known, the interferogram can be used to estimate the differential tropospheric delay (DTD), which can help to improve tropospheric delay predictions from weather models and in situ measurements. In conventional repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR), however, the estimation of the DTD can still be significantly hindered by baseline errors. In addition, a single interferogram provides only relative DTDs, as the delays can be retrieved up to an unknown offset. To address such issues, this article presents a method for the estimation of DTDs on large scales by using repeat-pass simultaneous multi-angle SAR systems. Complementary simultaneous observations of the correlated troposphere from multiple angles are used to retrieve estimates of the absolute DTD and, at the same time, to mitigate the effect of baseline knowledge errors. Finally, a performance evaluation is presented for the Harmony Earth Explorer 10 candidate mission. A centimeter-level absolute accuracy and a submillimeter-level relative accuracy of the DTD estimation are achieved under the multistatic Harmony case when at least one companion satellite has an inter-satellite distance longer than 300 km to provide enough sensitivity.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3105007","European Space Agency Earth Explorer 10 Candidate Mission Harmony Phase 0 Science Studies; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61960206009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521670","Interferometric phase error;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);multi-angle observation system;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);troposphere","Delays;Atmospheric modeling;Satellites;Estimation;Synthetic aperture radar;Strain;Terrestrial atmosphere","atmospheric techniques;geophysical image processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;troposphere","weather models;tropospheric delay predictions;ionospheric delays;surface deformation;phase contributions;synthetic aperture radar interferometry;interferometric phase;tropospheric delays;simultaneous multiangle repeat-pass InSAR;differential tropospheric delay estimation;DTD estimation;submillimeter-level relative accuracy;baseline knowledge errors;absolute DTD;multiple angles;correlated troposphere;complementary simultaneous observations;multiangle SAR systems;relative DTDs;single interferogram;baseline errors;conventional repeat-pass interferometric SAR","","","","39","IEEE","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the result from this processing, we obtained multi angle (observation angle of 0 to ± 9.5°) orthorectified ground-surface brightness temperature 20 images of the 15-1 crater in Owakudani from the 20 continuous images of STIC's IR camera images. We estimated the maximum brightness temperature and heat radiation rate of the 15-1 crater using a square area of 30x30m including the 15-1 crater in these 20 consecutive thermal IR images (measurement interval 0.5s). Those estimated values fluctuated by ± 50% during the observation for a total of 9.5s because of large amounts of fumarolic gas.

However, currently it is impossible to derive CI from NDHD for a large area at a spatial resolution finer than 275 m since such fine multi-angle data are unavailable. In this study, an algorithm of the mixed-pixel clumping index (MPCI) was implemented, and an MPCI map of China's landmass at 1 km resolution was derived from the HJ-1A/1B data at 30 m resolution. The MPCI map was compared with the previous NDHD CI derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The correlation of these two datasets was greater than 0.9, and the mean bias was approximately 0.1. Indirectly, the MPCI map was applied to an effective leaf area index (LAI) product to derive true LAI. Using the MODIS LAI product as a reference, we found that the coefficient of determination was improved from 0.72 to 0.80, and the root mean squared error was reduced from 0.53 to 0.35 m2/m2 after the effective LAI is corrected by this MPCI map, suggesting that this MPCI map is comparable to the NDHD CI.

Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the atmospheric point spread function (PSF) that are appropriate for the off-nadir optical remote sensing. By the convolution of the atmospheric PSF and the surface-leaving radiance, the radiance caused by the adjacency effect could be calculated. The influence factor analysis shows that, in addition to the surface albedo and the meteorological range, the viewing direction will affect the adjacency effect dramatically. With the deviation of the viewing zenith angle from the nadir, adjacency effect becomes weak. Unlike the nadir remote sensing, the adjacency effect in off-nadir remote sensing is azimuthally dependent and the contribution of the background in the viewing direction is greater than others. Based on a three-dimensional scene and a whole chain optical imaging simulation software, the images before the optical system of the sensor with and without the adjacency effect are simulated. The calculation of the SNR, contrast and spatial resolution of the images reveals that the adjacency effect seriously degrades the image quality.

When the target variable is available at a resolution that matches the remote sensing observations, standard algorithms, such as neural networks, random forests, or the Gaussian processes, are readily available to relate the two. However, we often encounter situations where the target variable is only available at the group level, i.e., collectively associated with a number of remotely sensed observations. This problem setting is known in statistics and machine learning as multiple instance learning (MIL) or distribution regression (DR). This article introduces a nonlinear (kernel-based) method for DR that solves the previous problems without making any assumption on the statistics of the grouped data. The presented formulation considers distribution embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and performs standard least squares regression with the empirical means therein. A flexible version to deal with multisource data of different dimensionality and sample sizes is also presented and evaluated. It allows working with the native spatial resolution of each sensor, avoiding the need for matchup procedures. Noting the large computational cost of the approach, we introduce an efficient version via random Fourier features to cope with millions of points and groups. Real experiments involve the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) vegetation optical depth (VOD) data for the estimation of crop production in the U.S. Corn Belt and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) reflectances for the estimation of aerosol optical depth (AOD).

For the conventional SAR with low-squint narrow beams, the azimuth antenna pattern and the elevation antenna pattern play separate roles in scattering measurements. In recent years, a novel spaceborne SAR imaging mode — azimuthal multi-angle observation — has been proposed based on the capability of beam steering. However, in the case of squint and high resolution, the antenna pattern becomes two-dimensional (2-D) inseparable along with the beam steering. Therefore, a spatially varying radiometric error is induced, which makes the calibration more complicated. This paper analyzed the impact of 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. First, the antenna pattern angles varying with the observation angles are analyzed. Then, an equivalent antenna pattern model for squint steering beam seen by an on-ground point scatterer is proposed. Finally, the relative radiometric error induced by the 2-D antenna pattern is assessed based on the integral method. The results show that the impact is related to the squint angle and azimuth resolution. The larger the squint angle, the higher the resolution, and the higher the impact of the 2-D antenna pattern on radiometric calibration. In addition, the beam steering needs to be controlled not only in azimuth but also in elevation. Otherwise, the radiometric error can increase several times.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-7247-7","10.1109/PIERS53385.2021.9694847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9694847","","Antenna measurements;Beam steering;Azimuth;Spaceborne radar;Two dimensional displays;Radiometry;Calibration","antenna radiation patterns;beam steering;calibration;radar antennas;radar imaging;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","radiometric error;radiometric calibration;azimuthal multiangle observation spaceborne SAR;azimuth antenna pattern;elevation antenna pattern play separate roles;beam steering;antenna pattern angles;equivalent antenna pattern model;squint angle","","2","","6","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the MISR data have been reported with large uncertainties and data gaps due to inaccurate aerosol estimation and/or cloud masking limiting its otherwise broader applications. To mitigate these issues, two approaches were proposed to estimate land surface albedo directly from surface reflectance (LSA_sfc) and Top-of-Atmosphere reflectance (LSA_toa), respectively. As a further development of the traditional albedo algorithms, this is the first attempt to simultaneously utilize multispectral and multiangular information in surface albedo estimation without any prior constraining information. Validations at AmeriFlux sites show that the proposed algorithms can achieve accuracies similar to that of the MISR product with respective bias and RMSE of 0.004 and 0.032 for LSA_sfc and 0.005 and 0.032 for LSA_toa algorithms. We found that the LSA_toa algorithm can significantly reduce data gaps and provide accurate surface albedo retrievals with two to three times more valid data than the current MISR product. In addition, these approaches can be easily applied to other optical sensors to produce accurate and gap-free clear-sky surface albedo estimations. The results of this paper also highlight the importance of having two to three simultaneous observations with sufficient angular sampling, which can improve albedo accuracy and reduce data gaps.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2648847","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:NNX09AN36G,NNH11ZDA001N); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration CICS-MD GOES-R Surface Albedo Project; Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Albedo Project through the University of Maryland, College Park; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837596","Ameriflux;bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF);direct estimation;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);multiangle data;Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR);surface albedo","Land surface;Estimation;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;MODIS;Broadband communication;Sea surface","albedo;atmospheric optics;radiometry;reflectivity;remote sensing","direct land surface albedo estimation;simultaneous MISR data;multiangular information;multiangle imaging spectroradiometer;MISR instrument;surface anisotropy characterization;aerosol estimation;cloud masking;surface reflectance;top-of-atmosphere reflectance;albedo algorithm;AmeriFlux site;MISR product;optical sensor;gap-free clear-sky surface albedo estimation;albedo accuracy","","12","","50","IEEE","31 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"A data assimilation approach for simultaneously estimating a suite of land surface variables from satellite data","S. Liang; Z. Xiao; H. Shi; H. Ma","Beijing Normal University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; Beijing Normal University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; Beijing Normal University, Beijing, Beijing, CN; Beijing Normal University, Beijing, Beijing, CN","2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)","4 Dec 2017","2017","","","3973","3975","After over two decade of efforts, many land products are now being produced systematically from a variety of satellite data, and these products have been widely used. However, estimating a set of atmospheric and surface variables from one sensor data is often an ill-posed inversion problem, because the number of unknowns is often larger than the available bands[1]. Thus, one has to make assumptions while trying to obtain realistic solutions, and as a result, most products still need significant improvements of quality and accuracy. Although the average accuracy may be acceptable, the error of each product can be very large under certain conditions. Furthermore, different products of land variables from different inversion algorithms are physically inconsistent for most cases. Many products in the current form are not suitable for climate study because the products are not continuous both spatially and temporally due to factors such as clouds. There is an urgent need to develop more advanced new inversion methods and produce more accurate products. We have recently proposed a data assimilation approach to estimate an improved suite of products from one or multiple satellite data. The general idea is to use the surface and atmospheric radiation models with parameters that are adjusted to optimally reproduce the spectral radiance received by the EOS sensors. Such adjustments are usually made by identifying reasonably close “first guesses” for the model parameters and determining statistically optimum estimates of the parameters by giving appropriate weights to the first guesses versus addition to the error increments needed to get agreement with the observations. The first guesses are the multiple years MODIS/MISR land product climatologies. The best estimate at present time is a climatological value corrected by some combinations of previous time's departure from climatology weighted using temporal autocorrelation and what it takes to fit present observations. The presentation will review this approach and also introduce three case studies[2-4]. Case one [3] estimated only leaf area index (LAI) by integrating temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from MISR bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of LAI than previously available. Case two [2] estimated temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles from MODIS time-series reflectance data also based on the EnKF technique. The products include LAI, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and surface broadband albedo. The LAI/FAPAR and surface albedo values estimated using this framework were compared with MODIS collection 5 eight-day 1-km LAI/FAPAR products (MOD15A2) and 500-m surface albedo product (MCD43A3), and GEOV1 LAI/FAPAR products at 1/112. spatial resolution and a ten-day frequency, respectively, and validated by ground measurement data from several sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrate that this new data assimilation framework can estimate temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles from MODIS time-series reflectance data even if some of the reflectance data are contaminated by residual cloud or are missing and that the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo values are physically consistent. The root mean square errors of the retrieved LAI, FAPAR, and surface albedo against ground measurements are 0.5791, 0.0453, and 0.0190, respectively. Case three [4] further estimated multiple land surface parameters and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data without relying on atmospheric correction. Soil, vegetation canopy, and atmospheric radiative transfer models were coupled. LAI and AOD were estimated first and the coupled model then calculated land surface reflectance, incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), land surface albedo, and the FAPAR. The flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. The retrieved land surface parameters and AOD were compared with the corresponding MODIS, Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GEOV1, and MISR products and validated by ground measurements from seven sites with different vegetation types. The results demonstrated that the new inversion method can effectively produce multiple physically consistent parameters with accuracy comparable to that of existing satellite products over the select sites (Figure 2).","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127870","Data assimilation;inversion methods;land remote sensing;biophysical parameters","Atmospheric modeling;Land surface;MODIS;Reflectivity;Satellites;Indexes;Remote sensing","aerosols;atmospheric optics;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;climatology;data assimilation;geophysical signal processing;Kalman filters;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing;vegetation;vegetation mapping","top-of-atmosphere reflectance data;atmospheric radiative transfer models;retrieved land surface parameters;Global Land Surface Satellite;MISR products;inversion method;multiple physically consistent parameters;existing satellite products;data assimilation approach;land surface variables;land products;sensor data;inversion problem;land variables;advanced new inversion methods;accurate products;improved suite;multiple satellite data;atmospheric radiation models;model parameters;climatological value;temporal autocorrelation;case studies;angular information;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer data;ensemble Kalman filter technique;temporal information;multiple sensors;spectral information;MISR bidirectional reflectance factor data;accurate estimate;MODIS time-series reflectance data;ground measurement data;data assimilation framework;retrieved LAI;vegetation types;inversion algorithms;fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation;calculated land surface reflectance;statistically optimum estimates;multiple years MODIS-MISR land product climatologies;GEOV1 LAI-FAPAR products;temporally complete land-surface parameter profiles;estimated multiple land surface parameters;FAFAR;surface broadband albedo;MCD43A3;MODIS TOA reflectance data","","","","","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Satellite remote sensing is highly expected to provide such valuable information. Before applying the remotely sensed soil moisture products, a thorough validation must be conducted to insure product quality. In this paper, we evaluate the soil moisture products retrieved from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) on board the Global Change Observation Mission - Water (GCOM-W) over Heihe river basin in China, respectively. The land cover in Heihe river basin changes from desert to grass, agriculture field, and then mountain forest, which makes the basin an obvious spatial variation in soil moisture field and valuable to check the reliability and stability of two soil moisture products. We calculate the diurnal relative difference (DRD) of monthly averaged soil moisture between day and night observation of each products, and comparing them with that calculated from corresponding Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) simulations. The comparison results indicate that the SMOS soil moisture products are much unstable than AMSR2 retrievals. The DRD of SMOS is 20 times larger than that of AMSR2 and 100 times larger than that of GLDAS. We speculate that the radio frequency interference effects on SMOS observation may contribute to this unstable performance. Moreover, the retrievals from multi-angle observations in SMOS algorithm is also a potential source causing this systemic bias.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7325856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7325856","AMSR2;SMOS;soil moisture;Heihe;ascending and descending difference;GLDAS","Soil moisture;Rivers;Remote sensing;Microwave radiometry;Numerical models;Accuracy;Satellites","land cover;moisture;remote sensing;rivers;soil","SMOS algorithm;AMSR2 retrieval;GLDAS simulation;global land data assimilation system;diurnal relative difference;mountain forest;agriculture field;land cover;GCOM-W;Global Change Observation Mission-Water;AMSR2 mission;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2;SMOS mission;European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity;product quality;satellite remote sensing;carbon cycle;terrestrial water;China;Heihe river basin;SMOS soil moisture product evaluation;AMSR2 soil moisture product evaluation","","1","","8","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown a powerful proxy for photosynthetic activity and used to estimate GPP. However, both non-physiological and functional factors controlling the emission of canopy SIF. The non-physiological factors, especially the sun-viewer geometry, impact the relationships between SIF and GPP. In this study, we did near-surface observations of both carbon flux and multi-view-angle spectra above a wheat canopy. The carbon flux was used to calculate GPP and the canopy spectra were used to retrieve SIF. SIF is significantly correlated with the angle between sun and viewer than SIF (R2=0.63). The relationships of SIF with GPP are also changing with different view azimuth angles. Generally, SIF observed at 180o (pointing north) are more correlated to GPP than that at the other two angles. A model recently developed by He et al. (2017) was used to normalize multi-angle SIF to the hotspot direction (SIFh) and to compute the canopy-level total SIF (SIFt), in order to reduce the effects of sun-viewer geometry on SIF. Compared to the correlation of GPP with the original observed SIF (SIFobs), the coefficients of determination (R2) increase by ~0.1 and ~0.05 for those of GPP with SIFh and SIFt, respectively. These results would be helpful in estimating GPP of crops at large scales using remote sensing techniques.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898345","GPP;multiple-angle remote sensing;SIF;sun-viewer geometry;hotspot","Fluorescence;Remote sensing;Sun;Production;Azimuth;Temperature measurement;Geometry","atmospheric composition;carbon;crops;fluorescence;photosynthesis;vegetation mapping","remote sensing techniques;canopy spectra;wheat canopy;multiview-angle spectra;carbon flux;gross primary production;original observed SIF;canopy-level total SIF;multiangle SIF;sun-viewer geometry;canopy SIF;GPP;sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence;C;CO2","","4","","17","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most current FAPAR products do not meet such requirements, and further improvements are still needed. In this paper, a data fusion scheme based on the multiple resolution tree (MRT) approach is developed to integrate multiple satellite FAPAR estimates at site and regional scales. MRT was chosen because of the superior computational efficiency compared with other fusion methods. The fusion scheme removed the bias in FAPAR estimates and resulted in a 15% increase in the R2 and 3% reduction in the root-mean-square error compared with the average of individual FAPAR estimates. The regional-scale fusion filled in the missing values, and provided spatially consistent FAPAR distributions at different resolutions.

Through modeling the illuminated scene with point scatterers and line-segment-scatterers, a multi-angle echo model is first presented.

The satellite will carry two Ku-band radars: the wave scatterometer (SWIM) and the wind scatterometer (SCAT). Such a unique configuration provides multi-look and multi-angle observations to reconstruct key parameters of local sea surface conditions: the directional wave spectrum and the determination of the sea surface wind speed and direction. From unique collocated wave and wind measurements, each single instrument observation by its own can benefit from the other one. As often discussed, radar returns, at the same location but for different angles of observations, will possibly exhibit different sensitivity with regard to various sea surface parameters, i.e. near-surface wind speed and direction, significant wave height, sea state degree of development and/or local swell wave spectrum characteristics. This often results in radar signal dispersion which limits the precision of the retrieval algorithms from radar remote sensing measurements. Accordingly, the potential to benefit from additional information from a co-located second instrument could be strongly useful in the correction of such factors. The present work considers the possibility of using the near-nadir SWIM measurements to improve the wind estimates from the scatterometer inversion algorithm. Preliminary estimates and simulations confirm that some types of errors, e.g. due to SCAT antenna geometry and configuration, can largely be reduced. As well, additional improvement can be expected for the measurements under low-wind and rapidly changing sea conditions.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519566","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519566","CFOSAT;ocean remote sensing;surface ocean wind scatterometer","Spaceborne radar;Sea measurements;Radar measurements;Wind speed;Sea surface;Surface waves","atmospheric techniques;backscatter;geophysical signal processing;ocean waves;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;wind","CFOSAT mission;improving scat wind vector retrieval;China France Oceanography Satellite;joint mission;global ocean surface wind;sea state observation;monitoring;Ku-band radars;wave scatterometer;wind scatterometer;unique configuration;multilook;multiangle observations;key parameters;local sea surface conditions;directional wave spectrum;sea surface wind;unique collocated wave;single instrument observation;radar returns;different sensitivity;sea surface parameters;near-surface wind speed;significant wave height;sea state degree;local swell wave spectrum characteristics;radar signal dispersion;retrieval algorithms;radar remote sensing measurements;near-nadir SWIM measurements;scatterometer inversion algorithm;additional improvement;low-wind;sea conditions","","1","","17","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, a synthetic retrieval sensitivity analysis is conducted which studies impacts of “melting effects” on retrievals (ρSRM,εGRM) in the form of snow liquid water. Experimental and synthetic analyses show that snow liquid water noticeably disturbs the retrievals and result in increased correlation R2(ρSRM,εGRM) between them.

Car/Chl value in leaves is considered as an indicator of stress, especially in the middle-layer and bottom-layer of crop. Traditional remote estimation of Car/Chl was based on the data obtained from the nadir. However, there are few studies focusing on the monitoring of Car/Chl in middle-layer and bottom-layer of crop. The objective of this study was to accurately estimate the Car/Chl in vertical layers, especially in the middle-layer and bottom-layer, using in-situ canopy multi-angle spectral data. We took the winter wheat as the research target, the spectral reflectance at nadir, ±20°, ±40°, ±60° viewing angles and leaf carotenoid and chlorophyll content of the bottom-layer, middle-layer and upper-layer measurement were measured, respectively. Two types of models, vegetation indices (VIs) and neural neural network (NN) were employed. It was concluded that -20° observing angle performed best for Car/Chl estimation in the middle-layer, with highest R2 of 0.68 for the MTCI model, and 0.86 for the ANN model, respectively. As for the bottom-layer, the NN achieved better results than the PRI model, corresponding R2 values were 0.76 and 0.60, and viewing angles were nadir and +40°, respectively. Additionally, the NN and SIPI models also performed well for Car/Chl assessment in the upper-layer, corresponding viewing angles were nadir and +60°.

But the weather condition and other factors will influence the field measuring results greatly. Due to the low reflectivity characteristic of water, data noise from the environment factors will cover the true information carried by radiation from the water. A simulated condition eliminating the influence of environment factors could help researchers to solve the problem. In this article, a method of water spectrum data measurement under simulated condition in laboratory is designed. Through simulating light condition, shielding scattering and airflow, the environment factors are delimitated as much as possible. The observation geometry of the spectrometer lens could be automatic controlled in remote by mechanical designing, electronic automation technology and video monitoring. The results show that the fitting degree of the data between this method and synchronization field measurement under good weather condition could reach 0.983 in the 400nm~900nm wavelength range.","","978-1-5090-4860-1","10.1109/ICFST.2017.8210500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8210500","water;spectrum;measurement;simulation;automatic","Reflectivity;Wavelength measurement;Remote sensing;Meteorology;Aquaculture;Water;Geometry","environmental factors;geometrical optics;geophysical signal processing;lenses;reflectivity;remote sensing;spectrometers","good weather condition;synchronization field measurement;light condition;environment factors;data noise;remote sensing satellites;geometrical optics theory;quantitative remote sensing;water spectrum data measurement","","","","10","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mechanism has motivated us to produce the products of fraction of absorbed PAR (fAPAR) by chlorophyll throughout the canopy (fAPARchl). Early results are described for the fAPARchl products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Hyperion generated in test and evaluation mode. MODIS BRDF adjusted surface reflectance (BRFn) products developed with the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction algorithm (MAIAC) and nadir or near-nadir Hyperion surface reflectance products obtained with the ATmosphere REMoval Algorithm (ATREM) are utilized to retrieve the fAPARchl products. A coupled leaf-stem-soil-snow-water_body radiative transfer model has been developed for inversion with the Metropolis approach. These products give a first glimpse of the potential of fAPARchl for the studies of vegetation gross primary production (GPP). The algorithms to retrieve fAPARchl from MODIS imagery and Hyperion imagery are briefly described. The fAPARchl products are evaluated at multiple sites and fields with various vegetation types in globally selected regions. The fAPARchl products are compared to the fAPAR at canopy level (fAPARcanopy) products, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) products. We find that fAPARchl is superior to fAPARcanopy for GPP estimation.

The shadow can block the target of the observation area, making it impossible to obtain the scattering characteristics of the target. The layover causes phase distortion and alters target characteristics. Shadow and layover severely hinder the interpretation of SAR images. To confront the above problems, a multi-angle fusion algorithm based on unsupervised progressive segmentation network is proposed. Firstly, inspired by mega-constellations of low earth orbit, a spaceborne SAR collaborative observation model is proposed to generate multi-angle images of fluctuant terrain. Secondly, according to the difference of echos in the shadow and layover regions, an unsupervised progressive segmentation network is designed to sequentially segment the shadow and layover regions. Finally, to improve the contrast and brightness of the fused SAR image, a single-scale weighted fusion algorithm is designed. Experiments were conducted using the simulated multi-angle SAR images.

Therefore, based on the scattering mechanism of PolSAR, this paper proposes a registration algorithm suitable for PolSAR images.

One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22.

ALH retrieval using geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites is advantageous for monitoring diurnal changes in ALH and understanding long-range transport. Before retrieving the ALH, the aerosol optical properties (AOPs) are retrieved using the green-near infrared (NIR) band, which is relatively insensitive to aerosol height. The retrieved AOPs are used as input to the radiative transfer calculation to compute the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance of a highly sensitive band (the blue band in this study). Then, the ALH is retrieved using the observed and calculated TOA reflectances. Since the retrieval accuracy of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) is better over the ocean, the retrieval was performed only over the ocean during the Korea–United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) campaign period.

As these variables are derived from measured radiances, the underlying radiance data are the most reliable sources of information for change detection. Here, we identify statistically significant trends in the color and spatial texture of the Earth as viewed from multiple directions from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), which has been sampling the angular distribution of scattered sunlight since 2000. Globally, our results show that the Earth has been appearing relatively bluer (up to 1.6% per decade from both nadir and oblique views) and smoother (up to 1.5% per decade only from oblique views) over the past 15 years. The magnitude of the global blueing trends is comparable to that of uncertainties in radiometric calibration stability. Regional shifts in color and texture, which are significantly larger than global means, are observed, particularly over polar regions, along the boundaries of the subtropical highs, the tropical western Pacific, Southwestern Asia, and Australia. We demonstrate that the large regional trends cannot be explained either by uncertainties in radiometric calibration or variability in total or spectral solar irradiance; hence, they reflect changes internal to the Earth's climate system. The 15-year-mean true color composites and texture images of the Earth at both nadir and oblique views are also presented for the first time.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2538723","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OCI-0725070,ACI-1238993); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1429669); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451236","Climate change;satellite remote sensing;regional trends;Climate change;satellite remote sensing;regional trends","Earth;Satellites;Cameras;Image color analysis;Instruments;Clouds;Calibration","geophysical techniques","angular distribution;Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer;geophysical variables;Earth-observing satellites;Earths color;regional changes","","10","","39","IEEE","12 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fitting abilities of these eight models with limited observations are unknown which makes it difficult to choose the best one in practical applications.

For a given target, DOLP determines the magnitude of Rp. It has been proved that DOLP can be used for some remote monitoring cases that cannot be well detected with either non-polarized or polarized reflectance. Several bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF) models have been proposed in the last several decades to reproduce the angular distribution of Rp, but much less attention has been devoted to modeling and analyzing of DOLP. In this study, the Nadal-Bréon BPDF model was transferred for calculating the DOLP of earth targets, and characteristics of DOLP were analyzed based on the modeling results. To evaluate the model's feasibility, two experiments were executed: a fitting and a a priori modeling. The results showed good correlations (r>0.9) between estimated and measured DOLP when the model was fitted with POLDER/PARASOL (a space-borne multi-angle multi-spectral polarimetric sensor) measurements. An increase of accuracy from 490 nm to 865 nm for fitting modeling was achieved and the highest accuracy was found at 865 nm for both experiments, with overall relative root mean square errors of 1.1 and 1.3 for fitting and a priori modeling, respectively. Class-based free parameters can be used for the a priori model of DOLP. The dispersion of the target-based free parameters controls the correlation of the a priori modeling results. Moreover, the maximum DOLP was found to be strongly determined by the corresponding bidirectional reflectance factor for every surface type (R2=0.86). This study provides an additional approach for obtaining DOLP from remote sensing platform and is helpful for studies of typical land surfaces.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3033981","Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2019JJ50047); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801227); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0503004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9240922","Degree of linear polarization (DOLP);bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF);POLDER/PARASOL;BRDF-BPDF database","Land surface;Analytical models;Biological system modeling;Atmospheric modeling;Databases;Forestry;Earth","geophysical techniques;polarimetry;remote sensing","linear polarization;polarized reflectance;polarized characteristics;bidirectional polarization distribution function models;Nadal-Bréon BPDF model;space-borne multiangle multispectral polarimetric sensor;fitting modeling;a priori model;target-based free parameters;maximum DOLP;corresponding bidirectional reflectance factor;land surfaces;POLDER/PARASOL measurements;size 490.0 nm to 865.0 nm","","2","","33","CCBY","27 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The study of SMC quantitative inversion based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology has become the hot spot. Because of using statistical modeling methods and without considering soil bidirectional reflection characteristics, the SMC inversion accuracy and model applicable scope were limited. The purpose of this study was to use the soil radiation transfer model (SOILSPECT) to invert SMC in order to not only improve the SMC hyperspectral inversion accuracy, but also make the model applying widely. Taking the black soil and chernozem in Gongzhuling city of Jilin province as the study object, this paper conducted multi-angle spectrometry measurement for different SMC from 5% to 45% (5% interval) to get measured soil reflectance by using the ASD Fieldspec Pro spectrometer under the indoor condition. The influences of the light source zenith angle, observing zenith angle, azimuth angle and SMC on soil bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were analyzed. Then SOILSPECT model parameters were obtained by using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method under the different SMC gradients, and SMC inversion by using SOILSPECT model was conducted. The results showed that soil BRDF declined with SMC rising in the range of 400~1400 nm wavelength, when SMC was less than the field water holding capacity, and soil BRDF rose with SMC rising when SMC was larger than the field water holding capacity. In the range of 1400~2400nm wavelength and under different observing zenith angles, there was no rules for soil BRDF changing. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model was higher. R2 value was above 0.98 compared the estimated values with the measured values. The inversion accuracy for 15% and 30% of SMC were higher at every sensitive band, but that for other SMC was unsteadiness. SMC inversion accuracy based on SOILSPECT model increased with the decreasing of the observational zenith angle. The vertical observation can get the highest SMC inversion accuracy.","","978-1-5386-5038-7","10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2018.8476086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8476086","soil moisture content;hyperspectral inversion;BRDF;SOILSPECT model","Soil measurements;Reflectivity;Mathematical model;Scattering;Hyperspectral sensors;Soil moisture","geophysical techniques;irrigation;moisture;radiative transfer;reflectivity;remote sensing;soil","Particle Swarm Optimization;light source zenith angle;observing zenith angle;azimuth angle;SOILSPECT model parameters;soil bidirectional reflectance distribution function;SMC hyperspectral inversion accuracy;soil radiation transfer model;soil bidirectional reflection characteristics;statistical modeling methods;SMC quantitative inversion;soil moisture content;highest SMC inversion accuracy;soil BRDF","","","","31","IEEE","30 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a new method for targets parameters estimation. The presented method modifies the degree of linear polarization (DOLP) model by introducing the Lorentz-Drude dispersion constants which do not vary with wavelength as well as the diffuse component of reflection related to the surface roughness to the DOLP equation. This solves the problem of difficulty and inaccuracy caused by multi-angle passive polarimetric measurements used by previous works and helps to improving the parameters estimation accuracy for rough targets. The Monte Carlo simulations result illustrate that the presented method is robust to Gaussian noise. Moreover, the experimental results of rough aluminium plate and rough copper plate validate the effectiveness of the presented model. The errors of estimated n are about 8% for aluminium plate and 9% for copper plate. The errors of estimated k are less than 4% for aluminium plate and no more than 5% for copper plate. The errors of estimated surface roughness σ are about 6.8% and about 6% for aluminium plate and copper plate respectively.

It can reveal for instance whether the plant has received too much or too little nutrients (nitrogen in particular). Corrective measures based on early diagnosis of nitrogen deficiency can prevent yield reduction. Optical approaches to estimating LCC are typically based on measuring the reflectance of leaves (close-range sensing) or canopy (remote sensing) with a spectrophotometer or a hyperspectral sensor. Given the cost of such devices, the use of colour cameras for LCC estimation has recently gained interest. However, existing approaches are mostly designed for very close range sensing, i.e. they allow the measurement of LCC for a single plant at a time, which limits their usefulness in practice. Furthermore, they do not exploit the anisotropic reflective properties of leaves and canopies. To investigate the feasibility of RGB imaging for remote sensing-based estimation of canopy LCC, we present a simulation based on a plant canopy reflectance model. An RGB camera model was used to generate RGB images with various reference illuminants and from 10 different viewing angles. We then applied linear and neural network based regression to predict LCC from RGB values without white balance.

However, these methods cannot satisfy the information acquisition such as correlation, composition analysis and attitude analysis of unlabeled or uncoordinated targets. Therefore, we are committed to researching new intelligent feature extraction and analysis method. In this article, a novel learning framework is proposed to realize the angle correlation feature extraction and feature analysis of multi-angle HRRP targets. A multi-layer sparse autoencoder is applied to extract HRRP features and the extracted features are mapped to the low-dimensional space by manifold learning method to find the correlation distribution of HRRP data. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by experiments with simulated and measured data. The experimental results show that the framework realizes the extraction of angle-invariant features, and the analysis of distribution relationship between HRRP data and angles.

The algorithm proposed in this paper extracts the width of target persistence angle which is defined as target azimuth-angle sensitivity. It is an effective parameter to distinguish different types of anisotropic targets. And it is independent of azimuth orientations for its measurement of width of target persistence angle.

To improve the SAR image quality, we propose a distributed SAR imaging method for the cylinder target with a sparse distributed SAR configuration. The proposed method reconstructs the cylinder target by estimating the parameters from the SAR image, and then identity the cylinder target from the distributed SAR echo.

Our team has previously proposed the logarithm background subtraction algorithm for moving target detection in single-channel circular SAR. Its principle is that the background image (static clutter) is obtained by median filtering of the image sequence, and the foreground image (moving target) is obtained by subtraction. To further improve the performance of background and foreground separation, we introduce the low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD) method into the previous framework. A new algorithm based on LRSD and adaptive threshold detector (ATD) is proposed in this letter. First, this letter introduces entropy metric to optimize parameters in LRSD to obtain better background and foreground separation. Second, since the statistical distribution of the foreground image is unknown, the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector cannot be applied to the foreground image. Therefore, an adaptive threshold detector (ATD) built on Otsu is presented in this letter, which is independent of image statistical properties. The final detection result is obtained via clustering using the modified density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by the experimental results on the airborne X-band Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2022.3153092","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61860206013); North China University of Technology Research Startup Funds(grant numbers:110051360002); Fundamental Research Fund of Beijing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:110052972027/119); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718099","Circular synthetic aperture radar (SAR);adaptive threshold detector (ATD);low-rank sparse decomposition (LRSD);moving target detection;single channel","Object detection;Synthetic aperture radar;Clutter;Sparse matrices;Image sequences;Image segmentation;Detectors","entropy;image reconstruction;image sequences;motion estimation;object detection;pattern clustering;radar detection;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","single-channel circular SAR ground moving target detection;LRSD;adaptive threshold detector;multiangle observation;circular synthetic aperture radar;logarithm background subtraction algorithm;background image;image sequence;foreground image;foreground separation;low-rank sparse decomposition method;constant false alarm rate detector;image statistical properties;final detection result;airborne X-band Gotcha Volumetric SAR Data","","1","","16","IEEE","21 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We also show how these methodologies and techniques can be effectively applied to solving general real-world problems with impacts on wireless communication, medicine, and meteorology. The applications include (A) smart underground mining with an integrated wireless cyber-physical framework using CEM modeling and measurements of wireless propagation in underground mines, (B) design of RF coils for next-generation high and ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners based on CEM and MRI experiments, and (C) accurate characterization of winter precipitation using multi-angle snowflake camera, visual hull image processing, advanced scattering methods, and polarimetric radar.","","978-1-7281-0878-0","10.1109/TELSIKS46999.2019.9002216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9002216","computational electromagnetics;higher order methods;uncertainty quantification;error estimation;adjoint methods;adaptive refinement;meshing techniques;RF and microwave modeling;wireless communication;smart mining;ray tracing;magnetic resonance imaging;RF MRI coil design;remote sensing of snow;polarimetric radar","Finite element analysis;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Adaptation models;Radio frequency;Wireless sensor networks;Computational electromagnetics","biomedical MRI;computational electromagnetics;error analysis;finite element analysis;image processing;iterative methods;mesh generation;sensitivity analysis","medicine;meteorology;finite element method;ray-tracing;hybrid techniques;CEM modeling;microwave devices;posteriori error estimation;sensitivity analysis;intelligent model refinement;adjoint methods;discrete surface Ricci flow method enabling generation;high quality meshes;adaptive iterative mesh refinement;wireless communication;smart underground mining;integrated wireless cyber-physical framework;wireless propagation;underground mines;RF coils;ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging scanners;advanced scattering methods;higher order computational electromagnetics;meshing techniques","","","","27","IEEE","20 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
