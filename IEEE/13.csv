However, the merging of data products from multisensors is often adversely affected by the difference in their spectral characteristics. In addition, the errors in the atmospheric correction (AC) methods further increase the inconsistencies in downstream products. This work proposes an improved spectral harmonization method for OLI and MSI-derived remote sensing reflectance ( ${R_{rs}}$ ) products, which significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. We compared  ${R_{rs}}$  retrieved via state-of-the-art AC processors, i.e., Acolite, C2RCC, and Polymer, against ship-based in situ  ${R_{rs}}$  observations obtained from the Barents Sea waters, including a wide range of optical properties. Results suggest that the Acolite-derived  ${R_{rs}}$  has a minimum bias for our study area with median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) varying from 9% to 25% in the blue–green bands. To spectrally merge OLI and MSI, we develop and apply a new machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model to near-simultaneous OLI and MSI images acquired in the years from 2018 to 2020. Compared to a conventional linear adjustment, we demonstrate that the spectral difference is significantly reduced from  $\sim 6$ % to 12% to  $\sim 2$ % to  ${< } {10\%}$  in the common OLI-MSI bands using the proposed BA model. The findings of this study are useful for the combined use of OLI and MSI  ${R_{rs}}$  products for water quality monitoring applications. The proposed method has the potential to be applied to other waters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3228393","The Nansen Legacy [Research Council of Norway (RCN)](grant numbers:276730); Center for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) (RCN)(grant numbers:237906); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) Project(grant numbers:210319602); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission-Climate (GCOM-C)(grant numbers:22RT000298); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9980426","Barents Sea;intersensor comparison;machine learning (ML);ocean color;remote sensing reflectance","Remote sensing;Monitoring;Spatial resolution;Arctic;Image color analysis;Optical sensors;Reflectivity","ecology;geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing","aquatic ecosystems;atmospheric correction methods;Barents sea waters;common OLI-MSI bands;downstream products;European Arctic;improved spectral harmonization method;Landsat-8 operational land imager;machine learning;machine learning-based bandpass adjustment model;median absolute percentage difference;Sentinel-2 remote sensing reflectance products;spectral characteristics;spectral harmonization algorithm;state-of-the-art AC processors","","","","67","IEEE","12 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making their change visible by comparing digital elevation models over time or by identifying the induced vegetation changes in time-series of optical satellite images. In this study we use digital elevation models generated from TanDEM-X observations to detect and derive volume and area change rates for RTSs on the Taymyr Peninsula. The available data takes allows to compare two time periods: from 2010/11/12 to 2016/17 and from 2017/18 to 2020/21. From 2016 onwards optical Sentinel-2 observations are available for which we manually map thaw slumps for each year in a small sub-area and compare the results to the TanDEM-X mapped RTSs. We found a strong, non-linear increase in the second time-period of the TanDEM-X period and by using the optical mapped RTSs we could attribute this increase to the Siberian heatwave in 2020.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883750","Permafrost;Retrogressive Thaw Slumps;TanDEM-X;Sentinel-2;Elevation Models differences","Heating systems;Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Optical imaging;Optical sensors;Arctic;Nonlinear optics","atmospheric temperature;climatology;digital elevation models;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;glaciology;ice;remote sensing;vegetation","retrogressive thaw slumps;rapid changes;Arctic permafrost thaw;slump headwall;digital elevation models;induced vegetation changes;time-series;optical satellite images;TanDEM-X observations;area change rates;time periods;2016 onwards optical Sentinel-2 observations;time-period;TanDEM-X period;optical mapped RTSs","","","","19","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m3, collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks. The proposed OCN model achieved reduced mean absolute error compared to the GPR by 5.2%, C2RCC by 51.7%, OC3 by 22.6%, and spectral band ratios by 29%. Moreover, the proposed spatial window and depth-integrated match-up creation techniques improved the performance of the proposed OCN by 57%, GPR by 41.9%, OC3 by 5.3%, and spectral band ratio method by 24% in terms of RMSE compared to the conventional match-up selection approach.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3074975","Nansen Legacy Project, RCN(grant numbers:276730); Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9411655","Barents sea;Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) monitoring;ocean color (OC)","Biological system modeling;Image color analysis;Satellites;Remote sensing;Arctic;Sea measurements;Production","Gaussian processes;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;ocean composition;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;organic compounds;regression analysis;remote sensing;underwater optics","Sentinel-2;Barents Sea;ocean chlorophyll-a;optical remote sensing;machine learning models;depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations;spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method;neural network model;ocean color algorithm;OCN model;in situ Chl-a observations;AD 2016 to 2018;pigment content;multispectral imager instrument;ocean color net;Gaussian process regression;Case-2 regional-coast colour processing chain model","","6","","73","CCBY","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios. A wide range of experiments has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed OCN for ocean color remote sensing in the subarctic region. The performance of the OCN is also presented spatially by computing chl-a maps in the Barents Sea.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323687","Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:276730); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323687","Barents Sea;Ocean Color;chl-a Monitoring","Arctic;Oceans;Image color analysis;Sea measurements;Optical sensors;Remote sensing;Monitoring","ecology;geophysical image processing;image colour analysis;oceanographic techniques;optical images;remote sensing;underwater optics","subarctic region;Ocean Color Net regression model;OCN;ocean color remote sensing;chl-a;transitional Barents Sea;optical images;chlorophyll-a concentrations;MultiSpectral Imager Instrument;Sentinel-2;Machine Learning techniques;Support Vector Regression","","2","","13","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, the changing river dynamics caused by accelerated bank erosion and consequent river siltation is making travel on the Colville increasingly difficult and in some cases dangerous. We used summer 2017 scenes from three optical sensors (PlanetScope, Sentinel 2, and Landsat) with resolution ranging from 3-30 m along with field measurements of water-depth to map shallow-water sites along a 45-km stretch of the Colville River. We found a strong correlation ( R2=0.9) between field-measured water depths and image-derived reflectance quantity (natural log ratio of green over red bands).
