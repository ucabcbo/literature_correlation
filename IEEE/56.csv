This will identify whether there is any obstruction in the way of ice or not so that ship does not strike with ice. The desired results are obtained when SAR algorithm is connected on RADARl imagery data. They also studied the algorithm for the segmentation of ice known as pixel based segmentation which helps to differentiate ice based on its properties. Large number of methods has been utilized for multi temporal segmentation from the MODIS data which is known as TempoSeg strategy for multiyear sea ice. Synthetic Aperture Radar utilized the RADARSATl imagery data in order to detect the ice of sea at different regions of the seas. With the help of Rl imagery data better outcomes are provided by the automated algorithm. In present work, the automated SAR algorithm is required to execute in order to detect sea ice.","","978-1-5386-2842-3","10.1109/ICCONS.2018.8663049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663049","Hyperspectral;multi-spectral;SAR;Image property","Hyperspectral imaging;Ice;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Synthetic aperture radar","geophysical image processing;image segmentation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","automated SAR algorithm;hyperspectral image;property analysis;sea ice SAR algorithm;pixel based segmentation;multitemporal segmentation;MODIS data;multiyear sea ice;RADARSATl imagery data;Rl imagery data","","","","12","IEEE","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
