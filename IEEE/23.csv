Increases in precipitation and local evaporation in the Arctic, known as the acceleration components of the hydrologic cycle, coupled with land cover changes, have resulted in significant changes in the regional surface energy budget. An extensive local evaluation of the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) - a remote sensing-based model using thermal infrared retrievals of land-surface temperature - was performed using tower measurements collected over two flux towers in Greenland's tundra types and two flux tower sites in Alaska's boreal forest in all sky conditions in summer. Evaluation results showed a mean turbulent flux errors generally less than 50 W·m-2 at half-hourly timesteps, similar to errors typically reported in surface energy balance modelling studies conducted in more temperate climatic regimes.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900401","Surface energy balance;thermal infrared;Arctic;boreal forest","Arctic;Forestry;Ocean temperature;Poles and towers;Sea surface;Remote sensing;Land surface temperature","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric temperature;atmospheric turbulence;evaporation;hydrology;land cover;land surface temperature;remote sensing;snow","surface energy fluxes retrieval;Arctic tundra;thermal remote sensing model;warmer place;earlier snow;permafrost degradation;plant communities;precipitation;local evaporation;acceleration components;hydrologic cycle;land cover changes;regional surface energy budget;extensive local evaluation;two-source energy balance model;remote sensing-based model;thermal infrared retrievals;land-surface temperature;tower measurements;flux towers;Greenland's tundra types;flux tower sites;Alaska's boreal forest;mean turbulent flux errors;surface energy balance modelling studies;sky conditions;temperate climatic regimes;power 50.0 W","","","","13","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenge is to develop an accurate and robust technique to derive AOT above highly variable and bright snow/ice surfaces. To extend data coverage of the eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE Retrieval (XBAER) AOT data product in the future, we propose a new algorithm for the retrieval of AOT and surface properties over snow/ice simultaneously. The algorithm utilizes the linear perturbation theory and does not use any simplified atmospheric correction techniques. Key issues like the selection of a proper aerosol type and optimal surface parameterization method for the retrieval of AOT over the Arctic have been investigated. The aerosol type is investigated using the aerosol climatology microphysical properties derived from four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites (Barrow, Hornsund, Kangerlussuaq, and Tiksi). The three-parametric Ross-Li linear kernel model is used to describe the snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The a priori knowledge of wavelength-dependent features of the coefficients in the Ross-Li linear kernel model is derived from Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) measurements over the Arctic and utilized as constraints in the retrieval. The studies show that the combination of Ross-Li surface model and weakly absorbing aerosol parameterization provides an optimal way to derive AOT over the Arctic snow/ice-covered regions from passive remote sensing observations. The retrieved AOTs using POLDER show good agreement with AERONET observations.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2972339","SFB/TR 172 “ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3”; German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9007036","Aerosol;arctic;retrieval;satellite;snow-covered","Aerosols;Arctic;Clouds;Optical surface waves;Satellites;Sea surface;Remote sensing","aerosols;atmospheric optics;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;climatology;clouds;ice;perturbation theory;reflectivity;remote sensing;snow","Arctic snow-covered regions;Aerosol typing;surface reflection model;aerosol optical thickness data;AOT;space-borne passive remote sensing;accurate technique;robust technique;data coverage;simplified atmospheric correction techniques;proper aerosol type;optimal surface parameterization method;aerosol climatology microphysical properties;Aerosol Robotic Network sites;kernel model;snow bidirectional reflectance distribution function;Ross-Li surface model;aerosol parameterization;passive remote sensing observations;retrieved AOTs","","9","","75","IEEE","21 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the Arctic, aerosol is an important factor that causes the temperature and environmental change. The lack of ground-based observation data in the Arctic makes satellite remote sensing an effective means for aerosol monitoring.We first selected the C61 version of the MODIS Level2 10 KM aerosol product from 2000 to 2018 as the Arctic's aerosol monitoring data. Then the products Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was evaluated by 20 ground-based AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sites in the Arctic. Based on the data with high quality control, the monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic were analyzed. Results show that: 1. MODIS AOD is overestimated in the Arctic and requires quality control to obtain more reliable results; 2. The monthly averaged AOD in the Arctic region does not exceed 0.3 with maximum 0.25 and minimum 0.027, and the average monthly AOD value of 18 years is 0.111.

However, the merging of data products from multisensors is often adversely affected by the difference in their spectral characteristics. In addition, the errors in the atmospheric correction (AC) methods further increase the inconsistencies in downstream products. This work proposes an improved spectral harmonization method for OLI and MSI-derived remote sensing reflectance ( ${R_{rs}}$ ) products, which significantly reduces uncertainties compared to those in the literature. We compared  ${R_{rs}}$  retrieved via state-of-the-art AC processors, i.e., Acolite, C2RCC, and Polymer, against ship-based in situ  ${R_{rs}}$  observations obtained from the Barents Sea waters, including a wide range of optical properties. Results suggest that the Acolite-derived  ${R_{rs}}$  has a minimum bias for our study area with median absolute percentage difference (MAPD) varying from 9% to 25% in the blue–green bands. To spectrally merge OLI and MSI, we develop and apply a new machine learning-based bandpass adjustment (BA) model to near-simultaneous OLI and MSI images acquired in the years from 2018 to 2020. Compared to a conventional linear adjustment, we demonstrate that the spectral difference is significantly reduced from  $\sim 6$ % to 12% to  $\sim 2$ % to  ${< } {10\%}$  in the common OLI-MSI bands using the proposed BA model. The findings of this study are useful for the combined use of OLI and MSI  ${R_{rs}}$  products for water quality monitoring applications.

Snow depth data are from three sources including climatology observation, microwave remote sensing and reanalysis data, while six snow/ice density combination schemes were adopted. The results show the averaged monthly sea ice freeboard from ICESat-2 ATL20 product well captures the seasonal variation of sea ice freeboard and sea ice growth in Arctic winter, which can be further used to estimate SIT. The difference of monthly SIT from different snow and ice density schemes is smaller than that caused by snow depth. Overall, the largest difference caused by snow depth in mean SIT is ~0.50 m, while that caused by the snow and ice density is ~0. 15 m.

We successfully deployed this remote sensing platform in three sites along an elevation gradient near Nome, Alaska in summer 2017. Corresponding workflows have been further developed for assessing spectral, structural, and thermal patterns of arctic tundra biomes from the collected datasets. Our results demonstrate that the UAS platform can successfully (1) map heterogenous vegetation composition and (2) assess corresponding spectral, structural, and thermal patterns of Arctic tundra biomes.

However, eddy identification and tracking via remote sensing can be a challenging task, since each sensor has some limitations. In order to overcome potential challenges, it is crucial to exploit the complementary information provided by different sensing systems. As one of the steps toward this aim, we have investigated the pertinence of applying the scheme, including a texture features extraction and a superpixel segmentation method, in order to distinguish eddies in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) using multisensor remote sensing data. Nevertheless, not all the images available from various sensors are of actual importance, since they can be corrupted, redundant, or simply unnecessary for a particular task.

This is certainly true for the arctic tundra as it is extremely sensitive to climate change. Satellites are used to observe large areas of the arctic tundra. However, the measurements are not at sufficient spatial resolution to be used to determine the species of animals, and to measure humidity, temperature, and CO2 levels for small areas. Ground-based measurements, which represent less that one percent of the experiments carried on the arctic tundra, must be done. Deploying and maintaining ground-based instruments is hard to do because visiting the arctic tundra is expensive, time consuming, and dangerous. Instead, automation is needed, where instruments can operate independently for long periods of time, and allow interaction with remote users for reporting of data and control of the instruments. However, the arctic tundra also has, as a common case, limited data network and energy coverage. We present the Distributed Arctic Observatory, where instruments called Observation Units (OUs) are distributed across the arctic tundra to measure a range of environmental state variables, and report them to where they are needed for further analysis. The DAO project uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide backhaul network access and energy to OUs. The modifications applied to the UAV and to OUs are presented. We describe the experiences gathered from practical use of the UAV to provide network access and energy to OUs located on the ground at 70°N.

Results from selected Sentinel-1 SAR scenes show that sea ice leads and open water areas can be identified with co-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles while water misclassification occurs at smaller incidence due to stronger surface scattering.

Being moored to ice floes at high Arctic for a whole year, thus including the winter season, the main goal of the expedition is to better understand and quantify relevant processes within the atmosphere-ice-ocean system that impact the sea ice, ultimately leading to improved climate models. Satellite remote sensing, specially multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a major role to achieve this goal. Two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. A comprehensive set of C- and L- band SAR images were acquired during the course of MOSAiC. In this initial study we evaluate the effects of seasonal changes on C- and L-band backscatter in respect to three different sea ice types, i.e., Young Ice, Smooth Ice and Rough/Deformed Ice along with the performance of sea ice type retrieval of a established algorithm. Areas of deformed, smooth and young sea ice were observed in the vicinity of R/V Polarstern and these areas are included whenever possible in the yearlong time series. For both frequencies a change in all backscatter channels values can be observed during the early melt season. This is first noticeable in the C-band images and later followed by a change in the L-band images, probably caused by their different penetration depth and volume scattering sensitivities.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553062","MOSAiC;Sea Ice Type;Polarimetry;SAR;ALOS-2 PALSAR-2;RADARSAT-2","C-band;Atmospheric modeling;Radar polarimetry;Arctic;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;L-band","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","temporal resolution;AD 2019 09;German research icebreaker Polarstern;mosaic ice floe;MOSAiC;multidisciplinary Arctic expedition;L-band images;C-band images;young sea ice;smooth sea ice;deformed sea ice;sea ice type retrieval;L-band backscatter;seasonal changes;L- band SAR images;radar response;SAR based remote sensing;multifrequency synthetic aperture radar;satellite remote sensing;climate models;atmosphere-ice-ocean system;winter season;high Arctic Ocean;Arctic climate;Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory","","","","8","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our results also illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristic of discrepancy between microwave remotely sensed SIC products and reanalysis dataset for the whole Arctic and Antarctic regions. The large difference for all the four SIC products mostly occurs in summer and marginal ice zone, indicating a great deal of uncertainty of satellite SIC products in this period and areas. The results will be useful to find possible errors in the satellite SIC products for further algorithm improvement.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899166","microwave remote sensing;sea ice concentration;reanalysis data;consistency","Silicon carbide;Arctic;Antarctica;Remote sensing;Sea ice;Satellites","geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","reanalysis dataset;polar regions;sea ice concentration products;reanalysis SIC dataset;Chinese Feng Yun-3B;Chinese Feng Yun-3C;DMSP SSMIS;GCOM-W AMSR2;NASA Bootstrap algorithm;OISSTV2 dataset;satellite-based SIC products;remotely sensed SIC values;ASI algorithm;SIC estimation;marginal ice zone;satellite SIC products;algorithm improvement;Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice algorithm;SSMIS-ASI;NASA Team sea ice algorithm;microwave remotely sensed sea ice concentration;remotely sensed sea ice concentrations;Arctic region;Antarctic region","","1","","5","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our understanding of snow thickness distributions on sea ice is severely limited by its vastness and numerous logistical difficulties. As such, we rarely collect enough in situ data from similar geographic locations to determine if and how the snow thickness distribution changes spatiotemporally. Geophysical changes in snow cover manifest as differences in dielectric properties, which are detectable in microwave emission and backscatter. Active microwave remote sensing offers improved spatial resolution when compared to passive microwave approaches. We apply our recently developed method that exploits the indirect thermodynamic control of the snow cover on near ice surface geophysical properties. The variance of C-band (5.3 GHz HH-polarization) microwave backscatter in winter (prior to melt) is assessed and is then used to estimate relative snow cover thickness and distribution. We assess the capability of our approach over landfast, first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and evaluate and compare our method against the Canadian Regional Ice Ocean Prediction system and AMSR2 passive microwave snow thickness estimates. Results demonstrate that this method can separate thick snow from thin snow on thick FYI within a thickness range of 5 to 45 cm at a spatial resolution of less than 5 km.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323947","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323947","Arctic;sea ice;snow;scatterometer;ASCAT","Snow;Sea ice;Spaceborne radar;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Ice;Arctic","backscatter;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","snow cover manifest;dielectric properties;microwave emission;active microwave remote sensing;spatial resolution;passive microwave approaches;indirect thermodynamic control;ice surface geophysical properties;HH-polarization;relative snow cover thickness;first-year sea ice;Canadian Arctic Archipelago;Canadian Regional Ice Ocean Prediction system;AMSR2 passive microwave snow thickness estimates;passive microwave data;momentum fluxes;polar regions;snow thickness distributions;geographic locations;geophysical changes;C-band;frequency 5.3 GHz","","","","48","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the training phase, the output parameters are generated from quad-pol observations obtained by Radarsat-2 (RS2), and the corresponding input data consist of features obtained from overlapping dual-pol Sentinel-1 (S1) data. Then, two, well-recognized ML methods are studied to learn the functional relationship between the output and input data. These ML approaches are the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) for regression models. The goal is to use the aforementioned ML techniques to generate Arctic sea ice information from freely available dual-pol observations acquired by S1, which can, in general, only be generated from quad-pol data. Eight overlapping RS2 and S1 scenes were used to train and test the GPR and NN models. Statistical regression performance measures were computed to evaluate the strength of the ML regression methods. Then, two scenes were selected for further evaluation, where overlapping optical images were available as well. This allowed the visual interpretation of the maps estimated by the ML models. Finally, one of the methods was tested on an entire S1 scene to perform prediction on areas outside of the RS2 and S1 overlap.

For each waveform, the centroid, skewness, kurtosis, and pulse area were also calculated. Received waveform parameters, such as pulsewidth, pulse amplitude, pulse area, skewness, and kurtosis, show coherent response to variations of geophysical features along an ATM or LVIS profile. These parameters, combined with elevation, were used to identify leads in sea-ice freeboard calculation. The relationship between these parameters and sea-ice freeboard and surface features were studied by comparing the parameters with ATM and LVIS-derived freeboard and coincident Digital Mapping System images which have been used to classify sea-ice surface types such as leads, thin ice, gray ice, and thick ice. An elevation bias of more than 16 cm (peak-to-peak) as a function of laser scanner azimuth was found in the ATM data, and an empirical correction was applied; this correction will improve the ATM shot-to-shot freeboard significantly.

However, it is also true that not all the information is relevant. It may be redundant, corrupted, or unnecessary for the given task, hence decreasing the performance of the algorithms. Therefore, it is crucial to select an optimal set of image attributes which provides the relevant information content to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the image interpretation and retrieval of geophysical parameters. Comprehensive studies have been focused on the analysis of relevant features for sea ice analysis obtained from different sensors, especially synthetic aperture radar. However, the outcomes of these studies are mostly data and application-dependent and can, therefore, rarely be generalized. In this article, we employ a feature selection method based on graph Laplacians, which is fully automatic and easy to implement. The proposed approach assesses relevant information on a global and local level using two metrics and selects relevant features for different regions of an image according to their physical characteristics and observation conditions. In the recent study, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for sea ice classification, using different multi-sensor data combinations. Experiments show the advantage of applying multi-sensor data sets and demonstrate that the attributes selected by our method result in high classification accuracies. We demonstrate that our approach automatically considers varying technical, sensor-specific, environmental, and sea ice conditions by employing flexible and adaptive feature selection method as a pre-processing step.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3099398","Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations; Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:237906); Automatic Multi-sensor Remote Sensing for Sea Ice Characterization; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:825258); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495271","Graph Laplacians;multi-sensor remote sensing;sea ice;unsupervised information selection","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;Optical imaging;Integrated optics;Optical polarization;Optical sensors","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","automatic selection;multisensor remote sensing analysis;sea ice classification;satellite sensors;sea ice conditions;image attributes;relevant information content;image interpretation;sea ice analysis;synthetic aperture radar;observation conditions;multisensor data sets;flexible feature selection method;adaptive feature selection method;multisensor data combinations","","5","","34","CCBY","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among multiyear ice loss, about 74% (autumn) and 93% (spring) of the loss were attributable to the depletion of the oldest ice type (5 years and older).

This work aims at improving methodology for studying these features, by estimating chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations in the transitional Barents Sea by remotely sensing its optical properties, in order to better understand the large-scale algal bloom dynamics in the region. The in-situ measurements of chl-a are collected from the year 2016 to 2018 over a wide area of the Barents Sea to cover the spatial and temporal variations in chl-a concentration. Optical images of the Barents Sea are captured by the Multi-Spectral Imager Instrument on Sentinel-2. Using these remotely sensed optical images and the in-situ measurements, we propose a match-up dataset creation method based on the distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra. Different Machine Learning (ML) techniques are assessed to estimate concentration of chl-a using the match-up dataset. Most of these techniques have not been investigated before in the subarctic region such as the Barents Sea. The Ocean Color Net (OCN) regression model proposed in this study has outperformed other ML-based techniques including Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, and the globally trained Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-Nets, as well as empirical methods based on spectral band ratios. A wide range of experiments has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed OCN for ocean color remote sensing in the subarctic region.

However, in situ SSS data in the Arctic Ocean are very sparse. The L-band microwave radiometer on board of NASA SMAP mission provides salinity measurements since April 2015, at 40 km resolution with global ocean coverage in ~3 days. With improved land/ice correction and RFI detection, SMAP SSS are retrieved in ice-free regions near the river mouth and ice edge. The collocated SMAP SSS and in situ salinity data collected by AXCTD from Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) 2016 field campaign along Greenland coast show reasonable agreement in revealing the freshening signature, which is not seen in ocean model output. During the open water season (August), SMAP SSS were retrieved in Chukchi Sea (2015), in Prudhoe Bay and East Siberian Sea (2016), and in Kara Sea in both years. The SSS contrast between the two years is consistent with sea ice concentration observations. Variability of SSS in Kara Sea is correlated positively with adjacent river discharges but negatively with the salinity of water transported from Atlantic Ocean.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519602","SMAP;SSS;Arctic;freshwater;monitoring;sea ice;river discharge","Rivers;Oceans;Arctic;Sea ice;Salinity (geophysical);Discharges (electric)","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;rivers;sea ice;seawater","Greenland coast;in situ salinity data;in situ SSS data;Atlantic Ocean;sea ice concentration observations;SSS contrast;Kara Sea;East Siberian Sea;Chukchi Sea;open water season;ice edge;river mouth;ice-free regions;global ocean coverage;salinity measurements;NASA SMAP mission;L-band microwave radiometer;open straits;ocean transport;evaporation;precipitation;surface freshwater;river discharge;Arctic Ocean;water cycle;Arctic freshwater system;SMAP Sea surface salinity","","1","","4","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The operational monitoring of low backscatter targets can benefit from a stronger integration of freely available SAR imagery from Sentinel-1. We, therefore, propose a detection method applicable to Sentinel-1 extra wide-swath (EW) SAR scenes. Using intensity values coupled with incidence angle and noise-equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) information, the image segmentation method is able to detect the low backscatter targets as one segment across subswaths. We use the Barents Sea as a test site due to the abundant presence of low backscatter targets with different origins, and of long-term operational monitoring services that help cross-validate our observations.

Our previous study found that SMAP SSS shows signatures consistent with the inter-annual anomalies of observed sea ice concentration and river discharge, but with large uncertainty (~1 psu) compared with limited in-situ data. One of error sources is the un-corrected sea ice contamination effect. The JPL SMAP algorithm retrieves SSS at each wind-salinity-cell if the matchup sea ice concentration (SIC) is less than 3% with no ice correction implemented yet. Since L-band brightness temperature (TB) of sea ice is much higher than that of seawater, SSS retrieved from TB from a field of view (FOV) mixed with water and ice will result in false fresh signature if the sea ice effect is not accurately accounted for. In this study, we develop an empirical observation-driven sea ice correction algorithm. We characterize the sea ice signature using SMAP TB and ancillary SIC data. The sea ice effect is corrected near ice edge where SIC is under a predetermined threshold for SSS retrieval. We consider the seasonal variation of TB over ice to be likely associated with seasonal change of physical temperature and summer melting pond. The sea ice fraction (ICEF) is calculated by integration of SIC over SMAP FOV weighted by antenna gain patterns. An empirical sea ice correction algorithm is proposed. The impact of sea ice correction is demonstrated by comparing TBs with or without sea ice correction.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323740","SMAP;radiometer;sea surface salinity;sea ice;Arctic Ocean","Ice;Sea ice;Silicon carbide;Arctic;Sea measurements;Oceans;Social factors;Climate change","ocean temperature;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;rivers;sea ice;seawater;wind","sea ice fraction;empirical sea ice correction algorithm;SMAP SSS retrieval;Arctic Ocean;sea surface salinity;river discharge;sea ice contamination effect;JPL SMAP algorithm;sea ice concentration;sea ice effect;empirical observation-driven sea ice correction algorithm;sea ice signature;ancillary SIC data;SMAP TB data;L-band brightness temperature;wind-salinity-cell","","1","","7","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For many applications, quantitative values of Arctic environment parameters are needed regardless of cloud cover and time of day (illumination). These include, for example, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), ice drift speed and direction, ice concentration, area of land ice melting zones, type and intensity of solid and liquid precipitation, cloud liquid water content, total atmospheric water vapor content, and other geophysical parameters. The source of information on these parameters are the data obtained by microwave scanning radiometers, scatterometers, and radars of various types from polar orbiting satellites of various countries.

However, most existing Arctic vegetation maps are at a coarse resolution and with a varying degree of detail and accuracy. Remote sensing-based approaches for mapping vegetation, while promising, are challenging in high latitude environments due to frequent cloud cover, polar darkness, and limited availability of high-resolution remote sensing datasets (e.g., ~ 5 m). This study proposes a new remote sensing based multi-sensor data fusion approach for developing high-resolution maps of vegetation in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We focus detailed analysis and validation study around the Kougarok river, located in the central Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We seek to evaluate the integration of hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, radar, and terrain datasets using unsupervised and supervised classification techniques over a ~343.72 km2 area for generating vegetation classifications at a variety of resolutions (5 m and 12.5 m). We fist applied a quantitative goodness-of-fit method, called Mapcurves, that shows the degree of spatial concordance between the public coarse resolution maps and k-means clustering values and relabels the k values based on the best overlap. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for developing high resolution vegetation maps for our study region in Arctic. We compare two CNN approaches: (1) breaking up the images into small patches (e.g., 6 × 6) and predict the vegetation class for entire patch and (2) semantic segmentation and predict the vegetation class for every pixel. We also perform accuracy assessments of the developed data products and evaluate varying CNN architectures. The fusion of hyperspectral and optical datasets performed the best, with accuracy values increased from 0.64 to 0.96-0.97 when using a training map produced by unsupervised clustering and Mapcurves labeling for both CNN models.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-3800-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2017.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215680","Multi-Sensor;Fusion;Remote Sensing;Vegetation Classificaiton","Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Arctic;Earth;Biological system modeling;Artificial satellites;Meteorology","geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;neural nets;pattern clustering;sensor fusion;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","US Department of Energy;Arctic vegetation mapping;Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment;Mapcurves labeling;unsupervised clustering;hyperspectral-optical dataset fusion;k values;training map;developed data products;vegetation class;CNN approaches;high resolution vegetation maps;public coarse resolution maps;vegetation classifications;unsupervised classification techniques;central Seward Peninsula;validation study;Alaska;multisensor data fusion approach;high-resolution remote sensing datasets;frequent cloud cover;high latitude environments;existing Arctic vegetation maps;Arctic ecosystems;land-atmosphere interactions;terrestrial ecosystem processes;multisensor remote sensing fusion;convolutional neural network approach;size 343.72 km","","5","","44","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

L-band SAR has proven to be sensitive toward deformed sea ice and is complementary compared with operationally used C-band SAR for sea ice type classification during the early and advanced melt seasons. Here, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN)-based sea ice type classification algorithm on a comprehensive data set of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 fully polarimetric images acquired with a range of incidence angles and during different environmental conditions. The variability within the data set means that it is ideal for making a novel assessment of the robustness of the sea ice classification, investigating the intraclass variability, the seasonal variations, and the incidence angle effect on the sea ice classification results. The images coincide with two different Arctic campaigns in 2015: the Norwegian Young Sea Ice Cruise 2015 (N-ICE2015) and the Polarstern’s (PS92) Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone (TRANSSIZ). We find that it is essential to take into account seasonality and intraclass variability when establishing training data for machine learning-based algorithms though moderate differences in incidence angle are possible to accommodate by the classifier during the dry and cold winter season. We also conclude that the incidence angle dependence of backscatter for a given ice type is consistent for different Arctic regions.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035029","Echtzeitdienste für die Maritime Sicherheit II/III (EMSII/III) Project; Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany; Center for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) Norwegian Research Council (NFR)(grant numbers:237906); Fram Centre Arctic Ocean Flagship Program via the Automised Large-scale Sea Ice Mapping Project; NFR Project Oil spill and newly formed sea ice detection, characterization, and mapping in the Barents Sea using remote sensing by SAR (OIBSAR)(grant numbers:280616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9257591","Artificial neural network (ANN);L-band;operational service;polarimetry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;L-band;Ocean temperature;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic;Satellites;Temperature measurement","image classification;neural nets;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","intraclass variability;dry winter season;cold winter season;SAR Sea Ice type classification;space-borne synthetic aperture radar polarimetry;sea ice type retrieval;l-band SAR;deformed sea ice;C-band SAR;advanced melt seasons;artificial neural network-based sea ice type classification algorithm;comprehensive data set;ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 fully polarimetric images;seasonal variations;incidence angle effect;sea ice classification results;Norwegian Young Sea Ice Cruise 2015;Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone","","8","","49","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the diverse types and distribution of sea-ice in various scenes, the categories of sea-ice scenes are indistinct. So a grouping way is primarily introduced to define different sea-ice scenes. These scenes are grouped into six typical categories according to the distribution of sea-ice. Then a transfer learning strategy is used to fine-tune a pre-trained deep convolution neural network model. Finally, using that trained network to classify new sea ice scenes.

Melt ponds on the surface of melting Arctic sea ice are of particular interest as they are sensitive and valuable indicators and are proxy to the processes in the Arctic climate system. Manual analysis of this remote sensing data is extremely difficult and time-consuming due to the complex shapes and unpredictable boundaries of the melt ponds, and that leads to the necessity for automatizing the processes. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient automatic method for melt pond region segmentation and boundary extraction from high-resolution aerial photographs. The proposed algorithm is based on a swin transformer U-Net in which we introduce novel cross-channel attention mechanisms into the decoder design. The framework operates with optical data and allows for classifying imagery into four classes, i.e., sea ice/snow, open water, melt pond, and submerged ice. We use aerial photographs collected during the Healy–Oden Trans Arctic Expedition over Arctic sea ice in the summer season of 2005 as test data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for precise automatic extraction of melt pond geometry, and it can also be extended for other optical data sources that involve melt ponds.

Previous efforts have focused on using reanalysis albedo data, but their uncertainties remain unknown. In this letter, we evaluated four popularly used reanalysis surface albedo products, namely, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the Japanese 55-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55), over the Arctic Ocean using satellite-retrieved product (CLARA-SAL) from 1982 to 2009. Owing to the flawed parameterization scheme or problematic model inputs, reanalysis products are unable to capture both the interannual variation and long-term reduction of surface albedo in the Arctic. This results in a large bias in the decline of shortwave radiative forcing at both surface (from -11.74 to -38.25 W m-2) and top of atmosphere (from -5.35 to -20.19 W m-2). The most significant underestimation occurred in the melt season and after sea-ice melting acceleration started since 1996, in the central Arctic Basin north of 80° N, which is likely due to the failure in simulating the influence of thinning ice and decreasing snow depth. The JRA-55 albedo product outperformed the other three products, which is likely due to the employment of observed sea-ice concentration on the parameterization scheme. On the other hand, the other three reanalysis products, namely, ERA-Interim, MERRA, and CFSR, are unable to effectively track the interannual variation of surface albedo and significantly underestimate (from -0.016 to -0.021 relative to -0.048, by one-third to half) the decreasing surface albedo.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2515159","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2013AA121201); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395314","Arctic region;evaluation and assessment;reanalysis product;satellite application;sea ice;surface albedo;Arctic region;evaluation and assessment;reanalysis product;satellite application;sea ice;surface albedo","Sea surface;Arctic;Satellites;Sea ice;Ocean temperature;Meteorology;Atmospheric modeling","albedo;oceanographic regions;sea ice;underwater optics","four reanalysis surface albedo data set;Arctic region;satellite product;climate dynamics;energy budget;European centre-for-medium-range weather forecasts interim reanalysis;MERRA;JRA-55;CLARA-SAL;ERA-Interim;satellite-retrieved product;CFSR;interannual variation;AD 1982 to 2009;shortwave radiative forcing;sea-ice melting acceleration;parameterization scheme;sea-ice concentration;interannual surface albedo variation","","6","","28","IEEE","29 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This processing extends the area over which a precise sea level can be computed. In the frame of the European Space Agency Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (http://cci.esa.int), we have first developed a new surface identification method combining two complementary solutions, one using a multiple-criteria approach (in particular the backscattering coefficient and the peakiness coefficient of the waveforms) and one based on a supervised neural network approach. Then, a new physical model has been developed (modified from the Brown model to include anisotropy in the scattering from calm protected water surfaces) and has been implemented in a maximum likelihood estimation retracker. This allows us to process both sea-ice lead waveforms (characterized by their peaky shapes) and ocean waveforms (more diffuse returns), guaranteeing, by construction, continuity between open ocean and ice-covered regions. This new processing has been used to produce maps of Arctic sea level anomaly from 18-Hz ENVIronment SATellite/RA-2 data.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2813061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328007","Arctic Ocean;oceans sea level;radar remote sensing;satellite altimetry;sea ice","Arctic;Sea surface;Sea ice;Sea level;Surface waves;Climate change","maximum likelihood estimation;neural nets;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level","ENVISAT altimetry processor;sea level continuity;open ocean;Arctic regions;current conventional altimetry products;sea-ice leads;Arctic Ocean;water levels;European Space Agency Sea Level Climate Change Initiative;surface identification method;multiple-criteria approach;peakiness coefficient;supervised neural network approach;calm protected water surfaces;sea-ice lead waveforms;ice-covered regions;Arctic sea level;backscattering coefficient;Environment Satellite-RA-2 data;maximum likelihood estimation retracker;Brown model","","24","","58","OAPA","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the light of the constrained energy minimization scheme, this article provides a generalized complex-valued constrained energy minimization (GCVCEM) scheme for the Arctic sea ice extraction with strong robustness and accessible implementation. Given the fact that the image extraction process is easily disturbed by noise in real-life application scenarios, a modified Newton integration (MNI) neural algorithm with the noise-tolerance ability and high extraction accuracy is proposed to aid the GCVCEM scheme. Its key idea is to add an error integration feedback term on the basis of the Newton–Raphson iterative (NRI) algorithm to resist noise perturbation on the solution process of the GCVCEM scheme for high-precision and robust extraction of the Arctic sea ice. Besides, the corresponding convergence analyses and robustness proofs on the proposed MNI neural algorithm are furnished. To evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed MNI neural algorithm, multiple comparative experiments with different sea ice observation images and different noise workspaces are performed. Both the visualized and quantitative experimental results substantiate the superiorities of the proposed MNI neural algorithm aided the GCVCEM scheme for the Arctic sea ice extraction.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3130647","Key Projects of the Guangdong Education Department(grant numbers:2019KZDXM019); Chinese Academy of Sciences “Light of West China” Program; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing, China(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyj-zdxmX0028); Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhanjiang)(grant numbers:ZJW-2019-08); High-Level Marine Discipline Team Project of Guangdong Ocean University(grant numbers:00202600-2009); First Class Discipline Construction Platform Project in 2019 of Guangdong Ocean University(grant numbers:231419026); Guangdong Graduate Academic Forum Project(grant numbers:230420003); Postgraduate Education Innovation Project of Guangdong Ocean University(grant numbers:202159); Guangdong Graduate Education Innovation Project, Graduate Academic Forum(grant numbers:2020XSLT27); Key Laboratory of Digital Signal and Image Processing of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019GDDSIPL-01); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011847); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627079","Arctic sea ice extraction;generalized complex-valued constrained energy minimization (GCVCEM) scheme;modified Newton integration (MNI) neural algorithm;noise-tolerance ability","Sea ice;Arctic;Minimization;Data mining;Remote sensing;Scattering;Robustness","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","multisource remote-sensing images;generalized complex-valued constrained energy minimization scheme;image extraction process;modified Newton integration neural algorithm;GCVCEM scheme;MNI neural algorithm;sea ice observation images;Arctic sea ice extraction techniques;Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm","","1","","43","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Highly-saline snow covers with fluctuating snow geophysical and thermodynamic properties cause these backscatter fluctuations, with contributions from surface and volume scattering from different snow layers and interfaces. C-band exhibited drastic variations in backscatter, especially for the 14cm snow cover, when compared to Ku- and X-band.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are useful tools for studying the water vapor variations over the entire Arctic. In this paper, we discuss precipitable water vapor (PWV) variations from the AIRS and MODIS Level-3 data products in response to Arctic sea ice change during December 2002–November 2016. The results indicate that both AIRS- and MODIS-derived PWV measurements tend to be underestimated, and this underestimation is generally greater for the latter than the former over both land and ocean. Additionally, both the AIRS and MODIS retrievals suggest that the atmospheres are drier in the solid sea ice pack and, to a lesser extent, in the marginal ice zone, than in the open ocean in each season. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between the PWV and sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies are generally observed in all seasons under different ice conditions except in the open ocean, where variations in the PWV may be attributed to the poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes. The Arctic PWV and SIC variation patterns are also dominated by the atmospheric and ice conditions in the solid sea ice pack, respectively. The monthly mean PWV and SIC time series analysis further reveals that the Arctic PWV variations tend to be affected by a delayed effect of approximately 1.2–1.3 months from SIC changes from a climatological perspective.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2913149","Global Change Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB953900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41506211,41606208); State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics(grant numbers:QNHX1909); Open Fund of the Key Laboratory for Polar Science, Polar Research Institute of China, MNR(grant numbers:KP201701); Shanghai Ocean University; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development(grant numbers:2018HY-XKQ03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714041","Arctic water vapor;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);sea ice concentration (SIC)","Arctic;Oceans;Sea measurements;MODIS;Sea ice;Atmospheric measurements;Silicon carbide;Climate change","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric optics;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;climatology;moisture;oceanographic regions;remote sensing;sea ice;time series","AIRS;Arctic sea ice change;December 2002-November 2016;climate change;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;entire Arctic;precipitable water vapor variations;MODIS Level-3 data products;MODIS-derived PWV measurements;MODIS retrievals;solid sea ice pack;marginal ice zone;open ocean;sea ice concentration anomalies;different ice conditions;SIC variation patterns;atmospheric ice conditions;Arctic PWV variations;SIC changes;time 1.2 month to 1.3 month","","7","","49","IEEE","14 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By taking advantage of our recent development on Sentinel-1 image noise correction, we suggest a fully automated SAR image-based sea ice classification scheme which can provide a potential near-real time services of sea ice charting. The denoised images are processed into texture features and a machine learning-based classifier is trained by feeding digitized ice charts. The use of ice chart rather than manually classified reference image makes enable an automated training which minimizes the effects from biased human decision. The resulting classifier was tested over the Fram Strait area for an extensive dataset of Sentinel-1 constellation acquired from October 2017 to May 2018.

Large differences were also observed in the Pauli phase angle and the dominant-scattering-type Touzi phase angle between burned and adjacent unburned areas.

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, compact polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-l satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact polarimteric acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification in operational environment. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure.

This urgency becomes indeed crucial when targeting transfer learning in remote sensing, as understanding the actual relationship between diverse sensors is fundamental to accurately characterize the considered scenes. In this work, we derive a reliability metric by means of an information theory-based approach.

Passive microwave data is an important data source for continuous observations of polar sea ice, thanks to its working ability in all-sky conditions and its wide coverage. However, it is difficult to achieve high-resolution monitoring of polar sea ice using passive microwave data due to its coarse resolution. In order to solve this problem, super resolution (SR) reconstruction technique is adopted in this paper to improve the spatial resolution of passive microwave images.

However, the instability of the image motion velocity poses a huge challenge to the observation task since the direction of the earth's rotation velocity keeps changing in the polar regions. The edge blur of polar image by the camera with the WFV is usually ignored. Therefore, a specific theoretical model that the camera images over the polar region is supposed to describe the instability distinctly. Mathematical expressions of the image motion velocity field are obtained with a novel method of velocity projection and coordinate transformation. The quantitative analysis of simulation reveals that the increasing anisotropy of the instantaneous image motion velocity field gets most significant near the poles. The value of modulation transfer function at the edge of the field of view decreased by 0.33%, which results in a discrepancy of sharpness in an image. The model is capable of explaining the edge blur, of the image from BNU-1, which provides a theoretical basis for the image motion compensation strategy of cameras with the WFV.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3066626","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62005275); Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2016YFB0501202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380890","Arctic and Antarctic;edge blur;image motion;optical remote sensing;velocity field model;wide field of view (WFV)","Cameras;Imaging;Remote sensing;Earth;Optical sensors;Optical imaging;Satellites","cameras;geophysical image processing;image resolution;image restoration;image sensors;motion compensation;remote sensing;transfer functions","Antarctic;Arctic;modulation transfer function;instantaneous image motion velocity field anisotropy;image motion compensation strategy;sharpness discrepancy;simulation quantitative analysis;coordinate transformation;mathematical expressions;image motion velocity instability;wide field of view;image motion;velocity projection method;camera images;specific theoretical model;polar image;edge blur;polar region;earth;observation task;polar environment;WFV;remote sensing camera","","3","","30","CCBYNCND","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a large discrepancy in current SOC estimates in Arctic tundra, where sparse measurements are unable to capture SOC complexity over the vast tundra region. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are sensitive to surface vegetation, roughness, and moisture conditions, and may provide useful information on surface SOC properties. Here, we investigated the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data for regional SOC mapping in the Arctic tundra through principal component analysis (PCA). Multiple in situ SOC datasets in the Alaska North Slope were assembled to generate a consistent surface (0–10 cm) SOC and bulk density dataset (n = 97). The radar VV backscatter shows a strong correlation with surface SOC, but the correlation varies greatly with surface snow, moisture, and freeze/thaw conditions. However, the first principal component (PC1) of radar backscatter time series from different years shows spatial consistency representing dominant and persistent surface backscatter behavior. The PC1 also shows a strong linear correlation with surface SOC concentration (R = 0.65, p<0.01), and an exponential relationship with bulk density (R = −0.65, p<0.01). The resulting predicted SOC maps show much lower soil bulk density and higher SOC concentration in the southern shrub tundra area than in the northern coastal region, consistent with in situ data. Our analysis shows that it is possible to separate the effects of different factors on the radar backscatter response using PCA and multitemporal SAR data, which may lead to more effective satellite-based methods for Arctic SOC mapping.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3236117","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0603100); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China; NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment(grant numbers:80NSSC19M0114); NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship(grant numbers:80NSSC18K1410); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015585","Arctic tundra;principal component analysis (PCA);radar backscatter;soil organic carbon (SOC)","Soil;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic;Backscatter;Land surface;Soil measurements;Radar","backscatter;freezing;ice;moisture;principal component analysis;remote sensing by radar;snow;soil;synthetic aperture radar;time series;vegetation","Arctic permafrost thaw;Arctic SOC mapping;Arctic tundra;lower soil bulk density;moisture conditions;multiplein situSOC datasets;multitemporal SAR data;multitemporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data;persistent surface backscatter behavior;principal component analysis;radar backscatter response;radar backscatter time series;radar VV backscatter;regional SOC mapping;SOC complexity;SOC maps;southern shrub tundra area;surface organic soil properties;surface snow;surface SOC concentration;surface SOC properties;surface soil organic carbon content;synthetic aperture radar data;tundra region","","","","55","CCBY","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making them detectable by comparing digital elevation models over time. Fort his study we used digital elevation models derived from bistatic single-pass radar observation from the TanDEM-X satellite pair over the time span from 2011 to 2017.

We aim at improving the monitoring capacity by integrating in situ Chl-a observations and optical remote sensing to locally train machine learning (ML) models. For this purpose, in situ measurements of Chl-a ranging from 0.014-10.81 mg/m3, collected for the years 2016-2018, were used to train and validate models. To accurately estimate Chl-a, we propose to use additional information on pigment content within the productive column by matching the depth-integrated Chl-a concentrations with the satellite data. Using the optical images captured by the multispectral imager instrument on Sentinel-2 and the in situ measurements, a new spatial window-based match-up dataset creation method is proposed to increase the number of match-ups and hence improve the training of the ML models. The match-ups are then filtered to eliminate erroneous samples based on the spectral distribution of the remotely sensed reflectance. In addition, we design and implement a neural network model dubbed as the ocean color net (OCN), that has performed better than existing ML-based techniques, including the Gaussian process Regression (GPR), regionally tuned empirical techniques, including the ocean color (OC3) algorithm and the spectral band ratios, as well as the globally trained Case-2 regional/coast colour (C2RCC) processing chain model C2RCC-networks.

Measuring Arctic SWE through traditional ground-based techniques is challenging due to the vast size and remote nature of the region. Remote sensing applications offer new perspectives towards SWE accumulation estimates across the Arctic. The cloud profiling radar (CPR) instrument installed on the NASA CloudSat satellite observes snapshots of falling snow in clouds and has been effectively used in previous work for estimating monthly surface SWE accumulation across high latitude regions. By comparing consecutive month-pair estimates of accumulated SWE from CloudS at $(\overline{SWE}_{C})$ with the positive difference in SWE on ground over the same period in gridded SWE products $(\Delta SWE_{B})$, we gain new insights into areas and locations of statistically inconsistent accumulation estimates. Applying this technique to the Blended-4 gridded SWE product from 60° to 82° N allows us to generate a quality flag which automatically highlights areas of inconsistent accumulation. This technique has flagged 4885 outliers over 107 month-pairs spanning 2007–2015 across the Northern Hemisphere when applied to the Blended-4 dataset. CPR snowfall data acts as an independent observational constraint for accumulated SWE in a region which is both difficult and expensive to traditionally observe. This comparison process can be used to further enhance the accuracy and robustness of future gridded SWE products across high latitude regions.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554930","Canadian Space Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554930","CloudSat;SWE;Arctic;remote sensing","Satellites;Uncertainty;Snow;Spaceborne radar;Size measurement;Robustness;Spatiotemporal phenomena","clouds;floods;geophysics computing;hydrological techniques;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;snow;water;water resources","traditional ground-based techniques;Arctic SWE;liquid water;water resource management practices;cold region flooding;energy budget;global water;critical contributor;Arctic snow;cloudsat-cpr snowfall estimates;gridded snow water equivalent products;future gridded SWE products;CPR snowfall data;Blended-4 gridded SWE product;statistically inconsistent accumulation estimates;consecutive month-pair estimates;high latitude regions;monthly surface SWE accumulation;falling snow;NASA CloudSat satellite;cloud profiling radar instrument;remote sensing applications;remote nature","","","","11","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the algorithms that combine both observations to identify partial concentrations of ice types (including MYI) is the Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE). However, cycles of warm-cold air temperature trigger wet-dry cycles of the snow cover on MYI surface. Under wet snow conditions, anomalous brightness temperature and backscatter, similar to those of first-year ice (FYI), are observed. This leads to misidentification of MYI as being FYI, hence decreasing the estimated MYI concentration suddenly. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a correction scheme to restore the MYI concentration under this condition. The correction is based on air temperature records. It utilizes the fact that the warm spell in autumn lasts for a short period of time (a few days). The correction is applied to MYI concentration retrievals from ECICE using an input of combined QuikSCAT and AMSR-E data, acquired over the Arctic region in a series of autumn seasons from 2003 to 2008. The correction works well by replacing anomalous MYI concentrations with interpolated ones. For September of the six years, it introduces over 0.1×106 km2 MYI area, except for 2005. Due to the regional effect of warm air spells, the correction could be important in the operational applications where ice concentrations are crucial on small scale and mesoscale.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2503884","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360933","Arctic sea ice;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE);ice concentration;microwave remote sensing;multiyear ice (MYI);surface air temperature;Arctic sea ice;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE);ice concentration;microwave remote sensing;multiyear ice (MYI);surface air temperature","Ocean temperature;Arctic;Microwave radiometry;Sea surface;Sea ice;Meteorology","atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;ice;snow","AMSR-E data;QuikSCAT data;Arctic region;autumn seasons;AD 2003 to 2008;warm air spell regional effect;concentration retrievals;reanalysis air temperature records;multiyear ice misidentification;first-year ice;anomalous brightness temperature;wet snow conditions;MYI surface;snow cover;wet-dry cycles;warm-cold air temperature cycles;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor;ice type partial concentrations;passive remote sensing observation;active microwave remote sensing observation;multiyear ice characteristics;multiyear ice concentration estimates","","22","","52","IEEE","18 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Radiosonde (RS) observations are one of the reliable tools to study Arctic inversions. However, they provide limited information on the spatial distribution of temperature inversions. The radio occultation (RO) technique can provide accurate, all-weather, high vertical resolution atmospheric parameter profiles over both land and ocean. In this paper, the RO technique is investigated to estimate the inversions, and their uncertainties are assessed via comparing with the RS inversions. Results show that the inversions (base, depth, and strength) from RS and RO observations are lower, deeper, and stronger in winter than in autumn, spring, and summer. Moreover, comparisons of spatiotemporally synchronized RO and RS inversions (i.e., Scheme I) during 2007–2013 reveal that the former are higher, deeper, and weaker than the latter. Further comparisons of RS and  $5 {^{\circ }} \times 5 {^{\circ }}$  gridded RO inversions (i.e., Scheme II) show smaller overall standard deviations than Scheme I, indicating that the gridded RO observations can better describe the large-scale spatial structure of temperature inversions. Furthermore, corrections of the observed remarkable systematic differences between RO and RS inversions in both the schemes are also made. The results show that the RO inversions can be well calibrated, and that greater improvements in RO inversions calibration are achieved in Scheme II than in Scheme I. Therefore, the RO technique could be a potential tool to study the Arctic low-level temperature inversions as well as improve our understanding of Arctic climate change.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2633461","Global Change Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB953900); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0501503); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41506211,41276197,41606208,11403083); Shanghai Oriental Scholar Program(grant numbers:2012-58); Shanghai Sailing Program(grant numbers:14YF1410200); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:14YZ118); international Global Navigation Satellite System Monitoring and Assessment Service project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797203","Arctic temperature inversion;radio occultation (RO);radiosonde (RS)","Arctic;Temperature measurement;Ocean temperature;Atmospheric measurements;Temperature distribution;Meteorology;Climate change","atmospheric temperature;climatology;land surface temperature;oceanographic regions;radiosondes;remote sensing","uncertainties assessment;Arctic low level temperature inversion characteristics;radio occultation observations;radiosonde observations;high vertical resolution atmospheric parameter profiles;RO inversions;RS inversions;AD 2007 to 2013;Arctic climate change","","5","","36","IEEE","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Operation IceBridge (OIB) was launched in 2009 to bridge the gap in polar observations between the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 missions. OIB flew more than 1000 aircraft surveys, providing annual mapping of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets in the Antarctic and Arctic. This study utilizes altimetry data and synchronized optical images from OIB to derive Arctic sea ice freeboard estimates for the period from 2009 to 2019. Lead detection is important in determining sea ice freeboard. We developed an improved approach by combining optical images, OIB laser pulse apparent reflectivity, and L1B elevation profiles to detect leads. We then determined the local sea surface height (SSH) with a lowest elevation method from the L1B elevation profile of leads. Thus, sea ice freeboard was calculated by the difference between L2 relative elevation and corresponding local SSH. We derived the estimates of the Arctic sea ice freeboard from 2009 to 2019. Spatial and temporal variations of the freeboard were analyzed based on the estimates. The Arctic annual average sea ice freeboard showed a decreasing trend from OIB observations. However, an obvious increase in multiyear ice freeboard was observed in 2014. We validated our freeboard estimates with OIB freeboard product from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and coincident ICESat-2 freeboard. The comparison shows that our freeboard estimates generally compare well with the ICESat-2 freeboard, and our method is more sensitive to thin ice.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3185230","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0603104); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41730102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803246","Arctic;freeboard;Operation IceBridge (OIB);sea ice;sea surface height (SSH)","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea surface;Altimetry;Sea measurements;Lead;Satellites","height measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","multiyear ice freeboard;OIB freeboard product;Ice Data Center;coincident ICESat-2 freeboard;operation IceBridge;Land Elevation Satellite;ICESat-2 missions;ice sheets;Arctic sea ice freeboard estimates;OIB laser pulse apparent reflectivity;L1B elevation profile;local sea surface height;lowest elevation method;L2 relative elevation;Arctic annual average sea ice freeboard;OIB observations","","","","25","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR.

Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice–water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence. The sea ice-related loss function is designed to provide more detailed sea ice information of the network to improve super-resolution performance and further benefit finer Arctic SIC results. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDRnet significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art MISR methods and can generate super-resolved SIC products with finer texture features and much sharper sea ice edges.

We find that increases in PWV and total CF generally coincide with the Arctic sea ice decline in each season, and both PWV and total CF anomalies are typically correlated with SIC anomalies in all seasons except for the PWV anomalies in summer. In addition, during all seasons except summer, the low CF generally exhibits closer connection than the middle and high CFs with the trend in total CF and sea ice, and the correlation of SIC with total CF anomalies is governed by that with low CF anomalies. The sensitivities of SIC to changes in PWV and total CF are typically negative, and they are generally consistent with each other in each season.

The algorithm, denoted as AMSR2 thin ice detection algorithm—version 2 (ATIDA2), is targeted for the Arctic Ocean. The detection of thin ice with a maximum thickness of 20 cm is based on the classification of the 36-GHz polarization ratio ( $PR36$ ) and H-polarization 89–36-GHz gradient ratio ( $GR8936H$ ) signatures with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and thick ice restoration with  $GR3610H$ . The thick ice restoration removes erroneous thin ice detections due to thin and thick ice  $PR36$  and  $GR8936H$  signature mixing. ATIDA2 is applied only when sea ice concentration (SIC) is ≥70% and the air temperature is ≤−5 °C to decrease misclassification of thick ice as thin ice. For the AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data, an atmospheric correction is applied following an EUMETSAT OSI SAF correction scheme in SIC retrieval algorithms. ATIDA2 is applied to L1R swath datasets, and then, the results are combined to a daily thin ice chart. ATIDA2 was developed and validated using MODIS ice thickness charts over the Barents and Kara Seas. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice in the daily chart is 8.7%, and 37.0% for vice versa. The comparison of the ATIDA2 chart and the SMOS ice thickness chart over the Arctic showed rough correspondence in the thin versus thick ice classification. The ATIDA2 chart is targeted to be used together with SAR imagery for various sea ice classifications.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3142966","European Union (EU), Finland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden, through the Kolarctic Cross Border Collaboration Project “Ice Operations”(grant numbers:KO2100 ICEOP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9681066","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Ice;Sea ice;Arctic;Silicon carbide;Production;Oceans;Microwave radiometry","oceanographic regions;radiometry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","AMSR2 radiometer data;ice detection algorithm-version;polarization ratio;ice restoration;ice PR36;sea ice concentration;AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data;MODIS ice thickness charts;ATIDA2 chart;SMOS ice thickness chart;sea ice classifications;thick ice classification;Arctic winter conditions;Arctic Ocean;temperature 5.0 degC;size 20.0 cm;frequency 36.0 GHz to 89.0 GHz","","1","","69","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The MTVZA-GYa data covered the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The method to retrieve the soil moisture and temperature was based on solving an inverse problem by minimizing the norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the brightness temperature. The calculation of the brightness temperature was performed using a semi-empirical model of radio-thermal emission the parameters of which have been pre-calibrated at the test sites in the area of Norilsk and Khatanga, as well as using a soil dielectric model with high in organic matter. The dielectric model was especially designed based on laboratory measurements of the complex permittivity of the organic-rich soil samples, which were collected at the test site near Norilsk city. As a result, the values of the root-mean-square error between the retrieved and measured soil temperatures and soil moisture were not exceed 6.5o 0.06cm3/cm3, respectively for both test sites.

The inclusion of cyclical terms is crucial if the DMRT is used to model both the active and passive contributions with the same model parameters. This is a necessity when setting out on a joint active/passive retrieval. Previously, the DMRT model has been applied to active and passive separately, and in each case with a separate set of model parameters. The traditional DMRT theory only includes the ladder terms of the Feynman diagrams. The cyclical terms are important in multiple volume scattering and volume-surface interactions. This leads to backscattering enhancement which represents itself as a narrow peak centered at backward direction. This effect is of less significance in passive remote sensing since emissivity is relating to the angular integral of bistatic scattering coefficients. The inclusion of cyclical terms in first-order radiative transfer (RT) accounts for the enhancement of the double bounce contribution and makes the results the same as that of distorted Born approximation in volume-surface interactions. In this paper, we develop the methodology of cyclical corrections within the framework of DMRT beyond first order to all orders of multiple scattering. The active DMRT equation is solved using a numerical iterative approach followed by cyclical corrections. Both quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA)-Mie theory with sticky spheres and bicontinuous media scattering model are used to illustrate the results. The cyclical correlation introduces around 1 dB increase in backscatter with a moderate snowpack optical thickness of ${\sim}\text{0.2}$. The bicontinuous/DMRT model is next applied to compare with data acquired in the Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx) campaign in the snow season of 2010-2011. The model results are validated against coincidental active and passive measurements using the same set of physical parameters of snow in all frequency and polarization channels. Results show good agreement in multiple active and passive channels.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2469290","Remote Sensing Theory Program of NASA(grant numbers:NNX11AK41G); NASA Instrument Incubator Program; European Space Agency(grant numbers:22671/09/NL/JA/ef); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7270987","Active and passive remote sensing;backscattering enhancement;bicontinuous medium;cyclical correction;dense medium radiative transfer (DMRT);distorted Born approximation;iterative approach;multiple scattering;Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx);quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA);terrestrial snow;Active and passive remote sensing;backscattering enhancement;bicontinuous medium;cyclical correction;dense medium radiative transfer (DMRT);distorted Born approximation;iterative approach;multiple scattering;Nordic Snow Radar Experiment (NoSREx);quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA);terrestrial snow","Scattering;Backscatter;Snow;Mathematical model;Iterative methods;Remote sensing;Microwave radiometry","iterative methods;radiative transfer;remote sensing;snow","snow active microwave remote sensing modeling;snow passive microwave remote sensing modeling;dense media radiative transfer;DMRT theory;multiple scattering enhancement;backscattering enhancement;Feynman diagram;multiple volume scattering;volume-surface interaction;bistatic scattering coefficient;first-order radiative transfer;Born approximation;active DMRT equation;numerical iterative approach;cyclical correction;quasicrystalline approximation;QCA-Mie theory;snowpack optical thickness;Nordic snow radar experiment;NoSREx campaign;AD 2010 to 2011","","48","","31","IEEE","17 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Effects of inundation, snow cover, and soil FT state on observed GNSS-R signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are analyzed for horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations. A simple classification approach is suggested to detect the inundated, frozen, or thawed soil state. A simple forward reflectivity model is formulated to evaluate the influence of snow cover, overlying frozen, or thawed soil, on the reflected GNSS signals. Reflectivity time series are simulated in H- and V-polarizations using in situ observations of the Arctic wetland site. The simulations are used to verify the tower-based observations, which show a significant impact of wet snow on reflectivity during melting conditions in spring. The observed SNR is strongly correlated with the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient. Generally, soil states detected by GNSS-R are in high agreement with ground truth soil states, especially for inundated and frozen soils. Wet snow conditions, however, complicate the correct timing estimation of soil thawing by inducing reflectivities of a similar order as thawing soil. It is recommended that GNSS-R land application models and retrieval algorithms consider snow cover effects to reduce false classification, especially in FT detection. Overall, the outcome of this study is relevant to the upcoming ESA HydroGNSS mission.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3129604","European Space Agency (ESA) Scout Mission(grant numbers:ESA CN: 4000129140/19/NL/CT); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:325397); Spanish(grant numbers:RTI2018-099008-B-C22/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622271","Arctic;freeze/thaw (FT);global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R);inundation;snow;wetland","Soil;Snow;Wetlands;Global navigation satellite system;Reflectivity;Floods;Poles and towers","freezing;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;melting;reflectometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;satellite navigation;snow;soil;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","inundated soils;frozen soils;wet snow conditions;soil thawing;thawing soil;GNSS-R land application models;snow cover effects;FT detection;Arctic wetland dynamics;tower-based GNSS reflectometry observations;tower-based global navigation satellite system reflectometry experiment;Arctic wetland environment;wetland inundation;soil FT state;observed GNSS-R signal-to-noise ratios;simple classification approach;inundated soil state;frozen, soil state;thawed soil state;simple forward reflectivity model;reflected GNSS signals;reflectivity time series;Arctic wetland site;tower-based observations;observed SNR;ground truth soil states","","1","","50","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the season length for shore-fast ice decreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more susceptible to erosion from storm waves. Such coastal erosion is a concern since a large proportion of the population centers and infrastructure in the Arctic are located near the coasts. Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need models capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects of coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses Gaussian process (GP) models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort Sea near Drew Point, AK, USA. GP regression is a data-driven modeling methodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse environments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use annual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from existing data sets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines from satellite imagery. We combine our calibrated models with future climate models to generate a range of plausible future erosion scenarios. Our results show that the GP methodology substantially improves yearly predictions compared to linear and nonlinear least squares methods and is capable of generating detailed forecasts suitable for the use by decision makers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2865429","University of Alaska Anchorage; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454820","Arctic;coastal erosion;Gaussian process (GP)","Sea measurements;Arctic;Predictive models;Data models;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Forecasting","atmospheric temperature;climatology;erosion;Gaussian processes;land use;ocean waves;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;soil;storms","Gaussian process regression;Arctic coastal erosion forecasting;Arctic coastal morphology;climatological changes;season length;shore-fast ice decreases;temperatures warm permafrost soils;storm waves;population centers;decision makers;scenario-based predictions;Gaussian process models;GP regression;data-sparse environments;remote Arctic coastlines;annual coastline positions;near-shore summer temperature averages;data sets;calibrated models;future climate models;plausible future erosion scenarios;GP methodology;infrastructure;land use;Beaufort Sea;Drew Point;USA;Alaska;data-driven modeling methodology;satellite imagery;nonlinear least square method","","8","","36","IEEE","5 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the influences of reflectance anisotropy and melt ponds were not well considered in previous studies. To improve the estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency, we developed a method for estimating the surface albedo of Arctic sea ice using an ensemble back-propagation neural network (EBPNN) model. A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo dataset of snow, white ice, and melt ponds was constructed using the asymptotic analytical radiative transfer (AART) model, and the nonlinear relationships between the surface reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface albedo were established using the EBPNN model (prediction correlation coefficient  $(R)= 0.996$  and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.023). Our results are consistent with the in situ measurements and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product ( $R= 0.916$ , RMSE = 0.085, and bias = 0.001), in which the reflectance anisotropy of the snow/ice and the influence of melt ponds were fully considered, and the calculation efficiency was significantly improved by using the EBPNN model. The results of this study provide new insights for estimating the Arctic sea ice albedo from satellite observations, and the proposed EBPNN method can be used to generate a long-term Arctic sea ice albedo dataset with superior estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3202046","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFA0714102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971287,41601349); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9868074","Albedo;Arctic;artificial neural network;melt ponds;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);sea ice","Sea ice;Sea surface;Arctic;Sea measurements;Reflectivity;MODIS;Land surface","albedo;mean square error methods;neural nets;radiative transfer;reflectivity;remote sensing;sea ice;snow","EBPNN model;long-term Arctic sea ice;surface albedo;ensemble back-propagation neural network;reflectance anisotropy;melt ponds;surface reflectance","","1","","85","IEEE","26 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To overcome such a limitation, a method of retrieving Arctic basin-scale ice thickness is developed. The physical background of this method is that the scattering optical thickness at microwave frequencies within the freeboard layer is linearly proportional to the physical thickness of the ice freeboard. In this study, we relate the optical thickness estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with ice freeboard estimated from the CryoSat-2 (CS2) by employing a piecewise linear fit. The results show a strong linear relationship between the AMSR2-estimated and CS2-measured ice freeboards with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and bias and RMSE of 0.0001 and 0.04 m, respectively; this evidence suggests that the method can provide Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard with a comparable accuracy level of CS2. The method is also applied to estimate ice freeboard for the periods of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) (1978-1987) and AMSR-E (2002-2011). It is shown that the area-averaged ice freeboard has decreased significantly with the linear trends of 1.5 cm/decade. In addition, there seems to be a change of ice freeboard distributions over the Arctic. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the ice thickness retrieval by using the hydrostatic balance equation, showing that operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval will be possible from satellite passive microwave measurements if a realistic snow depth on sea ice is employed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3026949","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean government (MSIP)(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A6A3A03032352); NASA Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)(grant numbers:NASA 80GSFC18C0102); Space Core Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2018M1A3A3A02065661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223741","Ice freeboard;passive microwave remote sensing;sea ice thickness;sea ice;surface emissivity","Sea ice;Microwave measurement;Snow;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave radiometry","hydrological techniques;ice;microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radiometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Arctic basin-scale sea ice thickness;satellite passive microwave measurements;Arctic basin-scale ice thickness;scattering optical thickness;microwave frequencies;freeboard layer;physical thickness;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2;CryoSat-2;AMSR2-estimated;CS2-measured ice freeboards;Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard;area-averaged ice freeboard;ice freeboard distributions;operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval;size 50.0 cm;size 1.0E-4 m;size 0.04 m","","3","","38","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is based on the soil dielectric measurements carried out in the ranges of gravimetric moisture from 0.01 to 0.43 g/g, dry soil density from 1.25 to 1.83 g/cm3, and temperature from 25 to -30°C (cooling run), in the frequency range 0.05-15 GHz. To fit the results of measurements of the soil complex dielectric constant as a function of soil moisture and wave frequency, the refractive mixing dielectric model in conjunction with the Debye multi-relaxation equations were applied. As a result, the spectroscopic parameters of dielectric relaxations for the bound, transient bound, and unbound soil water components were derived, being further complimented with the thermodynamics parameters to ensure a complete set of parameters of the temperature dependent multi-relaxation spectroscopic dielectric model for moist soils proposed. To calculate complex dielectric constant of soil, the following input variables have to be assigned: 1) density of dry soil, 2) gravimetric moisture, 3) wave frequency, and 4) temperature. The error of the dielectric model was evaluated in terms of RMSE, yielding the values RMSE of 0.53 and 0.43 for the soil dielectric constant and loss factor, respectively. These values appeared to be in the order of the dielectric measurement error itself. The dielectric model suggested can be applied in the active and passive remote sensing techniques in microwave to develop algorithms for retrieving soil moisture and freeze/thaw state of the topsoil in the Arctic regions.","","978-1-4799-7103-9","10.1109/SIBCON.2015.7147146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7147146","dielectric model;temperature dependence;dielectric relaxation;soil;Arctic regions;remote sensing","Soil;Temperature measurement;Soil measurements;Dielectrics;Dielectric measurement;Frequency measurement;Mathematical model","dielectric measurement;minerals;moisture;permittivity;remote sensing;soil","mineral arctic thawed soil;mineral arctic frozen soil;soil dielectric measurement;gravimetric moisture;dry soil density;soil complex dielectric constant;soil moisture function;wave frequency;Debye multirelaxation equation;dielectric relaxation;transient bound soil water component;unbound soil water component;thermodynamics parameter;multirelaxation spectroscopic dielectric model;dielectric model error;soil loss factor;remote sensing technique;Arctic region;frequency 0.05 GHz to 15 GHz","","","","11","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sea ice research also requires suitable equipment for fine-scale, visualized long-term tracking observations of target sea ice regions. This article investigates the feasibility of measuring interannual variability in sea ice morphology in the Arctic sea ice environment using a low-power gimbal camera automated by satellite communications. Year-round observational data from the arctic field were used. The sea ice images were defogged and edge-enhanced by a newly developed algorithm with the help of human visual enhancement principles. During the 11th Chinese National Arctic Science Expedition, the system was placed on perennial ice in the northern Beaufort Basin to monitor sea ice appearance changes and the external state of the ice mass balance buoy. The system fuses visually enhanced sea ice images with ice balance buoy data from the same ice floe in a multi-scale environmental sequence to obtain sea ice observations with image sequences. The data complement the need for long-duration, fixed-ice, and short-visual-range observations in sea-ice studies.

In this context, satellite-derived soil moisture data are valuable for modeling purposes. Assessing the applicability of such data at high latitudes is essential but has, until recently, been given little attention. Recent studies have pointed out that seasonal land cover variations and the presence of small water bodies, which are typical in the Arctic, can cause complications for soil moisture retrieval. Here, it is hypothesized that a bias related to water fraction is caused by variations in the water surface roughness. The impact is quantified for the Metop Advanced Scatterometer by investigations of the higher spatial resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by ENVISAT Advanced SAR over 11 sites across the Siberian Arctic. The bias calculated as an average over time can be explained by the lake fraction: a water fraction higher than 20% causes a bias of more than 10% relative surface soil moisture. This can, to a great extent, be attributed to wind, based on which a bias correction was developed. The correction was applied and evaluated with in situ soil moisture data, which were available from one of the sites: the Lena Delta. Weak results are obtained because water surfaces correspond mainly to rivers at this site. Variations in discharge, water height, and streams may therefore also affect the water surface roughness.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2530845","European Commission(grant numbers:FP7-ENV-2011); Changing Permafrost in the Arctic and its Global Effects in the 21st Century(grant numbers:282700); INTERACT; European Community's Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:262693); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577824","Arctic;C-band;lakes;microwave measurement;moisture;radar remote sensing;scatterometer;surface waves;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Soil moisture;Arctic;Rivers;Lakes;Satellites;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","backscatter;hydrological techniques;lakes;land cover;meteorology;moisture;oceanographic regions;remote sensing by radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar","Lena Delta;lake fraction;Siberian Arctic;ENVISAT Advanced SAR;SAR data;synthetic aperture radar;Metop Advanced Scatterometer;water surface roughness;water fraction;soil moisture retrieval;small water bodies;seasonal land cover variations;satellite-derived soil moisture data;Arctic Ocean;rapid warming;thawing;permafrost;Northern Hemisphere;meteorological data;coarse-scale radar retrieved soil moisture;backscatter variations impact","","12","","59","OAPA","27 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire on the Alaska North Slope was used as a case study. At ~10-year postfire, we observed a strong increase (>~3–4 dB) in the low-frequency radar backscatter in severely burned areas during the thaw season, in contrast to limited (< ~0.5 dB) C-band backscatter differences (VV and VH) between burned and unburned areas. However, C-band winter backscatter is generally higher (>1 dB) in burned areas than the adjacent unburned areas. Polarimetric decomposition analysis indicated a general trend toward more random surface scattering, and strong increases in double-bounce scattering and volume scattering power at both P- and L-band in the burned areas. The ice-rich yedoma region shows the largest backscatter increases in burned areas and the highest correlation with burn severity and microtopography changes. The above backscatter changes are attributed to increasing surface roughness and microtopography due to ice-wedge degradation and thermokarst development and increasing subsurface scattering due to an overall drier and deeper active layer in burned areas. Among all frequencies, P-band shows consistently larger contrast in backscatter power and phase between burned and unburned areas, which makes it potentially more useful to study fire–permafrost interactions in the Arctic over decadal time scales.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3125715","NASA Terrestrial Ecology Program as part of the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment(grant numbers:NNX15AT74A); Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP)(grant numbers:16-1-01-8); NSF(grant numbers:OIA-1929170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9605582","P-band;permafrost;polarimetric decomposition;tundra fire","Vegetation mapping;Backscatter;Radar;Arctic;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;L-band","backscatter;fires;geomorphology;ice;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;soil;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation;vegetation mapping;wildfires","multifrequency polarimetric SAR data;postfire permafrost changes;Arctic tundra;NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment airborne campaign;Sentinel-1 C-band;dual-polarization data;radar backscatter intensity;subsurface soil processes;Anaktuvuk River fire;low-frequency radar backscatter;C-band winter backscatter;polarimetric decomposition analysis;random surface scattering;double-bounce scattering;volume scattering power;burn severity;microtopography changes;surface roughness;thermokarst development;subsurface scattering;fire-permafrost interactions;AD 2007;full-polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar data;full-polarimetric L-band synthetic aperture radar data","","1","","47","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experiments show the importance of measuring the relevance of the bands at local and global scales and the ability of the method to minimize intercorrelation among selected bands, hence improving the selection of the most informative spectral channels.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553127","Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553127","information theory;hyperspectral images;band selection","Laplace equations;Data analysis;Atmospheric measurements;Clustering methods;Geoscience and remote sensing;Particle measurements;Information retrieval","geophysical image processing;graph theory;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;pattern clustering;remote sensing","unsupervised band selection;hyperspectral datasets;double Graph laplacian diagonalization;spectral information;hyperspectral images;redundant bands;application performance;relevant subset;original set;automatic band selection method;accurate band selection method;Graph Laplacians;band selection methods;similarity measures;global but contemporaneously local particularities;local scales;global scales;selected bands;informative spectral channels","","","","23","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The partially coherent approach of dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) has been extensively applied to study the wave propagation and scattering inside dense media such as terrestrial snow [1-5]. In the DMRT partially coherent approach, the coherent part is obtained by solving Maxwell's equations over several cubic wavelengths of statistically homogeneous snow volume to compute the phase matrix, the extinction coefficient, the effective propagation constants and the effective permittivity. Solving Maxwell's equations accounts for the coherent near field and intermediate field interactions within several cubic wavelengths. The phase matrix is then substituted into the radiative transfer equation which constitutes the incoherent part of DMRT. The DMRT equation is then solved to include incoherent interactions and volume/surface interactions. This approach is appropriate when the snow layers are electrically thick such that the coherent far field interaction cancels out over statistical average. This is true for many applications in terrestrial snow remote sensing where the wavelength is 1 ~ 3 cm and the snow depth can be several decimeters to meters. On the other hand, snow on sea ice is typically thin of 10 ~ 20cm with a decreasing trend over the western Arctic [6]. The local wave interaction arising from these thin layers are largely coherent. And in the backscattering direction of the active remote sensing, the coherent wave interaction can extend to far field giving rise to backscattering enhancement phenomena [1]. These short-range and long-range coherent wave effects are not captured by DMRT. In [7], a fully coherent snowpack scattering model is developed by solving the Maxwell's equation directly over the entire domain of snowpack on top of a dielectric half-space. The half-space represents the soil ground under the terrestrial snow or the sea ice below the snow cover across the Arctic Ocean. This is applicable when the sea ice thickness is larger than the penetration depth, depending on the wave frequency of the incidence waves. Effects of the half-space are included in the volume integral equation by the half-space dyadic Green's function. The snow volume is represented by bicontinuous media [8] and discretized into cubes. The method of moments (MoM) is then used to solve the volume integral equation with a pulse basis function and point matching, leading to discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adapted for the kernel of the half-space dyadic Green's function to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication in the iterative linear system solver [9]. For the first time, the scattering matrix of the snowpack is computed using this fully coherent approach of NMM3D, including both magnitude and phase. This allows the modeling of the coherence matrix and speckle statistics. Backscattering enhancement effects are also exhibited, and for a homogeneous snowpack of moderate optical thickness, the overall trend of the bistatic scattering pattern from the fully coherent approach agrees with the results of DMRT. In this paper, the fully coherent approach is improved by implementing the periodic boundary condition. The periodic Green's function in half space is used. The incorporation of the periodic boundary condition removes the edge diffraction artifacts from the finite computational domain and produces more physically plausible results. We also extend the fully coherent approach to compute the brightness temperatures of the snowpack following the reciprocity principle. This approach accounts for an arbitrary temperature profile of the snowpack and includes coherent effects in the thin layer together with fully coherent volume-surface interactions. This new method circumvents the unrealistic isothermal condition incorrectly assumed in the Kirchhoff approximation approach. The brightness temperatures and backscatters from the fully coherent model are compared with the results of DMRT for various snowpack configurations to understand and to determine the applicability regime of DMRT.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7735538","","Snow;Mathematical model;Media;Scattering;Remote sensing;Sea ice;Backscatter","approximation theory;fast Fourier transforms;Green's function methods;iterative methods;Maxwell equations;oceanographic regions;remote sensing;sea ice;snow","numerical simulation;Maxwell equation;active remote sensing;passive remote sensing;dense media radiative transfer;wave propagation;wave scattering;homogeneous snow volume;extinction coefficient;radiative transfer equation;DMRT equation;volume-surface interactions;snow layer;terrestrial snow remote sensing;snow depth;western Arctic Ocean;local wave interaction;coherent wave interaction;short-range coherent wave effect;long-range coherent wave effect;snowpack scattering model;soil ground;snow cover;sea ice thickness;wave frequency;half-space dyadic Green function;volume integral equation;pulse basis function;point matching;discrete dipole approximation;fast Fourier transform;iterative linear system solver;backscattering enhancement effect;periodic Green function;periodic boundary condition;edge diffraction artifact;brightness temperatures;Kirchhoff approximation approach","","","","9","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because the seasonal FT deformation is a direct measure of the active layer soil water content, and the amount of water in the soil limits the type of vegetation that can grow. Furthermore, we found that soil carbon amount also correlates with land cover types. Soils that contain more carbon in the active layer also tend to produce larger seasonal FT deformation.

Overlapping coincident sea ice freeboard measurements from airborne laser scanner data are used to validate the classification results. The automated sea ice classification algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a polarimetric feature extraction procedure. Next, the resulting feature vectors are ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification. Coherency matrix-based features that require an eigendecomposition are found to be either of low relevance or redundant to other covariance matrix-based features, which makes coherency matrix-based features dispensable for the purpose of sea ice classification. Among the most useful features for classification are matrix invariant-based features (geometric intensity, scattering diversity, and surface scattering fraction). Classification results show that 100% of the open water is separated from the surrounding sea ice and that the sea ice classes have at least 96.9% accuracy. This analysis reveals analogous results for both X-band and C-band frequencies and slightly different for the L-band.

This letter demonstrates the dependence of image texture parameters on SAR IA, using Arctic landfast sea ice samples extracted from C-band frequency Sentinel-1 SAR scenes collected during the winter period. Gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) derived texture parameters, and occurrence texture parameters, derived from undeformed first-year sea ice and multi-year sea ice, which are dominated by surface and volume scattering mechanisms, respectively, were analyzed. All GLCM texture parameters were found to be dependent on IA, highlighting the need for consideration of angular dependence in texture parameters, particularly in the development of image classification and inversion algorithms utilizing them. Occurrence texture parameters showed negligible influence by IA; however, feature discrimination capability was also lost. Some GLCM parameters had similar angular dependencies for both sea ice types, suggesting that, in some cases, global image normalization approaches for texture may be applied to account for the IA effect.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.3039739","Polar Knowledge Canada (POLAR)(grant numbers:NST-1718-0024); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284600","Arctic;image texture analysis;sea ice;sentinel-1;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic;Scattering;Kernel;Correlation","feature extraction;image classification;image texture;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","winter Arctic sea ice;synthetic aperture radar imagery;open platforms;Google Earth Engine;automated classification;geophysical information extraction algorithms;radar scattering mechanism;classification accuracy;image texture parameters;SAR IA;Arctic landfast sea ice samples;C-band frequency Sentinel-1 SAR scenes;winter period;gray-level cooccurrence matrix;occurrence texture parameters;first-year sea ice;volume scattering mechanisms;GLCM texture parameters;angular dependence;image classification;inversion algorithms;GLCM parameters;similar angular dependencies;sea ice types;global image normalization approaches;IA effect;incidence angle dependence;texture statistics;Sentinel-1 HH-polarization images","","2","","22","IEEE","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An accurate estimate of the OHC in the Arctic sea ice regions is challenging due to the lack of in-situ data and satellite-based algorithms. In this study, an artificial neural network-based (ANN) novel approach is presented for estimating OHC changes at various standard depth extents (in line with the World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels) in the Arctic sea ice regions based on the relationships of the sea ice thermodynamic parameters from the satellite measurements and in-situ OHC estimates. Because of the potential uncertainty that arises from the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer in the in-situ OHC estimates, a preliminary ANN model was developed with a set of approximations to account for the in-situ OHC stored in the respective depths within the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer. The ANN model architecture was optimized for a depth extent of 700 m and adopted for the remaining depths of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 100 m,150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m, 400 m, 450 m, 500 m, 550 m, 600 m, and 650 m. The new model was robust in capturing the spatial, temporal, and depth variabilities of OHC in the sea ice-covered Arctic regions with greater accuracy (mean bias error 0.022 GJ m−2, mean bias percentage error 0.015%, mean absolute error 0.182 GJ m−2, mean absolute percentage error 0.148%, root mean square error 0.24 GJ m−2, R−2 0.94, slope 0.93, and intercept 25.05 GJ m−2). This model is capable of estimating OHC and its temporal trends from satellite data which will have implications for understanding the global climate change and its impacts in the Polar Oceans.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3213942","Prime Minister’s Research Fellow Scheme(grant numbers:SB21221916OEPMRF008336); National Geospatial Programme, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(grant numbers:OEC1819150DSTXPSHA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916272","Ocean heat content;Arctic sea ice regions;sea ice thermodynamics;ocean remote sensing;climate change","Climate change;Arctic;Sea Ice;Ocean temperature;Remote sensing;Sea measurements;Thermodynamics;Energy management;Global warming;Artificial neural networks;Satellite navigation systems","global warming;ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","climate change;global warming;OHC estimates;Polar Oceans;global climate change;mean absolute error;ANN model architecture;preliminary ANN model;inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer;satellite measurements;World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels;standard depth extents;OHC changes;artificial neural network;satellite-based algorithms;Arctic sea ice regions;Earth energy imbalance;satellite data;sea ice-covered Arctic regions;Ocean heat content;artificial neural network model","","","","67","CCBY","12 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study focuses on a comprehensive analysis of SID retrieval in the Arctic based on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. A state-of-the-art method combining feature tracking (FT) and pattern matching (PM) techniques was applied to sequential Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data in 2020 to derive SID from the central Arctic to the Fram Strait. The SAR retrievals were validated with drifting buoys. For temporal intervals of S1 data of approximately 24 h, 15 254 collocations were collected from January to June and from October to December, yielding a 0.00 cm/s bias for the drift velocity magnitude and 0.27° for direction with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.47 cm/s and 4.73°. Using temporal intervals of S1 data of less than 24 h, we retrieved SID from July to September. A total of 644 collocations yields a comparison with a bias of 0.52 cm/s and 4.62° for the drift magnitude and direction, respectively. The corresponding RMSE values are 1.85 cm/s and 20.73°. The comparisons demonstrate better performance than the operational SAR-based SID product using the maximum cross correlation (MCC) method and are consistent with seasonal trends in drift velocity with the coarse-resolution product. We also analyzed the variations in SAR retrievals and further estimated appropriate temporal intervals, making it feasible to conduct long-term SID retrievals based on spaceborne SAR data at high spatial resolution in the Arctic.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3226223","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:42025605); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9968195","Arctic;sea ice drift (SID);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic;Random access memory;Nonvolatile memory;Ferroelectric films;Spaceborne radar","geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","central Arctic;corresponding RMSE values;drift magnitude;drifting buoys;estimated appropriate temporal intervals;Fram Strait;long-term SID retrievals;operational SAR-based SID product;SAR retrievals;sea ice drift;sea ice dynamics;sequential Sentinel-1 SAR data;SID retrieval;spaceborne SAR data;spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data","","","","49","IEEE","1 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the open water area is flagged out using brightness temperature (Tb) from the passive microwave sensor. Then, K-means algorithm is applied to identify the clusters of the two ice types in the Tb/backscatter parameter space and finally assign pixels to each class. Two optimization methods based on the movement of MYI and marginal ice zone are used to correct the misclassification of MYI. The results have shown a decrease of MYI in winter from 2002 to 2017, especially in 2008 and 2013 with a remarkable recovery in 2014. The classifications are consistent with results by visual interpretation from synthetic aperture radar images in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago with overall classification accuracy over 93%.

The Alaska coastline is larger than that of any other RA territory as well as the combined seaboard of the United States (US). It is also the only US regional observing system that includes a polar observing component in the Arctic. The effects of climate change in Alaska are already evidenced by the steady decline of Arctic summer sea ice extent and concentration, increased wildfires, thawing permafrost, increasing ocean acidification (OA) and recognizable ecosystem shifts. Other concerns include increased marine traffic, especially through the Bering Strait and across the Arctic Ocean region, ongoing industrial activities, escalating coastal erosion and inundation affecting many coastal subsistence communities, and physical and biological ramifications from the rapid and dramatic retreat of sea ice over the past 30 years. Addressing these changes including mitigation, adaptation and management of resources (e.g., fisheries) requires sustainable, reliable and accessible marine information from both ambient monitoring activities and process oriented research projects. The AOOS conceptual build out plan for the Alaskan Arctic prioritizes core monitoring platforms and activities for safe marine operations, improved storm and hazard response, and integrated data products for ecosystem assessments and climate trends. In this paper, we summarize how AOOS approaches this mission, and discuss actions currently underway in the Arctic, including the ongoing development of the Arctic Data Integration Portal.","","978-1-5090-1537-5","10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7761428","Arctic;ocean observing;data management;water level;sea level;ice detection;ecosystem;moorings;oil;AIS;weather","Arctic;Sea measurements;Oceans;Storms;Sensors;Ecosystems;Climate change","climatology;ecology;environmental monitoring (geophysics);erosion;remote sensing;sea ice;wildfires","Arctic data integration portal;climate trend;integrated data product;hazard response;storm response;marine operation;coastal subsistence community;coastal erosion;industrial activity;Arctic Ocean region;Bering Strait;ecosystem shift;ocean acidification;wildfire;Arctic summer sea ice extent;climate change;United States;RA territory;offshore environment;coastline environment;IOOS Regional Association;Integrated Ocean Observing System;AOOS;Alaska Ocean Observing System","","","","9","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On first-year sea ice (FYI), spatiotemporal variations in snow properties can cause the Ku-band main radar scattering horizon to appear above the snow/sea ice interface. This can increase the estimated sea ice freeboard by several centimeters, leading to FYI thickness overestimations. This article examines the expected changes in Ku-band main scattering horizon and its impact on FYI thickness estimates, with variations in snow temperature, salinity, and density derived from ten naturally occurring Arctic FYI Cases encompassing saline/nonsaline, warm/cold, simple/complexly layered snow (4-45 cm) overlying FYI (48-170 cm). Using a semi-empirical modeling approach, snow properties from these Cases are used to derive layer-wise brine volume and dielectric constant estimates, to simulate the Ku-band main scattering horizon and delays in radar propagation speed. Differences between modeled and observed FYI thickness are calculated to assess sources of error. Under both cold and warm conditions, saline snow covers are shown to shift the main scattering horizon above from the snow/sea ice interface, causing thickness retrieval errors. Overestimates in FYI thicknesses of up to 65% are found for warm, saline snow overlaying thin sea ice. Our simulations exhibited a distinct shift in the main scattering horizon when the snow layer densities became greater than 440 kg/m3, especially under warmer snow conditions. Our simulations suggest a mean Ku-band propagation delay for snow of 39%, which is higher than 25%, suggested in previous studies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2966432","Norges Forskningsråd; KLIMAFORSK programme(grant numbers:#240639); Centre of Ice, Climate and Ecosystems; Norsk Polarinstitutt; N-ICE project; Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway; Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:#15K16135,#24-4175); Centre for Earth Observation Science; University of Manitoba; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Polar Knowledge Canada(grant numbers:#NST-1718-0024); Natural Environment Research Council(grant numbers:NE/M005852/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000883","Radar altimetry;sea ice;snow","Snow;Sea ice;Arctic;Scattering;Ocean temperature;Salinity (geophysical);Temperature measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Ku-band main scattering horizon;snow temperature;Arctic FYI Cases;semiempirical modeling approach;dielectric constant estimates;modeled thickness;saline snow covers;thickness retrieval errors;FYI thicknesses;FYI thickness overestimations;estimated sea ice freeboard;Ku-band main radar scattering horizon;Arctic sea ice thickness estimates;snow properties;norwegian arctic;first-year sea ice thickness;modeled Ku-band altimeter estimates;snow property controls;mean Ku-band propagation delay;warmer snow conditions;snow layer densities","","11","","67","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The geological units show different three-dimensional (3-D) polarimetric SAR signature plots (i.e., radar backscattering responses according to the orientation and the ellipticity of a polarization state). We analyzed the quantitative relationship between the polarimetric SAR signatures of the geological units and their surface roughness. The pedestal height and the standard deviation of linear copolarization responses (SDLP) were calculated from the 3-D copolarization power signature plot, and then compared to in situ surface roughness measurements derived from LiDAR scanned high-resolution surface topography. The results show that the pedestal height has a positive correlation coefficient of ~0.6 with surface roughness, while the SDLP has a negative correlation coefficient of ~0.8 with surface roughness. The variation between the different polarization responses is highly dependent on the surface roughness of the geological units. The SDLP is thus suggested as a promising parameter to characterize surface roughness, in addition to the pedestal height that has been commonly used.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2946944","Canadian Space Agency Science and Operational Applications Research(grant numbers:SOAR,5306); Polar Knowledge Canada; Polar Continental Shelf Program of Natural Resource Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8892527","Canadian Arctic geology;pedestal height;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signature;standard deviation of linear copolarizations (SDLP);surface roughness","Surface roughness;Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;Arctic;Geology","backscatter;geophysical image processing;meteorite craters;optical radar;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;surface roughness;surface topography;synthetic aperture radar","polarimetric SAR signatures;characterizing geological units;Canadian Arctic;polarimetric radar signatures;physical surface properties;RADARSAT-2 quad polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data;polarimetric SAR signature plots;radar backscattering responses;different polarization responses;high-resolution surface topography;situ surface roughness measurements;3-D copolarization power signature plot;linear copolarization responses;pedestal height","","3","","38","IEEE","6 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While rule-based remote-sensing classification methods, such as the threshold method, have been widely used for surveying and mapping polar sea ice leads, they have difficulty in overcoming the problems of noise and poor generalization. In this article, we presented an automated, deep learning sea ice open lead detection network in low wind speed conditions, entropy-weighted network (EW-Net). In EW-Net, a dense block was introduced into a U-Net baseline network to strengthen feature propagation, and an entropy sampling structure was designed to improve the pertinence of the network to leads and alleviate the influence of noise. Furthermore, an entropy-weighted feature fusion block was designed to better restore features. EW-Net was trained on the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset in order to obtain lead maps of different polar regions from Sentinel-1 images. The results showed that the proposed EW-Net model was more effective and more generalizable for polar sea ice lead detection than the threshold method and the deep learning methods U-Net and DeepLab V3 Plus, with an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 0.97. In addition, EW-Net showed advantages in terms of outstanding generalization from cross-sensor image monitoring of leads.

However, lake-rich regions, such as Siberia, are mostly dominated by rivers and lakes, with few stable geometry features such as those typically used as control points for image registration. Lakes in Arctic regions are generally not static; their shorelines tend to expand and shrink seasonally, and may change substantially between different years, making it difficult to find consistent features for image registration. Consequently, traditional image-to-image registration methods, and even many sophisticated registration algorithms, rarely achieve accurate geometric correction in Arctic regions due to a lack of sufficient control points. In this article, we proposed a summary lake spatial attribute, the inferred deepest point of the lake (DPL), as a feature that is relatively insensitive to lake area changes, and therefore useful for registration of multitemporal images. The central focus of the DPL estimation algorithm is the identification of the largest inner circle (LIC) of the lake polygon. First, the internal Voronoi diagram of a lake polygon is calculated by the ""divide-and-conquer"" method. The medial axis (MA) is then calculated by Voronoi diagram simplification, and finally, the LIC center is obtained by computing the distance from the MA intersection to all polygon edges. The approach was used to register HJ-1 and Landsat multispectral scanner (MSS) images in Siberia, where water bodies dominate the landscape and change significantly over time. The proposed method found a large number of control points from the extracted water bodies. Subpixel registration accuracy of 0.62 pixels (18.5 m) and 0.33 pixels (19.6 m) root mean square error (RMSE) was obtained for the HJ-1 and MSS images, respectively. In comparison, the alternative method of using lake centroids, only achieved 0.75 pixels (22.4 m) and 0.49 pixels (29.3 m) RMSE. This registration accuracy improvement is potentially important for large-scale regional cartography and change detection applications.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2950686","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0504204,2018YFB0505000,2018YFB0505002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971375,41671034,41871283); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906131","Deepest point of the lake (DPL);largest inner circle (LIC);medial axis (MA);multitemporal image registration;Voronoi diagram;water body identification","Lakes;Image registration;Rivers;Artificial satellites;Arctic","computational geometry;geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;image registration;lakes;mean square error methods;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing","lake spatial attribute;multitemporal remotely sensed image registration;lake area changes;inferred deepest point;image-to-image registration methods;Arctic regions;stable geometry features;lake dynamics;water body change detection;lake-rich region;multitemporal remote sensing image registration method;change detection applications;large-scale regional cartography;registration accuracy improvement;lake centroids;MSS images;subpixel registration accuracy;extracted water bodies;Landsat multispectral scanner images;divide-and-conquer method;lake polygon;DPL estimation algorithm;multitemporal images","","","","34","IEEE","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a systematic intercomparison of the backscatter signature in VV polarization ( ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$ ) and the sea ice classification from three scatterometer systems using the same ice classification approach. The systems are the Ku-band quick scatterometer (QSCAT) and the newly launched Chinese rotating fan-beam scatterometer (RFSCAT) and the C-band advanced scatterometer (ASCAT). Three freezing seasons are used, i.e., 2007/08 and 2008/09 for the QSCAT/ASCAT comparison and 2019/20 for the RFSCAT/ASCAT comparison. With reference to ASCAT,  ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$  bias between QSCAT and RFSCAT results from their different incidence angles. A continuous declining trend of  ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$  from MYI and FYI is observed during winter, with a greater difference between MYI and FYI in the Ku-band. The MYI and FYI extent derived from QSCAT/RFSCAT is highly consistent with that derived from ASCAT, with a difference less than 7% and 3% for MYI and FYI, respectively. The overall accuracy (OA) is around 77% and 80% for the RFSCAT results and ASCAT results, respectively, compared with Sentinel-1 SAR images.

We evaluated several state-of-the-art feature-based algorithms, including A-KAZE, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), and a very fast feature extractor that computes binary descriptors known as Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) on dual polarized Sentinel-1A C-SAR extra wide swath mode data over the Arctic.

The experimental results showed high relevance of the proposed algorithm for retrieval of ice drift at subkilometre resolution from a pair of SAR images with 100-m pixel size.

This work presents an Arctic erosion one-line model capable of estimating unknown coastal parameters through historic coastline measurements. Parameter estimation is carried out using both the extended and unscented Kalman filters, and the results compared. The model and parameter estimation are evaluated using two sections of Arctic coastline, one near Oliktok Point, AK, and the other along the coast of Barter Island, AK. Historic wave fields are modeled for both locations using downsampled historic GCM data for boundary conditions and estimating fetch distance. Future wave and temperature conditions are found using GCM projections under the RCP 8.5 pathway. Parameter estimation is performed on all coastal measurements except the most recent coastline available; this hold out measurement is then used to test the predictive power of the model. Coastlines at both locations are simulated from 1980 to 2070.

Our noise-aware approach can be used in conjunction with any other deep learning model for sea ice classification. Hence our findings pave the way for getting refined and smoother sea ice maps for ice charting.

Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band SAR (L-band) and RADARSAT-2 (C-band) images are used to derive ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies calculated using linear regression models. For L-band, mean ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies for FYI and MYI are -0.21 and -0.30 dB/1°, respectively; and for C-band, they are -0.22 and -0.16 dB/1°, respectively. To validate our results, we calculated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) by comparing the ice type-specific dependence from 2010 with individual dependencies from 2009 based on ice types and frequencies. The RMSD is found to be smaller than the standard deviation of ice type-specific dependencies for both frequencies. The RMSD values for the L-band incidence angle dependencies are 0.03 and 0.04 dB/1° for FYI and MYI, respectively. For C-band, the RMSD values for the FYI and MYI dependencies are 0.03 and 0.01 dB/1°, respectively.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) can extract the inversions over both land and ocean, and it is, however, sensitive to the presence of clouds. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of cloud fraction (CF) on AIRS inversions over both land and ocean. First, the AIRS inversions under clear-sky conditions are compared with the results from the microwave-based Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations in 2007–2013. Results show that despite the COSMIC and AIRS inversions appearing to be deeper and stronger in winter than in autumn, spring, and summer, the former is generally shallower and stronger than the latter in all seasons over both land and ocean. Time-series analysis of the mean monthly inversions from COSMIC and AIRS observations in 2007–2013 under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions further indicates that their differences are systematic and can be effectively mitigated after calibration under all sky conditions. Taking the calibrated COSMIC inversions as references, the AIRS inversion depths can be estimated with a root mean square (rms) of less than about 86 and 135 m, and the AIRS inversion strength can be obtained with an rms of better than about 1.7 °C and 1.3 °C under cloudy conditions over land and ocean, respectively.

We propose to extract relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices at the input and use this to enforce alignment of the code spaces and reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. A change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from pixel pair affinities that are comparable across domains. To achieve code space alignment, we enforce pixels with similar affinity relations in the input domains to be correlated also in code space.

Prolonged access between North America and Europe via the Northeast Passage is of significant interest to the international maritime community. NOAA National Ocean Service's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) understands these changing conditions and recognizes the critical need for real-time oceanographic and meteorological observations along the U.S. Arctic coasts to support safe navigation. CO-OPS has been developing and testing a new, real-time oceanographic and meteorological observing system to address measurement needs at remote coastal sites where lack of infrastructure limits the use of land-based designs. The prototype system has two main components: 1) a bottom mounted ocean measurement platform and 2) a surface buoy with meteorological sensors and a satellite telemetry system. These two components are connected wirelessly, via an underwater acoustic link. Design details of the new system under development are presented here, along with results from three mid-Atlantic field trials successfully completed with an evolving prototype system, during 2014–2016. Plans for continuing work include completing a yearlong field trial in a relevant environment, along Alaska's northern slope, a critical step required to move the prototype system to the next technology readiness level.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232334","Arctic water levels;navigational safety;real-time ocean observatory;hydrographic survey;bottom mounted pressure gauge","Sea measurements;Real-time systems;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;Telemetry;Arctic;Climate change","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;satellite telemetry;sea ice;seafloor phenomena","safe navigation;U.S. Arctic Coasts;global climate change;sea ice;international maritime community;meteorological observations;U.S. Arctic coasts;meteorological observing system;ocean measurement platform;meteorological sensors;satellite telemetry system;Arctic waterways;real-time ocean observing system;Europe;Northeast Passage;North America;Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services;AD 2014 to 2016;Alaska;Alaska;underwater acoustic link","","","","16","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are also working on incorporating a radar scattering model for Arctic tundra into the SIM-P framework. A unified soil parameterization scheme was developed to harmonize key soil thermal, hydraulic and dielectric parameters in the soil process and radar models that can be used in the joint soil-radar inversion framework. The soil parameter retrievals of the SIM-P framework include soil organic content (SOC) and active layer thickness (ALT). Initial tests of SIM-P using in-situ soil permittivity observations showed reasonable accuracy in predicting site-level SOC and soil temperature profiles at an Alaska tundra site and ALT in Arctic Alaska. SIM-P will be further tested using airborne P- and L-band radar data collected during NASA's Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) to evaluate the sensitivity of longwave radar to active layer properties.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8898856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8898856","permafrost active layer;soil freeze/thaw;radar inversion;soil dielectric constant","Soil;Radar;Soil measurements;Temperature measurement;Dielectrics;Remote sensing;Radar scattering","geochemistry;hydrological techniques;ice;remote sensing;soil","remote sensing;regional Permafrost monitoring;current SIM-P framework;satellite-based soil process model;soil dielectric model;radar scattering model;Arctic tundra;unified soil parameterization scheme;dielectric parameters;radar models;joint soil-radar inversion framework;soil parameter retrievals;soil organic content;active layer thickness;in-situ soil permittivity observations;soil temperature profiles;L-band radar data;longwave radar;active layer properties;Soil Inversion Model framework;landscape scale;active layer dynamics;soil thermal parameter;soil hydraulic parameter;site-level SOC;Alaska tundra site;Arctic Alaska;airborne P-band radar data;NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment","","","","15","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The geographical location and climate impose additional constraints on satellite-based monitoring, making it necessary to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Dark features or low backscatter areas are frequent within the SAR images and their occurrence may indicate oil spills or so-called lookalikes. Automatic oil spill detection hinges on accurate separation of the lookalikes from actual oil spills. Two main types exist in the Barents Sea: newly formed sea ice and low wind regions, where the former occur during the freezing part of the year (approx. November - April) and the other year around. Mapping the occurrence of oil spills and lookalikes in the Barents Sea on a seasonal basis would add to our understanding and knowledge of the low backscatter phenomena. Awareness of the major locations of oil spills, natural oil seeps, or lookalikes, are important for operational services and their effort to reduce false alarms. Here, we explore the use of a segmentation-based dark feature detection method with Sentinel-l Extra Wide-Swath SAR images. We test the method on images acquired over the Barents Sea during the freezing season, and cross-validate the results with two sets of dark features segmented by operational expert oil spill and sea ice monitoring services.

However, the performance of ICESat-2 for SIT estimations still remains unknown. In the present study, SIT estimates derived from ICESat-2 are examined using three retrieval methods, namely, two buoyancy methods with the merged snow depth and empirical snow depth (BMA and BME, respectively) and one empirical estimation method (EEM), and these estimates are compared to near-simultaneous airborne measurements from the IceBird mission in April 2019. Overall, the ICESat-2 total freeboard registers quite well with that from the near-concurrent IceBird mission with a mean bias of 2.5 cm, which demonstrates the high reliability of ICESat-2 data for SIT estimation. However, the much more evident difference between SIT estimations than total freeboard from ICESat-2 and IceBird indicates that other parameters (e.g., snow depth and snow/ice densities) may bring increased uncertainties to the SIT estimation. Overall, BMA is the best method for SIT estimation and has the closest thickness distribution to that of IceBird data with a mean bias of 0.11 m, followed by the BME and EEM methods. The dominate error sources for SIT estimation using the buoyancy method are ice density and snow depth that require further investigation in future studies.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3022945","Programs for National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41976212,41830105); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1407203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9199410","Buoyancy method;empirical method;Ice, cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2);sea ice thickness (SIT);snow depth","Snow;Sea measurements;Estimation;Laser beams;Arctic;Sea ice","hydrological techniques;ice;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice;snow","Arctic sea Ice thickness estimates;Land Elevation Satellite-2;sea ice thickness estimations;SIT estimation;SIT estimates;empirical estimation method;ICESat-2 total freeboard registers;ICESat-2 data;snow depth;ice density;size 0.11 m;size 2.5 cm","","3","","33","IEEE","17 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel architecture called the dense dilated convolutions' merging network (DDCM-Net) to address this task. The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated image convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This effectively utilizes rich combinations of dilated convolutions that enlarge the network's receptive fields with fewer parameters and features compared with the state-of-the-art approaches in the remote sensing domain. Importantly, DDCM-Net obtains fused local- and global-context information, in effect incorporating surrounding discriminative capability for multiscale and complex-shaped objects with similar color and textures in very high-resolution aerial imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and flexibility of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets, as well as the DeepGlobe land cover data set. Our single model, trained on three-band Potsdam and Vaihingen data sets, achieves better accuracy in terms of both mean intersection over union (mIoU) and F1-score compared with other published models trained with more than three-band data.

Non-linear unmixing and material mapping using both spectral and spatial features are therefore two important topics when using hyperspectral imaging to monitor human settlements and infrastructures. Finally, even when no specific material and or urban element is sought, the mixture of artificial (as opposed to natural) materials in human settlements can be used to delineate their extents, with excellent results with respect to those obtained by multispectral optical sensors with the same spatial resolution.","2642-9535","978-1-7281-0009-8","10.1109/JURSE.2019.8809062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8809062","urban unmixing;urban extent extraction","Hyperspectral imaging;Urban areas;Spatial resolution;Vegetation mapping;Monitoring","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;remote sensing","infrastructure monitoring;hyperspectral imaging;urban remote sensing;spectral characterization;surface materials;urban areas;complex geometrical structure;complex unmixing procedures;material mapping;spectral features;spatial features;human settlements;urban element;nonlinear unmixing;multispectral optical sensors","","","","47","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each generation of this training inventory has improved the previous results by including additional reference wetland data and focusing on processing at the scale of ecozone, which represent ecologically distinct regions of Canada. The first and second generations attained relatively highly accurate results with an average approaching 86% though some overestimated wetland extents, particularly of the swamp class. The current research represents a third refinement of the inventory map. It was designed to improve the overall accuracy (OA) and reduce wetlands overestimation by modifying test and train data and integrating additional environmental and remote sensing datasets, including countrywide coverage of L-band ALOS PALSAR-2, SRTM, and Arctic digital elevation model, nighttime light, temperature, and precipitation data. Using a random forest classification within Google Earth Engine, the average OA obtained for the CWIM3 is 90.53%, an improvement of 4.77% over previous results. All ecozones experienced an OA increase of 2% or greater and individual ecozone OA results range between 94% at the highest to 84% at the lowest. Visual inspection of the classification products demonstrates a reduction of wetland area overestimation compared to previous inventory generations. In this study, several classification scenarios were defined to assess the effect of preprocessing and the benefits of incorporating multisource data for large-scale wetland mapping. In addition, the development of a confidence map helps visualize where current results are most and least reliable given the amount of wetland test and train data and the extent of recent landscape disturbance (e.g., fire).

CO-OPS continually pursues efforts to identify potential improvements to its observatory network. Many recent studies on global climate change have identified a significant increase in Arctic warming rates. Resulting trends of increased sea ice loss have led to Arctic waterways becoming more accessible during summer seasons. As a result, an increase in maritime transport throughout the region is anticipated for the near future. Presently, Artic waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have very few navigational support products and services. NOAA, recognizing the changing conditions, anticipates a growing, critical need for real-time oceanographic and meteorological observations across the region. In support of long term modernization plans, CO-OPS has been working on the design, development, and testing of a standalone, real-time water level measurement system for use in remote Arctic coastal regions with very limited infrastructure. Two types of system designs have been identified, for short and long term applications. Both design types include a bottom mounted pressure gauge for the primary source of water level measurements. The long-term system design involves a cable run from an offshore bottom mounted pressure gauge to a small, shore station. The short term system design includes a surface buoy with satellite telemetry and acoustic modem; and a bottom unit consisting of a conductivity, temperature, pressure sensor and acoustic modem. The buoy based system is intended for real-time communications during ice-free periods. Details of the short-term version system design will be presented along with results from a recent field trial conducted in the lower Chesapeake Bay region near Virginia Beach, Virginia during 2014–2015.

There is a large amount of heterogeneous radar data from the polar regions that have been gathered through expensive missions. However, retrieving meaningful information from this large volume of data is still a great challenge. With the advancement of machine learning techniques in recent years, many scientists are eager to take advantage of these algorithms and techniques to explore and mine Arctic and Antarctic data. These advancements, however, have happened mainly in the area of supervised learning where the models are data hungry and require large amounts of annotated data. Generating simulated data can be an effective and inexpensive approach to provide large labeled datasets for training machine learning models. In this work, we explore two approaches to simulate arctic snow radar echogram images, namely a radar scattering physics based approach combined with some statistical measures and a purely data-driven approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network. Using several image comparison metrics, we analyze the utility of both methods for the purpose of simulating echograms. Our results show that the physics simulator generates images with good structural similarities, while the purely data-driven approach achieves better textural similarities for simulated image. Finally, we also show that by augmenting our real dataset by the simulated echograms, we can improve our deep learning model for tracking internal layers of snow.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126547","NSF BIGDATA(grant numbers:IIS-1838230,IIS-1947584); NSF HDR Institute(grant numbers:OAC-2118285); IBM; Amazon Catalyst; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9622135","Generative adversarial networks (GANs);remote sensing;simulation;snow radar","Snow;Radar;Generative adversarial networks;Radar imaging;Radar tracking;Data models;Radar remote sensing","airborne radar;geophysical image processing;glaciology;hydrological techniques;learning (artificial intelligence);radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;snow","airborne snow radar data simulation;physics-driven methods;monitoring properties;ice sheets;polar regions;heterogeneous radar data;Antarctic data;supervised learning;annotated data;effective approach;inexpensive approach;training machine learning models;arctic snow radar echogram images;radar scattering physics;purely data-driven approach;conditional generative adversarial network;simulating echograms;physics simulator;simulated image;simulated echograms;deep learning model","","","","48","CCBY","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning and deep learning methodology can be utilized to automate ice charting, however, large amounts of reliable training data is crucial for implementing the technology successfully, and training data itself is sparse and costly to obtain in the Arctic areas. To obtain more training data, we proposed a two-stage methodology which incorporate the physics into training dataset generation procedure. Firstly, a physics-based incidence angle aware algorithm was employed for generating better connected and fewer reference classes to be manually labelled for training. Secondly, we enrich the training data to a balanced training set by using the physical knowledge regarding incidence angle dependence of SAR intensity. This many-fold enriched dataset can then be used for pixel-wise sea ice versus water classification by using a reduced UNet architecture.

Reduced sea ice coverage may open up the Arctic to further exploration of maritime activities, particularly during the summer months. Given such changes, it is important to investigate differences between available sea ice drift products. Products based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radar scatterometer, and radiometer are compared for both motion speed and direction within this study. Two C-band SAR and one L-band SAR product are used in the comparison. Differences in temporal and spatial resolutions of the drift estimates spanning from July 2010 until June 2011 are investigated. High temporal and spatial resolution was proven useful to fully capture the sea ice drift in the Fram Strait. For summer coverage, SAR data are a prerequisite and L-band is desirable. The two C-band SAR products have a mean speed correlation of 0.90 and exhibit high conformity, despite being generated by separate processing methods. The L-band SAR product and the scatterometer and radiometer products are to a lower degree in agreement with each other and the C-band SAR products, which may be attributed to the products' dependency on the temporal baseline. Depending on the choice of sensor or combination of sensors, the resulting 12-month mean drift varies between 0.09 and 0.12 m/s excluding L-band SAR. The latter shows a particularly low drift of 0.05 m/s, which we attribute to an over-representation of slow ice.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2506786","Swedish National Space Board and Chalmers Area of Advance Transport; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377006","Radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series;Radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites;Arctic;Microwave radiometry;Radar measurements","oceanographic regions;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice drift product;Arctic sea ice;sea ice drift pattern;sea ice coverage reduction;maritime activity;summer season;synthetic aperture radar;radar scatterometer;radiometer product;C-band SAR product;L-band SAR product;AD 2010 07 to 2011 06;high spatiotemporal resolution;Fram Strait;SAR data;slow ice","","6","","29","IEEE","8 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The polarized scanning atmospheric corrector (PSAC) sensors, onboard the HJ-2 A/B satellites, are served as the synchronously atmospheric correction instrument requiring a high-speed and accurate aerosol optical depth (AOD) algorithm. For this purpose, we proposed a neural network-based AOD retrieval model (named the AODNet) that takes full advantage of the multispectral measurements of PSAC for AOD retrieval at a high speed. The training of AODNet is conducted by the simulated observation data (currently applicable for the China region) from the forward calculation using the radiative transfer model. In this way, the land surface reflectance (LSR) is no need for our well-trained model. It is expected to be one of the effective ways to solve the ill-pose problem in the decoupling of the atmosphere and surface information in AOD retrieval. Either the Sun-sky radiometer Observation NETwork (SONET) AOD or the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD was used to validate the AODNet AOD. The correlation coefficient is higher than 0.85, and more than 60% of the AODNet AOD can fall into the expected error envelope of ±(0.05+20%). The cross-comparison shows that the AODNet has better accuracy than MODIS dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithm.

We compare the Doppler-derived ice velocities with global positioning system tracks from a drifting ice station as well as vector fields derived using traditional cross correlation between a pair of S1A and Radarsat-2 images with a time lag of only 25 min. A strategy is provided for precise calibration of the Doppler values in the context of the S1A level-2 ocean RVL product. When comparing the two methods, root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 7 cm/s were found for the extra wide (EW4) and EW5 swaths, while the highest RMSE of 32 cm/s was obtained for the EW1 swath. Though the agreement is not perfect, our experiment demonstrates that the Doppler technique is capable of measuring a signal from the ice if the ice is fast moving.

For some SARIn waveforms, the scattering from sea ice at the satellite nadir is successfully separated from returns originating from off-nadir leads. An average bias of -1.8 cm is found for absolute sea ice elevations when using a 50% threshold retracker. It is shown that including multiple SARIn peaks and the associated phase difference in the processing does not introduce any bias on the average sea ice freeboard heights compared with the estimates from regular SAR processing schemes, while significantly increasing the number of valid sea surface height retrievals (+55%) and the number of freeboard estimates in the coastal domain and in multi-year ice regions (~3 times). This results in an average ~34% reduction of the gridded random freeboard uncertainty, corresponding to a ~20% reduction of the gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty. The results of this work show that SARIn acquisitions over Arctic sea ice provide improved spatial coverage and denser sampling of sea level and sea ice freeboard compared with the SAR mode, with accuracy being largely driven by the retracking algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3022522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205871","CryoSat-2 (CS2);interferometry;radar altimetry;retracking;sea ice;swath processing","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Uncertainty;Spaceborne radar","height measurement;ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;synthetic aperture radar","single SARIn waveforms;Arctic sea ice;absolute sea ice elevations;including multiple SARIn peaks;average sea ice;valid sea surface height retrievals;multiyear ice regions;gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty;SARIn acquisitions;sea level;multipeak retracking;CryoSat-2 SARIn waveforms;pulse-limited radar altimeter;Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric mode;ice sheets;ice caps;CS2 SARIn data;multiple coherent peaks;CS2 SARIn waveforms;valid height estimate;size -1.8 cm","","","","59","CCBY","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since high-resolution (HR) images cannot be typically acquired continuously over time, bitemporal images with different resolutions are often adopted for CD in practical applications. Traditional subpixel-based methods for CD using images with different resolutions may lead to substantial error accumulation when the HR images are employed, which is because of intraclass heterogeneity and interclass similarity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel method for CD using images with different resolutions that are more suitable for the HR images. To this end, we propose a super-resolution-based change detection network (SRCDNet) with a stacked attention module (SAM). The SRCDNet employs a super-resolution (SR) module containing a generator and a discriminator to directly learn the SR images through adversarial learning and overcome the resolution difference between the bitemporal images. To enhance the useful information in multiscale features, a SAM consisting of five convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) is integrated to the feature extractor. The final change map is obtained through a metric learning-based change decision module, wherein a distance map between bitemporal features is calculated. Ablation study and comparative experiments on two large datasets, building change detection dataset (BCDD) and season-varying change detection dataset (CDD), and a real-image experiment on the Google dataset fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

Thus, an approach that is interpretative in nature and applicable across polarimetric modes is required. In this context, the geodesic distance (GD)-based approach within the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) literature is seen as an eigenvalue-decomposition free approach to interpret and analyze quad PolSAR data. This approach is highly adaptive toward applications due to its ability to compare the SAR observation with a known scatterer/model, or with another SAR observation in general providing a means for direct interpretation. In this work, we show that the GD (originally defined for the quad polarization mode) is generalizable across any arbitrary SAR polarimetric mode while retaining its simple form for ready computation. We show that the GD-based approach provides level ground for comparison of different polarimetric modes given a fixed application. We demonstrate it using change detection as the chosen application. In addition, we show how the behavior of the three roll-invariant GD-based parameters change under different polarimetric modes (e.g., quad, dual, and compact polarization modes). We also discuss how the GD-based approach can also be adapted to ground range detected (GRD) product data, which is presently available from Sentinel-1 and widely used in many applications. However, in this case, we show that only one of the three GD-derived parameters can be defined. We believe this work will make the GD-based approach important for present and future PolSAR applications cutting across sensors and its available polarimetric modes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3231932","Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) and the Research Council of Norway (RCN)(grant numbers:237906); Visual Intelligence Centre for Research-based Innovation; RCN(grant numbers:309439); Automatic Multisensor remote sensing for Sea Ice Characterization (AMUSIC) Framsenteret “Polhavet” flagship(grant numbers:2020); IMPETUS project; European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(grant numbers:101037084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998571","Compact;dual;geodesic distance (GD);ground range detected (GRD);hybrid;NISAR;polarimetric mode;PolSAR;quad;Sentinel-1;twin","Synthetic aperture radar;Symmetric matrices;Sensors;Scattering;Manifolds;Level measurement;Data models","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;geophysical techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","arbitrary SAR polarimetric mode;available polarimetric modes;chosen application;compact polarization modes;different polarimetric modes;direct interpretation;eigenvalue-decomposition free approach;fixed application;future PolSAR applications;GD-based approach important;GD-derived parameters;generalized geodesic distance-based approach;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar literature;quad polarization mode;quad PolSAR data;roll-invariant GD-based parameters;SAR observation;synthetic aperture radar acquisition;traditional quad polarimetric mode","","","","48","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

ArcÇav is composed of several components, including a digital camera, a single board computer, a microcontroller board, and a motion detection sensor. A limited energy source, very cold temperatures, darkness, and a very long recording period (several months) are major challenges that ArcÇav is designed to deal with. The performance of the developed system is evaluated in a real situation in the High Arctic. The field results show that ArcÇav can function well for an extended period of time on a battery at very low temperatures during the arctic winters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that life under snow has been filmed by a camera trap in the Arctic during winter.

This has potential benefits for wide-swath SAR imagery over flat areas and ocean, wide angled airborne and UAV based SAR data, connecting narrow-beam SAR images at different acquisition angles, as well as land-based analysis with local topographic terrain angles.

Separation between the low backscatter areas that constitutes oil slicks and newly formed sea ice is therefore important. Here we compare fully polarimetric L-band SAR images overlapping both oil slicks and newly formed sea ice.

In the retrieval algorithm, the background scattering is subtracted from the total scattering giving the volume scattering of snow. With the look-up table, we generate regression equations between multiple and single scattering and correlations between the scattering albedo and optical thickness at the two bands. With these relationships and the volume scattering of the snowpack, the best solution for the radar observation is found using a priori constrained least-squares cost function. Next, the absorption loss of the snowpack is derived from the solution, which is directly proportional to the SWE. We have applied the algorithm to airborne SAR observations from Finland and Canada.

The core of the method is a forward model which can ingest bulk data for seven geophysical parameters to reproduce the brightness temperatures observed by a passive microwave radiometer. The retrieval method inverts the forward model and produces ensembles of the seven parameters, wind speed, integrated water vapor, liquid water path, sea and ice temperature, sea ice concentration and multiyear ice fraction. The method is constrained using numerical weather prediction data in order to retrieve a set of geophysical parameters that best fit the measurements. A sensitivity study demonstrates the method is robust and that the solution it provides is not dependent on initialization conditions. The retrieval parameters have been compared with the Arctic Systems Reanalysis model data as well as columnar water vapor retrieved from satellite microwave sounders and the Remote Sensing Systems AMSR-E ocean retrieval product in order to determine the feasibility of using the same setup over pure surface with 100% and 0% sea ice cover, respectively. Sea ice concentration retrieval shows good skill for pure surface cases. Ice types retrieval is in good agreement with scatterometer backscatter data.

Mean monthly area flux exhibits a prominent cycle with the peak in March $\rm{(78 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}\text{/month)}$  and the trough in August $\rm{(5 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}/\text{month)}$. Mean net annual ice area flux  $\rm{(644.1 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}\,\text{km}^{2}\rm{)}$ is primarily/slightly attributable to winter (October–May)/summer (June–September) outflow of $\rm{598.7\times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}$ $\rm{(or\; 93.0\%)/ 45.4 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2} (\rm{or} 7\%)$ . However, these quantities need to be considered with great prudence since comparisons with preceding studies indicate distinct difference may exist between calculated Fram Strait sea ice outflow based on varied ice motion datasets. In particular, major bias emerged during winter rather than summer. Trends are also affected due to this bias. Despite the clear disparity in magnitude, we found a good agreement with preceding estimates in terms of temporal variability. The linkage between ice area flux via the Fram Strait and various atmospheric circulation indices, such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a west-east dipole anomaly pattern (DA), as well as a seesaw structure between Beaufort and Barents Sea (BBO), was examined. Results show that atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the DA and BBO possess a relatively stronger influence on Fram Strait ice export over the 25-year period. By contrast, the AO- and NAO-related atmospheric circulation pattern exhibit weaker connections with ice outflow through the strait. In addition, correlation analysis further justify the robust connection with a cross-strait surface level pressure gradient index. Depending on months, it is suggested that a manifold of aforementioned atmospheric indices may jointly or alone impose a significant influence on sea ice export through the Fram Strait.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2584539","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41406215); Laboratory for Marine Geology; Qingdao National Laboratory; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2014M561971); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:MGE2013KG07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514221","Fram Strait;remote sensing;sea ice area flux","Random access memory;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;Sea ice;Indexes;Arctic","atmospheric movements;atmospheric pressure;oceanographic regions;sea ice","concentration fields;AD 1988 to 2012;mean monthly area flux;mean net annual ice area flux;Fram Strait sea ice outflow;ice motion datasets;temporal variability;atmospheric circulation indices;Arctic Oscillation-related atmospheric circulation;west-east dipole anomaly pattern;seesaw structure;Beaufort Sea;Barents Sea;atmospheric circulation patterns;Fram Strait ice export;North Atlantic Oscillation-related atmospheric circulation;Arctic Sea ice area export;cross-strait surface level pressure gradient index","","16","","26","IEEE","15 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because of small scale and short lifetime, they are often missed by weather observation networks. As they can significantly affect ships and coastal communities and can have a large impact on lateral heat and moisture transport, better observation of polar lows with satellites is worthwhile. Here, we assess the detectability of polar lows using data from the microwave humidity sounders advanced microwave sounding unit-B (AMSU-B) and microwave humidity sounder (MHS) on the polar-orbiting satellites of NOAA. It turns out that cloud ice and frozen precipitation in polar lows cause strong scattering of upwelling atmospheric emission in the three water vapor channels around 183.31 GHz. As a result, most polar lows can be detected in brightness temperature differences of the water vapor channels as small areas of reversed sign. Out of 110 confirmed polar lows in the Nordic Seas, 85% could be clearly detected with AMSU-B. Looking for all polar-low-like signatures in AMSU-B/MHS data, we found about twice as many cases as the most thorough remote sensing inventory of polar lows published so far. The main reason is that in contrast to that inventory, we did not impose a minimum wind criterion which would need wind data from other sources. However, using the AMSU-B/MHS brightness temperature differences can be a quick tool to detect possible polar lows in near real time and this can equally well be applied to similar microwaves sounders operational on current and future satellites.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2499083","Sixth Framework Programmes of the European Union(grant numbers:018509-DAMOCLES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360099","Arctic regions;clouds;meteorology;microwave radiometry;remote sensing;Arctic regions;clouds;meteorology;microwave radiometry;remote sensing","Microwave radiometry;Electromagnetic heating;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Clouds;Remote sensing;Wind","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric temperature;remote sensing;snow;storms;wind","brightness temperature;Nordic Seas;AMSU-B/MHS data;water vapor channels;atmospheric emission;frozen precipitation;cloud ice;NOAA;polar-orbiting satellites;microwave humidity sounder;AMSU-B;advanced microwave sounding unit-B;moisture transport;coastal communities;heavy snowfall;winds;polar seas;low-pressure systems;space-borne microwave humidity sounders;polar lows;polar mesocyclones","","4","","27","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To evaluate not only potentials and limitations of our framework, but also the pros and cons of each regression method, we perform experiments on two data sets.

The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification.

To determine the separability of these two varying but similar appearing low backscatter ocean surfaces, multipolarization features are utilized from both SAR datasets. The discrimination is evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test. All imagery was obtained during several sea ice campaigns in the Arctic Ocean and separate oil spill campaigns in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico, with each campaign collecting in situ observations. We observe that the polarization difference (VV-HH) reliably separates the mineral oil slicks and newly formed sea ice areas using UAVSAR images, due to the low noise floor and subsequent high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiometric performance of the airborne system. The comparably higher noise floor and related lower SNR hampers the separability in the RS-2 images. Simulated noise floors were generated by adding white Gaussian noise to the UAVSAR data, which show that discrimination between the two low backscatter phenomena using multipolarization features is possible, provided that both datasets are still well above the noise floor. The pixel resolution has a limited effect on the separability.

The primary goal is reflectometry-based monitoring of sea ice as a part of the Arctic climate study. The dataset presented here covers the expedition’s first leg (late September to mid-December 2019) in the Siberian Sector of the central Arctic (at about 82 ° N to  $87~^\circ $  N). Daily profiles of reflectivity are retrieved for satellite elevations  $< 45^\circ $ . In agreement with model prediction, the results show best reflectivity contrast (about 5 dB between compact pack-ice and lower ice concentrations) for observations at left-handed circular polarization and elevation angles of 10°–20°. A daily resolved time series of sea-ice relative permittivity is inverted from the left-handed data. In general, the level of inversion results is at the lower limit of sea-ice values (relative permittivity of 3 and below), potentially indicating an influence of incoherent volume scattering. An occasional increase in the relative permittivity is attributed to the presence of water. Sea-ice profiles show anomalies that are confirmed by enhanced model prediction (slab reflection). A long-term comparison of prediction and retrieved profiles indicates anomalies’ dependence on ice thickness and temperature.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3121993","Research Council of Norway through the project HAVOC(grant numbers:280292); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583283","Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition;reflectometry;satellite navigation systems;sea-ice permittivity","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea measurements;Permittivity;Global navigation satellite system;Temperature measurement;Ocean temperature","ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;permittivity;radiowave propagation;reflectometry;satellite navigation;sea ice","sea-ice permittivity derived;GNSS reflection profiles;MOSAiC expedition;reflectometry measurements;German research icebreaker Polarstern;Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory;Arctic Climate expedition;Global Navigation Satellite Systems;dedicated GNSS reflectometry receiver;sea-ice reflectivity;sea ice;Arctic climate study;late September;Siberian Sector;central Arctic;daily profiles;satellite elevations;reflectivity contrast;compact pack-ice;lower ice concentrations;left-handed circular polarization;elevation angles;daily resolved time series;sea-ice relative permittivity;left-handed data;sea-ice values;sea-ice profiles;enhanced model prediction;slab reflection;ice thickness;noise figure 5.0 dB","","2","","34","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is especially challenging for the Arctic region due to the lower number of visible satellites, severe ionospheric disturbances, scintillation effects, and higher delays than in the non-Arctic and non-Antarctic regions. In regions up North, conventional satellite positioning systems are generally proposed to be utilized, together with other situational awareness systems, to achieve the necessary level of accuracy. This paper provides a detailed review of the current state-of-the-art, satellite-based positioning systems' availability and performance and reports high-level positioning requirements for the oncoming applications. In particular, the comparative study between three Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations is executed to determine whether they are suitable for autonomous vessel navigation in the Arctics' complex environment as the two most significant drivers for a reevaluation of the related satellite constellations. This work analyzes the ongoing research executed in different (inter-) national projects focused on Galileo, Global Positioning System (GPS), and GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS). Based on the literature review and the simulation campaign, we conclude that all the convectional constellations achieve an accuracy of fewer than three meters in the analyzed Arctic scenarios. It is postulated that other complementary positioning methods should be utilized to improve accuracy beyond this limit.

However, there is a common struggle to obtain accurate classifications year round, particularly in the melt and freeze-up seasons. During these seasons, the radar backscatter signal is affected by wet snow cover, obscuring information about underlying ice types. By using additional spatiotemporal contextual data and a combination of convolutional neural networks and a dense conditional random field, we can mitigate these problems and obtain a single classifier that is able to classify accurately at 3.5-m spatial resolution for five different classes of sea ice surface from October to May. During the near year-long drift of the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, we collected satellite scenes of the same patch of Arctic pack ice with X-band SAR with a revisit time of less than a day on average. Combined with in situ observations of the local ice properties, this offers up the unprecedented opportunity to perform a detailed and quantitative assessment of the robustness of our classifier for level, deformed, and heavily deformed ice.

Hustai National Park (HNP) of Mongolia, which is 506 square kilometers (km2) in size, encompasses high mountains, hills and valleys. The land cover of HNP, includes stepe land, mountain steppe and forest steppe. In recent years, HNP forests started to dry out significantly and the entire landscape has changed from forest steppe to mountain steppe. Currently, in HNP forests cover only 13.1 km2 of the park. The dominate tree species are Betula platyphylla Sukaczev (Siberian silver birch) and Populus tremula (Eurasian aspen). Siberian silver birch is drought sensitive, frost resistant and able to grow well under different environmental conditions. Siberian silver birch is distributed only on the north-facing slopes of the mountains because evapotranspiration is much higher than precipitation in Mongolia. In this study, we conducted field surveys at three sites in the park over a five-year period and sampled 1130 points. We apply a tree measurement (TM) survey to examine living and dead (dieback) trees, as well as obtain a Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) measurement. Using the DBH and height of the trees we clarify the factors that influence white birch forest. Extraction of fallen and dieback tree pixels using time series Landsat satellite data, including an analysis of microgeomorphology characteristics (slope and solar radiation) of dieback trees using 30m SRTM DEM data were employed. Results show the DBH of the birch tree with dieback was around 10–15 cm and the tree height was 2–3 m.

Traditionally, Arctic sea-ice types are mainly identified based on the scatterometer, radiometer, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the medium-incidence angles (about 20°–60°). The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), as a new type sensor with the low-incidence angles (0°, 2°, 4°, 8°, and 10°), is different from traditional remote sensors. SWIM has the potential to recognize sea-ice types based on its echo signals and backscattering information, whereas relevant research is still under development. In this research, the sea-ice classification using the SWIM’s observations of the low-incidence angles is studied. Firstly, the waveform features of the six low-incidence angles were extracted from the SWIM echoes from November 2019 to April 2020, including the maximum power (MAX), the backscattering power (BSP), the pulse peakiness (PP), the stack standard deviation (SSD), the leading-edge width (LEW), and the trailing-edge width (TEW). Secondly, the Euclidean distances among the sea-ice types (the first-year ice (FYI) and the multi-year ice (MYI)) and the open water (OW) are used to analyze the distinction of the three categories based on the waveform features in the incidence angles. Thirdly, the FYI, MYI, and OW are classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the waveform features, and the three kinds of kernel (Gaussian kernel, Linear kernel, and Polynomial kernel) for SVM are analyzed for their capabilities of sea-ice classification. Then, the classification results are compared with the ice charts of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) to evaluate the classification accuracies. It is found that the accuracies of the waveform features in the low-incidence angles for the Gaussian kernel are the highest, and the accuracies of the Linear kernel are the lowest. It is revealed that the accuracies of all features in the different angles using Gaussian kernel is up to 77%. It is concluded that SWIM has the capacity for the sea-ice classification. In the future, our work will focus on the development of recognition methods based on more waveform features or feature sets to improve the accuracies of the sea-ice classification. This research will expand new horizons for the SWIM ocean detection application.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-7247-7","10.1109/PIERS53385.2021.9695052","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695052","","Support vector machines;Sea surface;Surface waves;Feature extraction;Arctic;Kernel;Monitoring","backscatter;geophysical signal processing;image classification;ocean waves;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic sea-ice types;medium-incidence angles;Surface Wave Investigation;Monitoring instrument;type sensor;low-incidence angles;sea-ice classification;waveform features;first-year ice;multiyear ice;Gaussian kernel;ice charts;Arctic sea-ice type recognition;Arctic sea-ice monitoring","","","","23","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the Arctic seas, one of the major challenges of SSS remote sensing is the presence of sea ice. This paper proposes a data-driven ice correction (IC) algorithm which extracts emission from the water portion of measured brightness temperature (TB) in scenes mixed with water and ice. Emission of the ice portion was removed based on estimation according to the ice fraction (fice) in the satellite footprint and ice signature derived from surrounding pixels. The IC algorithm is applied to SMAP TB data to obtain TB with IC (TBIC), which are used for SSS retrieval using the standard JPL SMAP CAP processing system. We show that the algorithm is most effective near the ice edge, thereby increasing the fice threshold for possible SSS retrieval to 15% from the current 3% without IC. SMAP SSS are validated using in situ salinity collected during NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission from 2016 to 2020 along the Greenland coast. The number of collocations between OMG and SMAP daily gridded salinity increased by more than 30% with IC. The statistical analysis shows a similar retrieval accuracy with or without IC, with the standard deviation of the difference between OMG and SMAP of 1.41 psu (with IC) and 1.42 psu (without IC).

Low Earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements provide a promising opportunity for retrieval of ionospheric TEC over sea ice and calm waters, which offers a potential new data source to fill the gaps of ground-based GNSS networks. However, the GNSS-R slant TEC (sTEC) estimations include contributions from the incident and reflection ray paths, whose ionospheric piercing points (IPPs) can be separated by hundreds of kilometers. This article presents an algorithm that integrates sTEC measurements from the GNSS-R CubeSats and available ground-based GNSS receivers to derive Arctic vertical TEC (vTEC) maps. A simulation study using the model ionosphere constructed from the NeQuick-2 is conducted to assess the performance of the algorithm. Varying levels of temporal resolutions and solar activities, and the number of CubeSats and the number of maximum simultaneously tracked reflection signals by a CubeSat are implemented in the simulation. The results show that the inclusion of coherent GNSS-R measurements improves the accuracy of the vTEC maps under all levels of solar activities.

We explore two feature ranking methods derived for the GPR model, namely sensitivity analysis (SA) and automatic relevance determination (ARD). We also investigate a second regression method, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) for oceanic Chl-a content estimation. Feature relevance in the PLSR model can be accessed through the variable importance in projection (VIP) feature ranking algorithm. This paper thus analyzes three feature ranking models, SA, ARD, and VIP, which are all derived from different fundamental principles, and uses the ranked features as inputs to the GPR and PLSR to assess regression strengths. We compare the regression performances using some common performance measures, and show how the feature ranking methods can be used to find the lowest number of features to estimate oceanic Chl-a content by using the GPR and PLSR models, while still producing comparable performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms. We evaluate the models on a global MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer matchup dataset.

The goal is to show that the inversion results obtained from both methods are consistent. Given that the ocean surface is a highly nondepolarizing surface scatter, the signal return within the cross-polarization channels is usually negligible and of no practical use when trying to invert the returned backscatter into useful quantities such as the dielectric constant. In this article, we employ F-SAR data, which was acquired in X-, S-, and L-bands and has an extremely low noise floor, implying that the cross-polarization ratio can be employed.

We propose a novel approach to achieve high overall accuracy, while still achieving good accuracy for small objects. Quantifying the uncertainty on a pixel scale is another challenge in remote sensing, especially when using CNNs. In this paper we use recent advances in measuring uncertainty for CNNs and evaluate their quality both qualitatively and quantitatively in a remote sensing context.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based ice thickness charts were used as reference data. Thin ice detection was studied using polarization and spectral gradient ratios (PR and GR) calculated from the 36/37 and 89/91 GHz radiometer data. Thresholds for thin ice detection and maximum thicknesses for the detected thin ice (hT) were determined, as were error rates for misdetections. The results for different 1-D PR and GR parameters led to the conclusion that the AMSR-E PR36 and H-polarized GR8936 would be the best parameters for a 2-D classifier. We adopted the linear discrimination analysis (LDA) as a statistical tool. Thin ice areas with hT of 30 cm could be separated from thicker ice fields with approximately 20% error level. In our large data set, the estimation of thin ice thickness was not possible with reasonable accuracy due to the large scatter between ice thickness and the PR and GR signatures. This is likely due to a large data set, besides thin ice in polynyas also thin ice in the marginal ice zone and thin ice from freeze-up period. The optimal LDA parameters in the classifier and hT depended on the daily mean air temperature ((Tam)). We could not yet parameterize the classifier optimally according to (Tam), but the constructed classifier worked rather robustly as indicated by the relative small error rate variation between the three analyzed winters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2416393","Sea ice and snow products for the Barents; Pechora and Kara Seas using multisensor satellite data (KaraX); Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation TEKES; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088607","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice;Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Ice thickness;Microwave radiometry;MODIS;Silicon carbide;Sea ice;Estimation","microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;statistical analysis","thin ice detection;Barents Sea;Kara Sea;SSMIS radiometer data;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System;Special Sensor Microwave Imager-Sounder radiometer data;AD 2008 to 2011;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;ice thickness chart;polarization-spectral gradient ratio;AMSR-E PR36;H-polarized GR8936;2D classification;linear discrimination analysis;LDA;statistical tool;ice thickness estimation;polynyas;marginal ice zone;freeze-up period;daily mean air temperature;frequency 36 GHz;frequency 37 GHz;frequency 89 GHz;frequency 91 GHz","","18","","43","EU","17 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, high frequencies, for example, 91.7 GHz, are sensitive to variable atmospheric absorption, even in winter’s dry conditions. In this article, the influence of variable atmospheric absorption on snow cover extent (SCE) mapping was quantitatively investigated. A physical method was derived to enable atmospheric correction for variable atmospheric conditions. The total column precipitable water vapor (TPWV) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was parametrized into transmittances in this correction method. The corrected brightness temperature at 19 and 91.7 GHz from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS) was applied to the threshold algorithm for snow mapping over China. Compared with the Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) data in winter from 2012 to 2013, for Qinghai–Tibet plateau (QTP), a significant improvement after correction was obtained from February to March over ephemeral and shallow snow, where the largest daily improvement of accuracy is up to 20%. The accuracy (incl. precision, recall, and F1 index) improved on average is from 0.77 (0.60, 0.68, and 0.63) to 0.79 (0.69, 0.7, and 0.68) over the full winter time from December to March. Over forest-rich Northeast China, where snow in winter is thicker, small improvement was observed at the onset of the snow season and over snow margin area. It was evidenced that high frequency is a promising way of snow cover mapping with the proposed atmospheric correction method.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3031837","Chinese National Key Research and Development Program of China through MARIS Project(grant numbers:2017YFE0111700); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA19070201); Chinese Academy of Sciences President’s International Fellowship Initiative(grant numbers:2017VTB0008); International Partnership Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:131211KYSB20170041); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371351); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:325397); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9246529","Atmospheric correction;passive microwave (PM) remote sensing;Qinghai–Tibet plateau (QTP) and Northeast China;snow cover extent (SCE) mapping;variations in atmospheric contribution","Snow;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Microwave radiometry;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave imaging","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric movements;atmospheric techniques;hydrological techniques;microwave imaging;microwave measurement;radiometry;remote sensing;snow","variable atmospheric conditions;total column precipitable water vapor;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder;snow mapping;Interactive Multisensor Snow;Ice Mapping System data;ephemeral snow;shallow snow;snow season;snow margin area;snow cover mapping;atmospheric correction method;passive Microwave brightness temperature;spaceborne passive microwave observations;variable atmospheric absorption;snow cover extent mapping","","4","","45","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the significant spatiotemporal variability of soil properties and the limited information provided by point-scale measurements (e.g., cores), geophysical methods hold potential for improving soil and permafrost characterization. In this study, we evaluate the use of a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to estimate thaw layer thickness, snow depth, and ice-wedge characteristics in an ice-wedge-dominated tundra region near Barrow, AK, USA. To this end, we analyze GPR and point-scale measurements collected along several parallel transects at the end of the growing season and the end of frozen season. In addition, we compare the structural information extracted from the GPR data with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) information about ice-wedge characteristics. Our study generally highlights the value of GPR data collected in the frozen season, when conditions lead to the improved GPR signal-to-noise ratio, facilitate data acquisition, and reduce acquisition-related ecosystem disturbance relative to growing season. We document for the first time that GPR data collected during the frozen season can provide reliable estimates of active layer thickness and geometry of ice wedges. We find that the ice-wedge geometry extracted from GPR data collected during the frozen season is consistent with ERT data, and that GPR data can be used to constrain the ERT inversion. Consistent with recent studies, we also find that GPR data collected during the frozen season can provide good estimates of snow thickness, and that GPR data collected during the growing season can provide reliable estimate thaw depth. Our quantification of the value of the GPR and ERT data collected during growing and frozen seasons paves the way for coupled inversion of the datasets to improve understanding of permafrost variability.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2694447","Biological and Environmental Research; U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory(grant numbers:DE-AC02-05CH11231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927394","Arctic;electrical resistance measurement;geophysical measurements;ground penetrating radar","Ground penetrating radar;Ice;Soil;Snow;Arctic;Probes;Ecosystems","data acquisition;ecology;electrical resistivity;freezing;geomorphology;ground penetrating radar;ice;snow;soil;vegetation","Arctic soil;ground-penetrating radar;electrical resistivity tomography datasets;snow properties;soil properties;point-scale measurements;permafrost characterization;ice-wedge characteristics;growing season;frozen season;GPR data;electrical resistivity tomography information;improved GPR signal-to-noise ratio;ice-wedge geometry;ERT data;growing seasons;frozen seasons;Permafrost Properties","","17","","35","USGov","12 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we develop a new technique for unsupervised unmixing which is based on a deep autoencoder network (DAEN). Our newly developed DAEN consists of two parts. The first part of the network adopts stacked autoencoders (SAEs) to learn spectral signatures, so as to generate a good initialization for the unmixing process. In the second part of the network, a variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to perform blind source separation, aimed at obtaining the endmember signatures and abundance fractions simultaneously. By taking advantage from the SAEs, the robustness of the proposed approach is remarkable as it can unmix data sets with outliers and low signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the multihidden layers of the VAE ensure the required constraints (nonnegativity and sum-to-one) when estimating the abundances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using both synthetic and real hyperspectral data.

An original MPF retrieval is based on gradient ratio (GR), defined as the normalized difference between the 6.9 GHz horizontal (H) channel and the 89.0 GHz vertical channel GR(6/89) of AMSR-E. However, using the coarsest spatial resolution 6.9 GHz channel includes potential land contamination in  $T_{\mathrm {B}}$  in regions of narrow waterways such as the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA). This letter aims to provide a higher resolution MPF product, derived by using 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz  $T_{\mathrm {B}}\text{s}$  at H-polarization instead of the 6.9 GHz  $T_{\mathrm {B}}$  H-polarization in the GR calculation.

Our results suggest that the GR(10/89) and (18/89) MPF retrievals are available at a product quality similar to the original GR(6/89)-based MPF retrieval.

The relative performance of a set of features derived from quad-polarization versus hybrid-polarity (HP) modes in detection of various types of slicks as they evolve on a high wind driven sea surface is evaluated. It is shown that the HP mode is comparable with the full-polarimetric mode in its ability to distinguish the various slicks from open water (OW) for challenging conditions of high winds (9-12 m/s), small release volumes (0.2-0.5 m3), and during the period 0-9 h following release. The features that contain the cross-polarization component are better for distinguishing the various slicks from open water at later and more developed stages. Although these features are not available in the HP mode, we identify alternative features to achieve similar results. In addition, a clear correlation between the results of individual features and their dependence on particular components within the two-scale Bragg scattering theory is identified. The features that show poor detectability of the oil slicks are those that are independent of the small-scale roughness, while the features resulting in good separability were dependent on several factors in the two-scale Bragg scattering model. We conclude that the HP mode is a viable alternative for SAR-based oil spill detection and monitoring that provides comparable results to those from the quad-polarimetric SAR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2690001","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) under Research Council of Norway (RCN)(grant numbers:237906); NORRUSS Program under RCN(grant numbers:233896); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911302","Hybrid polarity (HP);NORSE2015;oil spill observation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series;uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Oils;Sea surface;Feature extraction;Polarization;Time series analysis","marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar;water quality;wind","full-polarimetric SAR;hybrid-polarity SAR;Norway;AD 2015 06;uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar;quad-polarization mode;slick type detection;wind driven sea surface;open water slicks;cross-polarization component;two-scale Bragg scattering theory;small-scale roughness;SAR-based oil spill detection;SAR-based oil spill monitoring;quad-polarimetric SAR;time 0 h to 9 h","","46","","68","IEEE","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the comparative study of climate change from the three poles (Antarctic, Arctic, and the Tibetan Plateau), the lake ice phenology which is mirrored the seasonal changes of lake ice, and it is an important index for assessing the synchronization and difference of climate change. Based on passive microwave, lake ice phenology of 48 lakes from 1978 to 2017 were extracted for northern Europe, Tibetan Plateau and Mongolia Plateau. A comparative analysis of the temporal variation for the lake ice phenology shows that from 1978 to 2017, the average ice cover duration showed a shortening trend of all regions, and the Northern Europe with the most dramatic shortening. The year of 2000 may be a turning of the lake ice cover duration in three regions. Especially in the northern Tibetan Plateau where is a trend of prolonged ice cover duration after 2000, and the delay of the break-up end date plays a more important role than the advance of the freeze-up start date. For the spatial changes, the variation of lake ice cover duration in the Tibetan Plateau shows a spatially aggregate phenomenon, and both the Northern Europe and Mongolian Plateau show changes with latitude. The comparison of lake ice phenology changes of three regions can provide more basis for climate characteristics analysis or climate change research. In the future work, various remote sensing data will be comprehensively used to obtain more information on lake ice phenology in High Mountain and cold regions.

Sea ice velocities were evaluated by comparison with measurements from moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and a drifting buoy. The root-mean-square (rms) differences between the sea ice velocities obtained by HFR and the ADCPs decreased with increasing radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), implying that a high SNR was associated with accurate measurement of sea ice velocity. These results agree with previous validations of HFR ocean current observations. The sea ice pattern mapped by HFR is consistent with the simultaneous C-band microwave radar observations. In particular, the HFR captured the approach of the sea ice edge toward the coast. Sharp attenuation of the HF signal over high concentration sea ice resulted in missing and/or low-SNR data at ranges beyond the front edge of pack ice, in qualitative agreement with model estimates of attenuation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2936576","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:2011627130); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:15403008,16H02226,17310002,17540405); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1333106,61331012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8847376","Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP);coastal ocean;drifting buoy;high-frequency radar (HFR);microwave radar;remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;Sea measurements;Oceans;Velocity measurement;Spaceborne radar;Current measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;signal classification","sea ice edge;pack ice;sea ice observation;oceanographic HF radar;high-frequency ocean radar;signal processing procedure;sea ice radial velocities;raw HFR data;MUltiple SIgnal Classification algorithm;sea ice velocity;radar signal-to-noise ratio;HFR ocean current observations;sea ice pattern;C-band microwave radar observations","","2","","54","IEEE","24 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective is to characterize and quantify differences in the Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X measurements. Three scene pairs are compared in terms of data quality and signal characteristics, including statistical properties and selected multipolarization (HH, VV) parameters. The signal characteristics are also compared among low-backscatter features of various origin within the individual pairs. No viable argument for selecting one sensor above the other is identified in the data quality study. In the statistical analysis, investigation of logcumulants indicates a larger deviation from Gaussian statistics in the TerraSAR-X data compared with Radarsat-2 measurements. Log-cumulant diagrams are also shown to be a useful tool for discrimination between oil spills and a simulated biogenic slick in both sensors. Multipolarization features show enhanced slick-sea contrasts and a better discrimination between mineral oil spills and other low-backscatter features in Radarsat-2 compared with TerraSAR-X. The presence of a non-Bragg scattering component in the data is revealed for both sensors. The relative contribution of non-Bragg scattering to the total backscatter is found to be higher in the TerraSAR-X data than in the Radarsat-2 data.

Moreover, deriving such parameters by manually digging a snow pit evidently yields low area coverage. We, therefore, propose a practical solution to this problem by mounting an ultrawideband radar system onto an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to obtain information such as snowpack depth, density, and stratigraphy in order to increase personnel safety and extend coverage area. In this paper, we describe the development of radar system hardware and its mounting onto a UAV, as well as initial tests with this radar as a snow measuring device. Preliminary results from both ground and airborne testing show that the radar system is capable of obtaining snow depth information that corresponds well to in situ validation data with a correlation of 0.87. The radar system also works well while mounted on a UAV platform with little additional signal noise from vibrational and translatory movements.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2019.2893043","Center for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) partners; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:237906); ESA Prodex Project DebriSAR(grant numbers:C4000122520); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8641294","Snow;stratigraphy;ultrawideband (UWB) radar;unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","Snow;Ultra wideband radar;Sea measurements;Radar antennas;Receiving antennas;Spirals","autonomous aerial vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;sea ice;snow","drone-mounted ultrawideband radar;snowpack properties;snowpack parameters;snow cover;sea ice;high-risk task;snow pit;ultrawideband radar system;unmanned aerial vehicle;snowpack depth;radar system hardware;snow measuring device;airborne testing show;snow depth information;UAV platform","","35","","34","IEEE","13 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this, we use quad-polarimetric SAR scenes from Radarsat-2. Oil slicks at sea can be detected using SAR instruments, and the dual- (HH-VV) and quad-polarimetric modes can provide additional information about the characteristics of the oil. Therefore the increase in polarization dimensionality may be beneficial in a potential clean-up situation. For example, characterization could aid in separating different types of oil slicks, like mineral oil and produced water as studied here. Oil slick characterization using scattering properties can only be performed if the returned signal is well above the noise floor. To avoid misinterpretation it is important to understand how the noise impacts the measured radar signal. Most of the features investigated in this study were to a larger degree influenced by the additive noise. Further, a backscatter signal level of 10 dB above the noise floor is identified as necessary to support analysis of the scattering properties within the oil slicks without too much noise contamination of the signal.

The test session was conducted in two different urban areas in Finland in the middle of January 2019. The arctic conditions turned out to be challenging for the sensors dedicated more to areas where temperature stays relatively warm. The aim of this one-week test session was to assess performance deterioration when powdered snow, salted road, snowy ground and sun light influence reliability of the future automated driving functions. This study focuses mainly on the issues with hardware that are basic building blocks for the situation awareness software modules. Furthermore, the countermeasures such as protecting sensors and mounting positions have been proposed.The test results indicate that some sensors significantly lose performance when temperature drops to less than -10 degrees centigrade. The problem is not merely mechanical freezing of the spinning LiDAR components but properties of laser illumination may change due to temperature variation, too. Since LiDAR is an optical device, they also suffer when there is turbulent snow in front of the sensor. The turbulence looks like a noise and partially blocks the laser echoes from surrounding environment. The performance, measured by laser pulse echo count, can with some sensors drop more than 50 percent. This seriously diminishes the sensing range and furthermore, makes pattern recognition unreliable. The two other sensor types which were taken into account are stereo vision and radar. They have a role in automated driving to compensate performance degradation of LiDARs due to arctic conditions.","","978-1-7281-4914-1","10.1109/ICCP48234.2019.8959554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8959554","automated driving;LiDAR;winter;laser;urban","","freezing;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;snow;stereo image processing","LiDAR performance review;arctic weather conditions;urban areas;one-week test session;performance deterioration;situation awareness software modules;spinning LiDAR components;temperature variation;laser pulse echo count;sensor types;performance degradation;future automated driving functions","","6","","6","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The model, SICNet, adopts an encoder–decoder framework with fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and can predict the SIC (covering  $320\times224$  grids, each with a resolution of 25 km) one-week lead with high accuracy. We design a temporal–spatial attention module (TSAM) to help SICNet capture spatiotemporal dependencies from SIC sequences. The satellite-derived SIC data of 33 years (1988–2020) from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) are employed to train and test the model, 1988–2015 for training, and 2016–2020 for testing. SICNet achieves the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.67%, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.67%, and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.9784 in weekly predicting of SIC during the melting season. SICNet achieves better performance than existing deep-learning-based models. The TSAM reduced the MAE from 2.73% to 2.67%. We evaluate the model’s performance by recursively predicting, from seven- to 28-day leads. We employ the binary accuracy (BACC) metric to measure the accuracy of the predicted sea ice extent (SIE) and compare SICNet with the anomaly persistence (Persist). SICNet shows better performance than Persist with an average BACC on the 28th day of 2016–2019 over 90% (90.17%). For the 28-day lead predictions of three extreme minimum SIE in September 2007, 2012, and 2020, SICNet outperforms Persist with an average improvement of 1.84% in BACC and  $0.16 milkm^{2}$  in the SIE error.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3177600","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(grant numbers:XDA19060101,XDB42040401); Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY010102); Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Science through the CAS Programs(grant numbers:COMS2019R02Y9KY04101L); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M662452); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2006211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780401","Deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs);recursively predicting;satellite-derived sea ice concentration (SIC);SIC prediction;temporal–spatial attention","Predictive models;Numerical models;Sea ice;Arctic;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Atmospheric modeling;Oceans","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;snow","pan-Arctic;melting season;purely data-driven model;daily sea ice concentration;SICNet;fully convolutional networks;temporal-spatial attention module;satellite-derived SIC data;National Snow and Ice Data Center;mean absolute error;mean absolute percentage error;deep-learning-based models;predicted sea ice extent;encoder-decoder framework;weekly sea ice concentration prediction","","3","","46","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior studies have attempted to characterize such oil slicks, primarily through analysis of polarimetric SAR data. In this article, we factor in system noise that is added to the backscattered signal, introducing artifacts that can easily be confused with random and volume scattering. This confusion occurs when additive and/or multiplicative system noise dominates the measured backscattered signal. Polarimetric features used in this article are shown to be affected by both additive and multiplicative system noise, some more than others. This article highlights the importance of considering specifically multiplicative noise in the estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR based on additive noise should at least be above 10 dB and the SNR involving both additive and multiplicative noise should at least be above 0 dB. The SNR from TerraSAR-X (TS-X) and Radarsat-2 (RS-2) is below 0 dB for the majority of the oil slick pixels when considering both the additive and multiplicative noise, rendering these data unsuitable for any analysis of the scattering properties and characterization. These results are in contrast to the reduced impact of noise on oil slicks detected by the L-band UAVSAR system.

Existing approaches train the networks by exploiting supervised information of the change areas, which, however, is not always available. A main challenge in the unsupervised problem setting is to avoid that change pixels affect the learning of the translation function. We propose two new network architectures trained with loss functions weighted by priors that reduce the impact of change pixels on the learning objective. The change prior is derived in an unsupervised fashion from relational pixel information captured by domain-specific affinity matrices. Specifically, we use the vertex degrees associated with an absolute affinity difference matrix and demonstrate their utility in combination with cycle consistency and adversarial training. The proposed neural networks are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Moreover, the H2020 “Operational Network of Individual Observation Nodes” (ONION) project analyzed and proposed an overall EU strategy and technical guidelines to develop and implement innovative Earth Observation concepts in the time frame 2021-2027. The top priority that was identified was the Maritime Weather Forecast, and in particular the Arctic sea ice monitoring use-case. Currently, those needs have been addressed with remote sensing satellites or in-situ instruments. However, in-situ instruments often sink or crash with ice blocks. Additionally, these instruments are isolated, making challenging its deployment and the data retrieval, using LEO satellite communications (e.g. Iridium, OrbComm). This also poses a problem in terms of modularity and flexibility, since sensors rely on proprietary communication systems. This work proposes a modular and cost-effective solution to this problem applying the paradigm of the Internet of Things to this context. Particularly, Long Range (LoRa) is one of the most frequently used and efficient technologies that also ensures long ranges.

The primary objective of the mission is to quantify at high spatio-temporal resolution crucial characteristics, processes and interactions between sea ice, and other Earth system components in order to advance the understanding and prediction of climate change and its impacts on the environment and society. The objective is articulated through three key questions. 1) In a rapidly changing Arctic regime and under the resilient Antarctic sea ice trend, how will highly dynamic forcings and couplings between the various components of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere modify or influence the processes governing the characteristics of the sea ice cover (ice production, growth, deformation, and melt)? 2) What are the impacts of extreme events and feedback mechanisms on sea ice evolution? 3) What are the effects of the cryosphere behaviors, either rapidly changing or resiliently stable, on the global oceanic and atmospheric circulation and mid-latitude extreme events? To contribute answering these questions, G-TERN will measure key parameters of the sea ice, the oceans, and the atmosphere with frequent and dense coverage over polar areas, becoming a “dynamic mapper” of the ice conditions, the ice production, and the loss in multiple time and space scales, and surrounding environment. Over polar areas, the G-TERN will measure sea ice surface elevation (<10 cm precision), roughness, and polarimetry aspects at 30-km resolution and 3-days full coverage. G-TERN will implement the interferometric GNSS reflectometry concept, from a single satellite in near-polar orbit with capability for 12 simultaneous observations. Unlike currently orbiting GNSS reflectometry missions, the G-TERN uses the full GNSS available bandwidth to improve its ranging measurements. The lifetime would be 2025–2030 or optimally 2025–2035, covering key stages of the transition toward a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in summer.

The problem is highly challenging, as classes generally have high interclass and low intraclass variances. Techniques to improve urban land cover classification performance in remote sensing include fusion of data from different sensors with different data modalities. However, such techniques require all modalities to be available to the classifier in the decision-making process, i.e., at test time, as well as in training. If a data modality is missing at test time, current state-of-the-art approaches have in general no procedure available for exploiting information from these modalities. This represents a waste of potentially useful information. We propose as a remedy a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for urban land cover classification which is able to embed all available training modalities in the so-called hallucination network. The network will in effect replace missing data modalities in the test phase, enabling fusion capabilities even when data modalities are missing in testing. We demonstrate the method using two datasets consisting of optical and digital surface model (DSM) images. We simulate missing modalities by assuming that DSM images are missing during testing. Our method outperforms both standard CNNs trained only on optical images as well as an ensemble of two standard CNNs. We further evaluate the potential of our method to handle situations where only some DSM images are missing during testing. Overall, we show that we can clearly exploit training time information of the missing modality during testing.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2834961","Norwegian Research Council FRIPRO(grant numbers:239844); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8386424","Convolutional neural networks (CNN);deep learning;land cover classification;missing data modalities;remote sensing","Remote sensing;Testing;Training;Optical sensors;Machine learning;Optical imaging","convolution;decision making;feedforward neural nets;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;optical images;sensor fusion;terrain mapping","missing data modalities;deep convolutional neural networks;remote sensing;hallucination network;training time information;training modalities;intraclass variances;interclass variances;data fusion;sensors;decision-making process;classifier;CNN architecture;optical images;digital surface model images;DSM images;Urban land cover classification","","29","","36","IEEE","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this research, we will develop a method to monitor freezing and thawing of tundra lakes in Arctic region with C-band and L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, and give a strategy to evaluate the effect of climate change to Arctic land area. The method to monitor the lake ice of tundra lakes was investigated by using SAR data acquired by ers-1, ENVISAT, and ALOS. We found that the increase of backscattering coefficients with ice growth for typical floating ice in 2008 was slower than that in 1992, which was probably caused by the decrease of accumulated freezing index in 2008. We also indicated a possibility to detect the change of backscattering mechanisms for growing and thawing lake ice by using L-band fully polarimetric SAR data acquired in 2009. In our further research, we will evaluate a time series of C-band and L-band backscattering coefficients of tundra lakes in Alaska and Siberia for long period of time by using the archived and future available SAR data.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326210","lake ice;tundra lake;backscattering mechanism;scattering decomposition;ers-1;ENVISAT;ALOS/PALSAR","Ice;Lakes;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Monitoring;Scattering;L-band;Climate change","climatology;freezing;hydrological techniques;lakes;melting;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;time series","Tundra Lake monitoring;Arctic climate change;tundra lake freezing;tundra lake thawing;Arctic region;C-band synthetic aperture radar data;Arctic land area;ers-1 data;ENVISAT data;ALOS data;floating ice;AD 2008;AD 1992;accumulated freezing index;L-band fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data;AD 2009;C-band backscattering coefficient;L-band backscattering coefficient;Alaska;Siberia","","","","8","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall validation accuracy of the SwinT-based sea ice classifier is up to 0.92, which is higher than the CNN-based classifier.

In this study, two methods that are complementary in terms of identifying temporal changes within an oil slick are presented. The two methods reflect two ways of evaluating the oil slicks. The first method identifies regions within the slick that show persistently high damping ratio (the contrast between clean sea and oil intensity), using higher damping values as a proxy for increasing oil thickness. This method also weights the age of the scenes as the algorithm incorporates new images. The second method outputs the short-term drift pattern and the changes in the damping ratios and copolarization ratios between two scenes, proxies for thickness, and emulsification. Both methods can aid in identifying regions of high priority for oil recovery. Due to the simplicity of the methods, they can be adapted to time-series data from different types of sensors, e.g., optical and SAR imagery. The methods are demonstrated on three L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle SAR UAVSAR time series acquired in November 2016 over a persistent seep in the Mississippi Canyon Block 20 of the Gulf of Mexico.

However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation. The SIC network with an encoder–decoder structure and atrous convolution, is employed to accurately perform the SIC retrieval by considering the characteristics of passive microwave images in the Arctic sea ice region. Experimental results show that the proposed SR-Aided SIC estimation approach can generate accurate SIC with more detailed sea ice textures and much sharper sea ice edges. With respect to MODIS SIC products distributed in Arctic scale, the proposed model achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 5.94% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.04%, whereas the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) SIC results have three and two times greater values of RMSE and MAE.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3232533","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0603100,2021YFB3900105); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41801335,41941006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999481","Arctic sea ice concentration;convolutional neural networks;passive microwave image;super resolution","Spatial resolution;Estimation;Sea ice;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques","edge detection;geophysical image processing;image resolution;mean square error methods;microwave imaging;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","AMSR2 SR features;Arctic scale;Arctic sea ice region;Arctic-wide sea ice concentration;atrous convolution;blurring effects;coarse spatial resolution;encoder-decoder networks;encoder-decoder structure;high-frequency information;high-frequency passive microwave observations;ice-water divides;low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 images;MODIS SIC products;open water;original AMSR2 images;passive microwave data;passive microwave images;sea ice edges;sea ice textures;SIC network;SIC retrieval;spatial details;SR network;SR-Aided SIC estimation approach;super-resolution-Aided Sea Ice concentration estimation;Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice SIC results","","","","30","CCBYNCND","27 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Long-term in situ lake ice phenological records indicate that lake ice is trending toward later freeze-up, earlier breakup, and a shorter ice duration. Parallel to study of lake ice using in situ records and process-based models, satellite remote sensing can expand our understanding of lake ice change over large spatial scales. However, most remote sensing studies have focused on large lakes or short periods of time, which may not robustly represent changes over multidecadal time periods or in the much more numerous small lakes. Here, we present a random forest model, Sensitive Lake Ice Detection (SLIDE), to accurately extract ice conditions from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI images. We trained the model using a manually labeled lake ice dataset (1089 labeled areas over 995 lakes globally). Our results show that our model achieves accurate classification between ice/snow and water (accuracy: 97.8%, kappa coefficient: 95.5%). Comparing Landsat-derived ice cover with in situ ice conditions, we show that our model produces less bias, lower RMSE, and higher kappa than does the Landsat snow/ice flag from the quality assessment band. This is especially true during the transitional period surrounding the ice on and off dates reported from in situ (mean bias −7.3% from our model, −17.3% from the Landsat quality band). Our results demonstrate the feasibility of mining the rich Landsat archive to study lake ice dynamics and of better flagging ice-affected lake observations.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3088144","SWOT Project Office through a subcontract at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Caltech Jet Propulsion Lab; NSF Navigating the New Arctic (PI: A.

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900079","Arctic;Antarctic;sea ice;bistatic radar;reflectometry;numerical solution;satellite missions","Sea ice;Reflectometry;Sea measurements;Thickness measurement;Arctic;Satellites","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","snow cover;melt pond faction;bistatic reflection;melt pond water;bistatic radar reflectometry;polar sea ice;melt pond fraction measurements;Antarctic sea ice covers;reflected signals;sea ice thickness measurement;ice volume;bottom ice-water interface;free-board height;Arctic sea ice covers;sea ice behaviors;Kirchhoff simulator;numerical Maxwell model;cryospheric science issues","","3","","29","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice thickness swath charts were used as reference data for the algorithm development. The algorithm is based on the classification of 36-GHz polarization ratio (PR36) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio (GR3689H) signatures with linear discriminant analysis. We applied an atmospheric correction to the AMSR2 L1R data following established sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval algorithms. The PR36 and GR8936H signatures were adjusted to a constant air temperature (Ta) before the thin ice detection using an empirical relationship between them and Ta. The maximum thickness of detected thin ice was estimated to be 20 cm. The thin ice detection with the L1R data is conducted only when SIC ≥ 70% and Ta ≤ -5 °C to limit conditions where thick ice may be erroneously detected as thin ice. The thin ice detection algorithm was developed for the Barents and Kara Seas, but it should also be applicable for other Arctic marginal ice zones (MIZs). The daily thin ice chart was validated using an independent set of MODIS daily ice thickness charts. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice was 10% and 32% for vice versa. We demonstrate the use of the daily thin ice chart for monitoring the thin ice fraction in the Barents and Kara Seas.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2913283","Finnish Meteorological Institute; Luonnontieteiden ja Tekniikan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta(grant numbers:283034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719016","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Microwave radiometry;Ice thickness;MODIS;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;ice;microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","Kara Seas;thin ice detection;AMSR2 high-frequency Radiometer data;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 radiometer high-frequency brightness temperature;L1R swath data;ice swath charts;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ice thickness swath charts;36-GHz polarization ratio;PR36;AMSR2 L1R data;sea ice concentration retrieval algorithms;ice detection algorithm;Arctic marginal ice zones;MODIS daily ice thickness charts;ice fraction;frequency 36.0 GHz;frequency 89.0 GHz;temperature -5.0 degC;size 20.0 cm;Ta;H","","6","","59","IEEE","21 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The use of multifrequency SAR data is beneficial for sea ice characterization and classification because it combines the advantages of the frequency dependence of signal penetration depths and backscattering characteristics due to small-scale ice properties. For drifting sea ice, however, an immediate combination of image pairs acquired with a time gap is usually not possible. Such cases require to consider the effects of ice drift. In this study we investigate the possibility to compensate for sea ice drift for separation in acquisition time ranging from a few hours to several days.

This article describes the first FMS for high-latitude OTHR that merges results from the environmental monitor and spectrum monitor in real-time. The environmental monitor uses the assimilative Canadian high-arctic ionospheric model (A-CHAIM), which assimilates near-real-time data and is, to date, the most advanced ionospheric model for high-latitude regions.

In particular, one of the main challenges is to tackle the problem in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised framework for bitemporal heterogeneous CD based on the comparison of affinity matrices and image regression. First, our method quantifies the similarity of affinity matrices computed from colocated image patches in the two images. This is done to automatically identify pixels that are likely to be unchanged. With the identified pixels as pseudotraining data, we learn a transformation to map the first image to the domain of the other image and vice versa. Four regression methods are selected to carry out the transformation: Gaussian process regression, support vector regression, random forest regression (RFR), and a recently proposed kernel regression method called homogeneous pixel transformation. To evaluate the potentials and limitations of our framework and also the benefits and disadvantages of each regression method, we perform experiments on two real data sets. The results indicate that the comparison of the affinity matrices can already be considered a CD method by itself. However, image regression is shown to improve the results obtained by the previous step alone and produces accurate CD maps despite of the heterogeneity of the multitemporal input data. Notably, the RFR approach excels by achieving similar accuracy as the other methods, but with a significantly lower computational cost and with fast and robust tuning of hyperparameters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2930348","Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:251327); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798991","Affinity matrix;Gaussian process (GP);heterogeneous data;image regression;kernel smoothing;multimodal image analysis;random forest (RF);support vector machine (SVM);unsupervised change detection (CD)","Kernel;Manifolds;Sensors;Correlation;Dictionaries;Satellites;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;regression analysis;remote sensing;support vector machines","unsupervised image regression;heterogeneous change detection;heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images;unsupervised framework;bitemporal heterogeneous CD;affinity matrices;colocated image patches;Gaussian process regression;support vector regression;random forest regression;kernel regression method;homogeneous pixel transformation;CD method;multitemporal input data","","43","","55","IEEE","14 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The GCOM-W1 and Meteor-M No. 2 brightness temperature data covered the period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2016 and January 1 to December 31, 2015, respectively. The peculiarity of the proposed calibration lies in the use of biomass vegetation and soil temperature estimations from the AMSR2 and the MTVZA-GYa radiometers observations with using empirical relationships. To estimate the vegetation biomass and soil temperature were proposed calibration curves linking brightness temperatures, measured by the radiometers, with the aboveground phytomass which was estimated from MODIS NDVI data, and with soil temperature which was measured by weather stations in-situ. As a result was shown that the proposed calibration allows to retrieve soil moisture at the test sites in North Slope of Alaska with determination coefficient of 0.46-0.52 and RMSE of 0.06-0.1 cm3/cm3.

The results indicate that all three methods have strong learning capacity, however, the computed statistical measures and the visual comparisons suggest the best performance for the GPR model.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9324192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324192","Neural Network;Support Vector Machine;Gaussian Process Regression;Polarimetry;Sea Ice","Support vector machines;Machine learning;Computational modeling;Training;Sea ice;Surface roughness;Sea surface","geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","dual-pol input data;quad-pol parameters;dual-pol scene;predicted polarimetric features;machine learning methods;dual-polarimetric SAR data;functional relationship;neural network approach;kernel-methods;support vector machine;Gaussian process regression;overlapping quad-pol Radarsat-2;quad-polarimetric parameters;quad-pol output parameters;dual-pol ScanSAR Sentinel-1;Synthetic Aperture Radar;sea ice SAR scenes","","","","10","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Effects of wind, total water vapor, liquid water path, and surface temperature on the TBs are evaluated through a radiative transfer model. TBs of open ocean yield higher sensitivity to the atmospheric water due to its low emissivity, whereas that of sea ice is more influenced by the surface conditions such as temperature and ice type. The weather effects are corrected by simulating changes in TBs caused by the atmospheric water absorption/emission and wind roughened ocean surface using numerical weather prediction reanalysis data fields as atmospheric profiles. ASI2 is validated on a collection of AMSR-E observations over open water and 100% SIC. The correction significantly reduces the standard deviation and bias of SIC over open water, yet yields little change over 100% SIC.

Although they are costly to collect, data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB and can replace in situ measurements as the regression target. Thus, the amount of training data increases dramatically, and we can learn an expressive two-stage regression model for SAR backscatter intensity. We propose to model the regression function between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB with a Pix2Pix convolutional neural network for image translation that uses a ResNet-5-based cGAN architecture with the Wasserstein GAN gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) objective function.

The ocean surface is modeled as an ensemble of randomly orientated, slightly roughened, tilted facets, for which the small perturbation model is assumed to be valid under the condition of no tilt. The orientation of the random facets causes a variation in the in-plane and out-of-plane tilt angles. As the original model utilizes both the co-polarization and cross-polarization channels to determine both the dielectric and roughness characteristics simultaneously from a series of look-up tables, the model is adapted from its original form in order to estimate the roughness characteristics of the scattering surface first, before the dielectric properties are inferred. The performance of the altered scattering model is then evaluated by applying it to multiple sets of quad-polarimetric data containing verified oil slicks, acquired from oil-on-water clean-up exercises in the North Sea. Histograms of retrieved values for the modulus of the dielectric constant indicate that the model is able to invert for values similar to the actual value of 2.3, the dielectric constant of pure crude oil at the lower limit, with successively higher values being found up to values of approximately 20 at the edges of the slicks. An error evaluation is also presented and demonstrates that sources of error are related to the alteration of the model to suit co-polarimetric data and the variance of the speckle that is related to the size of the averaging window. While the results are interesting, the approach is limited to the use of only the ratio of the co-polarimetric channels, from which two unknowns are estimated.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2973724","CIRFA; CIRFA partner Total E&P Norge AS; Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016080","Dielectric properties;look-alike;oil spill;surface slick characterization;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Oils;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar;Dielectrics;Scattering;Rough surfaces","crude oil;geophysical image processing;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","co-polarimetric data;co-polarimetric channels;successively higher values;pure crude oil;retrieved values;oil-on-water clean-up exercises;verified oil slicks;quad-polarimetric data;altered scattering model;scattering surface;original form;dielectric roughness characteristics;cross-polarization channels;original model utilizes;out-of-plane tilt angles;random facets;perturbation model;tilted facets;ocean surface;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;oil slick;dielectric parameters;two-scale surface scattering model;two-scale model;Radarsat-2 data;marine surface slick dielectric properties","","5","","42","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limited forest canopy penetration of C-band SAR sensors along with the sparseness of available ground truth restricts their usefulness in traditional AGB regression models. Therefore, we propose to use AGB predictions based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a surrogate response variable for SAR data. This dramatically increases the available training data and opens for flexible regression models that capture fine-scale AGB dynamics. This becomes a sequential modeling approach, where the first regression stage has linked in situ data to ALS data and produced the AGB prediction map; we perform the subsequent stage, where this map is related to Sentinel-1 data. We develop a traditional, parametric regression model and alternative nonparametric models for this stage. The latter uses a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to translate Sentinel-1 images into ALS-based AGB prediction maps. The convolution filters in the neural networks make them contextual. We compare the sequential models to traditional, nonsequential regression models, all trained on limited AGB ground reference data. Results show that our newly proposed nonsequential Sentinel-1-based regression model performs better quantitatively than the sequential models, but achieves less sensitivity to fine-scale AGB dynamics. The contextual cGAN-based sequential models best reproduce the distribution of ALS-based AGB predictions. They also reach a lower RMSE against in situ AGB data than the parametric sequential model, indicating a potential for further development.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3179819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9788045","Aboveground biomass (AGB);airborne laser scanning (ALS);conditional adversarial generative network (cGAN);sensor fusion;Sentinel-1;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Data models;Predictive models;Forestry;Synthetic aperture radar;Estimation;Biological system modeling;Atmospheric modeling","forestry;geophysical image processing;regression analysis;remote sensing;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation;vegetation mapping","traditional regression models;nonsequential regression models;AGB ground reference data;newly proposed nonsequential Sentinel-1-based regression model;contextual cGAN-based sequential models;ALS-based AGB predictions;situ AGB data;parametric sequential model;Sentinel-1-based biomass prediction;tanzanian miombo forests;aboveground biomass estimation;miombo woodlands;Sentinel-1 data;forest canopy penetration;C-band SAR sensors;available ground truth;traditional AGB regression models;airborne laser scanning;SAR data;available training data;flexible regression models;capture fine-scale AGB dynamics;sequential modeling approach;regression stage;ALS data;AGB prediction map;parametric regression model;alternative nonparametric models;conditional generative adversarial network;Sentinel-1 images;ALS-based AGB prediction maps","","1","","98","CCBY","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We explore the suitability of C-band SAR, paying attention to two challenges soil moisture retrieval faces. First, the microtopography and the heterogeneous organic soils impart unique microwave scattering properties, even in absence of noteworthy shrub cover. Empirically, we find the polarimetric response is highly random (entropies >0.7). The randomness limits the applicability of purely polarimetric approaches to soil moisture estimation, as it causes a tailor-made decomposition to break down. For comparison, the L-band scattering response is more surfacelike, also in terms of its angular characteristics. The second challenge concerns the large spatial but small temporal variability of soil moisture observed at our site. Accordingly, the Radarsat-2 C-band backscatter has a limited dynamic range (~2 dB). However, contrary to polarimetric indicators, it shows a clear surface soil moisture signal. To account for the small dynamic range while retaining a 100-m spatial resolution, we embed an empirical time-series model in a Bayesian framework. This framework adaptively pools information from neighboring grid cells, thus increasing the precision. The retrieved soil moisture index achieves correlations of 0.3-0.5 with in situ data at 5 cm depth and, upon calibration, root-mean-square errors of <;0.04 m3m-3. As this approach is applicable to Sentinel-1 data, it can potentially provide frequent soil moisture estimates across large regions. In the long term, L-band data hold greater promise for operational retrievals.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2893908","Canadian Space Agency; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:P2EZP2_168789); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8638842","Arctic;radar polarimetry;radar remote sensing;soil moisture;soil properties;synthetic aperture radar","Soil moisture;Moisture;Synthetic aperture radar;Scattering;Backscatter;Probes","hydrological techniques;moisture;remote sensing by radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar","soil moisture information;permafrost monitoring;ecological studies;C-band SAR;challenges soil moisture retrieval faces;noteworthy shrub cover;L-band scattering response;Radarsat-2 C-band backscatter;polarimetric indicators;clear surface soil moisture signal;empirical time-series model;soil moisture index;L-band data;fine-scale sar soil moisture estimation;heterogeneous organic soils;unique microwave scattering properties;fine-scale remote-sensing;Subarctic tundra;depth 5.0 cm","","14","","46","IEEE","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We reconstructed the 3-D surfaces of the site using the structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry of the photographs taken in the surveys and differenced the heights of the two surfaces to obtain the snow depth. The snow depth estimates corresponded well with 32 manual measurements of snow depth, with R = 0.87 (p <; 0.05) and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.6 cm, the majority of which is a 6-cm systematic bias due to the vegetation rebound in the snow-off measurements. The relative depth error is 17% in the extremely dry year of sampling (i.e., 2015) and is expected to decrease for deeper snow because the absolute error of SfM is relatively static. The processed snow depth is able to capture the snow spatial variability at submeter scale. This study suggests that balloon photogrammetry is a repeatable, flexible, economical, and safe method for continuous snow depth measurement at small scales and could complement existing remote sensing platforms (e.g., aircrafts, satellites, and drones) for snow observations in open areas by providing spatial continuity, long observation time, and customizable resolution.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2953481","Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc., (CUAHSI) Pathfinder Fellowship; Ohio State University Friends of Orton Hall Scholarship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8913602","Balloon remote sensing;photogrammetry;snow","Snow;Cameras;Remote sensing;Drones;Photography;Manuals","photogrammetry;remote sensing;snow","balloon photogrammetry;continuous snow depth measurement;snow observations;spatially continuous snow depth measurements;snow covered;snow-off measurements;relative depth error;deeper snow;snow spatial variability","","2","","22","IEEE","26 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To assess the impact of SAR ice and water retrievals on the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) ice concentration analyses, we designed a set of data assimilation experiments with and without the inclusion of SAR retrievals. Our verification results suggest that the assimilation of SAR-derived retrievals considerably improves ice concentration analyses in the situations where high spatial resolution is important (e.g., near land and over small inland lakes). Furthermore, SAR retrievals are particularly useful over the areas where the Canadian Ice Service's (CIS) manually derived ice products (such as Image Analyses, daily and weekly ice charts) are not available or have limited coverage. The three-satellite RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) launched in June 2019 will significantly increase the temporal frequency of SAR data. According to the most recent CIS estimate, more than 54 000 RCM images a year will be acquired over the CIS areas of interest.

Measurement of ice-surface heights with a spatial and temporal resolution that not only allows elevation-change calculation, but also captures ice-surface morphology and its changes is required to aid in investigations of the geophysical processes associated with glacial acceleration. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System aboard NASA's future ICESat-2 Mission (launch 2017) will implement multibeam micropulse photon-counting lidar altimetry aimed at measuring ice-surface heights at 0.7-m along-track spacing. The instrument is designed to resolve spatial and temporal variability of rapidly changing glaciers and ice sheets and the Arctic sea ice. The new technology requires the development of a new mathematical algorithm for the retrieval of height information. We introduce the density-dimension algorithm (DDA) that utilizes the radial basis function to calculate a weighted density as a form of data aggregation in the photon cloud and considers density an additional dimension as an aid in autoadaptive threshold determination. The autoadaptive capability of the algorithm is necessary to separate returns from noise and signal photons under changing environmental conditions. The algorithm is evaluated using data collected with an ICESat-2 simulator instrument, the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar, over the heavily crevassed Giesecke Brær in Northwestern Greenland in summer 2015. Results demonstrate that ICESat-2 may be expected to provide ice-surface height measurements over crevassed glaciers and other complex ice surfaces.

While at open ocean conditions, the scattered signal follows the diffuse scattering model, over flat sea ice it follows the coherent scattering model. In order to measure the degree of coherence of the received waveform or DDM, a correlation with the clean Woodward Ambiguity Function (WAF) is performed. The more similar the received signal is to the WAF, the more coherent is the scattering, and consequently, the more likely a flat sea ice surface is involved. In order to assess the performance of the proposed estimator a probabilistic study based on a Bayesian approach is performed, using the OSISAF Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) maps as ground truth.

Especially, it is greater than 0.73 when the frequency is above 80 Hz. The variation law of noise spectrum levels with time is basically the same as that of wind speed. It suggests that the ocean ambient noise is significantly affected by sea surface wind and the wind-driven noise should be the main noise source during ice-free periods. The empirical probability densities and percentile distribution of noise spectrum levels from 20 Hz to 5 kHz have been given in this paper. The distribution of noise spectrum levels is relatively concentration below 160 Hz and discrete above 160 Hz. According to wind speed, different sea states are divided. The mean values of noise spectrum levels of different frequencies under different sea states are given and compared with the Knudsen’s curves. In the frequency band between 800 Hz and 5 kHz, the wind-driven noise spectrum levels decrease about 4.65 dB/octave with increasing frequency, which is slightly less than that of Wenz’s result of about 5 dB/octave.","","978-1-7281-8190-5","10.1109/COA50123.2021.9520066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520066","Chukchi Plateau;ocean ambient noise;wind-driven noise;correlation coefficient;ice-free sea area","Correlation coefficient;Sea surface;Time-frequency analysis;Wind speed;Sea state;Acoustics;Arctic","acoustic noise;oceanographic regions;underwater sound;wind","wind-driven ocean ambient noise;Chukchi Plateau;ice-free sea area;ocean ambient noise data;noise spectrum level;wind speed;sea surface wind;main noise source;ice-free periods;sea states;wind-driven noise spectrum levels;Knudsen's curves;frequency 20.0 Hz to 5.0 kHz","","","","20","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, those issues are commonly caused by multiple targets and meteorological and oceanographic phenomena, respectively. This paper proposes a segmentation-based constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) detection algorithm using truncated statistics (TS) for multilooked intensity (MLI) SAR imagery, which simultaneously addresses both issues. From our previous work, TS is a useful tool when the region of interest (ROI) is contaminated by multiple nonclutter pixels. Within each ROI confined by the reference window, the proposed scheme implements an automatic image segmentation algorithm, which performs a finite mixture model estimation with a modified expectation-maximization algorithm. Data truncation is applied here to exclude all possible statistically interfering classes, and sample modeling is based upon the truncated two-parameter gamma model. Next, CFAR detection is conducted pixel by pixel, utilizing the statistical information obtained from the segmentation process within the local reference window. The segmentation-based CFAR detection scheme is examined with real Radarsat-2 MLI SAR imagery. Compared with the conventional CFAR detection approaches, our proposal provides improved background clutter modeling and robust detection performance in nonhomogeneous clutter environments.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2506822","Norwegian Research Council; Arctic Earth Observation and Surveillance Technologies (ArcticEO); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384481","Constant false-alarm rate (CFAR);expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm;modeling;nonhomogeneous;sea clutter;segmentation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);target detection;truncated statistics (TS);Constant false-alarm rate (CFAR);expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm;modeling;nonhomogeneous;sea clutter;segmentation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);target detection;truncated statistics (TS)","Clutter;Image segmentation;Detectors;Synthetic aperture radar;Program processors;Detection algorithms;Object detection","image segmentation;object detection;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar","Radarsat-2 MLI SAR imagery;data truncation;modified expectation-maximization algorithm;finite mixture model estimation;automatic image segmentation algorithm;multiple nonclutter pixels;multilooked intensity SAR imagery;segmentation-based constant false-alarm rate detection algorithm;nonhomogeneous sea clutter environments;target detection;truncated statistics;segmentation-based CFAR detection algorithm","","53","","48","IEEE","18 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it remains uncertain how the Ku-band radar interacts with the vast range of scatterers that can be present within the satellite footprint, including sea ice with varying physical properties and multiscale roughness, snow cover, and leads. Here, we present a numerical model designed to simulate delay-Doppler synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter echoes from snow-covered sea ice, such as those detected by Cryosat-2. Backscattered echoes are simulated directly from triangular facet-based models of actual sea ice topography generated from Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper data, as well as virtual statistical models simulated artificially. We use these waveform simulations to investigate the sensitivity of SAR altimeter echoes to variations in satellite parameters (height, pitch, and roll) and sea ice properties (physical properties, roughness, and presence of water). We show that the conventional Gaussian assumption for sea ice surface roughness may be introducing significant error into the Cryosat-2 waveform retracking process. Compared to a more representative lognormal surface, an echo simulated from a Gaussian surface with rms roughness height of 0.2 m underestimates the ice freeboard by 5 cm-potentially underestimating sea ice thickness by around 50 cm. We present a set of “ideal” waveform shape parameters simulated for sea ice and leads to inform existing waveform classification techniques. This model will ultimately be used to improve retrievals of key sea ice properties, including freeboard, surface roughness, and snow depth, from SAR altimeter observations.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2889763","European Space Agency(grant numbers:ESA/4000125582/18/I-NS); European Space Agency Snow Project “STSE - Arctic+”(grant numbers:ESA/AO/1-8377/15/I-NB); SKIM Mission Science Study Project “SKIM-SciSoc”(grant numbers:ESA RFP 3-15456/18/NL/CT/gp); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625441","Numerical analysis;modeling;radar altimetry;radar scattering;sea ice;snow;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea surface;Surface topography;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea ice;Numerical models","numerical analysis;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;snow;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar","facet-based numerical model;SAR altimeter echoes;heterogeneous sea ice surfaces;pan-Arctic sea ice thickness;unprecedented spatial coverage;physical properties;multiscale roughness;snow cover;delay-Doppler synthetic aperture radar altimeter echoes;snow-covered sea ice;backscattered echoes;triangular facet-based models;actual sea ice topography;Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper data;virtual statistical models;waveform simulations;sea ice surface roughness;Cryosat-2 waveform retracking process;representative lognormal surface;Gaussian surface;ice freeboard;SAR altimeter observations;Ku-band radar;sea ice properties;waveform classification techniques","","27","","68","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The determination of the 0.° versus θ0 dependence was based on SAR image pairs acquired on ascending and descending orbits over the same sea ice area with a short time difference. The SAR noise floor was subtracted from the HV images. From the image pairs 1.1 by 1.1 km windows representing level first-year ice (LFYI) and deformed first-year ice (DFYI) were manually selected, and a linear regression was fit between the resulting 0.° and θ0 differences of the windows to estimate the slope b1 (dB/1°) between 0.° and θ0. For example, under winter condition b1 for DFYI at HHand HV-polarizations was found to be -0.24 and -0.16 dB/1°, respectively, and b1 for LFYI at HH-polarization was -0.25 dB/1°. It was not possible to determine a reliable b1 for LFYI at HV due to a contamination effect of the S-1 noise floor. The b1 values at HH compared well with previous studies. They can be used to compensate the 0.° incidence angle variation in the S-1 EW SAR images with good accuracy. The HH b1 values are applicable to other S-1 imaging modes and other C-band SAR sensors like RADARSAT-2. Unfortunately, the HV b1 values are specific to the S-1 EW mode due to the noise floor problem.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2721981","project Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes; European Union’s Horizon 2020 Program(grant numbers:64061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022896","Arctic regions;radar scattering;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Snow;Backscatter;Arctic;Sea surface","geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;phased array radar;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","incidence angle dependence;Sentinel-1 SAR imagery;Kara Sea;extra wide mode dualpolarization synthetic aperture radar imagery;sea ice area;SAR noise floor;level first-year ice;LFYI;DFYI;HH-polarization;incidence angle variation;noise floor problem;winter condition;summer melting condition;SAR image pair;HV image;sea ice backscattering coefficient;deformed first-year ice;HV-polarization;S-1 noise floor contamination effect;S-1 EW C-band SAR sensor imaging mode;RADARSAT-2;size 1.1 km;noise figure -0.25 dB;power 1.0 EW;noise figure -0.24 dB;noise figure -0.16 dB;C","","41","","41","OAPA","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Regression training is applied to the LUT to transform the dual-frequency backscatter into functions of two parameters: the scattering albedo at X-band and SWE. The background scattering is subtracted from the SnowSAR data to give the volume scattering of snow. Classification of SnowSAR data is applied to provide a priori information. Based on the obtained volume scattering and the priori information, a cost function is established to find SWE.

As a result, we investigated the ability of C-band polarimetric parameters in a controlled mesocosm to accurately identify and discriminate between oil-contaminated and uncontaminated newly formed sea ice (NI). Parameters, such as total power, copolarization ratio, copolarization correlation coefficient, and others, were derived from the normalized radar cross section and covariance matrix to characterize the temporal evolution of NI before and after oil spill events. For separation purposes, entropy ( $H$ ) and mean-alpha ( $\alpha$ ) were extracted from eigen decomposition of the coherency matrix. The  $H$  versus  $\alpha $  scatterplot revealed that a threshold classifier of 0.3- $H$  and 18°- $\alpha $  could distinguish oil-contaminated NI from its oil-free surroundings. From the temporal evolution of the polarimetric parameters, the results demonstrate that the copolarization correlation coefficient is the most reliable polarimetric parameter for oil spill detection, as it provides information on a variety of oil spill scenarios, including oil encapsulated within ice and oil spreading on top of ice. Overall, these findings will be used to support existing and future C-band polarimetric radar satellites for resolving ambiguities associated with Arctic oil spill events, particularly during freeze-up seasons.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3232083","GENICE; Research Manitoba; Canada Research Chair (CRC) Programs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998524","Arctic;discrimination;eigen decomposition;oil spill;polarimetric parameter;radar;sea ice","Oils;Ice;Sea ice;Radar polarimetry;Ice surface;Backscatter;Sea surface","entropy;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar cross-sections;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic oil spill events;C-band polarimetric parameters;C-band radar polarimetric parameters;climate-driven sea ice loss;coherency matrix;controlled mesocosm;copolarization correlation coefficient;copolarization ratio;covariance matrix;existing C-band polarimetric radar satellites;future C-band polarimetric radar satellites;increased human activity;mean-alpha;normalized radar cross section;oil spill detection;oil spill scenarios;oil spills;oil-contaminated NI;oil-free surroundings;reliable polarimetric parameter;temporal evolution;uncontaminated newly formed sea ice","","","","58","CCBY","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using the dense media radiative transfer theory, this article studies the potential effects of terrestrial snow-cover depth, density, and grain size on high-frequency channels 89 and 166 GHz of the radiometer onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) core satellite, which are commonly used to capture snowfall scattering signals. Integrating the inference across all feasible grain sizes, ranges of snowpack density and depth are identified over which snowfall scattering signatures can be time-varying and potentially obscured. Using ten years of reanalysis data, the seasonal vulnerability of snowfall retrievals to the changes in snowpack emissivity in the Northern Hemisphere is mapped in a probabilistic sense and connections are made with the uncertainties of the GPM passive microwave snowfall retrievals. It is found that among different snow classes, relatively light Arctic tundra snow in fall, with a density below 260 kg m−3, and shallow prairie snow during the winter, with a depth of less than 40 cm, can reduce the surface emissivity and obscure the snowfall passive microwave signatures. It is demonstrated that during winter, the highly vulnerable areas are over Kazakhstan and Mongolia with taiga and prairie snow. In the fall, these areas are largely over tundra and taiga snow in north of Russia and the Arctic Archipelagos as well as prairies in Canada and the Great Plains in the United States.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3184530","NASA’s Remote Sensing Theory program (RST) through Dr. Lucia Tsaoussi(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1717); NASA’s Remote Sensing Theory program (RST) through Dr. Lucia Tsaoussi(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1717); NASA’s Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) Program through Dr. Gail Skofronick-Jackson and Dr. Will McCarty(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1294); NASA’s Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science (IDS) Program through Dr. Gail Skofronick-Jackson and Dr. Will McCarty(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1294); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800938","Global PrecipitationMeasurement (GPM) satellite;passive microwave radiometry;radiative transfer theory;snow cover;snowfall retrieval","Snow;Scattering;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave radiometry;Microwave imaging;Atmospheric modeling;Satellite broadcasting","atmospheric temperature;hydrological techniques;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing;snow","dense media radiative transfer theory;high-frequency surface emissivity;snowpack physical properties;terrestrial snow-cover depth;grain size;high-frequency channels;Global Precipitation Measurement core satellite;snowfall scattering signals;feasible grain sizes;snowpack density;snowfall scattering signatures;time-varying;seasonal vulnerability;snowpack emissivity;GPM passive microwave snowfall retrievals;different snow classes;relatively light Arctic tundra snow;shallow prairie snow;snowfall passive microwave signatures;highly vulnerable areas;taiga snow;size 40.0 cm;frequency 89.0 GHz;frequency 166.0 GHz","","1","","87","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So far, AWI Snow Radar data have been derived using a 2–18-GHz ultrawideband frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar in 2017–2019. Our results show that our method in combination with thorough calibration through coherent noise removal and system response deconvolution significantly improves the quality of the radar-derived snow depth data. The validation against a 2-D grid of in situ snow depth measurements on level landfast first-year ice indicates a mean bias of only 0.86 cm between radar and ground truth. Comparison between the radar-derived snow depth estimates from different altitudes shows good consistency. We conclude that the AWI Snow Radar aboard the IceBird campaigns is able to measure the snow depth on Arctic sea ice accurately at higher spatial resolution than but consistent with the existing airborne snow radar data of NASA Operation IceBridge.

Probability of the presence of ice within 2.05 km  $\times2.05$  km areas is modeled using a form of logistic regression as a function of the difference between the wind speeds estimated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and those obtained from numerical weather prediction short-term forecasts, the spatial correlation between HH and HV backscatter signals, and the spatial standard deviation of the wind speed estimated from SAR. The resulting ice probability model was built based on thousands of SAR images and corresponding Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products covering all seasons and all Canadian and adjacent Arctic regions being monitored by CIS. Extensive verification of the proposed technique was conducted for an entire year (2013) against independent Image Analysis products and Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System ice extent products. Using a probability threshold of 0.95, 72.2% of the retrievals were classified as either ice or open water with an accuracy of 99.2% in the most clean verification scenario against Image Analysis pure ice and water data. The ability to obtain such a large number of retrievals with a very high accuracy makes it feasible to assimilate the resulting retrievals in an ice prediction system.

We recently showed how to obtain additional information from fourth-order statistics to find a unique solution to model-based polarimetric decompositions ([1]).

Next, sea ice estimates from the F17 SSMIS sensor are used as a bridge to compare AMSR-E total sea ice extent estimates in 2010 with AMSR2 total sea ice extent estimates in 2013. Based on this comparison, a further adjustment is made to a weather filter threshold used in the NT2 algorithm to minimize the total extent bias between AMSR2 and AMSR-E using a double-differencing approach. The adjustments reduced apparent bias with AMSR-E from ~200 000 km2 for the original unmodified AMSR2 Tbs to -700 and 4700 km2 for the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. These differences are within the range of previous passive microwave sea ice intercalibrations. The adjusted AMSR2 sea ice fields provide a nearly 15-year time series of sea ice change; depending on the lifetime of AMSR2 and possible follow-on sensors, AMSR2 has the potential to be part of a multidecadal record of sea ice change.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2719624","NASA; NASA AMSR2 Science Team; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972951","AMSR2;antarctic;arctic;passive microwave (PM);remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;NASA;Atmospheric modeling;Calibration;Meteorology;Sea surface;Standards","calibration;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;regression analysis;remote sensing;sea ice","AMSR2 NASA team 2 algorithm;sea ice concentration;AMSR-E slow rotation data;regression equation;AMSR2 brightness temperature;AMSR-E brightness temperature;F17 SSMIS sensor;AMSR-E total sea ice extent estimation;AD 2010;AMSR2 total sea ice extent estimation;AD 2013;weather filter threshold;NT2 algorithm;double-differencing approach;Arctic Ocean;Antarctic;microwave sea ice intercalibration;sea ice change","","14","","15","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The NASA team 2 algorithm, previously developed for the NASA advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) product suite, is adapted for operational use with the JAXA AMSR2 sensor through several enhancements. First, the algorithm is modified to process individual swaths and provide concentration from the most recent swaths instead of a 24-hour average. A latency (time since observation) field and a 24-hour concentration range (maximum-minimum) are included to provide indications of data timeliness and variability. Concentration from the Bootstrap algorithm is a secondary field to provide complementary sea ice information. A quality flag is implemented to provide information on interpolation, filtering, and other quality control steps. The AMSR2 concentration fields are compared with a different AMSR2 passive microwave product, and then validated via comparison with sea ice concentration from the Suomi visible and infrared imaging radiometer suite. This validation indicates the AMSR2 concentrations have a bias of 3.9% and an RMSE of 11.0% in the Arctic, and a bias of 4.45% and RMSE of 8.8% in the Antarctic. In most cases, the NOAA operational requirements for accuracy are met.

From September 11, 2018 to April 5, 2019 (local time), an underwater signal recorder (USR) measured ocean ambient noise in the central Bering Sea at 357 m depth for 2 min per hour, and the central Bering Sea was ice-free during the experiment. It is found that there are a large number of transient sounds in the ocean ambient noise from September to November 2018. These transient sounds are inferred as anthropogenic underwater noise, but it needs to be further studied to specify the noise sources. The correlation coefficients of noise spectrum level and sea surface wind speed are greater than 0.71 in frequencies from 160 Hz to 5 kHz. However, it is decreased rapidly with decreasing frequency when the frequency is less than 160 Hz, and it is only 0.45 at 125 Hz. During the experiment, the average sea surface wind speed is 10.7 m/s and the corresponding Beaufort wind force is about level 5 to level 6. At this wind speed, the mean value of noise spectrum level is about 70.3 dB at 1 kHz in this paper. However, it is about 66 dB in the Wenz curves. The mean value of noise spectrum level in this paper is greater than that in the Wenz curves under the same Beaufort wind force. It should be attributed to the long-time high wind speeds during the experiment, especially the wind speeds are greater than 8 m/s over 67% of the time. The sea waves will grow more fully and the wave breaking will be intensified for the long-time of high wind speeds, so the wind-driven noise spectrum levels may be increased and higher although at the same Beaufort wind force. In the frequency range of 500Hz to 5kHz and wind speed range of 4 m/s to 16 m/s, the attenuation slope of noise spectrum level with increasing frequency, and the increment of noise spectrum level with the doubling of wind speed, are also compared with Wenz's results.","","978-1-7281-8190-5","10.1109/COA50123.2021.9520047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520047","central Bering Sea;ocean ambient noise;wind-driven noise;transient sound signal;correlation coefficient","Correlation coefficient;Sea surface;Wind speed;Terrorism;Force;Sea measurements;Time measurement","acoustic noise;oceanographic regions;underwater sound;wind","noise sources;noise spectrum level;average sea surface;long-time high wind speeds;wind-driven noise spectrum levels;wind speed range;central Bering Sea;Arctic Ocean;transient sounds;anthropogenic underwater noise;underwater signal recorder;Beaufort wind force;correlation coefficients;wind speeds;frequency 160.0 Hz to 5.0 kHz","","","","15","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to find the optimal classifier-feature assembly (OCF) for sea ice classification, it is necessary to assess their performance differences. The objective of this letter is to make a recommendation for the OCF for sea ice classification using Cryosat-2 (CS-2) data. Six classifiers including convolutional neural network (CNN), Bayesian, K nearest-neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were studied. CS-2 altimeter data of November 2015 and May 2016 in the whole Arctic were used. The overall accuracy was estimated using multivalidation to evaluate the performances of individual classifiers with different feature combinations. Overall, RF achieved a mean accuracy of 89.15%, followed by Bayesian, SVM, and BPNN (~86%), outperforming the worst (CNN and KNN) by 7%. Trailing-edge width (TeW) and leading-edge width (LeW) were the most important features, and feature combination of TeW, LeW, Sigma0, maximum of the returned power waveform (MAX), and pulse peakiness (PP) was the best choice.

Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is very valuable for the observation of polar regions, and extensive work was already carried out on detection and tracking of large icebergs. However, the identification of small icebergs is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this paper, a new detector is proposed based on incoherent dual-polarization SAR images. The algorithm considers the limited extension of small icebergs, which are supposed to have a stronger cross-polarization and higher cross- over copolarization ratio compared to the surrounding sea or sea ice background. The new detector is tested with two satellite systems. First, RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric images are analyzed to evaluate the effects of high-resolution data. Subsequently, a more exhaustive analysis is carried out using dual-polarization ground-detected Sentinel-1a extra wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test areas are in the east coast of Greenland, where several icebergs have been observed. A quantitative analysis and a comparison with a detector using only the cross-polarization channel are carried out, exploiting grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology improves the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter by up to 75 times. This returns an improved probability of detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2569450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485879","Arctic;iceberg detection;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Detectors;Clutter;Scattering","oceanographic techniques;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","depolarization ratio anomaly detector;sea ice;dual-polarization SAR images;RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric images;synthetic aperture radar;Sentinel-1a images;Greenland;iceberg detection;polarimetric radar","","33","","37","IEEE","6 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SMOS data covered the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013. The method to retrieve the soil temperature was based on solving an inverse problem by minimizing the norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the BTs. The calculation of the BT was performed using a semiempirical model of radiothermal emission, which incorporated an attenuation of the microwaves in the snow pack or the canopy and a temperature-dependent multirelaxation spectral dielectric model (TD MRSDM) for an organic-rich tundra soil. The TD MRSDM was specifically designed based on laboratory measurements of the complex permittivity of the organic-rich soil samples, which were collected at the test site on the Yamal Peninsula. As a result, the values of the root-mean-square error and the determination coefficient between the retrieved and measured soil temperatures were determined to be 2.2 °C and 0.70 and 3.5 °C and 0.52, respectively, for thawed frozen soil.

Owing to the geometrical interaction between microwaves and the imaged targets, the rates at which intensities decay depend on the nature of the targets, thus rendering single-rate image correction approaches only partially successful. The decay, also known as the incidence angle effect, impacts the segmentation of wide-swath images performed on absolute intensity values. We propose to integrate the target-specific intensity decay rates into a nonstationary statistical model, for use in a fully automatic and unsupervised segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate this concept by assuming Gaussian distributed log-intensities and linear decay rates, a fitting approximation for the smooth systematic decay observed for extended flat targets. The segmentation is performed on Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2, and UAVSAR wide-swath scenes containing open water, sea ice, and oil slicks. As a result, we obtain segments connected throughout the entire incidence angle range, thus overcoming the limitations of modeling that does not account for different per-target decays. The model simplicity also allows for short execution times and presents the segmentation approach as a potential operational algorithm. In addition, we estimate the log-linear decay rates and examine their potential for a physical interpretation of the segments.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2993067","Statoil and the Arctic University of Norway; CIRFA; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103275","Image segmentation;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Surface topography;Sea surface;Image segmentation;Sea ice;Remote sensing;Backscatter;Earth","approximation theory;Gaussian distribution;image segmentation;pattern clustering;radar computing;radar imaging;signal detection;synthetic aperture radar;unsupervised learning","smooth systematic decay;extended flat targets;UAVSAR wide-swath scenes;single-rate image correction rendering;wide-swath image segmentation;fitting approximation;Sentinel-1;Radarsat-2;open water;sea ice;Gaussian distributed log-intensities;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;fully automatic segmentation algorithm;nonstationary statistical model;target-specific intensity decay rates;absolute intensity values;incidence angle effect;imaged targets;geometrical interaction;implicit intensity decay;incidence angles;signal acquisition;synthetic aperture radar systems;SAR images;clustering-based segmentation;incidence angle dependencies;log-linear decay rates;per-target decays","","8","","35","CCBY","28 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thorough experimentation with different settings of input data preprocessing as well as varying scales of motion is performed.

Contrary to previous experimental and modeling studies which have shown higher variations of  $\sigma _{\phi }$  index as compared to the  $S_{4}$  index with the propagation geometry of GPS signals, our results suggest that these higher fluctuations in  $\sigma _{\phi }$  were refractive in origin and were the result of improper detrending of the phase at high latitudes where the use of constant cutoff of 0.1 Hz is not accurate due to higher ionospheric plasma drift velocities at these latitudes.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2021.3115668","Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) provided by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation and New Brunswick Innovation Foundation; NSERC; New Brunswick Innovation Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560130","Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN);magnetic field aligned angle (MFAA);scintillation","Indexes;Global Positioning System;Azimuth;Satellite broadcasting;Receivers;Geometry;Satellites","","","","1","","29","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two Saildrones funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), SD-1036 and SD-1037, were equipped with infrared (IR) radiation pyrometers in a “unicorn” structure on the deck for the determination of the ocean sea surface skin temperature (SST $_{\mathrm {skin}}$ ).

After stringent quality control of data and eliminating measurements influenced by sea ice and precipitation, and restricting the acceptable tilt angles of the USV based on radiative transfer simulations, SSTskin can be derived to an accuracy of approximately 0.12 K. The error budget of the derived SSTskin is developed, and the largest component comes from the instrumental uncertainties, assuming that the viewing geometry is adequately determined. Thus, Saildrones equipped with these sensors could provide sufficiently accurate SSTskin retrievals for studying the physics of the thermal skin effect, in conjunction with accurate subsurface thermometer measurements, and for validating satellite-derived SSTskin fields at high latitudes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3231519","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contribution to the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) Multi-sensor Improved Sea-Surface Temperature (MISST) project, Lead PI: Dr. Chelle Gentemann, The Farallon Institute(grant numbers:80NSSC20K0768); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996427","Arctic;infrared (IR) radiometer;Saildrone;sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin)","Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;Sea measurements;Skin;Sea surface;Atmospheric measurements;Sensors","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;pyrometers;quality control;radiative transfer;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;temperature measurement;thermometers","150-day cruises;accurate subsurface thermometer measurements;Arctic Ocean;atmospheric measurements;Bering Strait;Chukchi Sea;Dutch Harbor;eliminating measurements;high latitude Sea surface skin temperatures derived;infrared radiation pyrometers;ocean sea surface skin temperature;oceanographic measurements;precipitation;radiative transfer simulations;Saildrone infrared measurements;Saildrones;satellite-derived SSTskin fields;SD-1036;SD-1037;sea ice;sufficiently accurate SSTskin retrievals;temperature 0.12 K;thermal skin effect;USV","","1","","54","CCBY","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we introduce an approach to evaluate ice roughness that can aid in routing of ice roads and assessment of spatial variability and long-term changes in trafficability. Drawing on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry, SAR interferometry (InSAR), and other remote sensing techniques, we integrated approaches into the trafficability assessment that had rarely been applied over sea ice in the past. Analysis of aerial photogrammetry obtained through structure-from-motion helped verify cm-scale accuracy of X-band InSAR-derived ridge height and link L-band polarimetric classification to specific roughness regimes. Jointly, these approaches enable a km-scale evaluation of ridge topography and cm- to m-scale roughness - both critical for the assessment of trafficability. A trafficability index was derived from such SAR data in conjunction with analysis of ice trail routing and ice use near Utqiaġvik, Alaska. The index identifies areas of reduced trafficability, associated with pressure ridges or rubble ice, and served to delineate favorable trail routes for different modes of transportation, with potential uses ranging from ice road routing to emergency evacuation. Community outreach is needed to explore how this approach could assist different ice users in reducing risk, minimizing trail or ice construction efforts, and improving safety.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2764961","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-0856867); Swedish National Space Board(grant numbers:Dnr 192/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8239599","Radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;sea ice;surface roughness;surface topography;synthetic aperture radar","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea surface;Roads","photogrammetry;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","surface roughness;ice trafficability;SAR polarimetry;transportation;ice roughness;ice roads;spatial variability;integrated approaches;trafficability assessment;X-band InSAR;trafficability index;SAR data;ice trail routing;ice use;reduced trafficability;rubble ice;ice road routing;traversing sea ice;SAR interferometry;Arctic landfast sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing techniques;aerial photogrammetry analysis","","12","","95","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The sea-ice statistics given by the floe size distribution, being an important parameter for climate and wave- and structure-ice analysis, is challenging to calculate due to difficulties in ice floe identification, particularly the separation of seemingly connected ice floes. In this paper, the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake algorithm is applied to solve this problem. To evolve the GVF snake algorithm automatically, an initialization based on the distance transform is proposed to detect individual ice floes, and the morphological cleaning is afterward applied to smoothen the shape of each identified ice floe. Based on the identification result, the image is separated into four different layers: ice floes, brash pieces, slush, and water. This makes it further possible to present a color map of the ice floes and brash pieces based on sizes, and the corresponding ice floe size distribution histogram. The proposed algorithm yields an acceptable identification result, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in a case study.

Different approaches are analyzed to optimize both selection criteria in terms of pixels' quantity and density and finally their results are quantitatively compared. Experimental results with exploiting quad-pol UAVSAR data set over an urban area in CA, provide the expected improvement. Comparing the number of PSs between quad-pol with dual-pol and single-pol cases illustrate remarkable improvement in both selection criteria.

However, the flight stability may be impacted by the nonlinear motion of the GPR. Minimizing the motion of the suspended payload is key to obtaining a stable flight and requires an accurate estimate for the position of the payload. This study uses a Velodyne VLP-16™ Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor to measure the position of a suspended payload and an Extended Kalman filter to obtain an accurate estimate of the position of the payload.

Among the most rapid and dramatic changes are retrogressive thaw slumps. These slumps evolve by a retreat of the slump headwall during the summer months, making them detectable by comparing digital elevation models over time using the volumetric change as an indicator. Here, we present and assess a method to detect and monitor thaw slumps using time series of elevation models applied on two contrasting study areas in Northern Canada. Our two-step method is tailored to single-pass InSAR observations from the TanDEM-X satellite pair, which have been acquired since 2011. For each acquisition, we derive a digital elevation model and uncertainty estimates. In the first step, we difference digital elevation models and detect the significant elevation changes using a blob-detection algorithm. In the second step, we classify the detections into those due to thaw slumps and other causes using a simple thresholding method (accuracy: 78%), a random forest classifier (87%), and a support vector machine (86%). When our method is applied to other areas, the classifiers should be trained with data from part of the study area or with data obtained from similar areas in terms of topography, vegetation, and thaw slump characteristics to achieve the best performance. The obtained locations of thaw slumps can be used as a starting point to extract important slump properties, such as the headwall height and the volumetric change, which are currently not available on regional scales.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3000648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9110800","Abrupt thaw;banks island;digital elevation model (DEM) differencing;DEM generation;interferometry;Mackenzie river delta;permafrost;remote sensing;retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs);single-pass radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);thermokarst","Satellites;Vegetation mapping;Digital elevation models;Ice;Remote sensing;Synthetic aperture radar","digital elevation models;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;glaciology;ice;image classification;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;topography (Earth);vegetation","vegetation;support vector machine;random forest classifier;northern Canada;terrain-altering thermokarst;simple thresholding method;blob-detection algorithm;digital elevation model;TanDEM-X satellite pair;single-pass InSAR observations;slump headwall;Arctic host ice-rich permafrost;single-pass TanDEM-X observations;retrogressive thaw slumps","","12","","65","CCBY","8 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results reveal strong spatial and spectral variations that correlate well with the physical properties of the surface encountered along the flight path, which started over ocean, then passed the rock near the coast, and then up onto the ablation, wet, percolation, and dry snow zones of the interior ice sheet. In particular, strong spectral responses in percolation and dry snow zones are observed and plausibly explained by varying the distribution of horizontal density layers and isolated icy bodies in the upper portion of the firn.

An analysis of weather events was performed using multisensor satellite measurements, the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), and Arctic System Reanalysis, version 2 (ASR2). The CFSv2 data showed that the most intense cold advection occurred at the 1000-900 hPa boundary layer. It was shown that CAO had been developing from November 30 to December 6 and was accompanied by the sea surface wind speed exceeding 20 m/s and rapid formation and drift of sea ice. Analysis of the sea ice response to the CAO showed fast freezing of the Chukchi Sea for seven days indicating excessive heat loss of the water basin. In addition, significant increase in the open and very open ice areas was observed. These areas could be exposed to excessive cold atmosphere, releasing heat into the atmosphere. PL events have been identified during intensive mesocyclogenesis over the sea during 15-17 November. Weather conditions were characterized by the values of wind speed reaching 15-17 m/s and dry air with total water vapor content (5-7 kg/m2). Analysis of the synthetic aperture radar image revealed the position and horizontal size of the meso-α-cyclone, the fine structure of the mesoscale frontal system of the PL forming meso-γ-vortices, and the wave-like line of the horizontal wind shear in the local convergence zone. The representation of PL events in sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed fields from the ASR2 and CFSv2 datasets was ambiguous. However, the satellite-based and CFSv2 wind speeds better agreed for high-wind conditions.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2934749","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:17-77-20112,AAAA-A17-117030110037-8); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816674","Arctic;Chukchi Sea;cold-air outbreak (CAO);combined active/passive microwave;polar low (PL);sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Arctic;Wind speed","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric pressure;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;sea ice;storms;synthetic aperture radar;weather forecasting;wind","ASR2;CFSv2 datasets;Chukchi Sea;cold-air outbreak;mesocyclone case studies;satellite multisensor measurements;reanalysis datasets;polar low events;low sea ice extent;weather events;multisensor satellite measurements;NCEP Climate Forecast System;Arctic System Reanalysis;CFSv2 data;intense cold advection;sea surface wind speed;sea ice response;excessive heat loss;very open ice areas;excessive cold atmosphere;PL events;weather conditions;dry air;mesoscale frontal system;sea level pressure;near-surface wind speed fields;marine weather systems;boundary layer;November-December period;CFSv2 wind speeds;velocity 20.0 m/s;pressure 900.0 hPa to 1000.0 hPa;velocity 15.0 m/s to 17.0 m/s","","2","","39","IEEE","27 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the high sensitivity of the C-band signal to vegetation, estimating the soil freeze/thaw (F/T) state directly from the measured backscatter is not feasible over dense vegetation, such as boreal forests. The presented method is based on applying a simple zeroth-order model to estimate the contribution of the ground and the forest canopy on the observed total backscatter. The retrieved ground and canopy backscatter values were compared with in situ information on soil F/T state. By using a linear least sum of square errors classification algorithm, the retrieved ground and canopy backscatter values representing frozen and thawed ground were successfully separated. The method was tested for various soil types and incidence angles. For soil types with higher water holding capacities and lower infiltration rates such as fine Haplic Podzol and Umbric Gleysol, the estimation accuracy of the F/T state was over 97%, whereas for drier, well-drained soil types such as Haplic Arenosol and Coarse Haplic Podzol it was over 94%. Estimation accuracy slightly increased with higher incidence angle. The method is not feasible in rocky terrain due to very low water content, or in wet snow conditions due to lack of penetration of the C-band SAR signal through wet snow. With low ancillary data and computational requirements, the proposed method is applicable for continuous near real-time monitoring of soil F/T state.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2864635","European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000118400/16/NL/FF/gp); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:285630); Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence in Atmospheric Science(grant numbers:118780); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466795","Radar remote sensing;soil;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Soil;Backscatter;Forestry;Sensors;Snow;Synthetic aperture radar;Microwave imaging","backscatter;forestry;freezing;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing by radar;snow;soil;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation","soil frost detection;northern boreal forest region;C-band synthetic aperture radar data;C-band signal;boreal forests;simple zeroth-order model;forest canopy;canopy backscatter values;square errors classification algorithm;thawed ground;well-drained soil types;C-band SAR signal;soil freeze-thaw state;vegetation;soil F-T state;Haplic Podzol;Umbric Gleysol;wet snow condition;wet snow condition","","11","","55","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to predict sea ice motion for several days in the future, given only a series of past motion observations. The proposed approach consists of an encoder-decoder network with convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) units. Optical flow is calculated from satellite passive microwave and scatterometer daily images covering the entire Arctic and used in the network. The network proves able to learn long-time dependencies within the motion time series, whereas its convolutional structure effectively captures spatial correlations among neighboring motion vectors. The approach is unsupervised and end-to-end trainable, requiring no manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in predicting sea ice motion of up to 10 days in the future, outperforming previous deep learning networks and being a promising alternative or complementary approach to resource-demanding numerical prediction methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2909057","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141310450); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1400802); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8701505","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observing System (AMSR-E);Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT);AMSR2;Arctic sea ice;convLSTM;deep neural networks;drift prediction;optical flow;recurrent neural networks (RNNs)","Sea ice;Predictive models;Arctic;Data models;Atmospheric modeling;Numerical models;Microwave radiometry","geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);oceanographic regions;recurrent neural nets;sea ice;time series;vectors","sea ice motion prediction;motion observations;motion time series;convolutional long short-term memory networks;human activities;deep learning approach;motion vectors","","19","","74","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm is based on physical modeling of the brightness temperature (BT) of the upwelling radiation of the atmosphere — ocean system. The brightness temperature inversion is carried out with Neural Networks (NNs), trained on an ensemble of BTs, calculated using the data set of the atmospheric and oceanic parameters, governing passive microwave radiation of the atmosphere — ocean system. The improvement in the WVC retrieval is associated with the usage of the new ocean emissivity empirical model and exclusion of vertically polarized BT from the NNs inputs. The new model was incorporated into BT geophysical model and a new set of NNs coefficients was obtained for WVC algorithm. Though the results of the numerical experiment demonstrate higher retrieval accuracy for the old version of the NN model, real-valued validation with Global Positioning System WVC shows better performance of the new NN model with excluded vertically polarized measurements from NN inputs.

In this paper, the measured underwater noise data over a year period from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019 (local time) in the Chukchi Plateau are presented and discussed to study the monthly and seasonal statistical characteristics of underwater noise. Due to the transient sound signals generated by sea-ice activities, the underwater noise spectrum levels have a greater fluctuation during ice-cover period, and there are a large number of discrete values in the upper part of the empirical probability density diagram of noise spectrum level, which have deviated from the main distribution areas of noise spectrum level. For temperature increasing and ice-melting, the ice concentration decreases rapidly with time in summer, and the sea surface of Chukchi Plateau is in ice-free conditions for a few months. During the open-water conditions, the underwater noise of Chukchi Plateau should be dominated by wind-generated noise and it is almost unaffected by transient sounds, therefore, there are few discrete values which can be discovered on the empirical probability density diagram of noise spectrum level. The mean and median values of noise spectrum levels of the four seasons have been studied and compared. The spring reaches the lowest level in mean and median values for the gradually rising temperature and lower wind speed, and it is considered to be the quietest season in a year in Arctic Ocean, which is in agreement with the view of Sagers and Ballard. The attenuation trends of the mean and median values with the increasing frequency in summer are different from that of the other three seasons. The other three seasons exhibit a steeper attenuation slope than summer. The median values of noise spectrum levels measured in this paper demonstrate a higher attenuation slope compared with the results of Sagers and Ballard. The measured underwater noise is dominated by wind-generated noise in summer, therefore, the attenuation law of median values with the increasing frequency in summer is compared with that of Wenz. The noise spectrum levels decrease 4 dB/octave with the increasing frequency between 630 Hz and 2 kHz in this paper, and the result of Wenz is approximately decreasing 5 dB/octave.","","978-1-7281-8190-5","10.1109/COA50123.2021.9519949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519949","underwater noise;transient sound signals;statistical characteristics;ice concentration;Chukchi Plateau","Temperature measurement;Sea surface;Wind speed;Sea measurements;Attenuation;Market research;Noise measurement","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;sea ice;underwater sound;wind","wind-generated noise;empirical probability density diagram;mean values;median values;Chukchi Plateau;sea ice concentration;sea surface temperature;wind speed;measured underwater noise data;monthly characteristics;seasonal statistical characteristics;underwater noise spectrum levels;AD 2018 10 01 to 2019 09 30;transient sound signals;ice-cover period;ice-melting;ice-free conditions;Arctic Ocean;frequency 630.0 Hz to 2.0 kHz","","","","23","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, DNNs require a large amount of labeled data for training which often have limited availability in ecological studies. Up-to-date classification of vegetation in sensitive Arctic ecosystems continue to be a challenge. In an ecosystem undergoing rapid change, capturing the dynamics of vegetation requires the existing maps of vegetation (such as Alaska Existing Vegetation Type (AKEVT), circa 2000) to be updated based on frequent field based observation of vegetation. A method is needed to transfer the knowledge gained from field-collected observations to a larger area using DNNs. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on another similar task. This paper seeks to train DNNs using field-collected observations and apply transfer learning to apply the knowledge gained to update existing vegetation map at larger scale. We test two DNN methods, (1) a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and (2) siamese MLP network that uses a structure to rank similarity between inputs and can be used for training datasets with few samples and show good performance with limited datasets (e.g. few-shot learning). The results show ~90% accuracy (using the field observations for evaluation) when transfer learning is applied to a siamese network, compared to ~45% accurate when a MLP is trained on the AKEVT and evaluated on the field observations. The approach show promise for improving and update the existing vegetation maps over large areas using limited field-based observations.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-4896-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2019.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955556","transfer learning, deep learning, vegetation classification, Arctic","Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Arctic;Training;Task analysis;Neural networks;Biological system modeling","ecology;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;neural nets;vegetation mapping","large area classification;field-based observations;MLP network;deep multilayer perceptron model;vegetation map;machine learning;sensitive Arctic ecosystems;Up-to-date classification;supervised learning algorithms;DNN;Deep Neural Networks;Electro-Optical datasets;field-based measurements;Deep transfer learning","","","","29","USGov","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although passive microwave data are processed automatically, it suffers from poor spatial resolution and the higher frequency channels are sensitive to weather conditions. Deep learning has demonstrated its ability to perform complex and accurate analysis of images; here, we apply deep learning to estimate ice concentration from SAR scenes. We developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts SIC from SAR, trained upon passive microwave data. The model achieves a 5.24%/7.87% error on its train and test set, respectively. To assess the real-world applicability, we performed an independent validation on 18 SAR scenes (from two distinct geographical regions), not previously seen during training or test. Comparing against human-generated ice analysis charts, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2059, competitive with passive microwave (EL1 = 0.1863) for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. For the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2653, significantly better than the passive microwave result (EL1 = 0.3593). By using novel techniques for model training, as well as training entirely upon passive microwave data, we present an accessible and robust method of developing similar systems for processing SAR.1 Our results suggest that with further postprocessing, CNNs are accurate and robust enough to be used for operational tasks.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2892723","Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636521","Image processing;neural networks;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits;Silicon carbide;Sea ice","geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice concentration;training convolutional neural networks;passive microwave data;passive microwave sensors;deep learning;deep convolutional neural network;human-generated ice analysis charts;processing SAR;SAR scenes;weather conditions;Canadian Arctic Archipelago;Gulf of Saint Lawrence region","","25","","37","IEEE","6 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Atmospheric parameters derived from SMRs are highly dependent on the number of detected meteors and the accuracy of the meteors' locations. Recently, incoherent and coherent multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar approaches combined with waveform diversity have been proposed to increase the number of detected meteors and to improve time, altitude, and horizontal resolution of the estimated wind fields. The incoherent MIMO approach refers to the addition of new transmit sites (widely separated), whereas the coherent MIMO refers to the addition of new transmit antennas in the same site (closely separated). In both the cases, a different pseudorandom sequence is transmitted from each antenna element. Unfortunately, the addition of new transmit antennas with different code sequences degrades the performance of conventional signal recovery algorithms. This is a consequence of the cross-interference between the transmitted waveforms, making it worse as the number of transmitters increases. In this article, we propose a signal recovery approach based on compressed sensing, taking advantage of the sparse nature of specular meteor echoes. The approach allows the exact recovery of weak echoes even in interference environments. Besides the advantage of the proposed approach to recover the meteor signal, we discuss the optimal selection of the transmitted waveforms and the minimum code length required for exact recovery. Additionally, we propose a modification of the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm used in sparse problems to make it applicable in real-time analysis of large data. The success of the proposed approach is corroborated using Monte Carlo simulations and real data from a multi-static spread spectrum meteor radar network installed in northern Germany.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2931375","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:SPP 1788 (CoSIP)-CH1482/3-1); Leibniz-Gemeinschaft(grant numbers:SAW-2015-IAP-1); International Team, International Space Science Institute, Bern, Switzerland; NSF Major Research Infrastructure(grant numbers:AGS-1626041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802292","Compressed sensing (CS);mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT);multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar;orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP);sparse recovery;specular meteor radar (SMR);spread-spectrum;waveform diversity","Radar antennas;MIMO communication;MIMO radar;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Sensors","compressed sensing;diversity reception;echo;encoding;iterative methods;mesosphere;meteorological radar;MIMO radar;radiofrequency interference;spread spectrum radar;thermosphere","sparse signal recovery;MIMO specular meteor radars;waveform diversity;specular meteor echoes;sparse problems;multistatic spread spectrum meteor radar network;mesosphere dynamics;lower thermosphere dynamics;MLT dynamics;coherent multiple-input-multiple-output radar;incoherent multiple-input-multiple-output radar;incoherent MIMO radar;coherent MIMO radar;pseudorandom sequence;cross-interference;compressed sensing;minimum code length;Monte Carlo simulations;orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm","","12","","46","EU","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fulfill this promise, we must understand laser sea state bias (SSB). SSB occurs in the measurement of sea surface height in the presence of waves when the altimeter observations are preferentially influenced by particular parts (e.g., wave troughs) of the wave-covered surface. Radar altimeters have received considerable attention relating radar SSB to wave properties and wind speed. Comparatively, little attention has been devoted to the SSB of laser altimeters, and the studies of laser SSB which have been done have led to indeterminate or ambiguous results even as to sign. Here, we find that to make changes in satellite dynamic ocean topography (DOT) from the Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) period, 2004-2009, to the CryoSat-2 period, 2011-2015, consistent with hydrography plus ocean bottom pressure in the subarctic Greenland and Norwegian seas, we need to correct the ICESat DOT for SSB.

The SMOS data covered the period from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011. Retrieval of the temperature profiles in a frozen topsoil was based on the semiempirical emission model L-MEB and the temperature-dependent dielectric model for an organic-rich tundra soil. The soil samples measured to develop the dielectric model were collected at the TFS site. For winter seasons, the retrieved temperature profiles in the 16.0-cm topsoil were validated relative to the temperature profiles measured in situ. As a result, the values of root-mean-square error and determination coefficient of the temperatures retrieved at the depths of 0.6, 8.7, and 16.0 cm, relative to the respective temperatures measured in situ, were found to be 2.8 °C, 4.9 °C, and 6.4 °C and 0.62, 0.42, and 0.26, respectively.

We combined the ascending and descending DDInSAR images to figure out the direction of the true displacement over the anomaly. As a result, the circular anomaly appears mainly to be a vertical movement, not in the flow direction. This vertical movement in the David Glacier, where subglacial lakes are known to exist, can be thought of as a signal of water level change of a subglacial lake forming a subglacial channel system.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900509","DDInSAR;Subglaical lake;David Glacier","Lakes;Antarctica;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites;Ice;Optical interferometry","geophysical image processing;glaciology;lakes;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","David Glacier;flow velocity;East Antarctica;Sentinel-1A;slow-flowing area;double-differential InSAR technique;circular shaped velocity anomaly;ascending descending DDInSAR images;vertical movement;flow direction;subglacial lakes;subglacial channel system","","","","6","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Long-term ground-based remote sensing measurements and the ozonesonde program at Summit Station, Greenland, provide an opportunity to create a unique framework to retrieve atmospheric ozone using observationally based prior information in the Arctic. This study investigates the potential of using the ground-based polar atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (P-AERI) to estimate ozone below 10 km. Downlooking or limb-viewing sensors, such as those from satellites, have limited sensitivity to the lower atmosphere; however, uplooking, ground-based instruments provide complementary information to satellite observations to improve trace gas estimates at lower atmospheric levels. Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application, version 2 (MERRA-2) is a reanalysis product that integrates satellite information but also inherits their higher uncertainties at lower atmospheric levels. An observation-based climatology of the uncertainty in the MERRA-2 ozone dataset is estimated using ozonesondes launched at Summit Station. MERRA-2 shows high accuracy in the middle stratosphere but larger uncertainties below 10 km. Retrievals that use spectral radiance measurements from the P-AERI improve the estimates of ozone concentrations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere by using prior information from MERRA-2 and our climatology of MERRA-2 uncertainties as the covariance of the prior. Using ozonesonde observations from 2012 to 2017 at Summit Station, Greenland, the quality of the retrieved results is assessed. Comparisons show that retrieved partial columns reduce the bias of MERRA-2 ozone estimation below 10 km, and the average tropospheric ozone concentration is improved significantly.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3180626","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:PLR-1420932,PLR-1414314,NNA-1801764); National Center for Atmospheric Research; NSF(grant numbers:1755088); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9789100","Atmospheric measurements;infrared radiometry;remote sensing","Gases;Uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Clouds;Measurement uncertainty;Instruments;Standards","atmospheric composition;atmospheric optics;atmospheric spectra;atmospheric techniques;climatology;Fourier transform infrared spectra;ozone;remote sensing;stratosphere;troposphere","troposphere;MERRA-2 uncertainties;ozonesonde observations;Summit Station;Greenland;retrieved partial columns;MERRA-2 ozone estimation;average tropospheric ozone concentration;ozone retrievals;FTIR observations;geophysical parameters;long-term ground-based remote sensing measurements;ozonesonde program;atmospheric ozone;observationally based prior information;ground-based polar atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer;limb-viewing sensors;lower atmosphere;uplooking ground-based instruments;complementary information;satellite observations;trace gas estimates;lower atmospheric levels;Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis;satellite information;observation-based climatology;MERRA-2 ozone dataset;larger uncertainties;spectral radiance measurements;ozone concentrations;size 10.0 km;O3","","","","81","IEEE","6 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results suggest that data obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system (AMSR-E) underestimate SICs by 19%. We performed step-by-step comparisons among the aerial image, moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and AMSR-E SIC. These types of comparisons have not been made in previous validation studies. First, SICs acquired from MODIS-Terra imagery were acquired using a tie-point method and corrected by SICs derived from the aerial photography. Second, SICs of MODIS-Aqua images were trained based on the consistency of SIC results between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the selected region on the same day. Finally, the MODIS-Aqua SICs were employed to validate synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products. The results show that the AMSR-E products underestimate SICs by 8.5% in the marginal ice zone in comparison with MODIS SICs. According to our further analysis between sea-ice types and AMSR-E biases, the higher the proportion of first-year ice, the smaller the AMSR-E SIC bias. In other words, results suggest that the higher the thin ice proportion, the more the AMSR-E underestimates the SIC.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2989037","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFC1402704,2018YFA0605703); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096529","Aerial imagery;AMSR-E (advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system) data;step-by-step validation;sea-ice concentration (SIC)","Silicon carbide;Sea ice;MODIS;Microwave radiometry;Antarctica;Spatial resolution","oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","sea-ice concentration data;high-resolution sea-ice aerial image;earth-observing system underestimate SICs;step-by-step comparisons;moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer;MODIS-Terra imagery;MODIS-Aqua images;SIC results;MODIS-Aqua SICs;synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products;MODIS SICs;sea-ice types;step-by-step validation;Antarctic ASI AMSR-E;remote-sensing-data product validation;arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study;AD 2011 01;advanced microwave scanning radiometer;earth-observing system;aerial photography","","9","","48","CCBY","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The small number of available samples usually limits the performance in classification. Inspiring by the transfer learning method, the training samples are augmented with simulated sea ice images. Considering the distribution characteristic of sea ice scene, simulation samples are synthesized by algebraic operations on the respective regions of interest from two true samples. One of the two true samples can be an additional image, which is more easily collected than others, such as full ice and snow. Simultaneously, it introduces new information. Generalization and error-correction capability of deep neural networks for training samples make the proposed method feasible.

Only winter periods (October-May) were investigated. Maximum ice speed of 81.7 cm/s to SW was detected at 80°N 0°W between November22 and 23, 2013. At 79°N between 7° and 5°W, sea ice speed vectors were mostly directed to S-SW but reversed to the north for short periods. Using ERA-Interim atmospheric data, the southward component of the ice speed (max. +71.7, min. -30.9 cm/s) was correlated (R = 0.93) to the cross-strait sea level pressure gradient. Ice speeds due to the EGC were obtained by subtracting the wind-induced ice speed component estimated by linear regression. Results for winter 2013-2014 show that the mean southward component of the EGC (9.4 cm/s, σ = 3.0) accounted more than half of the mean sea ice speed (17.7 cm/s, σ = 7.2). The EGC oscillated between 5 and 15 cm/s and sustained the southward ice export during short periods when the wind reversed to north. Satellite-based measurements of the surface EGC are the complement to hydrographic measurements in Fram Strait, but further investigation is required to understand how the apparent variability of the current is influenced by the thickness of the ice transiting in the strait or by wind induced north-to-south oscillations of the sea surface in the strait.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2529847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422703","Arctic sea ice export;COSMO-SkyMed;East Greenland current (EGC);EGC background current;Fram Strait","Random access memory;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic","geophysical image processing;gradient methods;marine radar;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;wind","east Greenland current;COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR image;AD 2013 03 to 2014 12;western Fram strait;maximum ice speed;ERA-interim atmospheric data;southward ice speed component;cross-strait sea level pressure gradient;wind-induced ice speed component;mean sea ice speed;EGC oscillation;hydrographic measurement;sea surface north-to-south oscillations","","","","32","IEEE","1 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can lead to structural changes in entire ecosystems, and serious, persistent environmental consequences. However, many of these changes occur in vast and poorly accessible biomes and involve myriad species. As a consequence, conventional methods of measurement and data analysis are resource-intensive, restricted in scope, and in some cases, intractable for measuring species changes in remote areas. In this article, we introduce a method for detecting flowers of tundra plant species in large data sets obtained by aerial drones, making it possible to understand ecological change at scale, in remote areas. We focus on the sedge species E. vaginatum that is dominant at the investigated tundra field site in the Canadian Arctic. Our system is a modified version of the Faster R-CNN architecture capable of real-world plant phenology analysis. Our model outperforms experienced human annotators in both detection and counting, recording much higher recall and comparable level of precision, regardless of the image quality caused by varying weather conditions during the data collection.

For example, in the arctic and some desert zones both inter- swath and inter-burst noise amplification occurs. In this paper we propose a workflow for removing the thermal noise from Sentinel-1 ground detected SAR images on low back-scattering conditions by employing the co-polarization SAR image and the Gaussian Process Regression. Our processing flow uses the noise vectors provided in the European Space Agency (ESA) ground detected product and scales them such that a slightly over-denoised image is produced. Then, the Gaussian Process Regression is used to map the co-polarization SAR image into the cross-polarization SAR image. Prior to this step, a radiometric correction is applied on the co-polarization data, since its pixel values are heavily dependent on the incidence angle. Finally, the denoised cross-polarization image is obtained as a linear combination between the over-denoised version and the predicted image. Since, the co-polarization channel is employed for the prediction of the missing values in the cross-polarization channel there is no need for co-registration and the de noising procedure is trustworthy.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883828","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883828","TOPSAR denoising;Gaussian Process Regression;cross-polarization","Visualization;Noise reduction;European Space Agency;Gaussian processes;Radiometry;Radar polarimetry;Thermal noise","Gaussian processes;image denoising;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","inter-polarization mapping;Gaussian Process Regression;Sentinel-1 EW;Sentinel-1 SAR images;thermal noise;low-back-scattering areas;desert zones both inter- swath;inter-burst noise amplification;Sentinel-1 ground;low back-scattering conditions;co-polarization SAR image;processing flow;noise vectors;European Space Agency ground;cross-polarization SAR image;co-polarization data;denoised cross-polarization image;predicted image;co-polarization channel;cross-polarization channel;noising procedure;power 1.0 EW","","","","12","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The difference of scattering centers between different polarizations can be removed by azimuth phase differentiation. It was applied to TerraSAR-X quad-pol SAR over slow drifting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The SAR measured velocity was about 1.4 km/hr (or 0.37 m/s) to 2.4 km/hr (or 0.67 m/s).

Since land surface emissivity depends primarily on the surface characteristics, it would contains valuable information about the surface, especially regarding freeze and thaw states. The surface characteristics in terms of microwave emission changes whenever water undergoes phase changes at constant temperature. This study aims to investigate the potential of using emissivity estimates from various microwave sensors such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer — Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), AMSR2, and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI). It employs data fusion techinques to construct diurnal estimates in order to accurately predicting the exact time of the freeze-thaw transition for each land cover type and region. The results reveal that emissivity difference values from low and high frequencies (such as 6.9GHz and 89GHz) at horizontal polarization have a strong correlation with ground-based soil temperature values at 5cm depth. A novel threshold-based approach specific to different land cover types is proposed for daily FT detection from the use of three years (August 2012–July 2015) of emissivity estimates at different frequencies. Ground-based soil temperature observations are used as reference to develop threshold values for FT states. Preliminary evaluation of the proposed approach with independent ground observations for the year 2015 shows that the use of land emissivity estimates for high-latitude FT detection is promising with fine temporal resolution (at least 4 times a day).","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127044","Freeze and thaw;passive microwave;land surface emissivity;land cover type","Microwave radiometry;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Temperature sensors;Microwave imaging;Soil measurements;Microwave measurement;Climate change","atmospheric techniques;freezing;hydrological techniques;land surface temperature;microwave imaging;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;soil","microwave land surface emissivity estimated;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System;fine temporal resolution freeze-thaw states;freeze-thaw transition monitoring;boreal-Arctic ecosystems;AMSR-E;Special Sensor Microwave Imager;SSM-I;AMSR2;GPM GMI;independent ground observations;AD 2012 08 to 2015 07;high-latitude FT detection;land emissivity estimates;FT states;soil temperature observations;daily FT detection;soil temperature values;high frequencies;low frequencies;emissivity difference values;land cover type;freeze-thaw transition;diurnal estimates;Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager;microwave sensors;constant temperature;phase changes;microwave emission changes;surface characteristics;climate change;carbon dynamics;biogeochemical transitions;high latitude regions;time 3.0 year;depth 5.0 cm","","","","6","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset is manually annotated to train, test and refine the method.

To improve oil spill detection capability, we used a controlled mesocosm to analyze the multipolarized C-band backscatter response of oil in newly formed sea ice (NI). Artificial sea ice was grown in two cylindrical tubs at the Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility, University of Manitoba. The sea ice physical characteristics, including surface roughness, thickness, temperature, and salinity, were measured before and after oil injection below the ice sheet. Time-series C-band radar backscatter measurements detected the differences in the sea ice evolution and oil migration to the sea ice surface in the oil-contaminated tub, which was compared to uncontaminated ice in a control tub. Immediately prior to the presence of oil on the ice surface, the copolarized backscatter is increased by 13-dB local maximum, while the cross-polarized backscatter is decreased by 9-dB. Ice physical properties suggest that the local backscatter maximum and minimum, which occurred immediately before oil migrated onto the surface, were related to a combination of brine and oil upward migration. The findings of this work provide a baseline data interpretation for oil detection in the Arctic Ocean using current and future C-band multipolarization radar satellites.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3123908","GENICE; Research Manitoba; Canada Research Chair (CRC) Programs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); University of Manitoba GETS Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591590","Arctic;detection;oil spill;radar backscatter;sea ice","Sea ice;Oils;Ice;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Backscatter;Spaceborne radar","backscatter;hydrological techniques;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;surface roughness;water pollution measurement","oil spills;climate-related sea ice loss;oil spill detection capability;artificial sea ice;Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility;sea ice physical characteristics;oil injection;ice sheet;C-band radar backscatter measurements;sea ice evolution;sea ice surface;oil-contaminated tub;uncontaminated ice;ice physical properties;local backscatter maximum;oil detection;C-band multipolarization radar satellites","","1","","53","CCBY","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is based on dielectric measurements of three typical soils (sandy loam, silt loam, and silty clay) collected in the Yamal peninsular. The refractive mixing model was applied to fit the data aggregates consisting of measured complex refractive indexes (CRI) for the three soils as a function of soil moisture at a fixed temperature. As a result, there were derived the parameters of the refractive mixing dielectric model as a function of temperature and texture. These parameters involve the maximum allowed gravimetric fraction of bound water and the CRIs of soil solids, bound soil water, and free soil water components, the latter being represented by capillary ice. The error of the dielectric model was evaluated by correlating the predicted complex relative permittivity (CRP) values of the soil samples with the measured ones. The coefficient of determination, R2, and the root mean square error, RMSE, were estimated to be R2 = 0.994, RMSE = 0.22 and R2 = 0.988, RMSE = 0.07 for the real and imaginary parts of the CRP, respectively. These values are on the order of the dielectric measurement error itself.

However, it can be severely distorted, particularly in the case of L-band SAR systems mainly due to a frequent occurrence of ionospheric effects in the polar region. In this study, we developed an efficient method to extract and correct the ionospheric contribution from SAR offset tracking measurements. The method exploits an iterative directional filtering approach, which is based on the pattern and directionality of ionospheric streaks. The measurement performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using three L-band advanced land observing satellite phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar pairs. Our results showed that the proposed correction achieved the improved measurement accuracies from 4.68-23.88 to 1.03-1.51 m/yr. It means that the accuracies of corrected measurements were about 5-16 times better than those of the original measurements. From the results, we concluded that our correction technique is highly suitable for the precise measurement of the glacier displacements even in the presence of strong ionospheric effects. Using the proposed method, the variations of glacier velocities were measured in the Vylki, Shury, and Kropotnika glaciers on Novaya Zemlya, which is located in the Russian Arctic Ocean, and the grounding zones were detected from the measurements in the Shury and Kropotnika glaciers.

In this study, we utilize complementary satellite observations to determine the pattern and order of occurrence in landscape thawing, soil moisture increase, and ecosystem productivity that collectively define the eco-hydrological spring onset across Alaska and Northern Canada. Satellite data utilized include landscape FT status from SMAP and AMSR-2, OCO-2 derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (GOSIF), and gross primary production (GPP) and soil moisture from SMAP. The resulting spring onset maps showed spring thawing as the precursor to growing season onset, indicated by a rapid rise in available soil moisture and GPP. Our results indicated an average spring transition period of $3\pm 2$ (SD) weeks between initial landscape thawing and growing season onset. A rapid increase in soil moisture generally followed landscape thawing but occurred before the subsequent seasonal rise in GPP.

The number of pixels viewed by the CNN model in the input image used to generate an output pixel, or the receptive field, is important to detect large features or physical objects such as sea ice and correctly classify them. In addition, a noise phenomenon is present in the Sentinel-1 ESA Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) v2.9 SAR data, particularly in subswath transitions, visible as long vertical lines and grained particles resembling small sea ice floes. To overcome these two challenges, we suggest adjusting the receptive field of the popular U-Net CNN architecture used for semantic segmentation. It is achieved by symmetrically adding additional blocks of convolutional, pooling and upsampling layers in the encoder and decoder of the U-Net, constituting an increase in the number of levels. This shows great improvements in the performance and in the homogeneity of predictions. Second, training models on SAR data noise-corrected with an enhanced technique has demonstrated a significant increase in model performance and enabled better predictions in uncertain regions. An eight-level U-Net trained on the alternative noise-corrected SAR data is presented to be capable of correctly predicting many ambiguous SAR signatures and increased the performance by 8.44% points compared with the regular U-Net trained on the ordinary ESA IPF v2.9 noise-corrected SAR data.

Dielectric models of topsoil are a crucial element of remote sensing retrieval algorithms that are used to obtain geophysical characteristics of the land surface, such as soil moisture, temperature, and freeze/thaw state. Contemporary radiometers and radars acting from space are functioning in the frequency range from 1.2 GHz to 89 GHz. In addition, the GPR and TDR instruments, which are used for subsurface sensing, operate in the megahertz band. Therefore, there exist a need to work out the spectroscopic dielectric models of moist soils covering both the GHz and MHz frequency ranges. A method of developing such a model is outlined in [1] and [2] in the cases of one type organic rich soil and one type mineral soil, respectively. Currently, a problem of developing such a model for an aggregate of natural soils, having varying textures should be still solved. In this paper, this problem is considered for a set of mineral arctic soils collected on Yamal peninsular. The dielectric model being developed is based on the measured dielectric data attained for 5 types of mineral soils, with clay fraction varying from 10 to 50%, soil water contents changing in the range from zero to the value of field moisture capacity, temperature ranging from -1 to -30°C, frequency bound from 0.05 to 15 GHz. The measured dielectric data were processed in accordance with the methodology given in [1] and [2]. Namely, the refractive mixing dielectric model was applied with the Debye multi-relaxation equations to fit the measurements of the soil's complex dielectric constant as a function of soil moisture and wave frequency. The spectroscopic parameters of the dielectric relaxations for the bound, transient bound, and unbound soil water components were derived as a function of temperature. Further, these temperature dependences were expressed using the respective thermodynamic parameters, providing a complete set of parameters for the temperature-dependent multi-relaxation spectroscopic dielectric model for each type of measured mineral soils. Thus, obtained spectroscopic and thermodynamic parameters were expressed as a set of empirical functions of percentages of clay contents contained in the respective soil types. Finally, the temperature and texture dependent spectroscopic dielectric model for frozen mineral soils at 0.05-15 GHz appeared to be presented as an ensemble of analytical expressions, and it provides for the values of complex dielectric constants of frozen soil using the dry soil density, clay percentage, gravimetric moisture, temperature, and wave frequency as input variables.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735742","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7735742","","Soil;Dielectrics;Temperature measurement;Minerals;Temperature dependence;Dielectric measurement;Frequency measurement","clay;ground penetrating radar;minerals;moisture;remote sensing by radar;soil","frozen mineral soil temperature;temperature-dependent spectroscopic dielectric model;texture-dependent spectroscopic dielectric model;spectroscopic dielectric topsoil model;remote sensing retrieval algorithm;land surface;soil moisture;freeze-thaw state;contemporary radiometer;radar;GPR instrument;TDR instrument;subsurface sensing;organic rich soil;natural soil;mineral arctic soil;Yamal peninsular;Russia;soil water content;refractive mixing dielectric model;Debye multirelaxation equation;wave frequency;thermodynamic parameters;multirelaxation spectroscopic dielectric model;clay content;soil type;dry soil density;clay percentage;gravimetric moisture;frequency 0.1 GHz to 15 GHz","","2","","","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This event highlighted the importance of an operational sea-ice classification map for ice routing to serve ship navigation. In this paper, unprecedented Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithms from RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were developed using the conditional random fields (CRF) approach by including multiple features from sea-ice concentration, gray-level cooccurrence matrix textures, polarization ratio, backscatter coefficients, and intensity data. Coincident RADARSAT-2 Satellite SAR datasets with five scenes were collected for ice classification into categories such as open water, thin ice, smooth first year ice, deformed first year ice, and old ice during the CHINARE-30th cruise. The effects of deformation, rafting, and ridging during the spring-summer transition period were overwhelmed by the spatial and contextual CRF models in combination with the rich features extracted for sea-ice classification. Four strategies including statistical distribution and region connection, multiple features and support vector machine (SVM) integrated into the CRF model are proposed to describe the sea-ice-type relationships among pixels. By conducting comparative experiments between the proposed methods and state-of-the-art sea-ice classification based on the SVM algorithm, the best was obtained from the SVM-based CRF (SVM-CRF) algorithm for sea-ice classification with respect to the three scenes from the Indian Ocean sector and two scenes of Pacific Ocean sectors including medium-resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 50 m and higher resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 6.25 m.

Accurately tracking sea ice motions is essential to validate or even improve sea ice models for ice hazard forecasts at a fine scale. Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a significant benefit. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved fine-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image super-resolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure.

In the first approach, concentrations are thresholded to be encoded in a standard binary fashion, and in the second approach, concentrations are used as the target probability directly. The second method leads to a significant improvement in R2 measured on the prediction of ice concentrations evaluated over the test set. The performance improves both in terms of robustness to noise and alignment with mean concentrations from ice analysts in the validation data, and an R2 value of 0.89 is achieved over the independent test set.

The focus of this paper is the fractal analysis of KOMPSAT-5 SAR images of noncoherent sea-ice textures while being decomposed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) processing. As a novel approach, fractal analysis relies on SAR sea-ice spatial backscattering data generation and time-frequency domain (TFD) formulations from the perspective of uncorrelated HMN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the extraction of the resolution profile and raw data for the reference KOMPSAT-5 SAR sea-ice image have been derived, evaluated and compared both qualitatively and quantitatively at each scale of DWT decomposition on the basis of the presence of HMN. This paper also presents a novel detailed modeling of the multiresolution probability distribution function of the HMN and its power spectral density function modeling at each scale of the decomposition. Other quality assessment techniques, such as two K-means clustering algorithms and several visualized verification methods, such as gradient vector field, advection mapping and tensor field mapping, have been implemented in this regard to investigate embedded HMN suppression and its adverse effects on the presence of pixel anomalies. As a result, as the decomposition continues, the HMN at each scale of decomposition is constantly altering from high-frequency uncorrelated anomalies to low-frequency joint spatial information within the observed 2-D data. In other words, excessive multiscale HMN suppression will result in spatial information loss that makes the DWT scale selection quite important for texture classification. The results also show that the importance of HMN suppression in SAR sea-ice images in the form of pixel anomaly decomposition for the purpose of further texture investigation should be in accordance with the spectral behavior of the HMN. The results are helpful for SAR remote sensing image restoration and data preservation when dealing with high-resolution SAR images, such as in time series analysis, sea-ice texture change detection, and polar structural mapping. The proposed approach is implemented on real KOMPSAT-5 SAR satellite sea-ice images, while fractal spatial resolution profile simulations are carried out based on the inversed equalized hybrid domain image formation algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976815","Korea Polar Research Institute(grant numbers:PE20080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016014","Discrete wavelet transform;fractal analysis;high-frequency multiplicative noise;raw data generation;synthetic aperture radar","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Fractals;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image resolution;Electromagnetics;Reflectivity","discrete wavelet transforms;fractals;geophysical image processing;image classification;image restoration;image texture;oceanographic techniques;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;time series;wavelet transforms","fractal spatial resolution profile simulations;inversed equalized hybrid domain image formation algorithm;fractal analysis;texture classification;synthetic aperture radar images;SAR sea-ice spatial backscattering data generation;time-frequency domain;DWT decomposition;advection mapping;tensor field mapping;low-frequency joint spatial information;pixel anomaly decomposition;high-resolution SAR images;time series analysis;sea-ice texture change detection;KOMPSAT-5 SAR satellite sea-ice images;multiscale HMN suppression;KOMPSAT-5 SAR sea-ice image;transform-domain image decomposition;high-frequency multiplicative noise;discrete wavelet transform;power spectral density function modeling;K-means clustering algorithms;gradient vector field;SAR remote sensing image restoration","","17","","43","CCBY","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article presents nonparametric array manifold calibration for a multichannel ice-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sounder used for imaging subglacial morphology with parametric angle estimation in tomography. In this study, we outline a methodology for identifying scatterers at known angles from multichannel imagery by aligning our measurements to an independent fine-resolution satellite-derived digital elevation model of the Arctic that extends beyond the swath of the SAR. We adopt a support statistic based on our partial knowledge of the array response to identify approximately single-source measurements in our scenes. This technique is a departure from traditional approaches to the sounder array characterization problem that require measurements of flat, specular surface reflections from a maneuvering platform.

Accurate electron density models are required for the purpose of improving OTHR performance and for system planning and design. This is particularly true in the polar regions where large-scale electron density structures taking the form of patches and arcs of enhanced electron density are the common features of the F-region ionosphere.

It aims to better interpret synthetic aperture radar backscattering relationships to soil moisture. Coincident with RADARSAT-2 overpasses, soil and crop parameters were measured in July 2008 and August 2009 over two Canadian agricultural sites (Kenaston, Saskatchewan, and Lennoxville, Quέbec). The measured soil moisture was used to determine the theoretical semivariogram models that fit the experimental semivariograms. An inverse correlation is obtained between the soil moisture coefficient of variation (CV) and the range (spatial correlation) of the semivariogram, which can assess the degree of the spatial correlation between the samples of each field. Soil moisture measurements with high values of CV (20%-40%) are correlated within a distance less than 10 m and those with lower CV (10%-20%) are correlated within a larger distance varying between 12 and 46 m. The soil moisture measurements of each field were upscaled to the spatial resolution of RADARSAT-2 images (6 × 5 and 9 × 5m2) using either simple kriging or ordinary kriging. The results were cross validated using the surface scattering component, which is extracted from the Freeman-Durden decomposition applied to fully polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images. They show that the kriging-based soil moisture better represents RADARSAT-2 surface scattering with strong clustered linear regressions (R2 greater than '0.6, RMSE lower than '0.9 dB, and p-value of slope less than 0.05) than the nonkriged soil moisture samples.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2649219","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839229","Freeman–Durden decomposition;geostatistical;RADARSAT-2;soil moisture measurements;spatial variability;statistical;upscaling","Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Moisture measurement;Geophysical measurements;Agriculture;Synthetic aperture radar","geophysical techniques;hydrology;moisture;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;soil;statistical analysis;synthetic aperture radar","spatial soil moisture variability;in situ soil moisture measurements;spatial RADARSAT-2 resolution;geostatistical analysis;ground measurements;synthetic aperture radar;SAR backscattering;soil parameters;crop parameters;AD 2008 07;AD 2009 08;Canadian agricultural site;Kenaston;Saskatchewan;Lennoxville;Quεbec;theoretical semivariogram model;simple kriging;ordinary kriging;Freeman-Durden decomposition;polarimetric RADARSAT-2 image;RADARSAT-2 surface scattering","","4","","35","IEEE","1 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, limited information is available about ice thickness changes. Here, we present and validate a method to retrieve lake ice thickness using the CryoSat-2 (CS2) radar altimeter. These are the first satellite altimeter retrievals of lake ice thickness. Under optimal conditions, the CS2 signal is scattered from both the snow-ice and the ice-water interfaces, with returns from each interface being of sufficient power to be identified in the radar waveform. The distance between the scattering horizons is used to determine the ice thickness, similar to traditional ground penetrating radar measurements. The seasonal evolution of ice thickness of GBL and GSL is compared with in situ measurements, modeled ice thicknesses, and previous studies. The impact of ice and snow properties on signal penetration and the thickness retrieval are examined with synthetic aperture radar imagery. The CS2 ice thickness retrievals are able to observe the seasonal thickening of the lake ice and closely match the in situ measurements over both lakes (R > 0.65 , RMSE <; 0.33 m). Thickness retrievals of thin ice are limited by a minimum waveform peak separation of 2 range bins, approximately 0.26 m in ice. Although not designed for lake ice studies, CS2 and future SAR satellite altimeter missions offer new possibilities to monitor the ice and water levels of climatically sensitive and influential lakes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2677583","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Alberta Innovates-Technology Futures; European Space Agency; UAlberta North, the University of Alberta; Province of Alberta; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891554","Arctic;ice thickness;lakes;radar remote sensing","Lakes;Ice thickness;Spaceborne radar;Snow;Scattering","ground penetrating radar;hydrological techniques;ice;lakes;radar altimetry;snow;synthetic aperture radar","lake ice thickness retrieval method;Great Slave Lake;Great Bear Lake;satellite observations;seasonal snow coverage;seasonal ice coverage;freshwater lakes;northern Canada;CryoSat-2 radar altimeter;satellite altimeter retrievals;snow-ice interface;ice-water interface;radar waveform;scattering horizons;traditional ground penetrating radar measurements;ice thickness seasonal evolution;in situ measurements;ice property impact;snow property impact;signal penetration;synthetic aperture radar imagery;seasonal lake ice thickening;SAR satellite altimeter missions;ice level monitor;water level monitor","","18","","52","IEEE","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the case where the Bragg scattering k→-vector can be assumed to be the same for all transmit-receive paths, MIMO methods can be seen as a way of increasing the number of effective receivers. In the last decades, there has been scientific interest in determining the spatial characteristics of ionospheric and atmospheric irregularities on the subtransmit beam scale, allowing the study of processes in their intrinsic scales, otherwise inaccessible using simple beamforming techniques. Interferometric methods, including aperture synthesis imaging, were used in the past with a single transmitter and multiple receivers [single-input multiple-output (SIMO)]. In this paper, we present the first implementation of MIMO techniques to improve the spatial resolution of aperture synthesis radar imaging of daytime equatorial electrojet irregularities observed using the Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO). Our implementation uses two spatially separated transmitters and four spatially separated receivers. In order to separate the contributions of each transmitter, time, code, and polarization diversity experiments have been tested. We find that all three diversity approaches can be used for ionospheric irregularities, but time and polarization diversity are not applicable in all situations due to the range and Doppler width of the echoes, and due to magnetoionic radio propagation effects. The results are evaluated by comparing new MIMO imaging results against the currently used SIMO imaging technique. We present and discuss the theoretical and practical aspects of the MIMO approach, so they can be applied to study other targets not only at JRO but also at other modular coherent scatter radars.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2788425","WATILA Project(grant numbers:SAW-2015-IAP-1 383); NSF through Cornell(grant numbers:AGS-1433968); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:SPP 1788 (DynamicEarth) CH 1482/1-1 (DYNAMITE)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8267289","Atmospheric observations;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar;radar imaging;waveform diversity","Radar imaging;Radio transmitters;MIMO communication;Receivers;Radar antennas;Imaging","array signal processing;atmospheric techniques;ionospheric techniques;MIMO radar;radar antennas;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar resolution;radio receivers;remote sensing by radar","coherent MIMO;aperture synthesis radar imaging;multiple-input multiple-output radar techniques;multiple transmitters;multiple receivers;spatial characteristics;ionospheric irregularities;atmospheric irregularities;subtransmit beam scale;simple beamforming techniques;single transmitter;MIMO techniques;spatial resolution;daytime equatorial electrojet irregularities;Jicamarca Radio Observatory;spatially separated transmitters;spatially separated receivers;modular coherent scatter radars;field-aligned irregularities;spatial target characterization;Bragg scattering k→-vector;MIMO imaging;transmit-receive paths;interferometric methods;single-input multiple-output technique;polarization diversity experiments;diversity approaches;Doppler width;magnetoionic radio propagation effects;SIMO imaging technique","","15","","58","IEEE","23 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To provide a direct quantitative assessment of the surface wave damping, the measurements are decomposed into polarization difference (PD), polarization ratio (PR), nonpolarized (NP), and cross-polarized (CP) components. The PD signals relate to the extent of Bragg damping in the slick areas, over which the PR is systematically higher than over the ambient sea surface. Attenuation of the breaking waves is revealed to affect both the CP and the NP signals, with distinct but weaker contrasts compared to that of the PD. A revised physical model description is proposed to provide consistent interpretation of the polarized and NP signals.

The DDCM-Net can effectively recognize multi-scale and complex shaped roads with similar texture and colors, and also is shown to have superior performance over existing methods. To further improve its ability to accurately infer categories of roads, we propose the use of a joint-task learning strategy that utilizes two auxiliary output branches, i.e, multi-class classification and binary segmentation, joined with the main output of full-class segmentation. This pushes the network towards learning more robust representations that are expected to boost the ultimate performance of the main task. In addition, we introduce an iterative-random-weighting method to automatically weigh the joint losses for auxiliary tasks. This can avoid the difficult and expensive process of tuning the weights of each task's loss by hand.

In the near future, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) will be launched, providing unique compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, expected to be an improvement over the current RADARSAT-2 dual-polarimetric SAR imagery. This motivates the implementation of a CP-dedicated automatic scene classification approach. First, an existing unsupervised segmentation algorithm called iterative region growing using semantics (IRGS) is used to segment ice-class homogeneous regions to reduce the impact of speckle noise. Second, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the ice-type labels for each homogeneous region. Two complex quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes are used to mathematically simulate the corresponding CP scenes for algorithm testing. Classification accuracy shows that using only the two CP intensity images leads to improved results compared with standard dual-polarimetric scenes. Using the CP data, the best classification results are obtained with the reconstructed QP data for the IRGS segmentation and all derived CP features for the SVM labeling. The results support the expected potential that CP scenes will provide improved sea-ice classification than the current operational dual-pol scenes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2913796","Network of Centers of Excellence (ArcticNet); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Environment Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731878","Classification;compact polarimetry;dual-pol;RADARSAT-2;sea-ice;segmentation;support vector machine (SVM);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice;Support vector machines;Image reconstruction;Scattering;Image segmentation","geophysical image processing;image classification;image segmentation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","unsupervised segmentation algorithm;sea-ice classification;complex quadpolarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes;RADARSAT-2 dual-polarimetric SAR imagery;dual-pol scenes;IRGS segmentation;reconstructed QP data;dual-polarimetric scenes;CP intensity images;homogeneous region;ice-type labels;support vector machine;segment ice-class homogeneous regions;automatic scene classification approach;unique compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data;RADARSAT Constellation Mission;Arctic regions;sea-ice-type mapping;satellite imagery;automatic classification methods;compact polarimetric SAR data;sea-ice types;contextual classification;CP","","18","","57","IEEE","5 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data from coastal areas has provided useful bathymetry data, and may also be useful for quantifying coastal light attenuation and, by proxy, coastal suspended-sediment concentrations in regions where sediments are the dominant agent of light attenuation. In this study we evaluate the feasibility and utility of obtaining photon attenuation data for three different coastal areas: northwestern Alaska, a low-relief, passive, arctic margin where clouds are common and the ocean is ice-covered for ~7-9 months per year; the Oregon coast, a high-relief, active, temperate margin which receives abundant rainfall during the winter; and the North Carolina coast, a low-relief, passive, temperate margin. Based on downloaded data, approximately 4060% of segments were classified as Type B or C waters, meaning water-column data were available (versus Type A, where only a surface return was visible). From the Type B or C segments, we were able to calculate uncorrected photon attenuation coefficients (kd_ph_raw) from a subset of files. North Carolina segments offered the greatest abundance of useful data owing to the presence of large, shallow sounds and diverse shoreline orientations which intersected many ICESat-2 tracks. Spatial patterns of kd_ph_raw were consistent with values expected based on sediment resuspension and productivity characteristics in the estuaries (values were higher in the sounds and lower outside the barrier islands). Oregon segments offered much usable data, but the overall number of tracklines intersecting the coast was much smaller than in North Carolina due to the north-south coastline orientation. Alaska segments offered relatively little usable data, likely due to a combination of the brief open-water season each year, contamination from afterpulses and atmospheric effects, sparse data, and shallow water depths which yielded too little data for useful decay profiles. These results do however suggest that more exhaustive post-processing to obtain refined kd_ph values may be worthwhile, especially in temperate environments with coastlines which intersect a large number of tracks and have sediment and/or biologic signals of interest (e.g., North Carolina).","0197-7385","978-1-6654-6809-1","10.1109/OCEANS47191.2022.9977084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977084","ICESat-2;ATLAS;remote sensing;suspended sediment;light attenuation;coast;estuary;continental shelf","Clouds;Sea measurements;Lighting;Attenuation;Water pollution;Sensors;Sediments","bathymetry;ocean waves;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;rain;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;sedimentation;sediments;underwater optics","Alaska segments;Arctic margin;ATLAS instrument;bathymetry data;coastal areas;coastal light attenuation;coastal suspended-sediment concentrations;decay profiles;green laser beams;ICESat-2 ATLAS data;ICESat-2 tracks;NASA ICESat-2 satellite;North Carolina coast;North Carolina segments;north-south coastline orientation;Oregon coast;Oregon segments;photon attenuation data;photon returns;sediment resuspension;shallow water depths;sparse data;suspended particulate matter;temperate margin;uncorrected photon attenuation coefficients;water-column data","","","","17","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a comparison of SMAP and SMOS measured brightness temperatures and translate a validated retrieval algorithm for the thickness of thin sea ice from SMOS to SMAP radiometer observations. For October to December all observations of SMAP in forward and backward direction are compared as daily averages and found with low RMSD of 2.25K and 2.42K in TB,v and TB,h, respectively. The mean of forward and backward observations from SMAP are mapped to SMOS equivalent brightness temperatures using a linear regression.

We add a dense conditional random fields to the ConvLSTM, which further extracts global spatial information and can predict SIC more accurately. The experimental results show that compared with ConvLSTM, our model has a great improvement in the overall prediction accuracy and has more accurate predictions in the SIC boundary region, especially in the melting and freezing seasons when the SIC changes drastically.

Scintillation data collected by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor (GISTM) receivers of the CHAIN provide a good background for testing the phase screen theory given the weak nature of the scintillation amplitude. Sixty-four scintillation events are studied in items of their spectral characteristics and fluctuation levels. Both amplitude ( $S_{4}$ ) and phase ( $\sigma _{\phi }$ ) scintillation indices, as well as the power spectral index, are determined at multiple carrier frequencies (L1 1575.42 MHz, L2 1227.60 MHz, and L5 1176.45 MHz). Using the weak scatter theory, we found that the average frequency dependence of  $S_{4}$  is  $f^{-1.27}$ . This implies that ionospheric irregularity spectra are steeper compared to those obtained directly from the power spectral density of signal amplitude fluctuations. Our results suggest that the frequency scaling of amplitude scintillation fails to account for the ionospheric irregularities of the smallest scales.

As a typical land cover in Antarctica, exposed rock is considered indispensable in many studies, and the mapping of exposed rocks is seen as a key basis of work to meet the demand for more accurate and updated datasets with the consecutive development of satellite technology. Although the normalized difference snow index has been commonly used for differentiating exposed rocks and snow, it often misidentifies clouds as rocks. The British Antarctic Survey has used Landsat 8 data to create a new rock outcrop map for Antarctica, overcoming the limitations of previous techniques and generating Antarctic Digital Database (ADD) New Rock Outcrop with higher accuracy than previously achieved. However, there are still some omission and commission errors apparent in the shaded areas, which affect the accuracy. Widespread shaded areas in Antarctica due to low solar elevation angles and extreme topography cause difficulty in accurately mapping exposed rock. In addition, major differences are present between existing products. Addressing the existing issues about extraction of exposed rock, this study used the near infrared band and shortwave infrared 2 band of Landsat 8 reflectance data to build a specific exposed rock index for the extraction of exposed rocks. A shadow detection method combined with a blue reflectance threshold is used for the shadowed rock identification. Accuracy assessment of these extraction results showed that the accuracy of the new product is higher than all existing exposed rock products. The conversion from DN values to top of atmosphere reflectance and the solar elevation correction for each pixel individually eliminate a variety of errors associated with the different acquisition times of each image. From the statistics of the reflectance related to the training samples, this paper established the threshold of exposed rock extraction so as to ensure the applicability of the same threshold for exposed rock extraction in all images. This method is applied to a total of 1100 high-quality images that were collected for covering the Antarctic continent from November 2013 to February 2014. The results show that 253 of the images contain exposed rocks, and these images were used for mapping work. The map showed that the main exposed rock areas are mainly distributed in four coastal regions: The Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, Lambert Glacier basin, and Victoria Land regions. We also compared our results with ADD New Rock Outcrop and Bedrock Mapping Project 2 (Bedmap2) data in the four main regions. Our results were close to the ADD rock outcrops and exhibited remarkable differences with Bedmap2. We explored the possibility of analyzing and explaining these differences. Especially, as using the same data source Landsat 8 but with a different method, the comparison between our results and ADD New Rock Outcrop is discussed and concludes in shadowed rocks extraction, mixed-pixels, and omission disagreement. The results also show that shadowed rocks accounts for nearly 12% of the total exposed rocks and cannot be neglected. The method we developed can be quickly applied for extraction and mapping of large areas of exposed rocks using Landsat 8.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2755502","Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2012CB957704); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081829","Antarctica;exposed rock;landsat 8;land cover mapping;remote sensing (RS)","Rocks;Antarctica;Satellites;Remote sensing;Earth;Snow;Ice","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;glaciology;land cover;rocks;snow;terrain mapping;topography (Earth)","rock outcrop map;Antarctica;specific exposed rock index;exposed rock extraction;ADD New Rock Outcrop;shadowed rocks extraction;Landsat 8 reflectance data;Antarctic Digital Database;British Antarctic Survey;Landsat 8 images;land cover;solar elevation correction;AD 2013 11 to 2014 02;Antarctic Peninsula;Queen Maud Land;Lambert Glacier basin;Victoria Land region;bedrock mapping project;coastal region","","3","","54","IEEE","24 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Assessment of map accuracy resulted in an r2 value of 0.839 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.17%.

The Doppler velocity is caused by the surface scattering in the line of site of the radar. To a huge extent its periodic component is induced by the orbital motions associated with surface waves. The proposed methodology is based on linear wave theory, accounts for projection effects caused by the fixed antenna look direction, and was applied to a coherent-on-receive radar operating at X-band with vertical polarization in transmit and receive. To show the overall performance of the method, a data set consisting of approximately 100 days of radar measurements was analyzed and used to retrieve significant wave heights. Comparisons to wave measurements collected by a wave rider buoy resulted in a root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.21 m and a bias of 0 m without any calibration parameters needed.

GPR typically uses translation invariant covariances that make the prediction function very flexible and nonlinear. This, however, makes the relative relevance of the input features hardly accessible, unlike in linear prediction models. In this paper, we introduce the sensitivity analysis of the GPR predictive mean and variance functions to derive feature rankings and spectral spacings, respectively. The methodology can be used to uncover knowledge in any kernel-based regression method, it is fast to compute, and it is expressed in closed-form. The methodology is evaluated on GPR for global ocean chlorophyll prediction, revealing the most important spectral bands and their spectral spacings.

Knowledge of the angular dependence of different ice types is therefore necessary to account for this effect. While consistent estimates exist for HH polarization for different ice types, they are lacking HV polarization data, especially for multiyear sea ice. Here we investigate the incidence angle dependence of smooth and rough/deformed first-year and multiyear ice of different ages for wintertime dual-polarization Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery in the Beaufort Sea. Assuming a linear relationship, this dependence is determined using the difference in incidence angle and backscatter intensities from ascending and descending images of the same area. At cross-polarization rough/deformed first-year sea ice shows the strongest angular dependence with -0.11 dB/1° followed by multiyear sea ice with -0.07 dB/1°, and old multiyear ice (older than three years) with -0.04 dB/1°. The noise floor is found to have a strong impact on smooth first-year ice and estimated slopes are therefore not fully reliable. At co-polarization, we obtained slope values of -0.24, -0.20, -0.15, and -0.10 dB/1° for smooth first-year, rough/deformed first-year, multiyear, and old multiyear sea ice, respectively. Furthermore, we show that imperfect noise correction of the first subswath influences the obtained slopes for multiyear sea ice. We demonstrate that incidence angle normalization should not only be applied to co-polarization but should also be considered for cross-polarization images to minimize intra ice type variation in backscatter intensity throughout the entire image swath.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2977506","Swedish National Space Agency(grant numbers:Dnr. 164/18,Dnr. 192/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056528","Incidence angle;sea ice;Sentinel-1","Sea ice;Backscatter;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Earth;Arctic","backscatter;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","old multiyear sea ice;first-year ice;old multiyear ice;strongest angular dependence;first-year sea ice;cross-polarization rough;wintertime dual-polarization Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery;HV polarization data;HH polarization;different ice types;incidence angle dependence;visual sea ice classification;Beaufort Sea;dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images;multiyear sea ice incidence angle normalization;backscatter intensity;intra ice type variation;cross-polarization images;noise figure -0.11 dB;noise figure -0.07 dB;noise figure -0.24 dB;noise figure -0.2 dB;noise figure -0.04 dB;noise figure -0.15 dB;noise figure -0.1 dB","","9","","36","CCBY","3 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Monitoring the changes of the active layer and near-surface permafrost is crucial for revealing their dynamics. GNSS interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) is a relatively new technique for studying frozen ground dynamics. In this paper, we summarized the major achievements in applying GNSS-IR to the signal-to-noise ratio data recorded by the continuous GNSS sites in permafrost areas in the Arctic and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We identified 23 sites in the Arctic permafrost regions which are suitable for GNSS-IR studies. We used the GNSS-IR-retrieved surface elevation changes to investigate the multi-year, interannual, and seasonal changes of the frozen ground. We improved the commonly-used GNSS-IR algorithm for estimating soil moisture in permafrost areas by mitigating the bias introduced by seasonal surface deformation. We also analogized GNSS-IR to InSAR, and advocated for a synergy between their observations to obtain improved, quantitative, and insightful measurements of the ever-warming frozen ground.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554065","Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:CUHK14305618); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554065","GNSS;GNSS interferometric reflectometry;permafrost;surface elevation change;synthetic aperture radar","Temperature sensors;Global navigation satellite system;Soil measurements;Moisture measurement;Atmospheric measurements;Heuristic algorithms;Soil moisture","deformation;geomorphology;glaciology;global warming;ice;moisture;radar interferometry;reflectometry;satellite navigation;soil;synthetic aperture radar","frozen ground dynamics;GNSS interferometric reflectometry;global warming;active layer;near-surface permafrost;signal-to-noise ratio data;continuous GNSS sites;permafrost areas;Arctic permafrost regions;GNSS-IR studies;GNSS-IR-retrieved surface elevation changes;GNSS-IR algorithm;ever-warming frozen ground","","","","16","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assessed the accuracy of our MWRI-ASI SIC product by comparing with the published SIC products at different spatial resolution and by validating with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-1 data. We find that MWRI-ASI SIC has the smallest difference with AMSR2-ASI SIC with the mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8%, and the differences mainly occur at the marginal ice zone regions. The MWRI-ASI displays the highest difference with Sea Ice Index and OSI-430-b at 25 km with the mean MAD of 11.8%. MADs between MWRI-ASI SIC and SIC products from other sensors are below 10% except for late June to early October, when those are higher. Compared with the MODIS SIC, MWRI-ASI SIC outperforms other SIC products at the same resolution, with the mean bias of −2.1% and mean RMSD of 13.5%. Although MWRI-ASI tends to under-estimate high SIC, it can capture details of large leads, ice edge, and fragmented ice area.

The proposed technique was run for 736 image pairs and the ice/water retrieval results were verified against Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis products. Our results suggest that the fraction of water samples classified correctly has significantly increased from 65% (in the case of using a single SAR image) to 81% (in the case of using sequential SAR), while the detection accuracy stayed at approximately the same high level exceeding 99%. The developed approach is recommended to be implemented as part of the data assimilation component of the operational Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System. The results are particularly important in light of the upcoming Canadian RADARSAT constellation mission which will significantly increase the amount and frequency of SAR observations over the Arctic region.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8128123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8128123","synthetic aperture radar (SAR);sequential images;RADARSAT-2;ice probability","","data assimilation;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","sequential SAR images;data assimilation;ice motion information;sequential RADARSAT-2 images;ice probability model;sequential synthetic aperture radar images;single SAR image;canadian ice service image analysis products;SAR observations","","","","9","Crown","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The complexity of the backscattered radar signal however impedes a clear separation of the two types for all cases.

Y. Usikov Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (IRE NASU). It had 100-kW magnetron source, 12-m deployable slotted-waveguide antenna and onboard signal processing unit. Instead of planned experiments, only five days after placement into the polar Earth orbit in the autumn of 1983, SLR of “Cosmos-1500” rendered truly outstanding service. It provided a stream of microwave images of the polar sea ice conditions that enabled the rescue of the freighters in the Arctic Ocean. However, the way to success was far from smooth. Besides of the technical problems, A. Kalmykov had to overcome the jealousy and hostility of both his home institute administration and the USSR bureaucracy. Later, SLR of “Cosmos-1500” was released to the industry and became the main instrument of the USSR and Russian series of remote sensing satellites “Okean” and Ukrainian satellites “Sich-1” and “Sich-1M.” We believe that SLR of “Cosmos-1500” is a perfect candidate to the status of IEEE Milestone in Ukraine.","","979-8-3503-3152-3","10.1109/UkrMW58013.2022.10036997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036997","history of microwaves;orbital side-looking radar;remote sensing","Microwave integrated circuits;Slot antennas;Spaceborne radar;Satellite broadcasting;Streaming media;Signal processing;Sensors","","","","","","26","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining an extensive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data set of Hudson Strait with labelled ridge locations spanning nine winters, an automated system can be developed to detect ridging. In this study we test three transfer learning approaches using a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture; DenseNet-161. We find that when some layers of DenseNet-161 are unfrozen, the model can determine if an area is ridged or non-ridged with a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) score of 92.3.

It is based on measuring the similarity of the received GNSS reflected waveform or delay Doppler map (DDM) to the coherent reflection model waveform. Over the open ocean, the scattered signal has a diffusive, incoherent nature; it is described by the rough surface scattering model based on the geometric optics and the Gaussian statistics for the ocean surface slopes. Over sea ice and, in particular, newly formed sea ice, the scattered signal acquires a coherence, which is characteristic for a surface with large flat areas. In order to measure the similarity of the received waveform or DDM, to the coherent reflection model, three different estimators are presented: the normalized DDM average, the trailing edge slope (TES), and the matched filter approach. Here, a probabilistic study is presented based on a Bayesian approach using two different and independent ground-truth data sets. This approach allows one to thoroughly assess the performance of the estimators. The best results are achieved for both the TES and the matched filter approach with a probability of detection of 98.5%, a probability of false alarm of ~ 3.6%, and a probability of error of 2.5%. However, the matched filter approach is preferred due to its simplicity.

The sea ice concentration (proportion of ice area in a pixel) has been retrieved from the brightness temperature of passive microwave data, and the sea ice extent is defined as the area of ice that has an ice concentration no less than 15% (to avoid weather filtering issues near the ice edge). In an conventional way, the daily extents are averaged to monthly mean values, on the basis of those, monthly deviations are derived and linear regression model is applied to determine the rate (Parkinson and Cavalieri 2012). During this process, uncertainties from sensor transitions, processing method update, the addition of new data sources and the choice for a statistical method can all influence the final result (Cavalieri et al. 2012; Eisenman et al. 2014).","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730270","","Sea ice;Market research;Antarctica;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave radiometry","brightness;oceanographic regions;regression analysis;sea ice;sensitivity analysis;time series","sensitivity analysis;long-term trend;Antarctic sea ice extent;diminishing ice extent;Arctic Ocean;Antarctica;IPCC AR5;IPCC AR4;IPCC 2007;long time series;passive microwave data;South Pole;North Pole;sea ice concentration;brightness temperature;linear regression model;statistical method","","","","8","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The allocation of the 26-GHz band (i.e. 25.5 to 27 GHz) for the downlink, available for the first time for EO applications, allows for collecting a large amount of data. However, considering that several EO missions fly along polar orbits, a ground station (GS) installed at polar latitudes, where high-speed winds, low temperatures and precipitations particularly austere are normal, is fundamental to exploit all the satellite passages. For this reason, the use of radome structures to protect the GS against the environmental conditions is mandatory. This paper addresses the exploitation of the 26-GHz band for future EO satellites, namely the NASA/NOAA JPSS-1 satellite and the EUMETSAT Metop-SG satellite, with specific regard to the RF analysis, of European Space Agency (ESA) GS to be installed in Svalbard.

This has become increasingly true also in the Arctic, where reduced sea ice extent has made Arctic oceans more accessible for industry and tourism-related ship traffic. To minimize the environmental impacts of an oil spill, it is important to identify the source and monitor the extent and progression of a spill. In this paper, Lipschitz-Regularity (LR) transformation and two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT) are integrated into a previously developed image analysis workflow [1] for application to oil spill detection. To describe the performance of the developed approach under controlled conditions, we have applied our method to simulated SAR data of wind driven oceans containing oil spills of various properties. The simulated SAR data starts from a SAR raw signal simulator, which includes both an ocean and an oil slick model. Several crude oil types of varying slick thickness can be simulated and wind speed as well as sensor wavelength can be varied in the simulator. In addition to simulated data, we also used our method on several real-life real life oil spill scenarios using a series of L-band ALOS PALSAR images, and X-band TerraSAR-X images acquired during the Deep-Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and C-band Sentinel-1A images acquired from the Persian Gulf in 2017. From our analysis, we concluded that the LR and 2D-SWT have distinct advantages in oil spill detection and lead to high performance spill mapping results.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232360","Change detection;SAR;Bayesian inferencing;flood mapping;decision support","Oils;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea surface;Transforms;Surface waves;L-band","crude oil;geophysical image processing;marine pollution;oil pollution;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;wavelet transforms;wind","oil spill detection;reduced sea ice extent;Arctic oceans;developed image analysis workflow;simulated SAR data;SAR raw signal simulator;oil slick model;crude oil types;Deep-Water Horizon spill;wind-driven oceans;spill mapping;L-band ALOS PALSAR images;X-band TerraSAR-X images;C-band Sentinel-1A images;Persian Gulf;AD 2017;2D stationary wavelet transform;Gulf of Mexico;AD 2010;Lipschitz-Regularity transformation;petroleum hydrocarbons;marine pollution","","","","8","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These aircraft can be configured to meet specific scientific requirements and have been successfully used to conduct a full range of airborne oceanic research around the globe. While best known for its role as “Hurricane Hunters”, AOC deploys its planes from the Arctic Ocean to the Tropics in a wide variety of missions. The two WP-3D Orion aircraft have played a key role in oceanic research for nearly four decades. This presentation will provide an overview of the types of oceanic research missions conducted by the four engine turboprop WP-3D, with an emphasis on the capabilities of the Orion as an airborne platform to exploit emerging technologies supporting advances in oceanic survey techniques. Additionally, AOC operates three types of light aircraft that perform a wide range of remote sensing roles (both overland and overwater) along with several experimental unmanned aerial systems (UASs). The NOAA WP-3Ds first became operational in 1976 but have undergone a number of programmatic upgrades in recent years. Over the next three years both WP-3Ds will undergo a comprehensive 14 month service life extension maintenance project where significant portions of the wings, tail and avionics are being replaced (along with 4 upgraded Rolls Royce engines). This is expected to extend the service life an additional 20+ years. Each Orion can deploy dozens of Airborne Expendable Bathythermographs (AXBTs) on missions through a combination of external and internal buoy launch tubes. Conductivity Temperature and Depth (AXCTDs) and Current Profilers (AXCPs) can also be launched (but only using an internal free fall chute). More than 70 buoys were deployed on some missions in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. In 1983, oceanographic research flights between Mexico and Ecuador studying El Nino launched over 100 buoys per mission. With the capability to fly at low altitudes for mission durations of up to 10 hours (covering tracks in excess of 3000 km in length), the WP-3D has an unmatched track record of success in its ability to survey the ocean. In addition to the Orion, AOC operates four de Havilland (DHC-6) Twin Otter aircraft as well as a Gulfstream Turbo (Jet Prop) Commander 1000 (695A) and a Hawker Beechcraft King Air 350ER. Each is a proven remote sensing platform with the capability to loiter at low altitude over the ocean and collect data. Finally, for the past few years AOC has been operating a small number of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) including the Puma, which has been successfully deployed from NOAA research vessels, and the Coyote launched from the Orion.","","978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7401979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401979","","Aircraft;US Government agencies;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Engines;Remote sensing","aircraft communication","oceanic survey techniques;light aircraft;remote sensing roles;Rolls Royce engines;Airborne Expendable Bathythermographs;AXBT;Twin Otter aircraft;Gulfstream Turbo;Jet Prop Commander;airborne platform;oceanic research;WP-3D Orion aircraft;Hurricane Hunters;airborne oceanic research;specific scientific requirements;AOC;NOAA aircraft operations center;airborne oceanic survey capabilities","","","","","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, avalanche detection in Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery has been developed to improve monitoring. However, the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms, based on radar signal processing techniques, are still much less accurate than human experts. To reduce this gap, we propose a deep learning architecture for detecting avalanches in Sentinel-1 radar images. We trained a neural network on 6345 manually labeled avalanches from 117 Sentinel-1 images, each one consisting of six channels that include backscatter and topographical information. Then, we tested our trained model on a new synthetic aperture radar image. Comparing to the manual labeling (the gold standard), we achieved an F1 score above 66%, whereas the state-of-the-art detection algorithm sits at an F1 score of only 38%. A visual inspection of the results generated by our deep learning model shows that only small avalanches are undetected, whereas some avalanches that were originally not labeled by the human expert are discovered.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3036914","‘Satskred’ Project; Norwegian Space Centre; Norwegian Water and Energy Resource Directorate; Norwegian Public Road Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9254089","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);deep learning;saliency segmentation;Sentinel-1 (S1);snow avalanches;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Image segmentation;Peak to average power ratio;Deep learning;Snow;Radar imaging;Backscatter","geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;image segmentation;radar imaging;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar","Sentinel-1 radar satellite imagery;state-of-the-art detection algorithms;radar signal processing techniques;human expert;deep learning architecture;Sentinel-1 radar images;neural network;Sentinel-1 images;synthetic aperture radar image;state-of-the-art detection algorithm;deep learning model;snow avalanche segmentation;SAR images;fully convolutional neural networks;snow avalanche activity;snow avalanche hazard;traditional field monitoring;avalanche detection;manually labeled avalanches","","12","","26","CCBY","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, a new detector is proposed based on dual-polarized incoherent SAR images. Small icebergs have a stronger cross polarization accompanied by a higher cross- over co-polarization ratio compared to sea ice in many cases. This is the rational at the base of the detector. The new detector is tested with dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel-1a Extra Wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test area is on the East Coast of Greenland, where large numbers of icebergs occur. This work is mostly focused on the development of an appropriate Constant False Alarm Rate for the contrast enhanced image, that is based on a modification of the Cell-Averaging CFAR. A quantitative comparison of the proposed detector with an ordinary CA-CFAR using only the cross polarization channel is provided. We focus on grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology seems able to improve the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter up to 75 times. This returns an increased probability of detection and reduced probability of false alarms.","","978-2-8748-7045-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811650","","Detectors;Sea ice;Training;Synthetic aperture radar;Clutter;Scattering;Random access memory","geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;image enhancement;object detection;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","iceberg detector;CFAR test;dual-polarized radar imagery;small iceberg identification;sea ice;dual-polarized incoherent SAR images;co-polarization;cross polarization;dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel-1a Extra Wide swath images;East Coast of Greenland;constant false alarm rate;contrast enhanced image;detection probability;false alarm probability;modified cell-averaging CFAR","","","","5","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the retrieval is an ill-posed problem, and thus there are multiple thermodynamic solutions that might satisfy the observed radiances. Previous work developed a physical-iterative method called AERIoe that retrieved temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profiles from these radiance observations in both clear and cloudy conditions. The AERIoe algorithm was modified to enforce two physical constraints, namely that the derived relative humidity must be less than 100% and that the potential temperature must be monotonically increasing with height above some thin potentially subadiabatic layer after each iteration. Furthermore, additional observations including in situ surface meteorology, numerical weather prediction model output, microwave brightness temperatures, and partial profiles of water vapor from a Raman lidar were incorporated into the observation vector of the retrieval along with the infrared radiance observations. The addition of these new observations markedly improved the accuracy of the temperature profiles, especially above 2 km, and the water vapor profiles relative to radiosondes.

Although noise vectors in both the azimuth and range directions are provided in the standard S1 EW data for subtraction, the residual thermal noise still significantly affects sea ice detection by the EW data. In this article, we improve the denoising method developed in previous studies to remove the additive noise for the S1 EW data in cross-polarization. Furthermore, we propose a new method for eliminating the residual noise (i.e., multiplicative noise) at the subswath boundaries of the EW data, which cannot be well processed by simply subtracting the reconstructed 2-D noise field. The proposed method of removing both the additive and multiplicative noise was applied to EW HV-polarized images processed using different Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) versions. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of EW HV-polarized images under various sea ice conditions and sea states in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic.

Given its enhanced radar target information compared with conventional SAR systems over wider swath coverage compared with FP SAR, CP systems could play important role in the new generation of Earth observation systems. Herein, we study the evolution of CP SAR parameters from simulated CP SAR data in relation to early ice growth. Focus of the study is on four lakes located in Cornwallis Island, Canadian Central Arctic. We adopt parameters extracted from dual circular polarimetric and right circular transmit, linear (horizontal and vertical) receive configurations. In this study, we consider the ice thickness calculated from an established empirical model. Meteorological and ice climatological data were used to support the analysis. Results demonstrated a potential connection between a number of CP parameters and lake ice growth. Furthermore, we were able to highlight the relationship between the density of air bubbles in ice layer and the intensity of volume scattering mechanism, leading to the identification of lakes with increased gas production activities.

In previous thin-ice thickness algorithms, ice thickness is estimated by utilizing a negative correlation between ice thickness and polarization ratio (PR) of AMSR-E. However, in these thin-ice algorithms, the relationship has large dispersion. We consider that the problem is caused by not taking account of ice type. We classified thin-ice regions around Antarctica into two ice types: 1) active frazil, comprising frazil and open water and 2) thin solid ice, areas of the relatively uniform thin ice, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data. For each ice type, we examined the relationship between the AMSR-E PR of 36 GHz and ice thickness, showing that the active frazil type has a much smaller thickness than the thin solid ice type for the same PR. The two ice types can be discriminated by a simple linear discriminant method in the plane of the PR and gradient ratio of AMSR-E, with the misclassification of 3%. From these results, we propose a new thin-ice algorithm. The two ice types are classified by the linear discriminant method, and then empirical equations are used to obtain the ice thickness for each ice type. This algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the thin-ice thickness.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2853590","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:17H01157,17H06317); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency(grant numbers:RA1W403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424412","Antarctic coastal polynya;frazil ice;passive microwave;thin-ice thickness","Ice thickness;Sea ice;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques;Sea measurements","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea-ice production;thin-ice thickness algorithms;thin-ice regions;relatively uniform thin ice;solid ice type;AMSR-E passive microwave data;microwave radiometers;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System;ocean thermohaline circulation;Antarctica;uniform thin ice;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data;active frazil type;thin solid ice type;simple linear discriminant method;empirical equations;frequency 36.0 GHz","","18","","53","IEEE","2 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the use of an LFM chirp with a bandwidth of 0.3 MHz and a pulsewidth of 2 ms can give higher SNR and resolution for Moon imaging using SYISR. Several key techniques were applied in the experiment design and data processing: 1) for the reliability of the imaging algorithm, the range-Doppler imaging algorithm commonly used in synthetic aperture imaging was applied; 2) to avoid the sidelobe effect of the 13-bit Barker code matched filter, a sidelobe-free filter was used; and 3) to mitigate the problem of “north–south ambiguity,” mosaic imaging of the Doppler northern and southern hemispheres of the nearside of the Moon was adopted.

Phase-linking (PL) estimators impose a phase-closure constraint in order to estimate the temporal wrapped-phase history of a DS directly from its complex backscatter sample coherence matrix. Some PL methods, such as the SqueeSAR and maximum-likelihood-estimator of Interferometric phase (EMI) estimators, rely on knowledge of the coherence magnitude matrix. The true coherence magnitude is a priori unknown and must therefore be estimated from the data. Bias in these estimated coherence magnitudes reduces PL performance when the true coherence magnitude is low. Many areas of the Earth are seasonally snow-covered and, for natural terrain, this leads to severe cross-season decorrelation. This poses a significant challenge for PL estimators due to bias of the near-zero cross-season coherence magnitude estimates. We introduce a clustering approach to mitigate the PL estimator bias problem that exploits the fact that in natural terrain, many DSs decorrelate similarly. This allows for averaging over large numbers of same-behaving DS, which provides robust debiasing of the coherence magnitudes used during PL. We apply our method to a RADARSAT-2 spotlight-mode InSAR dataset over a site in the western Canadian Arctic and demonstrate significant reductions in a posteriori phase variance when compared to existing PL methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3186522","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) Canadian Space Agency (CSA) Industrial Research Chair in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Technologies, Methods and Applications, Simon Fraser University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9807376","Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);phase linking (PL);snow;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Coherence;Snow;Decorrelation;Backscatter;Electromagnetic interference;History;Maximum likelihood estimation","geophysical techniques;maximum likelihood estimation;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;time series","InSAR phase;seasonally snow-covered terrain;Interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series analysis;natural terrain;long-term geophysical trends;extended areas;distributed scatterers;DSs;phase-linking estimators;phase-closure constraint;wrapped-phase history;complex backscatter sample coherence matrix;maximum-likelihood-estimator;Interferometric phase estimators;coherence magnitude matrix;estimated coherence magnitudes;PL performance;severe cross-season decorrelation;PL estimators;near-zero cross-season coherence magnitude estimates;PL estimator bias problem;RADARSAT-2 spotlight-mode InSAR dataset;posteriori phase variance;existing PL methods","","","","25","IEEE","27 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of Sentinel-1 images divided into two classes, representing the presence and absence of a maritime mesocyclone, respectively. The dataset is constructed using the ECMWF reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004 annotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be publicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to classify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model yields an  $F1$  score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently detected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep learning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key features in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the model is accurate even if: 1) such features are significantly cropped due to the limited swath width of the SAR; 2) the features are partly covered by sea ice; and 3) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating the model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km), it is found that higher resolution yield the best performance. This emphasizes the potential of using high-resolution sensors like SAR for detecting polar lows, as compared to conventionally used sensors such as scatterometers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3204886","European Space Agency (ESA) through the Open Call Project “Polar Low Detection Based on Sentinel-1 Data”(grant numbers:4000129961); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878346","Deep learning;mesocyclones;polar lows;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Deep learning;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Data models;Radar polarimetry;Image color analysis","","","","","","56","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model is based on soil dielectric data that were measured over the ranges of volumetric moisture from 0.007 to 0.573 cm3/cm3, dry soil density from 0.564 to 0.666 g/cm3, and temperature from 25°C to -30°C (cooling run), at the frequency of 1.4 GHz. The refractive mixing model was applied to fit the measurements of the soil's complex refractive index (CRI) as a function of soil moisture, with the values of temperature being fixed. Using the results of this fitting, the parameters of the refractive mixing model were derived as a function of temperature. These parameters involve the CRIs of soil solids as well as bound, transient, and free soil water components. The error of the dielectric model was evaluated by correlating the predicted complex relative permittivity (CRP) values of the soil samples with the measured ones. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) were estimated to be R2 = 0.999, RMSE = 0.27 and R2 = 0.993, RMSE = 0.18 for the real and imaginary parts of the CRP, respectively. These values are in the order of the dielectric measurement error itself.

The novel technique benefits from a cost-effective data collection from a large number of global GNSS stations. In this study, we extend a traditional GNSS interferometry reflectometry (GNSS-IR) model so that it can be applied to a multilayer surface by considering the surface roughness, total reflectivity, and penetration loss in multilayer situations. Based on this model, the wavelet analysis is used to perform parameterization on the interferometric observations represented by the signal to noise ratio (SNR). An integration factor and power curve are also proposed to characterize the surface state transition. One-year data from an Arctic geodetic GNSS station in the north of Canada are collected for analysis to validate the proposed approach in comparison with the existing methods based on the amplitude and damping factors. The results show that the new method demonstrates good usability and sensitivity to detect surface state transitions, e.g., icing, snowfall, and snow melting. However, the amplitude and damping factor-based methods derived from the single-layer model are only able to detect the pure ice surface and cannot respond to thick snow conditions. Finally, the high-resolution spaceborne images confirm the reliability of this method, exhibiting a great potential for long-term coastal sea surface detection based on the global geodetic GNSS stations and later being expected to be applied to sense cryosphere surface states.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3155051","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41830110); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:B200203110); Postgraduate Research and Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYCX20_0489); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42004014,42174018); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200530); State Scholarship Fund from Chinese Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202006710115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721921","Area factor;cryosphere;global navigation satellite systems interferometry reflectometry (GNSS-IR);multilayer surface;sea surface detection;signal to noise ratio (SNR)","Global navigation satellite system;Ice;Sea surface;Monitoring;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces;Surface states","geodesy;Global Positioning System;reflectometry;satellite navigation;snow;surface states","sea surface states detection;ground-based GNSS interferometric reflectometry;interferometric measurements;ground-based global navigation satellite systems stations;cost-effective data collection;global GNSS stations;traditional GNSS interferometry reflectometry model;GNSS-IR;multilayer surface;surface roughness;interferometric observations;surface state transition;Arctic geodetic GNSS station;damping factor-based methods;pure ice surface;long-term coastal sea surface detection;global geodetic GNSS stations;cryosphere surface states","","","","50","IEEE","25 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) mission, based on a multifrequency microwave radiometer and designed to observe the ocean, sea ice, and Arctic environment, requires brightness temperature measurements with a total absolute uncertainty of 0.5 K and a spatial resolution of 5 km. This constraint demands very large reflectors with a gain value of tens of decibels. Mechanical constraints will be attained by using a mesh reflector, which guarantees the required resolution but with the drawback of a radiation pattern characterized by many grating lobes that contaminate the value of the brightness temperature associated with the boresight position. In this article, an antenna pattern correction (APC) is proposed to correct these effects. The algorithm takes advantage of an iterative formulation based on the Jacobi Method, providing a suitable correction that depends on the chosen spatial resolution. The APC algorithm was tested at both K- and Ka-bands with similar performance. Here, only the results from the latter are shown, as its antenna pattern is the most challenging among CIMR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3238269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021618","Antenna pattern correction (APC);conical scan;Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR);microwave radiometry;radiometric accuracy","Antennas;Earth;Temperature measurement;Microwave radiometry;Antenna measurements;Climate change;Spatial resolution","","","","","","13","CCBY","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To be able to mitigate this, it is essential to know the position of viable threats. Many sensors can be employed, such as satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), marine radar, air surveillance et cetera. At the core of the fusion of this sensor data is a Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) problem. This problem is studied in this paper through the implementation and application of the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) algorithm. A major limiting factor in the application of multi-target tracking is scalability. A common method of handling the scaling is clustering, which separates the MHT filter into smaller independent parts. However, with growing scale, the association of sensor data to the “right” cluster can become resource intensive in itself. A method is explored, based on rectangular lower probability bounds, to efficiently index the clusters and compartmentalize the measurement update of the MHT. The method uses the bounding box of the lower probability bound of tracks and reports respectively, to perform an intersection lookup against the sensor field-of-view, efficiently selecting clusters of relevance. The method, as well as the MHT algorithm, has been implemented and published online under an open-source license. In this report, the implementation is described and tested on simulated data for statistics. Further, it is tested against data extracted from the polarimetric classification of ice using satellite imagery of the Arctic. Results show that computational speed improvements can be achieved, in comparison to the linear complexity of a naive search, but that comparable performance can be obtained using standard database lookups.","","978-1-5090-1613-6","10.1109/AERO.2017.7943670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943670","","Target tracking;Radar tracking;Sensors;Ice;Arctic;Indexing","geophysical image processing;ice;image classification;image filtering;object tracking;pattern clustering;polarimetry;probability;public domain software;remote sensing;target tracking","spatially indexed clustering;scalable remotely sensed drift ice tracking;sensor data;multitarget tracking problem;MTT problem;multiple hypothesis tracking algorithm;MHT algorithm;rectangular lower probability bounds;bounding box;intersection lookup;sensor field-of-view;MHT measurement update;open-source license;polarimetric classification;satellite imagery;linear complexity;standard database lookups","","5","","27","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of in situ observations from the MIZ of the Arctic Ocean confirms the conclusion drawn based on theoretical estimates as well as the simulation ability of our new model to describe wave evolution in the MIZ. In wave refraction, variation of wavenumber in magnitude is determined by the incident wavenumber and the ice mass. A larger incident wavenumber or a larger ice mass leads to a larger variation of wavenumber in magnitude, though during refraction, the variation of wavenumber in magnitude is more sensitive to the incident wavenumber because it is proportional to the cube of the incident wavenumber, while it is linearly proportional to the ice mass. On the other hand, both the angle of refraction and the deflection are determined by the angle of incidence, the incident wavenumber and the ice mass. A larger angle of incidence, a shorter wave or larger ice mass results in a larger angle of refraction and a larger deflection. All these conclusions are supported by offline calculations, an online model and in situ observations. The online model also suggests that the instrument should be kept at a distance from the ice edge to obtain more general information of the open ocean.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028866","National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:ZK18-03-29); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214406","Wave refraction;marginal ice zone;frazil-pancake ice;wavenumber variation","Sensitivity;Sea ice;Ice thickness;Arctic;Ocean temperature","ocean waves;oceanographic regions;sea ice","Arctic Ocean;ice edge;larger ice mass results;shorter wave;larger incident wavenumber;wave evolution;MIZ;wavenumber variations;online model;offline calculation;theoretical estimates;frazil-pancake ice;marginal ice zone;wave refraction","","","","22","CCBY","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, this remote sensing problem is cast as an inverse scattering problem in which a data misfit cost functional is to be minimized using a differential evolution algorithm. This minimization requires repetitive calls to an appropriate electromagnetic forward solver. The utilized electromagnetic forward solver attempts to model both surface and volume scattering components associated with the irradiated rough multilayered medium under investigation.

It consists of a method for predicting maps of rapid fluctuations of ionospheric electron content in terms of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) dual-frequency phase measurements of the rate of change of total electron content index (ROTI). The forecast is made in space and time, at horizons up to more than 6 h. These forecast maps will consist of the ROTI spatial distribution in the northern hemisphere above 45° latitude. The prediction method models the ROTI spatial distribution as a pseudoconservative flux, i.e., exploiting the inertia of the flux of ROTI to determine the future position. This idea is implemented as a modification of the optical flow image processing technique. The algorithm has been modified to deal with the nonconservation of the ROTI quantity in time.

Most of them rely on empirical or statistical approaches for the interpretation of backscatter intensity measurements and their seasonal variations related to the melting regime of the different glacier zones. This article focuses on the potential of polarimetric SAR measurements to characterize the scattering in the different glacier zones in order to distinguish between them. For this, a general two-component scattering model is proposed, accounting for surface and subsurface contributions in the different glacier zones. The (anisotropic) propagation through snow, firn, and ice layers is also accounted for as it plays an important role in the interpretation of the polarimetric signatures. A set of five polarimetric descriptors is proposed to describe the projection of the model on the SAR measurements. The ability of the model to characterize the scattering in the different glacier zones is validated and discussed at different frequencies (X-, C-, and L-band). For this, a multifrequency airborne SAR dataset acquired by the DLR's F-SAR sensor in West Greenland during the ARCTIC 2015 campaign is used. The achieved results indicate that L-band polarimetric measurements allow to differentiate the different glacier zones based on the subsurface (e.g., volume) scattering characteristics. In contrast, the increased (back-) scattering complexity and the reduced penetration capability limit the potential of X- and C-band polarimetric measurements.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3126069","Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft- und Raumfahrt; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609650","Firn line;glacier zones;Greenland;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR);polarization phase difference","Ice;Scattering;Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Snow;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces","airborne radar;glaciology;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar","different glacier zones;map glacier zones;polarimetric SAR measurements","","4","","48","CCBY","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we investigate the effect of geophysical noise leading to systematic $c_{\text{ice}}$ biases and affecting $c_{\text{ice}}$ standard deviations (STD) using simulated top of the atmosphere $T_{B}$s over open water and 100% sea ice. We consider three case studies for the Arctic and the Antarctic and eight different $c_{\text{ice}}$ algorithms, representing different families of algorithms based on the selection of channels and methodologies. Our simulations show that, over open water and low $c_{\text{ice}}$, algorithms using gradients between V-polarized 19-GHz and 37-GHz $T_{B}$s show the lowest sensitivity to the geophysical noise, while the algorithms exclusively using near-90-GHz channels have by far the highest sensitivity. Over sea ice, the atmosphere plays a much smaller role than over open water, and the $c_{\text{ice}}$ STD for all algorithms is smaller than over open water.

The coherency is characterized as a function of ocean surface conditions and reflected signal parameters based on Spire Global CubeSat data collected from January to April 2019. The data contain 50-Hz GPS L1 and L2 carrier phase estimations obtained by open-loop tracking. Indicators based on the circular statistics of the excess-phase noise are developed to identify coherent and semicoherent reflections. Based on these indicators, we found that ~1% and 44% of GPS reflections over the ocean and sea ice, respectively, have potential for precision altimetry. The coherent and semicoherent reflection rates reach 23% in areas less than 200 km from the coastline and under calm sea conditions. Over young sea ice over the Arctic, this rate can be as high as 70%. There is a strong relationship between coherency and signal strength, and the coherency occurrence rate improves as the grazing angle decreases. The quality of the L1 and L2 coherent reflections is similar over sea ice, while, for reflections over the ocean, L1 signals are predominantly noisier and less coherent than the L2 signals. Using a postprocessing filtering method, the semicoherent reflections can achieve a similar level of altimetry precision as that of the coherent ones, thereby increasing the along-track length of the retrieved altimetry profile.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3129999","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1082,80NSSC20K1738); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9625022","Carrier phase estimations;coherent reflections;GPS reflection;ocean surface;precision altimetry;sea ice;semicoherent reflections","Reflection;CubeSat;Altimetry;Sea surface;Global navigation satellite system;Sea ice;Global Positioning System","Global Positioning System;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","ocean surface conditions;signal parameters;Spire Global CubeSat data;GPS L1;L2 carrier phase estimations;semicoherent reflections;GPS reflections;coherent reflection rates;semicoherent reflection rates;calm sea conditions;young sea ice;signal strength;coherency occurrence rate;grazing angle decreases;L2 coherent reflections;altimetry precision;coherent GNSS-reflections characterization;Global Navigation Satellite System;grazing angle geometries;low Earth orbit CubeSats;precision altimetry applications;AD 2019 01 to 04;size 200.0 km","","5","","62","CCBY","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose an unsupervised auroral optical flow (UnAurFlow) model for recognizing the PMAFs from auroral image sequences captured by all-sky imagers. Since auroral shape and illumination change continuously and randomly during the evolution, and auroral motion violates the brightness constancy assumption, UnAurFlow designs an auroral deformation detection module based on bidirectional optical flow and exploits the census transform to compensate for the auroral luminosity changes. UnAurFlow is trained in an unsupervised manner, which circumvents the difficulty of manually labeling auroral optical flow. The validity of UnAurFlow is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using auroral observations in 2003–2005 at the Arctic Yellow River Station. Based on the auroral optical flow computed by UnAurFlow, and combining with ResNet and the attention mechanism, PMAFs are automatically recognized with a precision of 84.77% from continuous auroral observations, which outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow algorithms. The temporal occurrence distribution of PMAFs is prenoon–postnoon asymmetric under negative interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) By conditions, which is in good agreement with the previous statistical study.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3083369","Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JM-272); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:GK202103020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447220","Auroral motion estimation;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs);unsupervised learning of optical flow","Optical imaging;Estimation;Strain;Magnetosphere;Ion radiation effects;Optical fiber networks;Brightness","aurora;geophysical image processing;image sequences;interplanetary magnetic fields;unsupervised learning","poleward moving auroral forms;PMAFs;common dayside auroral phenomena;unsupervised auroral optical flow model;UnAurFlow;auroral image sequences;auroral shape;illumination change;auroral motion;auroral deformation detection module;bidirectional optical flow;auroral luminosity changes;continuous auroral observations;state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow algorithms;unsupervised learning;all-sky imagers","","1","","45","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The network consisted of four HF radars (HFRs) that provided hourly sea surface velocity data in real-time mode in a netCDF format compliant to the Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions CF-1.6 and the INSPIRE directive. The hourly netCDF files are disseminated via a Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services catalog supporting OGC compliant distributions and protocols for data visualization, metadata interrogation, and data download. HFR velocity data were compared with in situ velocity measurements by Global Positioning System tracked surface drifters deployed within the radar footprint. The results show a good agreement, with the root mean square (rms) of the difference between radial velocities from HFR and drifters ranging between $20\%$ and $50\%$ of the drifter velocity rms. The HFR data have also been compared with subsurface velocity profiles from an upward looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) during winter 2015, to gain information on the correlation between surface and water column velocities. This information is especially relevant for fishery and coastal management applications, where transport of larvae, sediments, and pollutants in the water column are considered. Results show that, at least in the considered period, the velocity in the water column is well correlated, and there is a good agreement between surface HFR and ADCP data (correlations between 0.95 and 0.75).

In this paper, a U-Net model is trained to identify multi-year ice (MYI), first-year ice (FYI), and open water (OW) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. 14 Sentinel-1 A/B Extended Wide (EW) mode images, acquired in the Beaufort Sea and Svalbard between January and March 2020, and their gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture feature are split into chips to be fed into the model for training and testing. The GLCM is a set of images reflecting the comprehensive information of direction, adjacent interval, and variation amplitude of the gray level of original image. It can also be understood as texture features of original image. It is the basis of analyzing local patterns in an image and their arrangement rules. Dissimilarity of HH (HH-Dis) chosen from 20 kinds of available GLCM texture features is combined with horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization, horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization, and incident angle as inputs. The LabelMe software creates labels with visual interpretation. The proportions of FYI and MYI data in training data were adjusted to approximately equal, to avoid bias of model prediction results towards dominant categories. The result shows that the combination of HH, HV, incident angle and HH-Dis has the highest precision of 92.10%, although the precision is 89.35% when only HH and HV information combined. This result reflects the potential of adding GLCM for sea ice classification.","1559-9450","978-1-6654-6023-1","10.1109/PIERS55526.2022.9793312","Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793312","","Training;Visualization;Training data;Predictive models;Radar polarimetry;Software;Marine navigation","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;neural nets;oceanographic regions;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","U-Net model;dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images;marine navigation;Northwest Passage;synthetic aperture radar images;Beaufort Sea;GLCM texture features;horizontal-vertical polarization;horizontal-horizontal polarization;sea ice classification;gray level cooccurrence matrix texture feature;SAR images;Sentinel-1 A-B extended wide mode images;Svalbard;AD 2020 01 to 03;LabelMe software","","","","18","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The purpose is to test new navigation signals and inter-satellite communication links and define the necessary protocols for a future network that will be capable of providing global coverage. The rapid development of the BDS brings a promising prospect for all kind of application and the fusion of multiple GNSSs will significantly increase the number of observed satellites, optimize the spatial geometry and improve continuity and reliability of positioning. However, how the BDS could enhance the position accuracy and precision is still under intensive investigation. In this study, we utilize PANDA receivers to evaluate BDS's performance and benefits in positioning at high latitudes. The car-borne kinematic and static positioning using a PANDA receiver and a choke-ring antenna were carried out between latitude 60–71 degrees in Finland and Norway (Helsinki, Oulu, Saariselka and Nordkapp). A part of the test is north of the Arctic Circle. Except for the car-borne test, another static test at the Metsähovi Geodetic Fundamental Station was made. The PANDA receiver shared one antenna with another geodetic GNSS receiver for a zero baseline test. We also used the Finnish Permanent GNSS network FinnRef that has 20 GNSS stations between latitudes 60 and 70 for evaluation purposes. FinnRef stations are equipped with Javad receivers and individually calibrated choke ring antennas. All the stations are able to tracks BDS, GPS, Galileo and GLONASS. In order to assess the precise positioning performance with current multi-constellation GNSS, the Positioning And Navigation Data Analyst (PANDA) software developed by GNSS research center, Wuhan University, is employed to analyze the GNSS data and demonstrate the BDS significant contribution to precise positioning with current multi-constellations.

Yet, many of these coastal environments are threatened by anthropogenic and climate stressors resulting in the need for robust monitoring to inform current and future environmental stewardship decisions. While traditional oceanographic sampling is typically done from a research vessel, this is often costly and logistically difficult for scientists and coastal communities alike. Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) in partnership with communities along Canada's western, eastern, and Arctic coasts have continued to advance a number of solutions for long-term marine monitoring. Here, we discuss the development and implementation of seafloor cabled observatories, which collect continuous real-time data intended to help inform government, industry, and communities, and advance the scientific understanding of coastal environments. The strategic placement of these observatories, with collaboration from community partners, allows for high resolution datasets in both significant and remote regions of Canada. Each underwater platform has the potential to house a variety of instruments, which are connected to an underwater cable for real-time data transmission to the surface and which often allows the instruments to be powered from shore. Shore stations provide connectivity to the instruments and also provide an opportunity to host other shore-based instruments that can complement the underwater suite. Since large amounts of data are more easily and efficiently stored and transferred continuously rather than with battery-dependent autonomous systems, these observatory systems are well suited for collecting year-round, high temporal-resolution data. Thisallows for traditional physical oceanographic parameters to reveal environmental changes not only over annual and decadal time scales but also over diurnal (and shorter) time scales. These systems are more efficient at supporting year-round deployments of hydrophones, active acoustic instruments, surface and subsea video cameras, radars, and other high data-density instruments than their autonomous counterparts. Data from ONC's network of observatories are relayed from shore stations over the internet via fibre, cellular, or satellite connection to the Oceans 2.0 data management system. Oceans 2.0 supports open data access, detailed metadata support, sensor health monitoring, QA/QC of the data, data products, and a wide range of web services. All of these factors together serve to fill several major data and knowledge gaps to better understand our dynamic coastal waters. These community-based platforms have proven to be excellent tools for advancing and supporting ocean literacy and education resources by providing valuable and engaging resources to educators around the world, for all grade levels from primary education to postgraduate studies. They have also been used successfully as technology incubators where manufacturers and research groups can trial new sensor technologies in a real-world setting that is relatively easy to access and where they can leverage the continuous, real-time data stream and sensor-health monitoring that allows for instantaneous feedback on sensor performance. Finally, ONC's broad vision includes providing knowledge and leadership that deliver solutions to society in general; community-based cabled observatories are one of the means to support this vision. ONC's Community-Based Monitoring team usesthese cabled “community observatories” as one of many possible complementary tools when working directly with leadership in coastal communities, including Indigenous communities, environmental stewardship organizations, non-governmental organizations, and Municipal, Provincial, Federal government departments, and researchers, to implement local environmental monitoring programs. This paper will present a summary of multiple community observatory installations and will compare them to one another. It will discuss the various inputs and priorities that have influenced the development of each of the systems and how the data has been used in each scenario.","0197-7385","978-1-7281-5446-6","10.1109/IEEECONF38699.2020.9389268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389268","ocean monitoring;coastal communities;cabled observatories;indigenous partnerships","Leadership;Observatories;Oceans;Instruments;Sea measurements;Real-time systems;Monitoring","environmental monitoring (geophysics);geophysics computing;meta data;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;remote sensing;submarine cables;video signal processing;Web services","long-term marine monitoring;seafloor cabled observatories;coastal environments;community partners;high resolution datasets;underwater platform;underwater cable;real-time data transmission;shore stations;shore-based instruments;underwater suite;battery-dependent autonomous systems;observatory systems;temporal-resolution data;physical oceanographic parameters;active acoustic instruments;high data-density instruments;fibre satellite connection;Oceans 2.0 data management system;open data access;sensor health monitoring;metadata;data products;dynamic coastal waters;community-based platforms;ocean literacy;education resources;real-time data stream;sensor-health monitoring;community-based cabled observatories;cabled community observatories;coastal communities;indigenous communities;environmental stewardship organizations;local environmental monitoring programs;multiple community observatory installations;coastal monitoring;coastal marine environments;coastal community members;anthropogenic climate stressors;robust monitoring;oceanographic sampling;environmental stewardship decisions;ocean networks Canada;high temporal-resolution data;subsea video cameras;Internet;cellular satellite connection;Web services;primary education;ONC's broad vision;ONC's community-based monitoring team","","","","14","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two cubesats carrying thermal infrared spectrometers (TIRS) in polar orbits will test long-held assumptions regarding radiative balance at long wavelengths where the cold-dry Arctic and Antarctic surfaces expel significant amounts of the earth's radiant energy. Thermal radiometry with better than one micron sampling at wavelengths beyond 15 microns will provide critical observational bounds for inputs into glacier melt and climate change models through improvements in surface emissivities, longwave greenhouse effect parameterizations, and cloud presence/types. Additional information on potential far-infrared surface/atmosphere feedbacks during rapid melt processes may be captured with sub-diurnal revisits of targeted areas. A baseline mission with two cubesats in different orbits provides a means for optimization of sub-diurnal sampling for science purposes. In this presentation we provide details of orbit studies that inform expected sampling metrics. Candidate orbits are modeled in SGP and then TIRS sampling is projected into surface footprints with appropriate geo-location. Matching algorithms then compile statistics for time-delayed revisits between and within the two orbits. Binning of results by latitude allows for abstraction of precession issues as well as for correlations with surface types as defined by radiometric classification schemes. Multiple acceptable pairs of science-driven orbits were found that optimize sampling in areas known to experience rapid melt events. The final choice of PREFIRE orbital parameters includes the systems trade-space, particularly the power budget, as well as the availability of launch opportunities.","1095-323X","978-1-6654-3760-8","10.1109/AERO53065.2022.9843312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843312","Low earth orbit satellites;Orbital Calculations","Earth;Micrometers;Surface waves;Satellite broadcasting;Radiometry;Orbits;Antarctica;Climate change","artificial satellites;atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;climatology;clouds;Earth orbit;geophysical signal processing;infrared spectrometers;radiative transfer;radiometry;remote sensing","radiometric classification schemes;Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-Infrared Experiment;Cubesats-based Earth Science mission;NASA Earth Ventures-Instrument program;longwave greenhouse effect;rapid melt process;orbit studies;surface emissivities;climate change models;glacier;critical observational bounds;thermal radiometry;radiative balance;polar orbits;thermal infrared spectrometers;PREFIRE mission;orbital trade study;PREFIRE orbital parameters;science-driven orbits;candidate orbits","","","","6","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Imaging remote sensing systems, particularly Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), make possible monitoring of sea ice under almost any weather conditions and independent of the illumination conditions. Two main family of approaches have been widely used so far – area-based and feature-based. We evaluate their performance using texture properties of sea ice images which are physically related to the radar signal backscattering within a SAR resolution cell. Here we use the local entropy as indicator determined by gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method describing how often different compositions of pixel brightness values occur in an image. A total of 120 satellite SAR sea ice images acquired over different Arctic seas from Sentinel-1 were processed and analysed. Based on the analysis, assessment criteria for choosing sea ice tracking algorithm is proposed.","","978-3-8007-5457-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9472644","","","","","","","","","","2 Jul 2021","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Most of existing methods highly rely on massive labeled data which are scarce in many real world applications. It should also be noticed that progressive learning demands of existing data is very common today. That is, we may pay attention to more fine-grained information (like arctic tern, black tern, buttercup or tulip) in an existing data set with labels like “bird” and “flower”. It is reasonable to believe that the existing labels and model with transferable knowledge would be helpful to another related but different, fine-grained recognition task. In this context, an improved transfer deep learning approach with hierarchical multi-adversarial networks is proposed in this paper. With this approach, cross domain features are extracted by advanced deep encoders coarsely. After that, we annotate a small amount of images in the target domain, thereby creating the “active labels” which can provide instructions for adversarial learning. Then, the GAN-based hierarchical model is utilized to select cross domain categories and enhance related features so as to facilitate an effective transfer. In order to exploit useful local features, a novel adaptive attention mechanism, Region Adversarial Network (RAN) which can select attention regions during adversarial learning and generate valuable fine-grained features, is introduced in the article. We call the proposed hierarchical framework “Attentional Multi-Adversarial Networks (AMAN)”. Experimental results show that AMAN is able to augment cross domain features well-directly and build an effective classifier for fine-grained categorization in the target domain with fewer training samples and higher accuracies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934476","Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Research and Application Demonstration of Key Technologies in High-Resolution Remote Sensing based Intelligent Monitoring for Spatial Planning)(grant numbers:2019BFG02009); Ministry of Information Industry of the People's Republic of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8794503","Fine-grained classification;transfer learning;deep learning;domain adaption;generative adversarial networks;attention","Feature extraction;Generative adversarial networks;Task analysis;Training;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Generators","computer vision;feature extraction;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","transfer learning;massive labeled data;progressive learning demands;fine-grained information;transferable knowledge;fine-grained recognition task;improved transfer deep learning approach;cross domain features;advanced deep encoders;target domain;active labels;adversarial learning;GAN-based hierarchical model;cross domain categories;fine-grained features;hierarchical framework;computer vision problem;local features;adaptive attention mechanism;semisupervised fine-grained categorization;hierarchical multiscale adversarial networks;region adversarial network;attentional multiadversarial networks;AMAN","","5","","71","CCBY","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
