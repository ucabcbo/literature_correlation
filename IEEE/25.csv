Different snow and ice parameters are applied to illustrate the effects of auxiliary data on the SIT retrievals. Snow depth data are from three sources including climatology observation, microwave remote sensing and reanalysis data, while six snow/ice density combination schemes were adopted. The results show the averaged monthly sea ice freeboard from ICESat-2 ATL20 product well captures the seasonal variation of sea ice freeboard and sea ice growth in Arctic winter, which can be further used to estimate SIT. The difference of monthly SIT from different snow and ice density schemes is smaller than that caused by snow depth. Overall, the largest difference caused by snow depth in mean SIT is ~0.50 m, while that caused by the snow and ice density is ~0. 15 m. The best parameter scheme of SIT inversion using ICESat-2 needs to be further investigated using field measurements in the future.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553955","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0605403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553955","sea ice thickness;sea ice freeboard;ICESat-2;snow depth;sea and ice density;Arctic","Microwave integrated circuits;Snow;Sea measurements;Estimation;Arctic;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Remote sensing","climatology;ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice;snow","Arctic sea ice thickness estimation;different parameter schemes;Arctic monthly sea ice thickness;ICESat-2 gridded monthly sea ice freeboard product;ice parameters;auxiliary data;SIT retrievals;snow depth data;microwave remote sensing;reanalysis data;averaged monthly sea ice freeboard;ICESat-2 ATL20 product;sea ice growth;Arctic winter;monthly SIT;different snow;ice density schemes;largest difference;mean SIT;parameter scheme;SIT inversion;ICESat-2 needs;size 0.5 m;size 15.0 m","","","","10","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome such a limitation, a method of retrieving Arctic basin-scale ice thickness is developed. The physical background of this method is that the scattering optical thickness at microwave frequencies within the freeboard layer is linearly proportional to the physical thickness of the ice freeboard. In this study, we relate the optical thickness estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with ice freeboard estimated from the CryoSat-2 (CS2) by employing a piecewise linear fit. The results show a strong linear relationship between the AMSR2-estimated and CS2-measured ice freeboards with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and bias and RMSE of 0.0001 and 0.04 m, respectively; this evidence suggests that the method can provide Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard with a comparable accuracy level of CS2. The method is also applied to estimate ice freeboard for the periods of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) (1978-1987) and AMSR-E (2002-2011). It is shown that the area-averaged ice freeboard has decreased significantly with the linear trends of 1.5 cm/decade. In addition, there seems to be a change of ice freeboard distributions over the Arctic. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the ice thickness retrieval by using the hydrostatic balance equation, showing that operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval will be possible from satellite passive microwave measurements if a realistic snow depth on sea ice is employed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3026949","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean government (MSIP)(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A6A3A03032352); NASA Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)(grant numbers:NASA 80GSFC18C0102); Space Core Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2018M1A3A3A02065661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223741","Ice freeboard;passive microwave remote sensing;sea ice thickness;sea ice;surface emissivity","Sea ice;Microwave measurement;Snow;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave radiometry","hydrological techniques;ice;microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radiometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Arctic basin-scale sea ice thickness;satellite passive microwave measurements;Arctic basin-scale ice thickness;scattering optical thickness;microwave frequencies;freeboard layer;physical thickness;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2;CryoSat-2;AMSR2-estimated;CS2-measured ice freeboards;Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard;area-averaged ice freeboard;ice freeboard distributions;operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval;size 50.0 cm;size 1.0E-4 m;size 0.04 m","","3","","38","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the present study, SIT estimates derived from ICESat-2 are examined using three retrieval methods, namely, two buoyancy methods with the merged snow depth and empirical snow depth (BMA and BME, respectively) and one empirical estimation method (EEM), and these estimates are compared to near-simultaneous airborne measurements from the IceBird mission in April 2019. Overall, the ICESat-2 total freeboard registers quite well with that from the near-concurrent IceBird mission with a mean bias of 2.5 cm, which demonstrates the high reliability of ICESat-2 data for SIT estimation. However, the much more evident difference between SIT estimations than total freeboard from ICESat-2 and IceBird indicates that other parameters (e.g., snow depth and snow/ice densities) may bring increased uncertainties to the SIT estimation.

For frozen sea, a notable difference was observed between the measured MSL and ground-truth MSL values. This difference was caused by the combined thickness of snow and ice above the frozen sea surface, also known as the total freeboard. Assuming the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied, total freeboard was converted to ice thickness.

This simulation-based study highlights the importance of sea-ice roughness parameterization in the context of radar altimetry. This work provides a new sea-ice roughness parameterization in the form of an elevation spectrum developed from field campaign data. The formulation of this elevation spectrum is partly based on the generalized power law. Simulations have been developed to predict electromagnetic scattering from surfaces described by the new spectrum, with a focus on the X-band (10 GHz) scattering with nadir incidence. In this work, both the analytical small slope approximation and numerically exact Method of Moments are applied to various sea-ice surface spectra, representing a wide range of surface roughness conditions. The results show that the normalized radar cross section of the sea-ice interface varies significantly depending on the surface elevation spectrum and the statistics of the rough interface. Comparisons with numerically exact methods show that analytical approximations to rough surface scattering work reasonably well for the cases considered here, except at large scattering angles.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3077394","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N0001421WX00025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434392","Radar altimetry;rough surface scattering;sea-ice thickness","Sea surface;Surface roughness;Sea ice;Rough surfaces;Correlation;Sea measurements;Radar","electromagnetic wave scattering;ice;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;rough surfaces;sea ice;surface roughness","rough surface scattering model comparisons;sea ice;sea-ice thickness;microwave radar altimetry;radar measurements;roughness characteristics;altimetry-based thickness estimates;simulation-based study highlights;sea-ice roughness parameterization;sea-ice surface spectra;surface roughness conditions;normalized radar cross section;sea-ice interface varies;surface elevation spectrum;rough interface;rough surface scattering work;frequency 10.0 GHz","","","","19","USGov","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effect of surface roughness on Γ is neglected when only considering signals of coherent reflection. In practice, Γ at the specular point is first generated using TDS-1 data. Afterwards, SIT is calculated from TDS-1 Γ based on the proposed reflectivity model, and verified with two sets of reference SIT data; one is obtained by the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, and the other is the combined SMOS/Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) measurements. This analysis is performed on the data with SIT less than 1m. Through comparison, good consistency between the derived TDS-1 SIT and the reference SIT is obtained, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 and a root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of 9.39 cm with SMOS, and an r of 0.67 and an RMSD of 9.49 cm with SMOS/SMAP, which demonstrates the applicability of the developed model and the utility of TDS-1 data for SIT estimation.

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900079","Arctic;Antarctic;sea ice;bistatic radar;reflectometry;numerical solution;satellite missions","Sea ice;Reflectometry;Sea measurements;Thickness measurement;Arctic;Satellites","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","snow cover;melt pond faction;bistatic reflection;melt pond water;bistatic radar reflectometry;polar sea ice;melt pond fraction measurements;Antarctic sea ice covers;reflected signals;sea ice thickness measurement;ice volume;bottom ice-water interface;free-board height;Arctic sea ice covers;sea ice behaviors;Kirchhoff simulator;numerical Maxwell model;cryospheric science issues","","3","","29","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On first-year sea ice (FYI), spatiotemporal variations in snow properties can cause the Ku-band main radar scattering horizon to appear above the snow/sea ice interface. This can increase the estimated sea ice freeboard by several centimeters, leading to FYI thickness overestimations. This article examines the expected changes in Ku-band main scattering horizon and its impact on FYI thickness estimates, with variations in snow temperature, salinity, and density derived from ten naturally occurring Arctic FYI Cases encompassing saline/nonsaline, warm/cold, simple/complexly layered snow (4-45 cm) overlying FYI (48-170 cm). Using a semi-empirical modeling approach, snow properties from these Cases are used to derive layer-wise brine volume and dielectric constant estimates, to simulate the Ku-band main scattering horizon and delays in radar propagation speed. Differences between modeled and observed FYI thickness are calculated to assess sources of error. Under both cold and warm conditions, saline snow covers are shown to shift the main scattering horizon above from the snow/sea ice interface, causing thickness retrieval errors. Overestimates in FYI thicknesses of up to 65% are found for warm, saline snow overlaying thin sea ice. Our simulations exhibited a distinct shift in the main scattering horizon when the snow layer densities became greater than 440 kg/m3, especially under warmer snow conditions. Our simulations suggest a mean Ku-band propagation delay for snow of 39%, which is higher than 25%, suggested in previous studies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2966432","Norges Forskningsråd; KLIMAFORSK programme(grant numbers:#240639); Centre of Ice, Climate and Ecosystems; Norsk Polarinstitutt; N-ICE project; Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway; Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:#15K16135,#24-4175); Centre for Earth Observation Science; University of Manitoba; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Polar Knowledge Canada(grant numbers:#NST-1718-0024); Natural Environment Research Council(grant numbers:NE/M005852/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000883","Radar altimetry;sea ice;snow","Snow;Sea ice;Arctic;Scattering;Ocean temperature;Salinity (geophysical);Temperature measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Ku-band main scattering horizon;snow temperature;Arctic FYI Cases;semiempirical modeling approach;dielectric constant estimates;modeled thickness;saline snow covers;thickness retrieval errors;FYI thicknesses;FYI thickness overestimations;estimated sea ice freeboard;Ku-band main radar scattering horizon;Arctic sea ice thickness estimates;snow properties;norwegian arctic;first-year sea ice thickness;modeled Ku-band altimeter estimates;snow property controls;mean Ku-band propagation delay;warmer snow conditions;snow layer densities","","11","","67","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The partially coherent approach of dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) has been extensively applied to study the wave propagation and scattering inside dense media such as terrestrial snow [1-5]. In the DMRT partially coherent approach, the coherent part is obtained by solving Maxwell's equations over several cubic wavelengths of statistically homogeneous snow volume to compute the phase matrix, the extinction coefficient, the effective propagation constants and the effective permittivity. Solving Maxwell's equations accounts for the coherent near field and intermediate field interactions within several cubic wavelengths. The phase matrix is then substituted into the radiative transfer equation which constitutes the incoherent part of DMRT. The DMRT equation is then solved to include incoherent interactions and volume/surface interactions. This approach is appropriate when the snow layers are electrically thick such that the coherent far field interaction cancels out over statistical average. This is true for many applications in terrestrial snow remote sensing where the wavelength is 1 ~ 3 cm and the snow depth can be several decimeters to meters. On the other hand, snow on sea ice is typically thin of 10 ~ 20cm with a decreasing trend over the western Arctic [6]. The local wave interaction arising from these thin layers are largely coherent. And in the backscattering direction of the active remote sensing, the coherent wave interaction can extend to far field giving rise to backscattering enhancement phenomena [1]. These short-range and long-range coherent wave effects are not captured by DMRT. In [7], a fully coherent snowpack scattering model is developed by solving the Maxwell's equation directly over the entire domain of snowpack on top of a dielectric half-space. The half-space represents the soil ground under the terrestrial snow or the sea ice below the snow cover across the Arctic Ocean. This is applicable when the sea ice thickness is larger than the penetration depth, depending on the wave frequency of the incidence waves. Effects of the half-space are included in the volume integral equation by the half-space dyadic Green's function. The snow volume is represented by bicontinuous media [8] and discretized into cubes. The method of moments (MoM) is then used to solve the volume integral equation with a pulse basis function and point matching, leading to discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adapted for the kernel of the half-space dyadic Green's function to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication in the iterative linear system solver [9]. For the first time, the scattering matrix of the snowpack is computed using this fully coherent approach of NMM3D, including both magnitude and phase. This allows the modeling of the coherence matrix and speckle statistics. Backscattering enhancement effects are also exhibited, and for a homogeneous snowpack of moderate optical thickness, the overall trend of the bistatic scattering pattern from the fully coherent approach agrees with the results of DMRT. In this paper, the fully coherent approach is improved by implementing the periodic boundary condition. The periodic Green's function in half space is used. The incorporation of the periodic boundary condition removes the edge diffraction artifacts from the finite computational domain and produces more physically plausible results. We also extend the fully coherent approach to compute the brightness temperatures of the snowpack following the reciprocity principle. This approach accounts for an arbitrary temperature profile of the snowpack and includes coherent effects in the thin layer together with fully coherent volume-surface interactions.

Due to the interference between the signal components from the air–ice and ice–water interfaces, the reflection coefficient experiences an oscillating pattern versus elevation angle so that detecting sea ice using the power or amplitude of the reflected global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal has to choose a suitable satellite to reduce the influence of the oscillating pattern. A sea ice surface is more stable and presents higher correlation than a dynamic ocean surface, this article explores the potential of detecting and measuring sea ice using the coherency of reflected GNSS signal for coastal scenario. Experimental results show that phase coherency can significantly detect sea ice without strictly limiting elevation and azimuth angle. This article also is to is to explore the potential of retrieving sea ice thickness using the oscillating phase pattern versus elevation angle. The phase compensation and the dual-polarization observation are proposed to remove the delay phase between the direct and reflected signal from the estimated phase of the reflected GNSS signal. The results show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating phase pattern, respectively, have an inversely proportional and positively linear relationship with sea ice thickness. Simulation shows that, compared to the oscillating amplitude, the oscillating frequency is a better choice to measure sea ice thickness. The frequency of the dual-polarization oscillating pattern could provide the measurement performance with a root-mean-square error of 0.05 m.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3133431","China Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program(grant numbers:BX20200039); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42104031); Financial Support for BeiDou Technology Achievement Transformation and Industrialization of Beihang(grant numbers:BARI2003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9645268","Coastal global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R);correlation time;dual-polarization observation;phase compensation;random walk test;sea ice detection;sea ice thickness","Sea ice;Ice;Sea measurements;Global navigation satellite system;Permittivity;Atmospheric modeling;Sea surface","geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice","reflected GNSS signal;oscillating phase pattern;sea ice thickness;oscillating amplitude;dual-polarization oscillating pattern;sea ice detection;coastal GNSS reflectometry;three-layerair-ice-water reflection model;reflection coefficient;elevation angle;signal components;reflected global navigation satellite system signal;sea ice surface","","3","","53","CCBY","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer from Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. is China’s first commercial GNSS-R instrument. On July 3, 2021, this payload was equipped on the Jilin-1 wide-range 01B satellite (J1-01B) developed by Changguang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. and entered the polar orbit with the height about 500km from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.The attitude of J1-01B is stable to the ground within 0.1 degrees, which can guarantee the high accuracy of GNSS-R antenna gain model on the detection of sea surface wind speed and direction, soil moisture and etc. Meanwhile, its orbital characteristics ensure that its trajectory can cover the north and south poles of the earth, providing opportunities for researches on sea-ice detection and sea-ice thickness retrieval. The payload supports the mutual switching between dual system (GPS L1 or BDS B1) signal mode and dual working mode (generate the doppler delay maps (DDM) in manual-adjustable resolution on the satellite, or collect intermediate frequency (IF) data with 58Mb/s rate), which guarantees the verification and continuous development of multi-system compatibility, data quality analysis and application scenario expansion.After two weeks of satellite’s launch, the satellite has entered normal working mode. In two periods from 6:0 to 6:15 and from 7:32 to 7:42 on July 16, 2021, GNSS-R data were collected in DDMs as well as IFs formats, when J1-01B was over the Pacific Ocean. And L1a DDMs with the horseshoe shape were generated with correction from raw DDMs, as well as from IFs.The GNSS-R instrument on the Jilin-1 wide 01B satellite is an important component of the Yunyao constellation plan, which would provide rich and stable data, and be an important role in global and regional exploration in aerospace, meteorology, ocean, earthquake and other fields.","","978-1-6654-1782-2","10.1109/GNSSR53802.2021.9617716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617716","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS);GNSS Reflectometry;Hydrology;Remote Sensing","Global navigation satellite system;Sea surface;Satellites;Wind speed;Instruments;Reflectometry;Delays","aerospace instrumentation;atmospheric techniques;Global Positioning System;oceanographic techniques;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;wind","GNSS Reflectometer remote sensing mission;Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry;GNSS signals;sea level;ice density;space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer;Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co;China's first commercial GNSS-R instrument;Jilin-1 wide-range 01B;Changguang Satellite Technology Co;polar orbit;GNSS-R antenna gain model;orbital characteristics;sea-ice detection;sea-ice thickness retrieval;dual system;GPS L1;BDS B1;dual working mode;Doppler delay maps;multisystem compatibility;data quality analysis;application scenario expansion;normal working mode;Jilin-1 wide 01B;Yunyao constellation plan;earthquake;Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center","","","","16","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it remains uncertain how the Ku-band radar interacts with the vast range of scatterers that can be present within the satellite footprint, including sea ice with varying physical properties and multiscale roughness, snow cover, and leads. Here, we present a numerical model designed to simulate delay-Doppler synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter echoes from snow-covered sea ice, such as those detected by Cryosat-2. Backscattered echoes are simulated directly from triangular facet-based models of actual sea ice topography generated from Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper data, as well as virtual statistical models simulated artificially. We use these waveform simulations to investigate the sensitivity of SAR altimeter echoes to variations in satellite parameters (height, pitch, and roll) and sea ice properties (physical properties, roughness, and presence of water). We show that the conventional Gaussian assumption for sea ice surface roughness may be introducing significant error into the Cryosat-2 waveform retracking process. Compared to a more representative lognormal surface, an echo simulated from a Gaussian surface with rms roughness height of 0.2 m underestimates the ice freeboard by 5 cm-potentially underestimating sea ice thickness by around 50 cm. We present a set of “ideal” waveform shape parameters simulated for sea ice and leads to inform existing waveform classification techniques. This model will ultimately be used to improve retrievals of key sea ice properties, including freeboard, surface roughness, and snow depth, from SAR altimeter observations.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2889763","European Space Agency(grant numbers:ESA/4000125582/18/I-NS); European Space Agency Snow Project “STSE - Arctic+”(grant numbers:ESA/AO/1-8377/15/I-NB); SKIM Mission Science Study Project “SKIM-SciSoc”(grant numbers:ESA RFP 3-15456/18/NL/CT/gp); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8625441","Numerical analysis;modeling;radar altimetry;radar scattering;sea ice;snow;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea surface;Surface topography;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea ice;Numerical models","numerical analysis;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;snow;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar","facet-based numerical model;SAR altimeter echoes;heterogeneous sea ice surfaces;pan-Arctic sea ice thickness;unprecedented spatial coverage;physical properties;multiscale roughness;snow cover;delay-Doppler synthetic aperture radar altimeter echoes;snow-covered sea ice;backscattered echoes;triangular facet-based models;actual sea ice topography;Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper data;virtual statistical models;waveform simulations;sea ice surface roughness;Cryosat-2 waveform retracking process;representative lognormal surface;Gaussian surface;ice freeboard;SAR altimeter observations;Ku-band radar;sea ice properties;waveform classification techniques","","27","","68","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the current monitoring techniques could not detect the basic sea ice physical parameters in an automatic and accurate way, which is far away from the needs of marine production and navigation. At present, the most used sea ice monitoring methods based on naked eyes and equipment are time-consuming and labor-expensive. While the methods utilizing satellite remote sensing and radar observation station are highly limited by the accuracy and cost. In this paper, a method integrating image processing and machine learning technologies is proposed to automatically obtain the multi-parameters of sea ice, which include sea ice thickness, density, size distribution, and types. Our experiment results show that the average measurement error of thickness was less than 4 cm, the intensity was 2.8%, the size distribution was 5.8%, and the accuracy rate of type classification was 95%. This method has the advantage of easy operation, high precision, and low cost, which can greatly reduce the risk of manual operation and observation errors.

For some SARIn waveforms, the scattering from sea ice at the satellite nadir is successfully separated from returns originating from off-nadir leads. An average bias of -1.8 cm is found for absolute sea ice elevations when using a 50% threshold retracker. It is shown that including multiple SARIn peaks and the associated phase difference in the processing does not introduce any bias on the average sea ice freeboard heights compared with the estimates from regular SAR processing schemes, while significantly increasing the number of valid sea surface height retrievals (+55%) and the number of freeboard estimates in the coastal domain and in multi-year ice regions (~3 times). This results in an average ~34% reduction of the gridded random freeboard uncertainty, corresponding to a ~20% reduction of the gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty. The results of this work show that SARIn acquisitions over Arctic sea ice provide improved spatial coverage and denser sampling of sea level and sea ice freeboard compared with the SAR mode, with accuracy being largely driven by the retracking algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3022522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205871","CryoSat-2 (CS2);interferometry;radar altimetry;retracking;sea ice;swath processing","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Uncertainty;Spaceborne radar","height measurement;ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;synthetic aperture radar","single SARIn waveforms;Arctic sea ice;absolute sea ice elevations;including multiple SARIn peaks;average sea ice;valid sea surface height retrievals;multiyear ice regions;gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty;SARIn acquisitions;sea level;multipeak retracking;CryoSat-2 SARIn waveforms;pulse-limited radar altimeter;Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric mode;ice sheets;ice caps;CS2 SARIn data;multiple coherent peaks;CS2 SARIn waveforms;valid height estimate;size -1.8 cm","","","","59","CCBY","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rapidly changing sea ice environment and increased human activities in polar regions drive the demand for sea ice monitoring. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely adopted for sea ice sensing due to its all-weather, high spatial resolution, and day-and-night imaging capabilities. Previous reviews have addressed sea ice sensing based on various applications and sensors. However, no meta-analysis has been performed to specifically explore spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing. Therefore, this study aims to provide a meta-analysis of spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing by investigating 182 articles published in the last decade. Sea ice sensing applications for retrieving four key geophysical parameters (sea ice types, concentration, thickness, and motion) as well as SAR scattering characteristics analysis for sea ice are included. The review database was created with 15 fields including quantitative and qualitative perspectives, such as SAR frequency, polarization mode, methodology, evaluation metrics, etc. This meta-analysis aims to provide comparisons among different techniques and identify current challenges to determine effective methods for sea ice sensing. Overall, a snapshot of spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing is presented through the meta-analysis, which could benefit researchers for future studies to advance this field.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3194324","Canada First Research Excellence Fund; Ocean Frontier Institute; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-2017-04508); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842316","Meta-analysis;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);sea ice classification;sea ice concentration;sea ice drift;sea ice sensing;sea ice thickness (SIT)","Sea ice;Ice;Sensors;Synthetic aperture radar;Monitoring;Spaceborne radar;Ocean temperature","oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","meta-analysis;sea ice monitoring;rapidly changing sea ice environment;spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing;sea ice sensing applications;sea ice types","","4","","165","CCBY","27 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500-1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500-1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500-1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts. We also describe the remaining questions and challenges to be addressed in advancing to future spaceborne operation of this technology along with recommendations for future research activities.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3073286","NASA's Instrument Incubator(grant numbers:NNX14AE68G); Cryospheric Science(grant numbers:80NSSC18K0550,NNX14AH91G); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1838401); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:LE150100047,DP170102373); Jet Propulsion Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404821","Earth observations;microwave radiometry","Microwave radiometry;Microwave measurement;Sensors;Frequency measurement;Ocean temperature;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave FET integrated circuits","hydrological techniques;moisture;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;reviews;salinity (geophysical);sea ice;soil","surface soil moisture;sea surface salinity;sea ice thickness;brightness temperature measurements;passive microwave measurements;microwave radiometry;ice sheets;vegetation canopies;radiofrequency interference;soil freeze-thaw state;frequency 500.0 MHz to 1400.0 MHz","","9","","106","CCBY","14 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two important tasks are the classification of sea ice and the determination of sea ice thickness, which can be achieved by considering the specific scattering mechanisms of the different ice types. This paper describes a three-component scattering model to decompose polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data of sea ice. The total backscatter is modeled as the incoherent summation of surface, double-bounce, volume, and residual components. The proposed model extends the volume scattering contribution of sea ice by considering transmission, extinction, and refraction effects. The model is validated using C-band Radarsat-2 quad-polarization data acquired over sea ice in the Bohai Sea. The results show that the proposed polarimetric decomposition approach helps to distinguish different ice types and offers a proxy for sea ice thickness.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2356552","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41306193,60890075); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918375","Polarimetric radar;scattering;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Polarimetric radar;scattering;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Scattering;Sea surface;Solid modeling;Covariance matrices;Synthetic aperture radar","geophysical image processing;image classification;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","polarimetric decomposition method;Bohai Sea;C-band PolSAR data;synthetic aperture radar;sea ice classification;sea ice thickness;three-component scattering model;total backscatter model;volume scattering contribution;transmission effects;extinction effects;refraction effects;C-band Radarsat-2 quad-polarization data","","20","","35","IEEE","8 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the distance from the spacecraft to the earth's surface via the roundtrip travel time of individual laser pulses. GLAS utilized pulsed lasers and a direct detection receiver consisting of a silicon avalanche photodiode and a waveform digitizer. Early in the mission, the peak power of the received signal from snow and ice surfaces was found to span a wider dynamic range than anticipated, often exceeding the linear dynamic range of the GLAS 1064-nm detector assembly. The resulting saturation of the receiver distorted the recorded signal and resulted in range biases as large as ~50 cm for ice- and snow-covered surfaces. We developed a correction for this “saturation range bias” based on laboratory tests using a spare flight detector, and refined the correction by comparing GLAS elevation estimates with those derived from Global Positioning System surveys over the calibration site at the salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Applying the saturation correction largely eliminated the range bias due to receiver saturation for affected ICESat measurements over Uyuni and significantly reduced the discrepancies at orbit crossovers located on flat regions of the Antarctic ice sheet.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2702126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990535","Ice sheets;laser ranging;lidar;remote sensing;satellite laser altimetry","Optical surface waves;Measurement by laser beam;Receivers;Surface emitting lasers;Detectors;Ice","geophysical signal processing;glaciology;Global Positioning System;height measurement;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice;snow;vegetation","ICESAT-GLAS altimetry measurement;signal dynamic range;saturation correction;NASA Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite;AD 2003;AD 2009;satellite-based global lidar measurement;Earth ice sheet elevations;sea-ice thickness;vegetation canopy structure;Geoscience Laser Altimeter System;spacecraft;laser pulses;silicon avalanche photodiode;waveform digitizer;GLAS 1064-nm detector;ice-covered surfaces;snow-covered surfaces;spare flight detector;GLAS elevation estimation;Global Positioning System surveys;salar de Uyuni;Bolivia;ICESat measurements;Antarctic ice sheet","","20","","29","OAPA","25 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, experimental airborne campaigns were conducted in both Artic and Antarctica, within the NASA's UWBRAD project, by using a wide band radiometer operating in the range 0.5-2 GHz, aimed at investigating the temperature profiles of ice sheets and the sea ice thickness. By leveraging the results of UWBRAD system, a new mission concept was proposed to ESA Earth Explorer 10 and 11 (called CryoRad) and NASA EVI-6 (called PolarRad) featuring a spacebome 0.4-2 GHz nadir-looking microwave radiometer for the monitoring of polar regions. Even though the main goals of all these sensors are related to observables such as soil moisture, ocean salinity, and geophysical parameters of the cryosphere, all of them suffer from the emission due the atmosphere. In the spectral range comprised between 0.5 and 2 GHz the atmosphere is considered almost transparent, being the major contributions to the emission due to the water vapor (in both physical phases) and to the molecular oxygen, however a clear assessment is still lacking in literature. The aim of this paper is to provide an accurate estimate of the atmospheric effect on measured TB from space at low frequency for different climate scenario by using a combination of in-situ data (i.e. radio-sounding) and microwave emission model.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554138","Microwave radiometry;atmospheric emission;water vapor;liquid content","Earth;Microwave measurement;Microwave integrated circuits;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Satellite broadcasting;NASA","atmospheric composition;atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;atmospheric humidity;glaciology;radiometry;sea ice","atmospheric emission;low microwave frequencies;site-based analysis;L-band passive microwave radiometer satellites;Earth Observation;microwave radiometers;P-band;cryospheric;ocean science;Earth processes;particular campaigns;experimental airborne campaigns;NASA's UWBRAD project;wide band radiometer;temperature profiles;ice sheets;sea ice thickness;UWBRAD system;mission concept;ESA Earth Explorer 10;NASA EVI-6;ocean salinity;spectral range;atmospheric effect;microwave emission model;nadir-looking microwave radiometer;CryoRad;frequency 0.5 GHz to 2.0 GHz;frequency 0.4 GHz to 2.0 GHz","","","","13","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a comparison of SMAP and SMOS measured brightness temperatures and translate a validated retrieval algorithm for the thickness of thin sea ice from SMOS to SMAP radiometer observations. For October to December all observations of SMAP in forward and backward direction are compared as daily averages and found with low RMSD of 2.25K and 2.42K in TB,v and TB,h, respectively. The mean of forward and backward observations from SMAP are mapped to SMOS equivalent brightness temperatures using a linear regression. SMAP was found to yield lower brightness temperatures compared to SMOS by about 5K in both polarizations while difference decreases with increasing brightness temperatures. An existing ice thickness retrieval for SMOS using averaged brightness temperatures in the incidence angles range of 40° to 50° is transferred to SMAP using another linear regression. Ice thicknesses retrieved from both sensors show good agreement with a correlation of r = 0.969 and RMSD of 3.31 cm for ice thicknesses from 1 cm to 50 cm.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730367","SMAP;SMOS;sea ice;ice thickness","Sea ice;Brightness temperature;Ice thickness;Arctic;Ocean temperature;Sea surface","atmospheric radiation;radiometry;sea ice","SMOS radiometer observation;SMAP radiometer observation;sea ice retrieval algorithm;SMOS brightness temperature measurement;SMAP brightness temperature measurement;radiation budget;Earth climate system;sea ice thickness","","2","","4","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this method is not very well suited for dielectrics with losses several orders high and, therefore, cannot be considered as a general method of subsurface characterization. In this article, we introduce a new idea of near-field interferometry, which can be used to characterize higher loss dielectrics with dimensions very low compared with the wavelength. It is shown that, in low frequencies, there is a noticeable variation in the field components with different medium dielectric properties and thickness, and these changes can be detected externally from near-field measurements by varying receiver distance and the operating frequency. The proposed method is tested on a lossy sea ice model in the presence of a horizontal electric dipole, and the variation in field magnitudes is observed for thickness up to 5 m. Since practical sea ice bulks have thicknesses of a similar range, the near-field interferometry appears to be a promising approach to determine sea ice thickness from noninvasive measurements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3040261","Office of Naval Research Global, London, U.K., as a part of the NICOP project “Non-Invasive Measurement of Sea Ice Thickness Using Low Frequency EM Waves”(grant numbers:N62909-19-1-2013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288919","Characterization;dipole radiation;interferometry;layered media;lossy dielectric;low-frequency;near field;Sommerfeld integral","Receivers;Dielectrics;Interferometry;Dielectric losses;Sea ice;Sea measurements;Frequency measurement","electric field measurement;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","lossy sea ice model;practical sea ice bulks;low-frequency near-field interferometry;far-field interferometry;subsurface characterization;dielectric properties;low-loss subsurface materials;operating wavelength;higher loss dielectrics;lossy dielectric characterization","","","","37","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
