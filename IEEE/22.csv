The remotely sensed SIC products include the Chinese Feng Yun-3B with enhanced NASA Team (NT2) sea ice algorithm (FY3B/NT2), the Chinese Feng Yun-3C with NT2 (FY3C/NT2), the DMSP SSMIS with Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm (SSMIS/ASI), and the GCOM-W AMSR2 with NASA Bootstrap (BT) algorithm (AMSR2/BT). The OISSTV2 (NOAA Optimum Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily Temperature Analysis Version 2) dataset was adopted as a reference to compare and evaluate the performance of four satellite-based SIC products. The results show that remotely sensed SIC values are generally in good consistency with OISSTV2. Meanwhile, it is observed that different products have different bias in polar regions. Overall, the SSMIS/ASI product has better performance during the whole period, demonstrating that ASI algorithm may be more potential in SIC estimation. Our results also illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristic of discrepancy between microwave remotely sensed SIC products and reanalysis dataset for the whole Arctic and Antarctic regions. The large difference for all the four SIC products mostly occurs in summer and marginal ice zone, indicating a great deal of uncertainty of satellite SIC products in this period and areas. The results will be useful to find possible errors in the satellite SIC products for further algorithm improvement.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8899166","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8899166","microwave remote sensing;sea ice concentration;reanalysis data;consistency","Silicon carbide;Arctic;Antarctica;Remote sensing;Sea ice;Satellites","geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","reanalysis dataset;polar regions;sea ice concentration products;reanalysis SIC dataset;Chinese Feng Yun-3B;Chinese Feng Yun-3C;DMSP SSMIS;GCOM-W AMSR2;NASA Bootstrap algorithm;OISSTV2 dataset;satellite-based SIC products;remotely sensed SIC values;ASI algorithm;SIC estimation;marginal ice zone;satellite SIC products;algorithm improvement;Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice algorithm;SSMIS-ASI;NASA Team sea ice algorithm;microwave remotely sensed sea ice concentration;remotely sensed sea ice concentrations;Arctic region;Antarctic region","","1","","5","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, it's often hard to guarantee the abundance of sea-ice distribution of each different scene class, which causes unsatisfactory classification results. Therefore, it is of considerable practical value to research on sea-ice images simulation.

Simulation results demonstrate backscattering enhancement effects and coherent thin layer effects. The model is applied to study microwave signatures of the Arctic sea ice where the snow cover thickness has rapidly decreased. Microwave signatures are important in classification of sea-ice types and in quantitative characterization of snow cover properties. Both have strong impacts on the thermodynamics of sea ice. In the fully coherent model, a half-space dyadic Green's function is used in the volume integral equation to represent the effects of the underlying sea ice. Discrete dipole approximation is used to solve the volume integral equations, where parallel fast Fourier transform technique is utilized to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplications.

In contrast to global warming sea-ice around Antarctica exhibits an expansion whereas in the sector-wise studies it shows increasing and decreasing patterns. In total, SIE of Antarctica exhibits positive yearly trends ( 24.9±4.4 103km2 year-1; 2.1±0.4 %decade-1). The Weddell sea sector shows an increase in SIE trend (5.2±1.8 103km2 year-1; 2.6±0.9 %decade-1), attributed to atmosphere and ocean sea ice interactions such as air temperature, pressure, ocean currents and wind components. The seasonal trends of this sector show both positive and negative trends controlled by the thermodynamic effect of winds. Significant positive trends were observed in the summer (20.4±5.4 103km2year-1) and the spring (1.9±5.3 103km2 year-1) seasons.

However, it is also true that not all the information is relevant. It may be redundant, corrupted, or unnecessary for the given task, hence decreasing the performance of the algorithms. Therefore, it is crucial to select an optimal set of image attributes which provides the relevant information content to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the image interpretation and retrieval of geophysical parameters. Comprehensive studies have been focused on the analysis of relevant features for sea ice analysis obtained from different sensors, especially synthetic aperture radar. However, the outcomes of these studies are mostly data and application-dependent and can, therefore, rarely be generalized. In this article, we employ a feature selection method based on graph Laplacians, which is fully automatic and easy to implement. The proposed approach assesses relevant information on a global and local level using two metrics and selects relevant features for different regions of an image according to their physical characteristics and observation conditions. In the recent study, we investigate the effectiveness of this approach for sea ice classification, using different multi-sensor data combinations. Experiments show the advantage of applying multi-sensor data sets and demonstrate that the attributes selected by our method result in high classification accuracies.

The two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage of the imaged ground area, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. Whereas single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, dual polarimetric, or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid polarimetric acquisitions offer a trade-off between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of hybrid dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction procedure.

The results show the averaged monthly sea ice freeboard from ICESat-2 ATL20 product well captures the seasonal variation of sea ice freeboard and sea ice growth in Arctic winter, which can be further used to estimate SIT. The difference of monthly SIT from different snow and ice density schemes is smaller than that caused by snow depth. Overall, the largest difference caused by snow depth in mean SIT is ~0.50 m, while that caused by the snow and ice density is ~0. 15 m.

The partially coherent approach of dense media radiative transfer (DMRT) has been extensively applied to study the wave propagation and scattering inside dense media such as terrestrial snow [1-5]. In the DMRT partially coherent approach, the coherent part is obtained by solving Maxwell's equations over several cubic wavelengths of statistically homogeneous snow volume to compute the phase matrix, the extinction coefficient, the effective propagation constants and the effective permittivity. Solving Maxwell's equations accounts for the coherent near field and intermediate field interactions within several cubic wavelengths. The phase matrix is then substituted into the radiative transfer equation which constitutes the incoherent part of DMRT. The DMRT equation is then solved to include incoherent interactions and volume/surface interactions. This approach is appropriate when the snow layers are electrically thick such that the coherent far field interaction cancels out over statistical average. This is true for many applications in terrestrial snow remote sensing where the wavelength is 1 ~ 3 cm and the snow depth can be several decimeters to meters. On the other hand, snow on sea ice is typically thin of 10 ~ 20cm with a decreasing trend over the western Arctic [6]. The local wave interaction arising from these thin layers are largely coherent. And in the backscattering direction of the active remote sensing, the coherent wave interaction can extend to far field giving rise to backscattering enhancement phenomena [1]. These short-range and long-range coherent wave effects are not captured by DMRT. In [7], a fully coherent snowpack scattering model is developed by solving the Maxwell's equation directly over the entire domain of snowpack on top of a dielectric half-space. The half-space represents the soil ground under the terrestrial snow or the sea ice below the snow cover across the Arctic Ocean. This is applicable when the sea ice thickness is larger than the penetration depth, depending on the wave frequency of the incidence waves. Effects of the half-space are included in the volume integral equation by the half-space dyadic Green's function. The snow volume is represented by bicontinuous media [8] and discretized into cubes. The method of moments (MoM) is then used to solve the volume integral equation with a pulse basis function and point matching, leading to discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adapted for the kernel of the half-space dyadic Green's function to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication in the iterative linear system solver [9]. For the first time, the scattering matrix of the snowpack is computed using this fully coherent approach of NMM3D, including both magnitude and phase. This allows the modeling of the coherence matrix and speckle statistics. Backscattering enhancement effects are also exhibited, and for a homogeneous snowpack of moderate optical thickness, the overall trend of the bistatic scattering pattern from the fully coherent approach agrees with the results of DMRT. In this paper, the fully coherent approach is improved by implementing the periodic boundary condition. The periodic Green's function in half space is used. The incorporation of the periodic boundary condition removes the edge diffraction artifacts from the finite computational domain and produces more physically plausible results. We also extend the fully coherent approach to compute the brightness temperatures of the snowpack following the reciprocity principle. This approach accounts for an arbitrary temperature profile of the snowpack and includes coherent effects in the thin layer together with fully coherent volume-surface interactions. This new method circumvents the unrealistic isothermal condition incorrectly assumed in the Kirchhoff approximation approach. The brightness temperatures and backscatters from the fully coherent model are compared with the results of DMRT for various snowpack configurations to understand and to determine the applicability regime of DMRT.","","978-1-5090-6093-1","10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7735538","","Snow;Mathematical model;Media;Scattering;Remote sensing;Sea ice;Backscatter","approximation theory;fast Fourier transforms;Green's function methods;iterative methods;Maxwell equations;oceanographic regions;remote sensing;sea ice;snow","numerical simulation;Maxwell equation;active remote sensing;passive remote sensing;dense media radiative transfer;wave propagation;wave scattering;homogeneous snow volume;extinction coefficient;radiative transfer equation;DMRT equation;volume-surface interactions;snow layer;terrestrial snow remote sensing;snow depth;western Arctic Ocean;local wave interaction;coherent wave interaction;short-range coherent wave effect;long-range coherent wave effect;snowpack scattering model;soil ground;snow cover;sea ice thickness;wave frequency;half-space dyadic Green function;volume integral equation;pulse basis function;point matching;discrete dipole approximation;fast Fourier transform;iterative linear system solver;backscattering enhancement effect;periodic Green function;periodic boundary condition;edge diffraction artifact;brightness temperatures;Kirchhoff approximation approach","","","","9","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our previous study found that SMAP SSS shows signatures consistent with the inter-annual anomalies of observed sea ice concentration and river discharge, but with large uncertainty (~1 psu) compared with limited in-situ data. One of error sources is the un-corrected sea ice contamination effect. The JPL SMAP algorithm retrieves SSS at each wind-salinity-cell if the matchup sea ice concentration (SIC) is less than 3% with no ice correction implemented yet. Since L-band brightness temperature (TB) of sea ice is much higher than that of seawater, SSS retrieved from TB from a field of view (FOV) mixed with water and ice will result in false fresh signature if the sea ice effect is not accurately accounted for. In this study, we develop an empirical observation-driven sea ice correction algorithm. We characterize the sea ice signature using SMAP TB and ancillary SIC data. The sea ice effect is corrected near ice edge where SIC is under a predetermined threshold for SSS retrieval. We consider the seasonal variation of TB over ice to be likely associated with seasonal change of physical temperature and summer melting pond. The sea ice fraction (ICEF) is calculated by integration of SIC over SMAP FOV weighted by antenna gain patterns. An empirical sea ice correction algorithm is proposed. The impact of sea ice correction is demonstrated by comparing TBs with or without sea ice correction.","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323740","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323740","SMAP;radiometer;sea surface salinity;sea ice;Arctic Ocean","Ice;Sea ice;Silicon carbide;Arctic;Sea measurements;Oceans;Social factors;Climate change","ocean temperature;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;rivers;sea ice;seawater;wind","sea ice fraction;empirical sea ice correction algorithm;SMAP SSS retrieval;Arctic Ocean;sea surface salinity;river discharge;sea ice contamination effect;JPL SMAP algorithm;sea ice concentration;sea ice effect;empirical observation-driven sea ice correction algorithm;sea ice signature;ancillary SIC data;SMAP TB data;L-band brightness temperature;wind-salinity-cell","","1","","7","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While rule-based remote-sensing classification methods, such as the threshold method, have been widely used for surveying and mapping polar sea ice leads, they have difficulty in overcoming the problems of noise and poor generalization. In this article, we presented an automated, deep learning sea ice open lead detection network in low wind speed conditions, entropy-weighted network (EW-Net). In EW-Net, a dense block was introduced into a U-Net baseline network to strengthen feature propagation, and an entropy sampling structure was designed to improve the pertinence of the network to leads and alleviate the influence of noise. Furthermore, an entropy-weighted feature fusion block was designed to better restore features. EW-Net was trained on the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset in order to obtain lead maps of different polar regions from Sentinel-1 images. The results showed that the proposed EW-Net model was more effective and more generalizable for polar sea ice lead detection than the threshold method and the deep learning methods U-Net and DeepLab V3 Plus, with an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 0.97. In addition, EW-Net showed advantages in terms of outstanding generalization from cross-sensor image monitoring of leads.

The paper utilizes the Bayesian methodology for sea ice extent retrieval of the CFOSAT scatterometer (CSCAT) data and evaluate the sea ice extent derived from the ice-masked imagery against the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S) data set and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer2 (AMSR2) data set during 2019. The results suggest CSCAT sea ice extent correlates well with the AMSR2 over sea ice concentrations (SIC) 25% for Antarctic, but different seasonally dependent correlations for Arctic.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9883644","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41806209); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2022YQJD22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9883644","sea ice extent;scatterometer;Bayesian method;CSCAT","Microwave integrated circuits;Correlation;Radar measurements;Microwave theory and techniques;Antarctica;Microwave radiometry;Arctic","geophysical image processing;oceanographic regions;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar","sea ice concentrations;polar sea ice extent retrieval;Ku-band dual-polarized rotating fan-beam scatterometer;scatterometer sea ice extent data;CFOSAT scatterometer data;ice-masked imagery;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer2 data;CSCAT sea ice extent;China-France Oceanography Satellite;AD 2018;KNMI;OSI SAF;Bayesian methodology;Special Sensor Microwave Imager-Sounder data;SSMI-S data;AMSR2 data;AD 2019;Arctic Ocean;Antarctic Ocean","","","","7","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main processes of the method include: (1) Classification of sea ice using high resolution satellite images. (2) Extraction of sea ice channels topology based on the classification results.

To provide a solid contact between the probe and ice, we slightly submerge and then freeze the probe's flange in sea water in a cold laboratory with a preset temperature. Once the ice is formed, we conduct a measurement of the complex reflection coefficient in the cold room using a vector network analyzer. To calibrate the system, we propose a set of measurements from air, shorting block (short), and pure methanol to be conducted immediately after. Both the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant as functions of frequency are then derived using a coaxial probe inverse model fed by these data. X-ray microtomography analysis of our samples revealed that the ice formed under the described conditions has completely isotropic microstructure typical for the frazil layer of natural first-year sea ice. To evaluate the experimental system's accuracy, we conducted extensive test measurements of standard materials (saline water, methanol, butanol, and pure ice).

This simulation-based study highlights the importance of sea-ice roughness parameterization in the context of radar altimetry. This work provides a new sea-ice roughness parameterization in the form of an elevation spectrum developed from field campaign data. The formulation of this elevation spectrum is partly based on the generalized power law. Simulations have been developed to predict electromagnetic scattering from surfaces described by the new spectrum, with a focus on the X-band (10 GHz) scattering with nadir incidence. In this work, both the analytical small slope approximation and numerically exact Method of Moments are applied to various sea-ice surface spectra, representing a wide range of surface roughness conditions. The results show that the normalized radar cross section of the sea-ice interface varies significantly depending on the surface elevation spectrum and the statistics of the rough interface. Comparisons with numerically exact methods show that analytical approximations to rough surface scattering work reasonably well for the cases considered here, except at large scattering angles.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3077394","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N0001421WX00025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9434392","Radar altimetry;rough surface scattering;sea-ice thickness","Sea surface;Surface roughness;Sea ice;Rough surfaces;Correlation;Sea measurements;Radar","electromagnetic wave scattering;ice;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;rough surfaces;sea ice;surface roughness","rough surface scattering model comparisons;sea ice;sea-ice thickness;microwave radar altimetry;radar measurements;roughness characteristics;altimetry-based thickness estimates;simulation-based study highlights;sea-ice roughness parameterization;sea-ice surface spectra;surface roughness conditions;normalized radar cross section;sea-ice interface varies;surface elevation spectrum;rough interface;rough surface scattering work;frequency 10.0 GHz","","","","19","USGov","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Geophysical changes in snow cover manifest as differences in dielectric properties, which are detectable in microwave emission and backscatter. Active microwave remote sensing offers improved spatial resolution when compared to passive microwave approaches. We apply our recently developed method that exploits the indirect thermodynamic control of the snow cover on near ice surface geophysical properties. The variance of C-band (5.3 GHz HH-polarization) microwave backscatter in winter (prior to melt) is assessed and is then used to estimate relative snow cover thickness and distribution. We assess the capability of our approach over landfast, first-year sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and evaluate and compare our method against the Canadian Regional Ice Ocean Prediction system and AMSR2 passive microwave snow thickness estimates.

Two sets of spatially and temporally near coincident fully polarimetric acquisitions from the TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-2 satellites are investigated. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a polarimetric feature extraction procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification. Based on the common coherency and covariance matrix, we extract a number of features and analyze the relevance and redundancy by means of mutual information for the purpose of sea ice classification. Coherency matrix based features which require an eigendecomposition are found to be either of low relevance or redundant to other covariance matrix based features, which makes coherency matrix based features dispensable for the purpose of sea ice classification. Among the most useful features for classification are matrix invariant based features (Geometric Intensity, Scattering Diversity, Surface Scattering Fraction). This analysis reveals analogous results for all four acquisitions, in both X-band and C-band frequencies and slightly different for L-band. The subsequent classification produces similarly promising results for all four acquisitions.

During the first part of the study period H S increased, with the largest sails observed in the winters of 2015 and 2016, after which H S declined, suggesting that the most heavily deformed sea ice may have drifted beyond the area surveyed and exited the CA. Our analysis of the interannual and regional variability in sea ice deformation in the western Arctic during the last decade provides an improved understanding of sail height that will help advance ridge parameterizations in sea ice models.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.3004724","NASA(grant numbers:80NSSC17K0006); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(grant numbers:NA14NES4320003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133170","Optical imagery;pressure ridge;sea ice","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea measurements;Pressure measurement;Oceans;Length measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","high-resolution imagery;Digital Mapping System;annual winter NASA Operation IceBridge surveys;late-winter NASA Operation IceBridge surveys;Arctic sea ice;central Arctic;heavily deformed sea ice;interannual variability;regional variability;sea ice deformation;western Arctic;advance ridge parameterizations;sea ice models;winter observations;sea ice pressure ridge sail height;Beaufort sea region;Chukchi sea region","","2","","14","CCBY","3 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, eddy identification and tracking via remote sensing can be a challenging task, since each sensor has some limitations. In order to overcome potential challenges, it is crucial to exploit the complementary information provided by different sensing systems. As one of the steps toward this aim, we have investigated the pertinence of applying the scheme, including a texture features extraction and a superpixel segmentation method, in order to distinguish eddies in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) using multisensor remote sensing data. Nevertheless, not all the images available from various sensors are of actual importance, since they can be corrupted, redundant, or simply unnecessary for a particular task.

In this paper, a convolution neural network (CNN) based method for sea ice recognition (SIR) and estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC) using GNSS-R data is proposed. Specifically, a CNN model is designed to solve the classification problem of SIR and the regression problem of SIC estimation. In the stage of data set construction, first, the global GNSS-R data (TDS-l), in a certain period of time, is spatiotemporally matched with the relatively reliable sea ice data (NSIDC), and then the matched GNSS-R data is extracted to balance the amount of seawater data and sea ice data. In the stage of CNN model construction, the feature learning ability of the model is enhanced by adding convolution layer, pooling layer and full connection layer. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN -based scheme has a higher prediction accuracy of SIR and lower estimation error of SIC than other existing methods.","","978-1-6654-9848-7","10.1109/CISCE55963.2022.9851159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9851159","component;Global Navigation Satellite System;Convolution neural network;TechDemoSat-l;Remote Sensing","Satellites;Climate change;Simulation;Speckle;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Sensors;Convolutional neural networks","geophysical signal processing;geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;oceanographic techniques;regression analysis;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;seawater","sea ice remote sensing;global navigation satellite system reflector technology;convolution neural network based method;sea ice concentration;data set construction;global GNSS-R data;relatively reliable sea ice data;matched GNSS-R data;convolution neural network-based method","","","","11","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was found that both methods could distinguish the crack and small ice, and these two sea ice distribution results were almost similar. The difference between two methods was: image of threshold value method contained disordered spots and isolated small ice, while k-mean method outcome had clear segmentation boundary and ensured completely segmentation region.

Machine learning and deep learning methodology can be utilized to automate ice charting, however, large amounts of reliable training data is crucial for implementing the technology successfully, and training data itself is sparse and costly to obtain in the Arctic areas. To obtain more training data, we proposed a two-stage methodology which incorporate the physics into training dataset generation procedure. Firstly, a physics-based incidence angle aware algorithm was employed for generating better connected and fewer reference classes to be manually labelled for training. Secondly, we enrich the training data to a balanced training set by using the physical knowledge regarding incidence angle dependence of SAR intensity.

Reduced sea ice coverage may open up the Arctic to further exploration of maritime activities, particularly during the summer months. Given such changes, it is important to investigate differences between available sea ice drift products. Products based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR), radar scatterometer, and radiometer are compared for both motion speed and direction within this study. Two C-band SAR and one L-band SAR product are used in the comparison. Differences in temporal and spatial resolutions of the drift estimates spanning from July 2010 until June 2011 are investigated. High temporal and spatial resolution was proven useful to fully capture the sea ice drift in the Fram Strait. For summer coverage, SAR data are a prerequisite and L-band is desirable. The two C-band SAR products have a mean speed correlation of 0.90 and exhibit high conformity, despite being generated by separate processing methods. The L-band SAR product and the scatterometer and radiometer products are to a lower degree in agreement with each other and the C-band SAR products, which may be attributed to the products' dependency on the temporal baseline. Depending on the choice of sensor or combination of sensors, the resulting 12-month mean drift varies between 0.09 and 0.12 m/s excluding L-band SAR. The latter shows a particularly low drift of 0.05 m/s, which we attribute to an over-representation of slow ice.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2506786","Swedish National Space Board and Chalmers Area of Advance Transport; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377006","Radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series;Radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);time series","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites;Arctic;Microwave radiometry;Radar measurements","oceanographic regions;radiometry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice drift product;Arctic sea ice;sea ice drift pattern;sea ice coverage reduction;maritime activity;summer season;synthetic aperture radar;radar scatterometer;radiometer product;C-band SAR product;L-band SAR product;AD 2010 07 to 2011 06;high spatiotemporal resolution;Fram Strait;SAR data;slow ice","","6","","29","IEEE","8 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper describes an analytical method to model electromagnetic scattering from ridges around the VHF range (100–500 MHz) when ridges are modeled as a rough surface over stratified media. Models considering the macroscopic properties of FY and MY ridges relevant to VHF scatter are presented. Simulations show that FY and MY ridges have different scattering characteristics, making it possible to separate the two ice types.

However, due to the diverse types and distribution of sea-ice in various scenes, the categories of sea-ice scenes are indistinct. So a grouping way is primarily introduced to define different sea-ice scenes. These scenes are grouped into six typical categories according to the distribution of sea-ice. Then a transfer learning strategy is used to fine-tune a pre-trained deep convolution neural network model. Finally, using that trained network to classify new sea ice scenes.

The Okhotsk Sea was chosen as a test site. For three well-known scattering models, the performed comparison showed that, at the small incidence angles, the model constructed within the framework of the perturbation method best describes the dependence of the RCS on the incidence angle. However, synchronous measurements in the Ku- and Ka-bands showed that there is an unexplained change in the RCS in the framework of this theoretical model when passing from one frequency range to another.

Previous reviews have addressed sea ice sensing based on various applications and sensors. However, no meta-analysis has been performed to specifically explore spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing. Therefore, this study aims to provide a meta-analysis of spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing by investigating 182 articles published in the last decade. Sea ice sensing applications for retrieving four key geophysical parameters (sea ice types, concentration, thickness, and motion) as well as SAR scattering characteristics analysis for sea ice are included. The review database was created with 15 fields including quantitative and qualitative perspectives, such as SAR frequency, polarization mode, methodology, evaluation metrics, etc. This meta-analysis aims to provide comparisons among different techniques and identify current challenges to determine effective methods for sea ice sensing.

Separation between the low backscatter areas that constitutes oil slicks and newly formed sea ice is therefore important. Here we compare fully polarimetric L-band SAR images overlapping both oil slicks and newly formed sea ice.

Here we demonstrate the influence of undetected cloud on the melt pond retrieval and suggest a masking procedure based on a Bayesian classifier trained using coincident infrared observations of AATSR.

In addition to backscatter coefficients and gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features, sea ice concentration was introduced as a classification basis. To better analyze the backscatter information of sea ice types, we considered two steps that could improve the ScanSAR image quality, the noise floor stripe reduction and the incidence angle normalization. Then, effective GLCM texture characteristics from both polarizations were selected using the proper parameters. The third type of information, sea ice concentration, was extracted from the initial SVM classification result after the optimal SVM model was achieved from the training. The final result was generated by implementing the SVM twice and the decision tree once. Using this method, the classification was improved in two aspects, both of which were related to sea ice concentration. The results showed that the sea ice concentration parameter was effective in dealing with open water and in discriminating pancake ice from old ice. Finally, the maximum likelihood (ML) was run as a comparative test. In conclusion, the sea ice concentration parameter could play a role in SVM classification, and the whole process provided an effective way to classify sea ice using dual polarization ScanSAR data.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2365215","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61132006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967773","Classification;concentration;sea ice;support vector machine (SVM);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Classification;concentration;sea ice;support vector machine (SVM);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Support vector machines;Backscatter;Synthetic aperture radar;Nickel;Noise","decision trees;geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;maximum likelihood estimation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","maximum likelihood;pancake ice;open water;sea ice concentration parameter;decision tree;optimal support vector machine model;gray-level cooccurrence matrix texture characteristics;incidence angle normalization;noise floor stripe reduction;ScanSAR image quality;sea ice types;backscatter information;classification basis;gray-level cooccurrence matrix texture features;backscatter coefficients;dual polarization RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR data;support vector machine-based sea ice classification","","72","","41","IEEE","26 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we employ an automatic sea ice classification algorithm on two sets of spatially and temporally near coincident fully polarimetric acquisitions from the ALOS-2, Radarsat-2, and TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X satellites. Overlapping coincident sea ice freeboard measurements from airborne laser scanner data are used to validate the classification results. The automated sea ice classification algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, we perform a polarimetric feature extraction procedure. Next, the resulting feature vectors are ingested into a trained neural network classifier to arrive at a pixelwise supervised classification. Coherency matrix-based features that require an eigendecomposition are found to be either of low relevance or redundant to other covariance matrix-based features, which makes coherency matrix-based features dispensable for the purpose of sea ice classification. Among the most useful features for classification are matrix invariant-based features (geometric intensity, scattering diversity, and surface scattering fraction). Classification results show that 100% of the open water is separated from the surrounding sea ice and that the sea ice classes have at least 96.9% accuracy. This analysis reveals analogous results for both X-band and C-band frequencies and slightly different for the L-band. The subsequent classification produces similarly promising results for all four acquisitions. In particular, the overlapping image portions exhibit a reasonable congruence of detected sea ice when compared with high-resolution airborne measurements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2809504","Maritime Sicherheit–Echtzeitdienste funding programme, Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Germany; Norges Forskningsråd; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:237906); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:603887,ICE-ARC-064); Centre of Ice, Climate and Ecosystems, Norwegian Polar Institute; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:233896); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8350411","Airborne laser scanner (ALS);artificial neural network (ANN);multifrequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR);near real time (NRT) processing;polarimetry;sea ice","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Temperature measurement;Sea measurements;Neural networks;Arctic","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","X-band SAR;spaceborne synthetic aperture radar polarimetry;Arctic sea ice characterization;temporally near coincident fully polarimetric acquisitions;TanDEM-X satellite;TerraSAR-X satellite;open water;C-band SAR;L-band SAR;high-resolution airborne measurements;detected sea ice;subsequent classification;analogous results;sea ice classes;useful features;covariance matrix-based features;coherency matrix;pixelwise supervised classification;trained neural network classifier;resulting feature vectors;polarimetric feature extraction procedure;automated sea ice classification algorithm;classification results;airborne laser scanner data;coincident sea ice freeboard measurements;Radarsat-2;ALOS-2;automatic sea ice classification algorithm;sea ice analysis;valuable tool","","35","","61","CCBY","26 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, a simple and effective feature selection (FS) was devised so that the input size was significantly reduced (from 128 × 20 to 20) while the classification accuracy was enhanced. To be specific, the feature was selected as the mean value along the delay-axis (128 in length) at each Doppler bin (20 in all). Here, expected classification labels (sea ice/seawater) were obtained based on reference sea ice concentration data collected by multiple passive microwave sensors.

For developing a credible and effective response to oil spill in ice-infested waters, a field experiment was performed on spectrum of oil film in waters with sea ice. In this experiment, four groups of spectrum samples were collected, which were clean sea water, brash ice and even ice and sea water /brash ice /even ice contaminated by diesel and crude oil. The experiment results indicated that: the same sort of oil with different background had different reflectance at the same wavelength, so did the same sort of oil with the same background but different distribution state; nevertheless there were some common characteristics within the same oil. For example, diesel had two apparent characteristics, no matter on the surface of sea water or brash ice or even ice, the first of which was that the reflectance curves of diesel film were first lower and then higher than that of clean sea water, brash ice or even ice according to the wavelength; the second was that the reflectance curves of diesel film were almost equaled to that of the background between 400nm and 510nm in sea water, 410nm and 510nm in brash ice and 490nm and 510nm in even ice. The spectrum curves of crude oil had a representative sphenoid reflectance-peak which appeared between 750nm and 770nm. These characteristics of oil film in terms of ice and oil type could be effectively used to distinct the oil with sea water and sea ice, meanwhile this experiment would improve and facilitate the detecting and monitoring proposal of oil which had been spilled in moving, broken pack ice and fast-ice environment in the ocean.","2153-7003","978-1-4799-7929-5","10.1109/IGARSS.2015.7326562","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7326562","sea ice;oil film;spectrum","Reflectivity;Films;Sea ice;Water pollution;Water;Sea measurements","crude oil;environmental monitoring (geophysics);marine pollution;oil pollution;petroleum;remote sensing;sea ice;spectral analysis","oil film spectral characteristics analysis;sea ice;oil exploration;oil spill;oil film spectrum;sea water;brash ice;ice contamination;diesel film reflectance curve;crude oil spectrum curve;sphenoid reflectance-peak;oil type;oil detection;oil monitoring;wavelength 400 nm;wavelength 510 nm;wavelength 410 nm;wavelength 490 nm","","1","","4","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Satellite remote sensing, specially multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) plays a major role to achieve this goal. Two major objectives in SAR based remote sensing of sea ice is on the one hand to have a large coverage, and on the other hand to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible. A comprehensive set of C- and L- band SAR images were acquired during the course of MOSAiC. In this initial study we evaluate the effects of seasonal changes on C- and L-band backscatter in respect to three different sea ice types, i.e., Young Ice, Smooth Ice and Rough/Deformed Ice along with the performance of sea ice type retrieval of a established algorithm. Areas of deformed, smooth and young sea ice were observed in the vicinity of R/V Polarstern and these areas are included whenever possible in the yearlong time series. For both frequencies a change in all backscatter channels values can be observed during the early melt season. This is first noticeable in the C-band images and later followed by a change in the L-band images, probably caused by their different penetration depth and volume scattering sensitivities.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9553062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9553062","MOSAiC;Sea Ice Type;Polarimetry;SAR;ALOS-2 PALSAR-2;RADARSAT-2","C-band;Atmospheric modeling;Radar polarimetry;Arctic;Synthetic aperture radar;Remote sensing;L-band","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","temporal resolution;AD 2019 09;German research icebreaker Polarstern;mosaic ice floe;MOSAiC;multidisciplinary Arctic expedition;L-band images;C-band images;young sea ice;smooth sea ice;deformed sea ice;sea ice type retrieval;L-band backscatter;seasonal changes;L- band SAR images;radar response;SAR based remote sensing;multifrequency synthetic aperture radar;satellite remote sensing;climate models;atmosphere-ice-ocean system;winter season;high Arctic Ocean;Arctic climate;Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory","","","","8","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a technique for calculating 2-D centimeter-scale surface roughness parameters, including the rms height, correlation length, and form of autocorrelation function, from 3-D terrestrial light detection and ranging data. We demonstrate that a single scale of roughness can be extracted from complex sea ice surfaces, incorporating multiple scales of topography, after sophisticated 2-D detrending, and calculate roughness parameters for a wide range of artificial and natural sea ice surface types. The 2-D technique is shown to be considerably more precise than standard 1-D profiling techniques and can therefore characterize surface roughness as a stationary single-scale process, which a 1-D technique typically cannot do. Sea ice surfaces are generally found to have strongly anisotropic correlation lengths, indicating that microwave scattering models for sea ice should include surface spectra that vary as a function of the azimuthal angle of incident radiation. However, our results demonstrate that there is no fundamental relationship between the rms height and correlation length for sea ice surfaces if the sampling area is above a threshold minimum size.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2336833","Canada Research Chair; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866911","Geophysical measurements;ice surface;laser applications;measurement by laser beam;radar scattering;sea ice;surface roughness;surface topography;Geophysical measurements;ice surface;laser applications;measurement by laser beam;radar scattering;sea ice;surface roughness;surface topography","Sea surface;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface topography;Sea ice;Ocean temperature","electromagnetic wave scattering;measurement by laser beam;oceanographic techniques;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice;surface roughness","sea ice surface roughness parameterization;2D centimeter scale sea ice surface roughness;terrestrial LiDAR;sea ice microwave scattering;roughness height;roughness correlation length;autocorrelation function;light detection and ranging;LiDAR data;complex sea ice surfaces;topography scale;2D detrending;artificial sea ice surface types;natural sea ice surface types;stationary single scale process;anisotropic correlation length;microwave scattering models;incident radiation azimuthal angle","","29","","45","IEEE","28 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Sea ice velocities were evaluated by comparison with measurements from moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and a drifting buoy. The root-mean-square (rms) differences between the sea ice velocities obtained by HFR and the ADCPs decreased with increasing radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), implying that a high SNR was associated with accurate measurement of sea ice velocity. These results agree with previous validations of HFR ocean current observations. The sea ice pattern mapped by HFR is consistent with the simultaneous C-band microwave radar observations. In particular, the HFR captured the approach of the sea ice edge toward the coast. Sharp attenuation of the HF signal over high concentration sea ice resulted in missing and/or low-SNR data at ranges beyond the front edge of pack ice, in qualitative agreement with model estimates of attenuation.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2936576","China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:2011627130); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:15403008,16H02226,17310002,17540405); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1333106,61331012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8847376","Acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP);coastal ocean;drifting buoy;high-frequency radar (HFR);microwave radar;remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;Sea measurements;Oceans;Velocity measurement;Spaceborne radar;Current measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;signal classification","sea ice edge;pack ice;sea ice observation;oceanographic HF radar;high-frequency ocean radar;signal processing procedure;sea ice radial velocities;raw HFR data;MUltiple SIgnal Classification algorithm;sea ice velocity;radar signal-to-noise ratio;HFR ocean current observations;sea ice pattern;C-band microwave radar observations","","2","","54","IEEE","24 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it remains uncertain how the Ku-band radar interacts with the vast range of scatterers that can be present within the satellite footprint, including sea ice with varying physical properties and multiscale roughness, snow cover, and leads. Here, we present a numerical model designed to simulate delay-Doppler synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter echoes from snow-covered sea ice, such as those detected by Cryosat-2. Backscattered echoes are simulated directly from triangular facet-based models of actual sea ice topography generated from Operation IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper data, as well as virtual statistical models simulated artificially. We use these waveform simulations to investigate the sensitivity of SAR altimeter echoes to variations in satellite parameters (height, pitch, and roll) and sea ice properties (physical properties, roughness, and presence of water). We show that the conventional Gaussian assumption for sea ice surface roughness may be introducing significant error into the Cryosat-2 waveform retracking process. Compared to a more representative lognormal surface, an echo simulated from a Gaussian surface with rms roughness height of 0.2 m underestimates the ice freeboard by 5 cm-potentially underestimating sea ice thickness by around 50 cm. We present a set of “ideal” waveform shape parameters simulated for sea ice and leads to inform existing waveform classification techniques.

The two major objectives in SAR-based remote sensing of sea ice are, on the one hand, to have a large coverage and, on the other hand, to obtain a radar response that carries as much information as possible in order to characterize sea ice. Single-polarimetric acquisitions of existing sensors offer a wide coverage on the ground, whereas dual polarimetric or even better fully polarimetric data offer a higher information content, which allows for a more reliable automated sea ice analysis at a cost of smaller swath. In order to reconcile the advantages of fully polarimetric acquisitions with the higher ground coverage of acquisitions with fewer polarimetric channels, hybrid/compact polarimetric acquisitions offer an excellent tradeoff between the mentioned objectives. With the advent of the RISAT-1 satellite platform, we are able to explore the potential of compact dual pol acquisitions for sea ice analysis and classification. Our algorithmic approach for an automated sea ice classification consist of two steps. In the first step, we perform a feature extraction followed by a feature evaluation procedure. The resulting feature vectors are then ingested into a trained artificial neural network classifier to arrive at a pixel-wise supervised classification.

The study investigated differences in scatterometer observations for all three frequencies, co-pol ratios, and introduced new dual-frequency ratios to discriminate dominant polarization-dependent frequencies from these snow covers. Preliminary results suggest that, thinnest 4 cm snow cover demonstrate greatest increase in microwave backscatter from all three frequencies, followed by backscatter from thicker 8 cm and 14 cm snow covers. Dual-frequency indices derived for all frequency and polarization combinations suggest greater sensitivity of Ku-band microwaves to snow grain microstructure with increasing snow thicknesses, X-band microwaves to changes in snow salinities with decreasing snow thicknesses.

For sea ice, the coherence rate is ~96% at elevation angles of $20-43^{\circ}$, then drops to a minimum of ~25% near nadir. Over the Greenland ice sheet, the maximum coherence rate is 86% at the elevation angle of $47^{\circ}$, and the minimum is 21% at $73^{\circ}$. In Antarctica, the coherence rate reaches a maximum of 90% at $48^{\mathrm{o}}$ and a minimum of 36% at $72^{\circ}$.

For the initial competition, our team ranked 3rd place (deepjoker) in the accuracy leaderboard and the solution has been the most efficient algorithm to achieve a segmentation score above 97.79%. In this article, we briefly introduce our three strategies of the achievement including: 1) decoding the partial pretrained networks which can simultaneously capture the complex boundaries of sea ices and decrease the computational cost without the performance drop; 2) employing the classwise Dice loss for solving the gradient vanishing problem when most ground-truth maps are backgrounds; and 3) replacing the commonly exploited decoder with the one proposed by Silva et al. (2021). The main contributions are twofold: 1) an efficient and effective sea-ice segmentation method is proposed and 2) the gradient vanishing problem of binary Dice loss is investigated under some scenarios and solved by introducing its classwise version.

Hence, it is crucial to draw sea-ice maps that reflect the geographical distribution of different types of sea ice. Many automatic sea-ice classification methods using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are based on the polarimetric characteristics or image texture features of sea ice. They either require professional knowledge to design the parameters and features or are sensitive to noise and condition changes. Moreover, ice changes over time are often ignored. In this article, we propose a new SAR sea-ice image classification method based on a combined learning of spatial and temporal features, derived from residual convolutional neural networks (ResNet) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In this way, we achieve automatic and refined classification of sea-ice types. First, we construct a seven-type ice data set according to the Canadian Ice Service ice charts. We extract spatial feature vectors of a time series of sea-ice samples using a trained ResNet network. Then, using the feature vectors as inputs, the LSTM network further learns the variation of the set of sea-ice samples with time. Finally, the extracted high-level features are fed into a softmax classifier to output the most recent ice type. Taking both spatial features and time variation into consideration, our method can achieve a high classification accuracy of 95.7% for seven ice types. Our method can automatically produce more objective sea-ice interpretation maps, allowing detailed sea-ice distribution and improving the efficiency of sea-ice monitoring tasks.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3049031","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFC1400304); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972240); Capacity Development for Shanghai Local College(grant numbers:20050501900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332239","Ice charts;long short-term memory (LSTM);residual convolution network;sea-ice classification;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Ice;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Feature extraction;Sea surface;Surface roughness;Climate change","feature extraction;ice;image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","detailed sea-ice distribution;sea-ice monitoring tasks;SAR images;spatial features;temporal features;sea ice;climate change;ship navigation;sea-ice maps;automatic sea-ice classification methods;synthetic aperture radar images;polarimetric characteristics;image texture features;ice changes;SAR sea-ice image classification method;automatic classification;refined classification;sea-ice types;seven-type ice data set;Canadian Ice Service ice charts;spatial feature vectors;sea-ice samples;recent ice type;seven ice types;objective sea-ice interpretation maps","","12","","60","IEEE","21 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm is based on estimating the degree of coherence of the received GNSS reflected waveform or Delay-Doppler Map (DDM). While at open ocean conditions, the scattered signal follows the diffuse scattering model, over flat sea ice it follows the coherent scattering model. In order to measure the degree of coherence of the received waveform or DDM, a correlation with the clean Woodward Ambiguity Function (WAF) is performed. The more similar the received signal is to the WAF, the more coherent is the scattering, and consequently, the more likely a flat sea ice surface is involved. In order to assess the performance of the proposed estimator a probabilistic study based on a Bayesian approach is performed, using the OSISAF Sea Ice Concentration (SIC) maps as ground truth. A probability of detection of 97%, a probability of false alarm of 2%, and a probability of error of 2.5% are the best results obtained for the Arctic region.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7729516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7729516","Sea Ice;GNSS-R;UK TDS-1;coherent reflection;incoherent scattering","Sea ice;Sea surface;Scattering;Arctic;Antarctica;Surface waves;Rough surfaces","Bayes methods;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;probability;satellite navigation;sea ice","Arctic region;Antarctic region;Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry data;GNSS-R data;UK TDS-1 satellite;coherence degree;GNSS reflected waveform;delay-Doppler map;open ocean conditions;scattered signal;diffuse scattering model;flat sea ice detection;coherent scattering model;woodward ambiguity function;received signal;flat sea ice surface;Bayesian approach;OSISAF Sea Ice Concentration maps;ground truth;detection probability;false alarm probability;error probability","","5","","21","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First year (FY) ridges and multi-year (MY) ridges may be present in the same region, but MY ridges are stronger and have the potential to cause greater damage to vessels and structures. A new approach has been developed to model electromagnetic (EM) scattering from sea ice ridges. Ridges are represented as having a rough surface over horizontally stratified and isotropic layers. The total scatter from the ridge is the sum of the scatter from the surface and the layers. This paper provides an overview of the modeling process and provides some initial simulation results showing the impacts of radar frequency and ice salinity on the scattered wave. Ice ridge surface and structure characteristics affect the nature of the scattered signal and additional work is required to determine if it is possible to reliably distinguish between ridge types. Future work will involve simulations using more detailed modeling of ice ridge profiles to better determine how radar frequency and ice ridge structure and phenology affect ice discrimination.","","978-1-7281-1450-7","10.1109/OCEANSE.2019.8867124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867124","radar scattering;analytical solution;sea ice;simulation;ice type","Sea surface;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface impedance;Scattering;Surface waves;Sea ice","oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;salinity (geophysical);sea ice","ice ridge surface;ridge types;ice ridge profiles;radar frequency;ice ridge structure;phenology;modeling scattering differences;sea ice ridges;multiyear ridges;MY ridges;model electromagnetic scattering;ice salinity;sub-polar region;remote sensing data;rough surface;horizontally stratified layer;horizontally isotropic layer;modeling process;scattered wave;structure characteristics;ice discrimination","","1","","13","IEEE","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome such a limitation, a method of retrieving Arctic basin-scale ice thickness is developed. The physical background of this method is that the scattering optical thickness at microwave frequencies within the freeboard layer is linearly proportional to the physical thickness of the ice freeboard. In this study, we relate the optical thickness estimated from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) with ice freeboard estimated from the CryoSat-2 (CS2) by employing a piecewise linear fit. The results show a strong linear relationship between the AMSR2-estimated and CS2-measured ice freeboards with a correlation coefficient of 0.85 and bias and RMSE of 0.0001 and 0.04 m, respectively; this evidence suggests that the method can provide Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard with a comparable accuracy level of CS2. The method is also applied to estimate ice freeboard for the periods of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) (1978-1987) and AMSR-E (2002-2011). It is shown that the area-averaged ice freeboard has decreased significantly with the linear trends of 1.5 cm/decade. In addition, there seems to be a change of ice freeboard distributions over the Arctic. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to the ice thickness retrieval by using the hydrostatic balance equation, showing that operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval will be possible from satellite passive microwave measurements if a realistic snow depth on sea ice is employed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3026949","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean government (MSIP)(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1A6A3A03032352); NASA Snow and Ice Distributed Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)(grant numbers:NASA 80GSFC18C0102); Space Core Technology Development Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2018M1A3A3A02065661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223741","Ice freeboard;passive microwave remote sensing;sea ice thickness;sea ice;surface emissivity","Sea ice;Microwave measurement;Snow;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave radiometry","hydrological techniques;ice;microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radiometry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Arctic basin-scale sea ice thickness;satellite passive microwave measurements;Arctic basin-scale ice thickness;scattering optical thickness;microwave frequencies;freeboard layer;physical thickness;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2;CryoSat-2;AMSR2-estimated;CS2-measured ice freeboards;Arctic basin-scale ice freeboard;area-averaged ice freeboard;ice freeboard distributions;operational basin-scale ice thickness retrieval;size 50.0 cm;size 1.0E-4 m;size 0.04 m","","3","","38","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The focus of this paper is the fractal analysis of KOMPSAT-5 SAR images of noncoherent sea-ice textures while being decomposed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) processing. As a novel approach, fractal analysis relies on SAR sea-ice spatial backscattering data generation and time-frequency domain (TFD) formulations from the perspective of uncorrelated HMN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the extraction of the resolution profile and raw data for the reference KOMPSAT-5 SAR sea-ice image have been derived, evaluated and compared both qualitatively and quantitatively at each scale of DWT decomposition on the basis of the presence of HMN. This paper also presents a novel detailed modeling of the multiresolution probability distribution function of the HMN and its power spectral density function modeling at each scale of the decomposition. Other quality assessment techniques, such as two K-means clustering algorithms and several visualized verification methods, such as gradient vector field, advection mapping and tensor field mapping, have been implemented in this regard to investigate embedded HMN suppression and its adverse effects on the presence of pixel anomalies. As a result, as the decomposition continues, the HMN at each scale of decomposition is constantly altering from high-frequency uncorrelated anomalies to low-frequency joint spatial information within the observed 2-D data. In other words, excessive multiscale HMN suppression will result in spatial information loss that makes the DWT scale selection quite important for texture classification. The results also show that the importance of HMN suppression in SAR sea-ice images in the form of pixel anomaly decomposition for the purpose of further texture investigation should be in accordance with the spectral behavior of the HMN. The results are helpful for SAR remote sensing image restoration and data preservation when dealing with high-resolution SAR images, such as in time series analysis, sea-ice texture change detection, and polar structural mapping. The proposed approach is implemented on real KOMPSAT-5 SAR satellite sea-ice images, while fractal spatial resolution profile simulations are carried out based on the inversed equalized hybrid domain image formation algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976815","Korea Polar Research Institute(grant numbers:PE20080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016014","Discrete wavelet transform;fractal analysis;high-frequency multiplicative noise;raw data generation;synthetic aperture radar","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Fractals;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image resolution;Electromagnetics;Reflectivity","discrete wavelet transforms;fractals;geophysical image processing;image classification;image restoration;image texture;oceanographic techniques;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;time series;wavelet transforms","fractal spatial resolution profile simulations;inversed equalized hybrid domain image formation algorithm;fractal analysis;texture classification;synthetic aperture radar images;SAR sea-ice spatial backscattering data generation;time-frequency domain;DWT decomposition;advection mapping;tensor field mapping;low-frequency joint spatial information;pixel anomaly decomposition;high-resolution SAR images;time series analysis;sea-ice texture change detection;KOMPSAT-5 SAR satellite sea-ice images;multiscale HMN suppression;KOMPSAT-5 SAR sea-ice image;transform-domain image decomposition;high-frequency multiplicative noise;discrete wavelet transform;power spectral density function modeling;K-means clustering algorithms;gradient vector field;SAR remote sensing image restoration","","17","","43","CCBY","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the fact that the image extraction process is easily disturbed by noise in real-life application scenarios, a modified Newton integration (MNI) neural algorithm with the noise-tolerance ability and high extraction accuracy is proposed to aid the GCVCEM scheme.

Besides, the corresponding convergence analyses and robustness proofs on the proposed MNI neural algorithm are furnished. To evaluate the extraction performance of the proposed MNI neural algorithm, multiple comparative experiments with different sea ice observation images and different noise workspaces are performed.

This letter presents an enhanced region-based probabilistic posterior sampling approach to effectively synthesize SAR imagery with different ocean features. In the proposed approach, instead of relying entirely on the SAR intensity values, the posterior sampling is performed based on a number of quantitative factors, such as intensity, label field, and the prior class probability of sampling candidates, constituting a complete probabilistic framework that addresses key aspects in the synthesis of SAR imagery from heterogeneous sources. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can better address the difficulties caused by the heterogeneity in the source images compared with the existing state-of-the-art ice synthesis method, and it will improve the consistency, comprehensiveness, and fairness of the evaluation of the remote sensing classification and segmentation algorithms.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2633572","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ArcticNet; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41501410); Canada Research Chairs Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797259","Image synthesis;oil spills;sea ice;statistical texture modeling","Synthetic aperture radar;Oils;Sea ice;Probabilistic logic;Image segmentation;Image generation","image sampling;marine pollution;oil pollution;pollution measurement;radar imaging;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","enhanced probabilistic posterior sampling;SAR imagery synthesis;sea ice;oil spills;synthetic aperture radar;ocean features;source images","","3","","13","IEEE","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, slow rotation 2 r/min AMSR-E data is used to derive regression equations from colocated pairs of AMSR2 and AMSR-E brightness temperatures (Tbs). The regression equations are used to modify AMSR2 Tbs into AMSR-E equivalent Tbs that are then input into the NASA Team 2 (NT2) sea ice concentration algorithm used for the AMSR-E standard products. The regressed Tbs result in changes in sea ice concentration of a few percent compared to using the original un-regressed AMSR2 Tbs. Next, sea ice estimates from the F17 SSMIS sensor are used as a bridge to compare AMSR-E total sea ice extent estimates in 2010 with AMSR2 total sea ice extent estimates in 2013. Based on this comparison, a further adjustment is made to a weather filter threshold used in the NT2 algorithm to minimize the total extent bias between AMSR2 and AMSR-E using a double-differencing approach. The adjustments reduced apparent bias with AMSR-E from ~200 000 km2 for the original unmodified AMSR2 Tbs to -700 and 4700 km2 for the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively. These differences are within the range of previous passive microwave sea ice intercalibrations. The adjusted AMSR2 sea ice fields provide a nearly 15-year time series of sea ice change; depending on the lifetime of AMSR2 and possible follow-on sensors, AMSR2 has the potential to be part of a multidecadal record of sea ice change.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2719624","NASA; NASA AMSR2 Science Team; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7972951","AMSR2;antarctic;arctic;passive microwave (PM);remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;NASA;Atmospheric modeling;Calibration;Meteorology;Sea surface;Standards","calibration;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;regression analysis;remote sensing;sea ice","AMSR2 NASA team 2 algorithm;sea ice concentration;AMSR-E slow rotation data;regression equation;AMSR2 brightness temperature;AMSR-E brightness temperature;F17 SSMIS sensor;AMSR-E total sea ice extent estimation;AD 2010;AMSR2 total sea ice extent estimation;AD 2013;weather filter threshold;NT2 algorithm;double-differencing approach;Arctic Ocean;Antarctic;microwave sea ice intercalibration;sea ice change","","14","","15","IEEE","11 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emphasis of this case study is not to understand how the vessels escaped danger but rather to investigate the sea ice breaks in the region, i.e., the dynamic processes of the sea ice during the event through an analysis of the TS-X data, sea ice classification, and the reanalysis of surface wind and ocean current modeling results. Therefore, we present six images of TS-X ScanSAR and newly operational wide ScanSAR imaging modes; these images provide abundant information about the state of the sea ice. Both the ScanSAR and wide ScanSAR images in the HH-polarization are used for classifying sea ice in the region; the resulting classification illustrates how the sea ice varied and finally broke during the event. A further analysis of the sea ice drift derived from the sequential TS-X images and surface wind and ocean current model data partially explains why the sea ice broke under such weather conditions. This case study contributes to a better understanding of the sea ice dynamics on both regional and local scales.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2497355","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Key Program of the NSFC(grant numbers:61132006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337357","Classification;dynamic process;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);X-band;Classification;dynamic process;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);X-band","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Antarctica;Spaceborne radar;Monitoring;Sea surface","remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice;East Coast of Antarctica;spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data;TerraSAR-X;AD 2014 01;Chinese icebreaker XueLong;X-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar;dynamic processes;TS-X ScanSAR;surface wind","","11","","31","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At present, remote sensing images of sea ice are mainly acquired with the help of payload platforms, such as aircraft or satellites. The above methods have a large measurement scale and a short period. Sea ice research also requires suitable equipment for fine-scale, visualized long-term tracking observations of target sea ice regions. This article investigates the feasibility of measuring interannual variability in sea ice morphology in the Arctic sea ice environment using a low-power gimbal camera automated by satellite communications. Year-round observational data from the arctic field were used. The sea ice images were defogged and edge-enhanced by a newly developed algorithm with the help of human visual enhancement principles. During the 11th Chinese National Arctic Science Expedition, the system was placed on perennial ice in the northern Beaufort Basin to monitor sea ice appearance changes and the external state of the ice mass balance buoy. The system fuses visually enhanced sea ice images with ice balance buoy data from the same ice floe in a multi-scale environmental sequence to obtain sea ice observations with image sequences. The data complement the need for long-duration, fixed-ice, and short-visual-range observations in sea-ice studies. The equipment design methods and image processing algorithms involved in the experimental process have accumulated engineering experience for this application area.

So far, AWI Snow Radar data have been derived using a 2–18-GHz ultrawideband frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar in 2017–2019. Our results show that our method in combination with thorough calibration through coherent noise removal and system response deconvolution significantly improves the quality of the radar-derived snow depth data. The validation against a 2-D grid of in situ snow depth measurements on level landfast first-year ice indicates a mean bias of only 0.86 cm between radar and ground truth. Comparison between the radar-derived snow depth estimates from different altitudes shows good consistency. We conclude that the AWI Snow Radar aboard the IceBird campaigns is able to measure the snow depth on Arctic sea ice accurately at higher spatial resolution than but consistent with the existing airborne snow radar data of NASA Operation IceBridge.

Artificial sea ice was grown in two cylindrical tubs at the Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility, University of Manitoba. The sea ice physical characteristics, including surface roughness, thickness, temperature, and salinity, were measured before and after oil injection below the ice sheet. Time-series C-band radar backscatter measurements detected the differences in the sea ice evolution and oil migration to the sea ice surface in the oil-contaminated tub, which was compared to uncontaminated ice in a control tub. Immediately prior to the presence of oil on the ice surface, the copolarized backscatter is increased by 13-dB local maximum, while the cross-polarized backscatter is decreased by 9-dB. Ice physical properties suggest that the local backscatter maximum and minimum, which occurred immediately before oil migrated onto the surface, were related to a combination of brine and oil upward migration. The findings of this work provide a baseline data interpretation for oil detection in the Arctic Ocean using current and future C-band multipolarization radar satellites.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3123908","GENICE; Research Manitoba; Canada Research Chair (CRC) Programs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); University of Manitoba GETS Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591590","Arctic;detection;oil spill;radar backscatter;sea ice","Sea ice;Oils;Ice;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Backscatter;Spaceborne radar","backscatter;hydrological techniques;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;surface roughness;water pollution measurement","oil spills;climate-related sea ice loss;oil spill detection capability;artificial sea ice;Sea-ice Environmental Research Facility;sea ice physical characteristics;oil injection;ice sheet;C-band radar backscatter measurements;sea ice evolution;sea ice surface;oil-contaminated tub;uncontaminated ice;ice physical properties;local backscatter maximum;oil detection;C-band multipolarization radar satellites","","1","","53","CCBY","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, local binary pattern(LBP) features are extracted from selected spectral bands. PCA bagging is employed to generating hashing codes of the extracted features. Then, a piece of short but strong code is obtained to represent the features of each pixel. Finally, these hashing codes are fed into the extreme learning machine for classification.

Sentinel-1 satellite SAR data are used for observations of sea ice leads and open water where SSA may originate due to wind forcing. Results from selected Sentinel-1 SAR scenes show that sea ice leads and open water areas can be identified with co-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles while water misclassification occurs at smaller incidence due to stronger surface scattering. In contrast, the cross-polarized backscatter remains low at low and high incidence angles.

Due to the noise, low resolution and multiple characteristics of SAR images, and limitations of traditional SAR image classification methods, the detection accuracy of traditional sea ice SAR images is not high and can't meet the high precision requirements of application in practice. Deep learning, one of the most popular machine learning methods, have been researched and applied in SAR image classification by some researchers. But, so far, very few researchers have applied deep learning methods to sea ice SAR image detection. In this paper, two scenes of Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data of sea ice were applied to sea ice detection research using convolutional neural network (CNN). First, the train data is obtained from Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR Image by chipping different classes of SAR images into patches; Then, the different classes train data is used to train the CNN and get the trained CNN model; After the training, the trained CNN model was used to classify the Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR image with sea ice and non-sea ice by a patch-based window traversing the entire SAR image. In order to illustrate the sea ice detection result of deep learning, several traditional SAR image detection methods are experimented for contrast. Experimental results demonstrate that deep learning method is suitable for sea ice SAR image detection and achieves high detection accuracy than others traditional methods.","","978-1-5386-1211-8","10.1109/PIERS-FALL.2017.8293267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8293267","","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Climate change;Training data;Machine learning;Data models","geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","CNN model;SAR image detection methods;SAR image classification methods;convolutional neural network;Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data;synthetic aperture radar image processing;Gaofen-3 sea ice detection;sea ice SAR image detection;deep learning method;Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR image;Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR Image","","11","","16","IEEE","19 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, researchers noticed that humans and animals learn much better when the examples are organized in a meaningful order, and proposed Self-Paced Boost Learning (SPBL) to simulate the process. Inspired by this, we proposed a novel sea ice change detection method based on SPBL. First, log-ratio operator is utilized for difference image generation. Then, a hierarchical fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is employed to select reliable samples. Finally, based upon these samples, SPBL is employed to classify pixels from the original SAR images into unchanged and changed class.

This event highlighted the importance of an operational sea-ice classification map for ice routing to serve ship navigation. In this paper, unprecedented Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithms from RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were developed using the conditional random fields (CRF) approach by including multiple features from sea-ice concentration, gray-level cooccurrence matrix textures, polarization ratio, backscatter coefficients, and intensity data. Coincident RADARSAT-2 Satellite SAR datasets with five scenes were collected for ice classification into categories such as open water, thin ice, smooth first year ice, deformed first year ice, and old ice during the CHINARE-30th cruise. The effects of deformation, rafting, and ridging during the spring-summer transition period were overwhelmed by the spatial and contextual CRF models in combination with the rich features extracted for sea-ice classification. Four strategies including statistical distribution and region connection, multiple features and support vector machine (SVM) integrated into the CRF model are proposed to describe the sea-ice-type relationships among pixels. By conducting comparative experiments between the proposed methods and state-of-the-art sea-ice classification based on the SVM algorithm, the best was obtained from the SVM-based CRF (SVM-CRF) algorithm for sea-ice classification with respect to the three scenes from the Indian Ocean sector and two scenes of Pacific Ocean sectors including medium-resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 50 m and higher resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery with a pixel spacing of 6.25 m. Results indicate that the SVM-CRF approach has the capacity for improving sea-ice classification, which can provide accurate and reliable sea-ice class information for sea-ice analysis.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2551318","State Key Program of National Natural Science of China(grant numbers:41531069); National Basic Research Program of China(grant numbers:2012CB957701); Chinese Polar Environment Comprehensive Investigation and Assessment Programs(grant numbers:CHINARE2016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7466105","Antarctic;classification;conditional random fields (CRFs);multiple features;RADARSAT-2;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Antarctica;Synthetic aperture radar;Satellites;Oceans;Arctic","geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;matrix algebra;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;random processes;sea ice;seawater;statistical analysis;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","conditional random field;RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization satellite image;AD 2014 01;Antarctic Chinese national antarctic research expedition;CHINARE;Xuelong;Chinese polar research vessel;Adelie depression area;east Antarctic continent;operational sea-ice classification map;serve ship navigation;ice routing;Antarctic sea-ice classification algorithm;RADARSAT-2 satellite dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar image;conditional random field approach;gray-level cooccurrence matrix texture;polarization ratio;backscatter coefficient;intensity data;RADARSAT-2 satellite SAR dataset;open water;smooth first year ice;rafting;deformation;CHINARE-30th cruise;spring-summer transition period;contextual CRF model;region connection;support vector machine;state-of-the-art sea-ice classification;SVM algorithm;SVM-based CRF algorithm;SVM-CRF;Indian ocean sector;sea-ice classification;Pacific ocean sector;pixel spacing;dual-polarization SAR imagery;higher resolution dual-polarization SAR imagery;SVM-CRF approach;sea-ice classification information analysis;open water","","11","","53","IEEE","6 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Results suggest that data obtained from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system (AMSR-E) underestimate SICs by 19%. We performed step-by-step comparisons among the aerial image, moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and AMSR-E SIC. These types of comparisons have not been made in previous validation studies. First, SICs acquired from MODIS-Terra imagery were acquired using a tie-point method and corrected by SICs derived from the aerial photography. Second, SICs of MODIS-Aqua images were trained based on the consistency of SIC results between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the selected region on the same day. Finally, the MODIS-Aqua SICs were employed to validate synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products. The results show that the AMSR-E products underestimate SICs by 8.5% in the marginal ice zone in comparison with MODIS SICs. According to our further analysis between sea-ice types and AMSR-E biases, the higher the proportion of first-year ice, the smaller the AMSR-E SIC bias. In other words, results suggest that the higher the thin ice proportion, the more the AMSR-E underestimates the SIC.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2989037","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFC1402704,2018YFA0605703); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096529","Aerial imagery;AMSR-E (advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth-observing system) data;step-by-step validation;sea-ice concentration (SIC)","Silicon carbide;Sea ice;MODIS;Microwave radiometry;Antarctica;Spatial resolution","oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","sea-ice concentration data;high-resolution sea-ice aerial image;earth-observing system underestimate SICs;step-by-step comparisons;moderate-resolution-imaging spectroradiometer;MODIS-Terra imagery;MODIS-Aqua images;SIC results;MODIS-Aqua SICs;synchronous AMSR-E swath SIC products;MODIS SICs;sea-ice types;step-by-step validation;Antarctic ASI AMSR-E;remote-sensing-data product validation;arctic radiation and turbulence interaction study;AD 2011 01;advanced microwave scanning radiometer;earth-observing system;aerial photography","","9","","48","CCBY","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

SAR data are currently the primary source of information for sea ice charting made by human ice experts as a result of its integration with multiple information sources at different scales (mainly radiometers). The rise of deep learning now opens the prospect of automatic sea ice mapping. In this article, we investigate the potential of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for the automatic estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC). With input data down-sampled at 200 m and an FCN architecture (depth and receptive field) duly parameterized, our approach is to mimic the work of an analyst who considers general context and does not necessarily use the highest possible resolution but speckle-noise polluted data. A comprehensive database is generated with 1320 dual-polarized S-1 scenes collocated with ice charts produced by MET Norway. A dedicated attention is paid to seasonal representativeness to ensure the adequate performance for all sea ice types. Even if the FCN output is modeled as a categorical problem, the proposed architecture accounts for the semantic distances between SIC classes by introducing an auxiliary loss. A comparative benchmark with Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) and MET Norway SIC products is carried out, showing an overall accuracy of 78.2% for our 6-class classification approach.

To approach, sea ice was categorized into three ice types, typical of the sea ice in this region: nilas (thin level), pancake ice (thin rough), and deformed ice (thick rough), and then the measures to classify into these categories were developed using ALOS/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) as a function of backscatter coefficients at HH polarization ( $\sigma _{\text {HH}}^{0}$ ) and incidence angle ( $\theta _{i}$ ), based on the field observations. Comparative analysis confirmed that PALSAR can detect deformed ice more efficiently than RADARSAT-2 (C-band SAR). The temporal evolution of the area, judged as deformed ice from these measures, shows significant variability with both time and space, and deformed ice regions appear in relatively linear alignments with a width of a few tens of kilometers in the inner ice pack region, consistent with ice drift convergence. To confirm the results, PALSAR-2 images at HH and HV polarizations were examined as a function of  $\theta _{i}$ , based on the four-year field observations in the same area. The results revealed that  $\sigma _{\text {HH}}^{0}$  and  $\sigma _{\text{HV}}^{0}$  are both subject to floe sizes as well as deformed ice, and  $\sigma _{\text{HV}}^{0}$  is more sensitive. This indicates that care should be taken when applying these measures to the ice areas where significantly small floes are dominant like the marginal ice zone.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3043335","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP16K00511,JP19K12304); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9303432","Cryosphere;deformed sea ice;dynamics;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Ice;Sea ice;Sea measurements;Synthetic aperture radar;L-band;Radar polarimetry;Satellites","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","deformed sea ice;seasonal ice zone;dynamical deformation process;satellite L-band synthetic aperture radar images;pancake ice;inner ice pack region;ice drift convergence;marginal ice zone;ALOS-PALSAR;Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar;RADARSAT-2;C-band SAR;PALSAR-2 images;HH polarizations;HV polarizations","","7","","47","CCBY","22 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A sea ice surface is more stable and presents higher correlation than a dynamic ocean surface, this article explores the potential of detecting and measuring sea ice using the coherency of reflected GNSS signal for coastal scenario. Experimental results show that phase coherency can significantly detect sea ice without strictly limiting elevation and azimuth angle. This article also is to is to explore the potential of retrieving sea ice thickness using the oscillating phase pattern versus elevation angle. The phase compensation and the dual-polarization observation are proposed to remove the delay phase between the direct and reflected signal from the estimated phase of the reflected GNSS signal. The results show that the amplitude and frequency of the oscillating phase pattern, respectively, have an inversely proportional and positively linear relationship with sea ice thickness. Simulation shows that, compared to the oscillating amplitude, the oscillating frequency is a better choice to measure sea ice thickness.

It is shown that including multiple SARIn peaks and the associated phase difference in the processing does not introduce any bias on the average sea ice freeboard heights compared with the estimates from regular SAR processing schemes, while significantly increasing the number of valid sea surface height retrievals (+55%) and the number of freeboard estimates in the coastal domain and in multi-year ice regions (~3 times). This results in an average ~34% reduction of the gridded random freeboard uncertainty, corresponding to a ~20% reduction of the gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty. The results of this work show that SARIn acquisitions over Arctic sea ice provide improved spatial coverage and denser sampling of sea level and sea ice freeboard compared with the SAR mode, with accuracy being largely driven by the retracking algorithm.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3022522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205871","CryoSat-2 (CS2);interferometry;radar altimetry;retracking;sea ice;swath processing","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Uncertainty;Spaceborne radar","height measurement;ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;synthetic aperture radar","single SARIn waveforms;Arctic sea ice;absolute sea ice elevations;including multiple SARIn peaks;average sea ice;valid sea surface height retrievals;multiyear ice regions;gridded total sea ice thickness uncertainty;SARIn acquisitions;sea level;multipeak retracking;CryoSat-2 SARIn waveforms;pulse-limited radar altimeter;Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric mode;ice sheets;ice caps;CS2 SARIn data;multiple coherent peaks;CS2 SARIn waveforms;valid height estimate;size -1.8 cm","","","","59","CCBY","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A series of MODIS image pairs for a selected region in Arctic Ocean is employed, and sparse pairwise correspondences between nonrigid patches are calculated. An edge-preserving sparse-to-dense interpolation is applied followed by variational energy minimization to compute the final optical flow.

Thorough experimentation with different settings of input data preprocessing as well as varying scales of motion is performed.

The proposed optical flow approach clearly outperforms the pattern matching method in most cases, both in terms of accuracy and motion vector consistency.

In this paper, a class-based correction is proposed for normalizing each class in ScanSAR data to a nominal incidence angle. Two tested sea ice synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets were acquired: a data set for the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which was obtained by the RADARSAT-2 satellite, and a data set for the Bohai Sea, which was obtained by the ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar. An unsupervised classification is performed on each image block prior to normalization, and the incidence angle range of each image block is approximately 5°. Because the distribution of the backscatter coefficients in the azimuth band is discrete and nonlinear, the class-based locally linear mapping (LLM) technique is implemented, based on the assumption that a small quantity of sorted backscatter coefficients is locally linear. This algorithm is a transplantable and easily applied method that requires limited ground data, and it is also a semiautomated technique because nearly all of its parameters can be adaptively determined during the image analysis. The results demonstrate that LLM-corrected ScanSAR images appear to have more detailed textures, and the natural signal variability in the radar data is preserved, which indicates that the LLM produces better results compared with the histogram-based-alike (HIST-alike) technique when correcting the incidence angle in the sea ice SAR data. The results of the data analysis in this paper show that the width of the azimuth band should be selected based on the extent of variation in the incidence angle, and the reference band can be calculated based on the maximum interclass distance principle. The intercomparisons also reveal that the proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy of supervised classifications.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2513159","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61271381,61371154); Science and Technological Fund of Anhui Province for Outstanding Youth(grant numbers:10040606Y09); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390041","Backscatter;incidence angle effect;Scanning Synthetic Aperture Radar (ScanSAR);sea ice;Backscatter;incidence angle effect;Scanning Synthetic Aperture Radar (ScanSAR);sea ice","Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Sea ice;Azimuth;Spaceborne radar","data analysis;geophysical image processing;image classification;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","incidence angle correction;SAR sea ice monitoring data;radar backscatter variations;incidence angle effects;scanning synthetic aperture radar data;class-based correction;ScanSAR data;nominal incidence angle;sea ice synthetic aperture radar data sets;Gulf of Saint Lawrence;RADARSAT-2 satellite;Bohai Sea;ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar;unsupervised classification;image block;normalization;backscatter coefficient distribution;azimuth band;class-based locally linear mapping technique;ground data;semiautomated technique;image analysis;LLM-corrected ScanSAR images;natural signal variability;histogram-based-alike technique;data analysis;reference band;maximum interclass distance principle","","18","","41","IEEE","22 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to extract useful information from DDM, three delay waveforms are defined and utilized. The delay waveform without Doppler shift is defined as central delay waveform (CDW), while the integration of delay waveforms of 20 different Doppler shift values is defined as integrated delay waveform (IDW). The differential waveform between normalized CDW (NCDW) and normalized IDW (NIDW) is defined as differential delay waveform (DDW), which is a new observable used to describe the difference between NCDW and NIDW, which have different Doppler spread characteristics. The difference is mainly caused by the roughness of reflected surface. First, a new data quality control method is proposed based on the standard deviation and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the first 48 bins of DDW. Then, several different observables derived from NCDW, NIDW, and DDW are applied to distinguish sea ice from water based on their probability density function.

Combining an extensive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data set of Hudson Strait with labelled ridge locations spanning nine winters, an automated system can be developed to detect ridging. In this study we test three transfer learning approaches using a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture; DenseNet-161.

Continuous monitoring of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) primarily relies on passive microwave images. However, passive microwave images have coarse spatial resolution, resulting in SIC production with significant blurring at the ice–water divides. In this article, a novel multi-image super-resolution (MISR) network called progressive multiscale deformable residual network (PMDRnet) is proposed to improve the spatial resolution of sea ice passive microwave images according to the characteristics of both passive microwave images and sea ice motions. To achieve image alignment with complex and large Arctic sea ice motions, we design a novel alignment module that includes a progressive alignment strategy and a multiscale deformable convolution alignment unit. In addition, the temporal attention mechanism is used to adaptively fuse the effective spatiotemporal information across image sequence.

In this study, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to detect the structure of the sea ice and a sound velocity meter to test the acoustic velocity of the ice core in the short-term ice station located at  $85^{\circ } 28.863^{\prime }$  N,  $179^{\circ } 48.807^{\prime }$  W during the 11th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition. The ice core was located in the middle of the GPR lines. The structure and acoustic velocity of the sea ice model within the 85° circle of the Arctic Ocean were established on the basis of the data processing results. The model revealed the fine structural characteristics and vertical acoustic velocity distribution of the sea ice within the 85° circle of the Arctic Ocean in summer.

However the application of a Wishart classifier gives an improved resolution over the Pauli RGB. Two main differences emerge from our results. The intensity fluctuations of the return are better revealed on the Pauli RGB with forward scattering showing as dark areas.

Coherent GNSS signal reflection usually occurs at relatively low elevation angles, and sea ice is a good reflector for GNSS signals. As analyzed in [1], most of the uncertainty for GNSS-R relative sea surface height (SSH) retrievals is from the tropospheric delay models, which usually have several centimeters error in the zenith total error (ZTD), and the effects will be significantly amplified at low elevation angles. In this paper, the retrieved sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) using LEMUR-2 GNSS-R data are compared with the monthly averaged ice freeboard measurements from ICESat-2. Overall, the comparison shows good consistency. However, for some reflection events/segments, adjustments of the zenith troposphere delay model of up to 11 cm is required in order to fit the ICESat-2 ice freeboard measurements. Therefore, the tropospehere delay correction may be a challenge for high-precision GNSS-R sea ice altimetry.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554623","NASA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554623","GNSS-R;coherent reflection;sea ice;ice freeboard;LEMUR-2;ICESat-2;altimetry","Sea surface;Global navigation satellite system;Sea measurements;Terrestrial atmosphere;Extraterrestrial measurements;Reflection;Surface fitting","Global Positioning System;height measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;phase measurement;radar altimetry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;troposphere","coherent GNSS signal reflection;GNSS signals;GNSS-R relative sea surface height retrievals;retrieved sea surface height anomalies;LEMUR-2 GNSS-R data;monthly averaged ice freeboard measurements;ICESat-2 ice freeboard measurements;high-precision GNSS-R;sea ice surface height;relative sea ice surface heights;carrier phase measurements;coherent GNSS reflection signals;Spire Global Inc.'s LEMUR-2 low-Earth orbit","","1","","9","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring sea ice thickness and the mean sea level (MSL) of the frozen sea are performed using the interference frequency obtained by the GNSS interference pattern (IP) technique. The height variations between the GNSS antenna and the sea surface evaluated using the IP of the direct and reflected carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) are used to find the corresponding MSL. The GNSS-reflectometry (GNSS-R) derived MSL for open sea conditions agreed well with the mareograph data with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 2.72 cm with an R-squared value of 0.9644. For frozen sea, a notable difference was observed between the measured MSL and ground-truth MSL values. This difference was caused by the combined thickness of snow and ice above the frozen sea surface, also known as the total freeboard. Assuming the conditions for hydrostatic equilibrium is satisfied, total freeboard was converted to ice thickness. The ice thickness values agreed well with the published ice charts by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).

Effects of wind, total water vapor, liquid water path, and surface temperature on the TBs are evaluated through a radiative transfer model. TBs of open ocean yield higher sensitivity to the atmospheric water due to its low emissivity, whereas that of sea ice is more influenced by the surface conditions such as temperature and ice type. The weather effects are corrected by simulating changes in TBs caused by the atmospheric water absorption/emission and wind roughened ocean surface using numerical weather prediction reanalysis data fields as atmospheric profiles. ASI2 is validated on a collection of AMSR-E observations over open water and 100% SIC. The correction significantly reduces the standard deviation and bias of SIC over open water, yet yields little change over 100% SIC. Combined with an improved weather filter based on the corrected TBs at lower frequencies, ASI2 allows retrieval of low ice concentration and resolves a more exact ice concentration gradient across the ice edge compared to the original ASI algorithm.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2018.2805193","ESA Sea Ice Climate Change Initiative 2 (SICCI2); SFB/TR 172 “ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes; German Research Foundation (DFG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8307424","Arctic regions;remote sensing;sea ice","Meteorology;Sea ice;Silicon carbide;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Remote sensing","atmospheric humidity;clouds;oceanographic techniques;radiative transfer;remote sensing;sea ice;wind","atmospheric correction;polarization difference;brightness temperatures;total water vapor;liquid water path;surface temperature;radiative transfer model;open ocean;low emissivity;surface conditions;ice type;weather effects;ocean surface;numerical weather prediction reanalysis data fields;atmospheric profiles;open water;ice edge;original ASI algorithm;AMSR-E observations;atmospheric water absorption;weather filter;sea ice concentration retrieval algorithm;atmospheric water emission","","16","","32","IEEE","7 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the training phase, the output parameters are generated from quad-pol observations obtained by Radarsat-2 (RS2), and the corresponding input data consist of features obtained from overlapping dual-pol Sentinel-1 (S1) data. Then, two, well-recognized ML methods are studied to learn the functional relationship between the output and input data. These ML approaches are the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) for regression models. The goal is to use the aforementioned ML techniques to generate Arctic sea ice information from freely available dual-pol observations acquired by S1, which can, in general, only be generated from quad-pol data. Eight overlapping RS2 and S1 scenes were used to train and test the GPR and NN models. Statistical regression performance measures were computed to evaluate the strength of the ML regression methods. Then, two scenes were selected for further evaluation, where overlapping optical images were available as well. This allowed the visual interpretation of the maps estimated by the ML models. Finally, one of the methods was tested on an entire S1 scene to perform prediction on areas outside of the RS2 and S1 overlap.

However, the penetration of microwaves into snow-covered thick ice and the achievable height sensitivity for tens-of-centimeters thin ice are two major issues, which limit the accuracy of InSAR-derived sea ice topography. Polarimetry provides scattering information concerning the sea ice properties and has the potential, in combination with interferometry, to achieve an accurate reconstruction of a sea ice digital elevation model (DEM). This article studies the relation between polarimetric signatures and sea ice topography, and explores the possibility to compensate the penetration bias by merging copolar coherence into InSAR processing. The newly generated topographic map has a root-mean-square error under 0.3 m. For thin ice below 1 m, a positive relation between copolar phase φcoPol and surface height is observed, suggesting that φcoPol can effectively characterize thin sea ice topography. For thick ice with ridges, the maximum polarimetric phase difference ΔφmaxPol reveals a particular shape of the coherence region, which can be interpreted as oriented volume scattering. It suggests that the model-based approach using polarimetric SAR interferometry assuming an oriented volume scattering model is promising in measuring the scattering centers in thick and deformed sea ice. The study of polarimetric behavior for the InSAR DEM is, therefore, a step forward toward accurate modeling of sea ice topography from polarimetric single-pass InSAR data.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3036395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9250474","Polarimetry;sea ice topography;single-pass interferometry;TanDEM-X","Sea ice;Ice;Surfaces;Snow;Sea measurements;Synthetic aperture radar;Surface topography","digital elevation models;hydrological techniques;polarimetry;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;radiowave interferometry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;topography (Earth)","TanDEM-x interferometric SAR data;single-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar;sea ice topographic retrieval;InSAR-derived sea ice topography;sea ice properties;sea ice digital elevation model;deformed sea ice;polarimetric behavior;single-pass InSAR data;sea ice topographic height","","9","","82","CCBY","6 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In quantifying polar sea ice differences to address the contrasted sea ice behaviors, two key parameters are sea ice thickness and melt pond fraction, which remain challenging to measure extensively in time and in space with a sustainable approach. Here, we present a new paradigm for such measurements using bistatic radar reflectometry, thanks to developments of low-cost receivers to acquire reflected signals from numerous existing transmitter systems operated at multiple frequencies to be replenished and sustained indefinitely into the future. For sea ice thickness measurement to determine ice volume, reflected signals likely come from the bottom ice-water interface avoiding large errors inherent in current altimetry techniques due to uncertainty in free-board height and snow cover. Regarding melt pond faction on sea ice to estimate albedo and insolation, the bistatic reflection can be dominated by melt pond water with permittivity that is one order of magnitude larger compared to that of snow or ice. These are examined by a combination of numerical Kirchhoff (KA) simulator and Numerical Maxwell Model of 3D simulations (NMM3D) to preserve phase and amplitude information and thereby account for both coherent and incoherent effects. Physical insights from the rigorous theory for bistatic radar reflectometry will be valuable to develop future satellite missions to resolve cryospheric science issues concerning the polar sea ice differences.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900079","Arctic;Antarctic;sea ice;bistatic radar;reflectometry;numerical solution;satellite missions","Sea ice;Reflectometry;Sea measurements;Thickness measurement;Arctic;Satellites","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","snow cover;melt pond faction;bistatic reflection;melt pond water;bistatic radar reflectometry;polar sea ice;melt pond fraction measurements;Antarctic sea ice covers;reflected signals;sea ice thickness measurement;ice volume;bottom ice-water interface;free-board height;Arctic sea ice covers;sea ice behaviors;Kirchhoff simulator;numerical Maxwell model;cryospheric science issues","","3","","29","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, its coarse spatial resolution leads to blurring effects at the ice-water divides, resulting in the great challenges of fine-scale and accurate SIC estimation, especially for regions with low SIC. Besides, the SIC derived by operational algorithms using high-frequency passive microwave observations has great uncertainties in open water or marginal ice zones due to atmospheric effects. In this article, a novel framework is proposed to achieve accurately SIC estimation with improved spatial details from original low-resolution Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) images, with joint the super-resolution (SR) and SIC estimation network. Based on the SR network, the spatial resolution of original AMSR2 images can be improved by four times, benefiting to construct AMSR2 SR features with more high-frequency information for SIC estimation.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are useful tools for studying the water vapor variations over the entire Arctic. In this paper, we discuss precipitable water vapor (PWV) variations from the AIRS and MODIS Level-3 data products in response to Arctic sea ice change during December 2002–November 2016. The results indicate that both AIRS- and MODIS-derived PWV measurements tend to be underestimated, and this underestimation is generally greater for the latter than the former over both land and ocean. Additionally, both the AIRS and MODIS retrievals suggest that the atmospheres are drier in the solid sea ice pack and, to a lesser extent, in the marginal ice zone, than in the open ocean in each season. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between the PWV and sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies are generally observed in all seasons under different ice conditions except in the open ocean, where variations in the PWV may be attributed to the poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes. The Arctic PWV and SIC variation patterns are also dominated by the atmospheric and ice conditions in the solid sea ice pack, respectively. The monthly mean PWV and SIC time series analysis further reveals that the Arctic PWV variations tend to be affected by a delayed effect of approximately 1.2–1.3 months from SIC changes from a climatological perspective.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2913149","Global Change Research Program of China(grant numbers:2015CB953900); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41506211,41606208); State Key Laboratory of Satellite Ocean Environment Dynamics(grant numbers:QNHX1909); Open Fund of the Key Laboratory for Polar Science, Polar Research Institute of China, MNR(grant numbers:KP201701); Shanghai Ocean University; Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development(grant numbers:2018HY-XKQ03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8714041","Arctic water vapor;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);sea ice concentration (SIC)","Arctic;Oceans;Sea measurements;MODIS;Sea ice;Atmospheric measurements;Silicon carbide;Climate change","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric optics;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;climatology;moisture;oceanographic regions;remote sensing;sea ice;time series","AIRS;Arctic sea ice change;December 2002-November 2016;climate change;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;entire Arctic;precipitable water vapor variations;MODIS Level-3 data products;MODIS-derived PWV measurements;MODIS retrievals;solid sea ice pack;marginal ice zone;open ocean;sea ice concentration anomalies;different ice conditions;SIC variation patterns;atmospheric ice conditions;Arctic PWV variations;SIC changes;time 1.2 month to 1.3 month","","7","","49","IEEE","14 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The determination of the 0.° versus θ0 dependence was based on SAR image pairs acquired on ascending and descending orbits over the same sea ice area with a short time difference. The SAR noise floor was subtracted from the HV images. From the image pairs 1.1 by 1.1 km windows representing level first-year ice (LFYI) and deformed first-year ice (DFYI) were manually selected, and a linear regression was fit between the resulting 0.° and θ0 differences of the windows to estimate the slope b1 (dB/1°) between 0.° and θ0. For example, under winter condition b1 for DFYI at HHand HV-polarizations was found to be -0.24 and -0.16 dB/1°, respectively, and b1 for LFYI at HH-polarization was -0.25 dB/1°. It was not possible to determine a reliable b1 for LFYI at HV due to a contamination effect of the S-1 noise floor. The b1 values at HH compared well with previous studies. They can be used to compensate the 0.° incidence angle variation in the S-1 EW SAR images with good accuracy. The HH b1 values are applicable to other S-1 imaging modes and other C-band SAR sensors like RADARSAT-2. Unfortunately, the HV b1 values are specific to the S-1 EW mode due to the noise floor problem.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2721981","project Space-borne observations for detecting and forecasting sea ice cover extremes; European Union’s Horizon 2020 Program(grant numbers:64061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022896","Arctic regions;radar scattering;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Snow;Backscatter;Arctic;Sea surface","geophysical image processing;oceanographic techniques;phased array radar;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","incidence angle dependence;Sentinel-1 SAR imagery;Kara Sea;extra wide mode dualpolarization synthetic aperture radar imagery;sea ice area;SAR noise floor;level first-year ice;LFYI;DFYI;HH-polarization;incidence angle variation;noise floor problem;winter condition;summer melting condition;SAR image pair;HV image;sea ice backscattering coefficient;deformed first-year ice;HV-polarization;S-1 noise floor contamination effect;S-1 EW C-band SAR sensor imaging mode;RADARSAT-2;size 1.1 km;noise figure -0.25 dB;power 1.0 EW;noise figure -0.24 dB;noise figure -0.16 dB;C","","41","","41","OAPA","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This enables us to distinguish sea ice from seawater through studying the values of various DDM observables, which describe the extent of DDM spreading. The area associated with a DDM that results in an observable below or above a threshold value will be classified as covered by sea ice and seawater, respectively. In particular, this study applies an adaptive incoherent summation to each DDM with efforts to increase signal-to-noise ratio and avoid the averaging between DDMs collected over surfaces of different types. Accordingly, an adaptive threshold is employed for the derived observable based on the incoherent summation interval for its corresponding DDM. The proposed sea ice detection method is tested with five different DDM observables. Through comparing DDM observable-based detection results with ground-truth sea ice data, the feasibility of this method is validated with an accuracy of up to 99.73% based on the pixel number observable.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2582690","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:NSERC 402313-2012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7508496","Delay-Doppler map (DDM);Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R);sea ice detection","Sea ice;Sea surface;Remote sensing;Sensors;Satellites","oceanographic techniques;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;seawater","spaceborne GNSS-R sea ice detection;UK TechDemoSat-1 mission;Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry;GNSS-R delay-Doppler maps;seawater;DDM spreading;signal-to-noise ratio;DDM observable-based detection;ground-truth sea ice data","","89","","30","IEEE","9 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Five different polarimetric decomposition approaches, including the Cloude-Pottier decomposition (Cloude), the Freeman three-component decomposition (Freeman3), the Freeman three-component decomposition using the extended Bragg model (Freeman3X), the Yamaguchi three-component decomposition (Yamaguchi3), and the nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition (NNED) were analyzed using 35 scenes of GF-3 PolSAR data collected over the Fram Strait, Arctic from June 14–18, 2017. Polarimetric features extracted from these five methods were evaluated and utilized to train random forest classifiers to classify open water (calm water and rough water) and sea ice types (melted ice, unmelted ice, and deformed ice). The results show that NNED could ensure physically valid decomposed powers while the other three model-based decompositions had negative values. In terms of sea ice classification, NNED had the highest feature importance scores and achieved an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of about 86.18% and 0.82, respectively. Inclusion of radar incidence angle as a feature in the classifier could slightly improve the classification accuracy by about 3%. The influence of incidence angle on sea ice classification accuracy was also investigated and it was found that high incidence angles (39°–46°) were superior to low incidence angles (21°–27°) due to the overall higher accuracies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3170732","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFC1509104); Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory(grant numbers:311021008); Science and Technology Projects in Guangzhou(grant numbers:202102020525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764387","Arctic sea ice;Gaofen-3;polarimetric decomposition;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar;random forest","Sea ice;Ocean temperature;Scattering;Sea surface;Arctic;Solid modeling;Random access memory","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;melting;oceanographic regions;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic summer sea ice classification;Gaofen-3 fully polarimetric SAR data;Chinese Gaofen-3;C-band fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data;Arctic sea ice classification;summer season;polarimetric decomposition approaches;Cloude-Pottier decomposition;Freeman three-component decomposition;Freeman3;extended Bragg model;Freeman3X;Yamaguchi three-component decomposition;Yamaguchi3;nonnegative eigenvalue decomposition;NNED;GF-3 PolSAR data;polarimetric features;melted ice;unmelted ice;deformed ice;model-based decompositions;sea ice classification accuracy;AD 2017 06 14 to 18;Fram Strait;random forest classifiers;open water;calm water;rough water;radar incidence angle","","1","","75","CCBY","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All GLCM texture parameters were found to be dependent on IA, highlighting the need for consideration of angular dependence in texture parameters, particularly in the development of image classification and inversion algorithms utilizing them. Occurrence texture parameters showed negligible influence by IA; however, feature discrimination capability was also lost.

Fine-scale motions can be tracked from high-resolution radar or optical satellite imagery but with limited coverage. Daily motions over the entire Arctic are retrievable from passive microwave data, but at a much lower spatial resolution. Thus, providing motions at the passive microwave spatial and temporal coverage, but at an enhanced spatial resolution, will be a significant benefit. To break the resolution limitation and to boost tracking accuracy, a sequential super-resolved fine-scale sea ice motion tracking framework is proposed in which a hybrid example-based single image super-resolution algorithm is employed before the tracking procedure.

The proposed system is based on an ensemble of deep learning models and conditional random field postprocessing. The following surface ice formations were considered: Icebergs, Deformed ice, Level ice, Broken ice, Ice floes, Floebergs, Floebits, Pancake ice, and Brash ice. Additionally, five non-surface ice categories were considered: Sky, Open water, Shore, Underwater ice, and Melt ponds. To find input parameters for the approach, the performance of 12 different neural network architectures was explored and evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. The best performance was achieved using an ensemble of models having pyramid pooling layers (PSPNet, PSPDenseNet, DeepLabV3+, and UPerNet) and convolutional conditional random field postprocessing with a mean intersection over union score of 0.799, and this outperformed the best single-model approach. The results of this study show that when per-class performance was considered, the Sky was the easiest class to predict, followed by Deformed ice and Open water. Melt pond was the most challenging class to predict. Furthermore, we have extensively explored the strengths and weaknesses of our approach and, in the process, discovered the types of scenes that pose a more significant challenge to the underlying neural networks.

First, the algorithm is modified to process individual swaths and provide concentration from the most recent swaths instead of a 24-hour average. A latency (time since observation) field and a 24-hour concentration range (maximum-minimum) are included to provide indications of data timeliness and variability. Concentration from the Bootstrap algorithm is a secondary field to provide complementary sea ice information. A quality flag is implemented to provide information on interpolation, filtering, and other quality control steps. The AMSR2 concentration fields are compared with a different AMSR2 passive microwave product, and then validated via comparison with sea ice concentration from the Suomi visible and infrared imaging radiometer suite. This validation indicates the AMSR2 concentrations have a bias of 3.9% and an RMSE of 11.0% in the Arctic, and a bias of 4.45% and RMSE of 8.8% in the Antarctic. In most cases, the NOAA operational requirements for accuracy are met.

After the storm, the large-scale scattering contribution increased, while the volume scattering contribution considerably dropped. Surface scattering from the small-scale component of the air-snow interface became significant at high incidence angles.

In 2010, the European Space Agency launched CryoSat-2 carrying SIRAL, a Ku-band RA with objectives of determining the thickness and extent of sea ice and the topography of the ice sheets. One difficulty with Ku-band radar surveys over snow and ice is unknown penetration of RA signal into snow cover. Improving our understanding of the interactions of RA signals with snow and ice is needed to produce accurate elevation products. To this end, we developed a low-power, ultrawideband (12-18 GHz) RA for airborne surveys to provide fine resolution measurements capable of detecting both scattering from the surface and layers within sea ice and ice sheets. These measurements provide a means of identifying the dominant scattering location of lower resolution RA measurements comparable to satellite-based instruments. We generated two products: a full-bandwidth waveform (FBW) to identify scattering targets at fine resolution and a reduced-bandwidth waveform (RBW) to represent conventional RA measurements. Retrackers are used to generate height estimates over various surface conditions for comparisons. Over ice sheets, the leading-edge tracker provided consistent ice-surface elevation measurements between the FBW and RBW results; however, there were significant differences between the results from the centroid tracker. Over sea ice, the location of the dominant return between the results from snow-covered sea ice is highly variable. This paper provides an overview of RA surveys in polar regions, a description of the CReSIS system, and a discussion of the results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2014.2361641","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ANT-0424589); National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:NNX09AR77G,NNG10HP19C,NNX10AT68G,NNX13AD53A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936928","Airborne radar;frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW);radar altimetry review;sea ice;snow;ultrawideband radar;Airborne radar;frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW);radar altimetry review;sea ice;snow;ultrawideband radar","Sea ice;Snow;Radar;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Satellites","glaciology;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow;topography (Earth)","fine resolution radar altimeter measurement;sea ice;polar region monitoring;AD 2010;European Space Agency;ESA CryoSat-2;SIRAL instrument;ice sheet topography;snow;airborne surveys;full bandwidth waveform;reduced bandwidth waveform;CReSIS system","","19","","72","EU","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the present study, SIT estimates derived from ICESat-2 are examined using three retrieval methods, namely, two buoyancy methods with the merged snow depth and empirical snow depth (BMA and BME, respectively) and one empirical estimation method (EEM), and these estimates are compared to near-simultaneous airborne measurements from the IceBird mission in April 2019. Overall, the ICESat-2 total freeboard registers quite well with that from the near-concurrent IceBird mission with a mean bias of 2.5 cm, which demonstrates the high reliability of ICESat-2 data for SIT estimation. However, the much more evident difference between SIT estimations than total freeboard from ICESat-2 and IceBird indicates that other parameters (e.g., snow depth and snow/ice densities) may bring increased uncertainties to the SIT estimation. Overall, BMA is the best method for SIT estimation and has the closest thickness distribution to that of IceBird data with a mean bias of 0.11 m, followed by the BME and EEM methods.

An accurate estimate of the OHC in the Arctic sea ice regions is challenging due to the lack of in-situ data and satellite-based algorithms. In this study, an artificial neural network-based (ANN) novel approach is presented for estimating OHC changes at various standard depth extents (in line with the World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels) in the Arctic sea ice regions based on the relationships of the sea ice thermodynamic parameters from the satellite measurements and in-situ OHC estimates. Because of the potential uncertainty that arises from the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer in the in-situ OHC estimates, a preliminary ANN model was developed with a set of approximations to account for the in-situ OHC stored in the respective depths within the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer. The ANN model architecture was optimized for a depth extent of 700 m and adopted for the remaining depths of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 100 m,150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m, 400 m, 450 m, 500 m, 550 m, 600 m, and 650 m. The new model was robust in capturing the spatial, temporal, and depth variabilities of OHC in the sea ice-covered Arctic regions with greater accuracy (mean bias error 0.022 GJ m−2, mean bias percentage error 0.015%, mean absolute error 0.182 GJ m−2, mean absolute percentage error 0.148%, root mean square error 0.24 GJ m−2, R−2 0.94, slope 0.93, and intercept 25.05 GJ m−2).

The dataset presented here covers the expedition’s first leg (late September to mid-December 2019) in the Siberian Sector of the central Arctic (at about 82 ° N to  $87~^\circ $  N). Daily profiles of reflectivity are retrieved for satellite elevations  $< 45^\circ $ . In agreement with model prediction, the results show best reflectivity contrast (about 5 dB between compact pack-ice and lower ice concentrations) for observations at left-handed circular polarization and elevation angles of 10°–20°. A daily resolved time series of sea-ice relative permittivity is inverted from the left-handed data. In general, the level of inversion results is at the lower limit of sea-ice values (relative permittivity of 3 and below), potentially indicating an influence of incoherent volume scattering. An occasional increase in the relative permittivity is attributed to the presence of water. Sea-ice profiles show anomalies that are confirmed by enhanced model prediction (slab reflection).

Melt ponds on the surface of melting Arctic sea ice are of particular interest as they are sensitive and valuable indicators and are proxy to the processes in the Arctic climate system. Manual analysis of this remote sensing data is extremely difficult and time-consuming due to the complex shapes and unpredictable boundaries of the melt ponds, and that leads to the necessity for automatizing the processes. In this study, we propose a robust and efficient automatic method for melt pond region segmentation and boundary extraction from high-resolution aerial photographs. The proposed algorithm is based on a swin transformer U-Net in which we introduce novel cross-channel attention mechanisms into the decoder design. The framework operates with optical data and allows for classifying imagery into four classes, i.e., sea ice/snow, open water, melt pond, and submerged ice. We use aerial photographs collected during the Healy–Oden Trans Arctic Expedition over Arctic sea ice in the summer season of 2005 as test data. The experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for precise automatic extraction of melt pond geometry, and it can also be extended for other optical data sources that involve melt ponds. The approach has a promising potential to be used to analyze melt ponds' corresponding changes between years.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3213192","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:PHY-2102906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9914571","Arctic;complex system;deep learning;melt ponds;remote sensing;sea ice;swin transformer","Arctic;Sea ice;Transformers;Image segmentation;Annotations;Decoding;Data models","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;ice;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","sea ice feature recognition;melt pond geometry;Healy-Oden Trans Arctic Expedition;boundary extraction;melt pond region segmentation;Arctic climate system;melting Arctic sea ice;Arctic region;high-resolution aerial photographs;swin transformer U-Net","","","","35","CCBY","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Snow metamorphosis is initiated by incoming solar radiation increase and depends on a number of parameters controlling heat exchanges within the snow layer. With variable surface slopes, net solar radiation influx and absorption may differ significantly within a target and impact its dielectric properties. Beside, surface slope orientation influences air flows over each and every snow-air interface and therefore the evaporation rate which in turn controls the latent heat consumed in the process. Vertical profiles of the water content are computed for a range of surface slope orientation, solar radiation influx and evaporation induced latent heat rates. Surface water content variability induced by the radiation diurnal cycle is simulated and the scattering impact inferred. While snow metamorphosis differential rates were confirmed from field observations, the main impact on SAR sea ice images interpretation was mainly related to liquid water content at the snow-air interface and the increased surface scattering incidence angle dependence from electromagnetically smooth surfaces.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127290","component;Sea-ice;SAR;Ridges;Snow wetness","Snow;Sea surface;Surface treatment;Sea ice;Water heating;Solar radiation","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric radiation;atmospheric temperature;backscatter;evaporation;latent heat;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;snow;solar radiation","snow surface slope;differential snow metamorphosis rate impact;SAR sea ice images interpretation;dry snow;SAR satellites;backscattered component;solar radiation increase;heat exchanges;snow layer;variable surface slopes;net solar radiation influx;surface scattering incidence angle dependence;electromagnetically smooth surfaces;liquid water content;snow metamorphosis differential rates;scattering impact;radiation diurnal cycle;surface water content variability;latent heat rates;surface slope orientation;evaporation rate;snow-air interface;impact its dielectric properties","","","","4","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Operation IceBridge (OIB) was launched in 2009 to bridge the gap in polar observations between the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 missions. OIB flew more than 1000 aircraft surveys, providing annual mapping of sea ice, glaciers, and ice sheets in the Antarctic and Arctic. This study utilizes altimetry data and synchronized optical images from OIB to derive Arctic sea ice freeboard estimates for the period from 2009 to 2019. Lead detection is important in determining sea ice freeboard. We developed an improved approach by combining optical images, OIB laser pulse apparent reflectivity, and L1B elevation profiles to detect leads. We then determined the local sea surface height (SSH) with a lowest elevation method from the L1B elevation profile of leads. Thus, sea ice freeboard was calculated by the difference between L2 relative elevation and corresponding local SSH. We derived the estimates of the Arctic sea ice freeboard from 2009 to 2019. Spatial and temporal variations of the freeboard were analyzed based on the estimates. The Arctic annual average sea ice freeboard showed a decreasing trend from OIB observations. However, an obvious increase in multiyear ice freeboard was observed in 2014. We validated our freeboard estimates with OIB freeboard product from the National Snow and Ice Data Center and coincident ICESat-2 freeboard. The comparison shows that our freeboard estimates generally compare well with the ICESat-2 freeboard, and our method is more sensitive to thin ice.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3185230","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFA0603104); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41730102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9803246","Arctic;freeboard;Operation IceBridge (OIB);sea ice;sea surface height (SSH)","Sea ice;Arctic;Sea surface;Altimetry;Sea measurements;Lead;Satellites","height measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","multiyear ice freeboard;OIB freeboard product;Ice Data Center;coincident ICESat-2 freeboard;operation IceBridge;Land Elevation Satellite;ICESat-2 missions;ice sheets;Arctic sea ice freeboard estimates;OIB laser pulse apparent reflectivity;L1B elevation profile;local sea surface height;lowest elevation method;L2 relative elevation;Arctic annual average sea ice freeboard;OIB observations","","","","25","IEEE","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerical simulations of all radars were carried out and the assumption was confirmed that all radars can determine the kind of scattering surface (ice/open water) at the incidence angles less than 12°. The disadvantage of the DPR measurement scheme is that at incidence angles of 1 °_3° the problem may not have a solution. It deals with fact that ice and open water backscatter normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) will be the same.

Knowledge of the angular dependence of different ice types is therefore necessary to account for this effect. While consistent estimates exist for HH polarization for different ice types, they are lacking HV polarization data, especially for multiyear sea ice. Here we investigate the incidence angle dependence of smooth and rough/deformed first-year and multiyear ice of different ages for wintertime dual-polarization Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery in the Beaufort Sea. Assuming a linear relationship, this dependence is determined using the difference in incidence angle and backscatter intensities from ascending and descending images of the same area. At cross-polarization rough/deformed first-year sea ice shows the strongest angular dependence with -0.11 dB/1° followed by multiyear sea ice with -0.07 dB/1°, and old multiyear ice (older than three years) with -0.04 dB/1°. The noise floor is found to have a strong impact on smooth first-year ice and estimated slopes are therefore not fully reliable. At co-polarization, we obtained slope values of -0.24, -0.20, -0.15, and -0.10 dB/1° for smooth first-year, rough/deformed first-year, multiyear, and old multiyear sea ice, respectively. Furthermore, we show that imperfect noise correction of the first subswath influences the obtained slopes for multiyear sea ice. We demonstrate that incidence angle normalization should not only be applied to co-polarization but should also be considered for cross-polarization images to minimize intra ice type variation in backscatter intensity throughout the entire image swath.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2977506","Swedish National Space Agency(grant numbers:Dnr. 164/18,Dnr. 192/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9056528","Incidence angle;sea ice;Sentinel-1","Sea ice;Backscatter;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar;Earth;Arctic","backscatter;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","old multiyear sea ice;first-year ice;old multiyear ice;strongest angular dependence;first-year sea ice;cross-polarization rough;wintertime dual-polarization Sentinel-1 C-band SAR imagery;HV polarization data;HH polarization;different ice types;incidence angle dependence;visual sea ice classification;Beaufort Sea;dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR images;multiyear sea ice incidence angle normalization;backscatter intensity;intra ice type variation;cross-polarization images;noise figure -0.11 dB;noise figure -0.07 dB;noise figure -0.24 dB;noise figure -0.2 dB;noise figure -0.04 dB;noise figure -0.15 dB;noise figure -0.1 dB","","9","","36","CCBY","3 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This motivates the implementation of a CP-dedicated automatic scene classification approach. First, an existing unsupervised segmentation algorithm called iterative region growing using semantics (IRGS) is used to segment ice-class homogeneous regions to reduce the impact of speckle noise. Second, a support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the ice-type labels for each homogeneous region. Two complex quad-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 scenes are used to mathematically simulate the corresponding CP scenes for algorithm testing. Classification accuracy shows that using only the two CP intensity images leads to improved results compared with standard dual-polarimetric scenes. Using the CP data, the best classification results are obtained with the reconstructed QP data for the IRGS segmentation and all derived CP features for the SVM labeling.

We present a systematic intercomparison of the backscatter signature in VV polarization ( ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$ ) and the sea ice classification from three scatterometer systems using the same ice classification approach. The systems are the Ku-band quick scatterometer (QSCAT) and the newly launched Chinese rotating fan-beam scatterometer (RFSCAT) and the C-band advanced scatterometer (ASCAT).

With reference to ASCAT,  ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$  bias between QSCAT and RFSCAT results from their different incidence angles. A continuous declining trend of  ${\sigma }_{\mathrm {vv}}^{\mathrm {o}}$  from MYI and FYI is observed during winter, with a greater difference between MYI and FYI in the Ku-band.

Identification of these PLs has been done using the geo-informational system, allowing synergistic data analysis, making advantage from overlaying various types of data. Several case studies with the comprehensive synoptic analysis, fulfilled on the basis of the NCEP-CFSR data, have confirmed the PL cases in spite of their poor visibility in the regular scatterometer and radiometer wind fields near the sea ice edge. It has been found that the PL identification over the sea ice edge is fast and confident with the geo-informational system, consolidating various satellite data types of different spatial and temporal resolution.

The sea-ice statistics given by the floe size distribution, being an important parameter for climate and wave- and structure-ice analysis, is challenging to calculate due to difficulties in ice floe identification, particularly the separation of seemingly connected ice floes. In this paper, the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake algorithm is applied to solve this problem. To evolve the GVF snake algorithm automatically, an initialization based on the distance transform is proposed to detect individual ice floes, and the morphological cleaning is afterward applied to smoothen the shape of each identified ice floe. Based on the identification result, the image is separated into four different layers: ice floes, brash pieces, slush, and water. This makes it further possible to present a color map of the ice floes and brash pieces based on sizes, and the corresponding ice floe size distribution histogram. The proposed algorithm yields an acceptable identification result, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in a case study.

Existing methods suffer from noise interference and the mixture of water and ice caused high segmentation error and less robustness. In this article, we propose a novel sea ice floe segmentation algorithm from HRO images based on texture-sensitive superpixeling and two-stage thresholding. First, sparse components are extracted from the HRO images using the robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and noise is removed by the bilateral filter. The enhanced image is obtained by combining the low-rank matrix and the sparse components. Second, a texture-sensitive simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm is introduced for presegmentation of the enhanced HRO image. Third, a learning-based adaptive thresholding in the two stages is employed to generate the refined segmentation from the derived superpixels blocks. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on two HRO images using visual assessment, quantitative evaluation (with seven metrics), and histogram comparison. The superior performance of the proposed method has demonstrated its efficacy for sea ice floe segmentation.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3040614","Natural and Environmental Research Council(grant numbers:NE/S002545/1); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201906495007); Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072122); Education Department of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019KSYS009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9271815","Adaptive two-stage thresholding;high-resolution optical (HRO) image;low-rank sparse representation;sea ice floe segmentation;texture-sensitive superpixeling","Image segmentation;Sea ice;Optical sensors;Optical imaging;Optical filters;Sparse matrices;Integrated optics;Climate change","geophysical image processing;image segmentation;image texture;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","novel sea ice floe segmentation algorithm;HRO images;texture-sensitive superpixeling;two-stage thresholding;sparse components;robust principal component analysis;texture-sensitive simple linear iterative clustering superpixel algorithm;enhanced HRO image;learning-based adaptive thresholding;refined segmentation;derived superpixels blocks;effective segmentation;high-resolution optical remote sensing images;sea ice evolutions;water;high segmentation error","","","","40","CCBY","25 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first two algorithm variants were trained using only open water and fully ice-covered patches, based on the FMI ice charts, and they had a similar CNN structure. These two algorithm variants differ only in deriving the segmentwise SIC from the CNN output. In the third algorithm, variant synthetic SIC data derived as a mixture of open water and fully ice-covered ice patches according to the ice charts were used in training. The estimation results were evaluated with respect to the FMI ice chart SIC for an independent test dataset.

Firstly, a biased position attention module is used to improve the detection accuracy of details, which fuses scene features and local object features. Secondly, given that a single loss function has its own limitations, a weighted loss function is designed to further improve the edge detection performance.

We find that increases in PWV and total CF generally coincide with the Arctic sea ice decline in each season, and both PWV and total CF anomalies are typically correlated with SIC anomalies in all seasons except for the PWV anomalies in summer. In addition, during all seasons except summer, the low CF generally exhibits closer connection than the middle and high CFs with the trend in total CF and sea ice, and the correlation of SIC with total CF anomalies is governed by that with low CF anomalies. The sensitivities of SIC to changes in PWV and total CF are typically negative, and they are generally consistent with each other in each season. Moreover, the negative sensitivities of SIC to low, middle, and high CFs are greatest and most extensive in summer. The contribution of PWV is typically much greater and more extensive than that of total CF to Arctic sea ice change in all seasons.

The geographical location and climate impose additional constraints on satellite-based monitoring, making it necessary to use Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Dark features or low backscatter areas are frequent within the SAR images and their occurrence may indicate oil spills or so-called lookalikes. Automatic oil spill detection hinges on accurate separation of the lookalikes from actual oil spills. Two main types exist in the Barents Sea: newly formed sea ice and low wind regions, where the former occur during the freezing part of the year (approx. November - April) and the other year around. Mapping the occurrence of oil spills and lookalikes in the Barents Sea on a seasonal basis would add to our understanding and knowledge of the low backscatter phenomena. Awareness of the major locations of oil spills, natural oil seeps, or lookalikes, are important for operational services and their effort to reduce false alarms. Here, we explore the use of a segmentation-based dark feature detection method with Sentinel-l Extra Wide-Swath SAR images. We test the method on images acquired over the Barents Sea during the freezing season, and cross-validate the results with two sets of dark features segmented by operational expert oil spill and sea ice monitoring services.

During this process, uncertainties from sensor transitions, processing method update, the addition of new data sources and the choice for a statistical method can all influence the final result (Cavalieri et al. 2012; Eisenman et al. 2014).","2153-7003","978-1-5090-3332-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730270","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730270","","Sea ice;Market research;Antarctica;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave radiometry","brightness;oceanographic regions;regression analysis;sea ice;sensitivity analysis;time series","sensitivity analysis;long-term trend;Antarctic sea ice extent;diminishing ice extent;Arctic Ocean;Antarctica;IPCC AR5;IPCC AR4;IPCC 2007;long time series;passive microwave data;South Pole;North Pole;sea ice concentration;brightness temperature;linear regression model;statistical method","","","","8","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To determine the separability of these two varying but similar appearing low backscatter ocean surfaces, multipolarization features are utilized from both SAR datasets. The discrimination is evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test. All imagery was obtained during several sea ice campaigns in the Arctic Ocean and separate oil spill campaigns in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico, with each campaign collecting in situ observations. We observe that the polarization difference (VV-HH) reliably separates the mineral oil slicks and newly formed sea ice areas using UAVSAR images, due to the low noise floor and subsequent high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) radiometric performance of the airborne system. The comparably higher noise floor and related lower SNR hampers the separability in the RS-2 images. Simulated noise floors were generated by adding white Gaussian noise to the UAVSAR data, which show that discrimination between the two low backscatter phenomena using multipolarization features is possible, provided that both datasets are still well above the noise floor. The pixel resolution has a limited effect on the separability.

On first-year sea ice (FYI), spatiotemporal variations in snow properties can cause the Ku-band main radar scattering horizon to appear above the snow/sea ice interface. This can increase the estimated sea ice freeboard by several centimeters, leading to FYI thickness overestimations. This article examines the expected changes in Ku-band main scattering horizon and its impact on FYI thickness estimates, with variations in snow temperature, salinity, and density derived from ten naturally occurring Arctic FYI Cases encompassing saline/nonsaline, warm/cold, simple/complexly layered snow (4-45 cm) overlying FYI (48-170 cm). Using a semi-empirical modeling approach, snow properties from these Cases are used to derive layer-wise brine volume and dielectric constant estimates, to simulate the Ku-band main scattering horizon and delays in radar propagation speed. Differences between modeled and observed FYI thickness are calculated to assess sources of error. Under both cold and warm conditions, saline snow covers are shown to shift the main scattering horizon above from the snow/sea ice interface, causing thickness retrieval errors. Overestimates in FYI thicknesses of up to 65% are found for warm, saline snow overlaying thin sea ice. Our simulations exhibited a distinct shift in the main scattering horizon when the snow layer densities became greater than 440 kg/m3, especially under warmer snow conditions. Our simulations suggest a mean Ku-band propagation delay for snow of 39%, which is higher than 25%, suggested in previous studies.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2966432","Norges Forskningsråd; KLIMAFORSK programme(grant numbers:#240639); Centre of Ice, Climate and Ecosystems; Norsk Polarinstitutt; N-ICE project; Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway; Joint Research Program of the Institute of Low Temperature Science, Hokkaido University; Arctic Challenge for Sustainability; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:#15K16135,#24-4175); Centre for Earth Observation Science; University of Manitoba; Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Polar Knowledge Canada(grant numbers:#NST-1718-0024); Natural Environment Research Council(grant numbers:NE/M005852/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000883","Radar altimetry;sea ice;snow","Snow;Sea ice;Arctic;Scattering;Ocean temperature;Salinity (geophysical);Temperature measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","Ku-band main scattering horizon;snow temperature;Arctic FYI Cases;semiempirical modeling approach;dielectric constant estimates;modeled thickness;saline snow covers;thickness retrieval errors;FYI thicknesses;FYI thickness overestimations;estimated sea ice freeboard;Ku-band main radar scattering horizon;Arctic sea ice thickness estimates;snow properties;norwegian arctic;first-year sea ice thickness;modeled Ku-band altimeter estimates;snow property controls;mean Ku-band propagation delay;warmer snow conditions;snow layer densities","","11","","67","CCBY","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we introduce an approach to evaluate ice roughness that can aid in routing of ice roads and assessment of spatial variability and long-term changes in trafficability. Drawing on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) polarimetry, SAR interferometry (InSAR), and other remote sensing techniques, we integrated approaches into the trafficability assessment that had rarely been applied over sea ice in the past. Analysis of aerial photogrammetry obtained through structure-from-motion helped verify cm-scale accuracy of X-band InSAR-derived ridge height and link L-band polarimetric classification to specific roughness regimes. Jointly, these approaches enable a km-scale evaluation of ridge topography and cm- to m-scale roughness - both critical for the assessment of trafficability. A trafficability index was derived from such SAR data in conjunction with analysis of ice trail routing and ice use near Utqiaġvik, Alaska. The index identifies areas of reduced trafficability, associated with pressure ridges or rubble ice, and served to delineate favorable trail routes for different modes of transportation, with potential uses ranging from ice road routing to emergency evacuation. Community outreach is needed to explore how this approach could assist different ice users in reducing risk, minimizing trail or ice construction efforts, and improving safety.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2764961","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF-0856867); Swedish National Space Board(grant numbers:Dnr 192/15); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8239599","Radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;sea ice;surface roughness;surface topography;synthetic aperture radar","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea surface;Roads","photogrammetry;radar imaging;radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","surface roughness;ice trafficability;SAR polarimetry;transportation;ice roughness;ice roads;spatial variability;integrated approaches;trafficability assessment;X-band InSAR;trafficability index;SAR data;ice trail routing;ice use;reduced trafficability;rubble ice;ice road routing;traversing sea ice;SAR interferometry;Arctic landfast sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;remote sensing techniques;aerial photogrammetry analysis","","12","","95","IEEE","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous efforts have focused on using reanalysis albedo data, but their uncertainties remain unknown. In this letter, we evaluated four popularly used reanalysis surface albedo products, namely, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the Japanese 55-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55), over the Arctic Ocean using satellite-retrieved product (CLARA-SAL) from 1982 to 2009. Owing to the flawed parameterization scheme or problematic model inputs, reanalysis products are unable to capture both the interannual variation and long-term reduction of surface albedo in the Arctic. This results in a large bias in the decline of shortwave radiative forcing at both surface (from -11.74 to -38.25 W m-2) and top of atmosphere (from -5.35 to -20.19 W m-2). The most significant underestimation occurred in the melt season and after sea-ice melting acceleration started since 1996, in the central Arctic Basin north of 80° N, which is likely due to the failure in simulating the influence of thinning ice and decreasing snow depth. The JRA-55 albedo product outperformed the other three products, which is likely due to the employment of observed sea-ice concentration on the parameterization scheme. On the other hand, the other three reanalysis products, namely, ERA-Interim, MERRA, and CFSR, are unable to effectively track the interannual variation of surface albedo and significantly underestimate (from -0.016 to -0.021 relative to -0.048, by one-third to half) the decreasing surface albedo.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2515159","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)(grant numbers:2013AA121201); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395314","Arctic region;evaluation and assessment;reanalysis product;satellite application;sea ice;surface albedo;Arctic region;evaluation and assessment;reanalysis product;satellite application;sea ice;surface albedo","Sea surface;Arctic;Satellites;Sea ice;Ocean temperature;Meteorology;Atmospheric modeling","albedo;oceanographic regions;sea ice;underwater optics","four reanalysis surface albedo data set;Arctic region;satellite product;climate dynamics;energy budget;European centre-for-medium-range weather forecasts interim reanalysis;MERRA;JRA-55;CLARA-SAL;ERA-Interim;satellite-retrieved product;CFSR;interannual variation;AD 1982 to 2009;shortwave radiative forcing;sea-ice melting acceleration;parameterization scheme;sea-ice concentration;interannual surface albedo variation","","6","","28","IEEE","29 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, we investigated the ability of C-band polarimetric parameters in a controlled mesocosm to accurately identify and discriminate between oil-contaminated and uncontaminated newly formed sea ice (NI). Parameters, such as total power, copolarization ratio, copolarization correlation coefficient, and others, were derived from the normalized radar cross section and covariance matrix to characterize the temporal evolution of NI before and after oil spill events. For separation purposes, entropy ( $H$ ) and mean-alpha ( $\alpha$ ) were extracted from eigen decomposition of the coherency matrix. The  $H$  versus  $\alpha $  scatterplot revealed that a threshold classifier of 0.3- $H$  and 18°- $\alpha $  could distinguish oil-contaminated NI from its oil-free surroundings. From the temporal evolution of the polarimetric parameters, the results demonstrate that the copolarization correlation coefficient is the most reliable polarimetric parameter for oil spill detection, as it provides information on a variety of oil spill scenarios, including oil encapsulated within ice and oil spreading on top of ice. Overall, these findings will be used to support existing and future C-band polarimetric radar satellites for resolving ambiguities associated with Arctic oil spill events, particularly during freeze-up seasons.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3232083","GENICE; Research Manitoba; Canada Research Chair (CRC) Programs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998524","Arctic;discrimination;eigen decomposition;oil spill;polarimetric parameter;radar;sea ice","Oils;Ice;Sea ice;Radar polarimetry;Ice surface;Backscatter;Sea surface","entropy;marine pollution;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;radar cross-sections;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic oil spill events;C-band polarimetric parameters;C-band radar polarimetric parameters;climate-driven sea ice loss;coherency matrix;controlled mesocosm;copolarization correlation coefficient;copolarization ratio;covariance matrix;existing C-band polarimetric radar satellites;future C-band polarimetric radar satellites;increased human activity;mean-alpha;normalized radar cross section;oil spill detection;oil spill scenarios;oil spills;oil-contaminated NI;oil-free surroundings;reliable polarimetric parameter;temporal evolution;uncontaminated newly formed sea ice","","","","58","CCBY","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The SAR retrievals were validated with drifting buoys. For temporal intervals of S1 data of approximately 24 h, 15 254 collocations were collected from January to June and from October to December, yielding a 0.00 cm/s bias for the drift velocity magnitude and 0.27° for direction with corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.47 cm/s and 4.73°. Using temporal intervals of S1 data of less than 24 h, we retrieved SID from July to September. A total of 644 collocations yields a comparison with a bias of 0.52 cm/s and 4.62° for the drift magnitude and direction, respectively. The corresponding RMSE values are 1.85 cm/s and 20.73°. The comparisons demonstrate better performance than the operational SAR-based SID product using the maximum cross correlation (MCC) method and are consistent with seasonal trends in drift velocity with the coarse-resolution product.

Many machine-learning methods including deep learning can be employed for ice-type detection, and most classifiers tend to prefer different feature combinations. In order to find the optimal classifier-feature assembly (OCF) for sea ice classification, it is necessary to assess their performance differences. The objective of this letter is to make a recommendation for the OCF for sea ice classification using Cryosat-2 (CS-2) data. Six classifiers including convolutional neural network (CNN), Bayesian, K nearest-neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were studied. CS-2 altimeter data of November 2015 and May 2016 in the whole Arctic were used. The overall accuracy was estimated using multivalidation to evaluate the performances of individual classifiers with different feature combinations.

In the last decades, the wave propagation in ice has been studied by in situ measurements, satellite imagery, and laboratory experiments using ice tanks. As well, different theoretical models of the behaviour of waves in ice have been developed. We focus on events of long swell waves encountering the MIZ, mainly on the northern hemisphere. Images from the TerraSAR-X (TS-X) satellite are used to investigate the progression of waves and their behaviour in ice. The included TS-X scenes were acquired in Stripmap mode and are up to few hundred kilometres in length. In particular, the spatial variability of wave parameters through the MIZ is analysed. This yields valuable clues on the interaction between ocean waves and sea ice.

After more than a decade of research, it has been observed that spatial information can very significantly improve the accuracy of land use/land cover maps. In this context, the goal of this paper is to propose a few insights on how spatial information can benefit to (passive) microwave remote sensing. To do so, we focus here on mathematical morphology and provide some illustrative examples where morphological operators can improve the processing and analysis of microwave radiometric information. Such tools had great influence on multispectral/hyperspectral remote sensing in the past, and are expected to have a similar impact in the microwave field in the future, with the launch of upcoming missions with improved spatial resolution, e.g. SMOS-NEXT.","","978-1-5090-2951-8","10.1109/MICRORAD.2016.7530523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530523","Mathematical Morphology;Multiscale representation;Feature extraction;Spatial information;Remote sensing","Remote sensing;Microwave radiometry;Microwave imaging;Microwave theory and techniques;Image reconstruction;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits","geophysical image processing;land cover;land use;radiometry;terrain mapping","morphological tool;passive microwave remote sensing data;Earth observation;microwave radiometry;soil moisture;ocean salinity;sea ice cover;image processing;data analysis technique;automatic measurement;optical remote sensing;hyperspectral remote sensing;land use map;land cover map;morphological operator;microwave radiometric information;multispectral remote sensing;spatial resolution;SMOS-NEXT","","1","","8","IEEE","4 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in TerraSAR-X ScanSAR images of ocean scenes, the scalloping and interscan banding (ISB) artifacts are usually visible. Though these two artifacts could be reduced to a certain degree where residual artifacts do not impede the visual interpretation of SAR images, this is not the case when it comes to sea ice classification. The difficulty mainly comes from the involvement of texture features in sea ice classification. Texture features, especially gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are useful bases for sea ice classification using SAR data in single or dual polarization. When GLCM is applied to TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data, however, scalloping and ISB artifacts are found to be intensified, further affecting the classification result. How to largely eliminate the effects of scalloping and ISB on sea ice classification has not been studied thoroughly yet. In this paper, an approach combining Kalman filter, GLCM, and support vector machine is proposed. An independent testing shows that this approach is effective at the removal of scalloping and ISB's effects on sea ice classification using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data, with the overall accuracy of 88.26%.

Deep learning has demonstrated its ability to perform complex and accurate analysis of images; here, we apply deep learning to estimate ice concentration from SAR scenes. We developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts SIC from SAR, trained upon passive microwave data. The model achieves a 5.24%/7.87% error on its train and test set, respectively. To assess the real-world applicability, we performed an independent validation on 18 SAR scenes (from two distinct geographical regions), not previously seen during training or test. Comparing against human-generated ice analysis charts, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2059, competitive with passive microwave (EL1 = 0.1863) for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. For the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region, we achieved an L1 error of 0.2653, significantly better than the passive microwave result (EL1 = 0.3593). By using novel techniques for model training, as well as training entirely upon passive microwave data, we present an accessible and robust method of developing similar systems for processing SAR.1 Our results suggest that with further postprocessing, CNNs are accurate and robust enough to be used for operational tasks.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2892723","Marine Environmental Observation Prediction and Response Network; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636521","Image processing;neural networks;remote sensing;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits;Silicon carbide;Sea ice","geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice concentration;training convolutional neural networks;passive microwave data;passive microwave sensors;deep learning;deep convolutional neural network;human-generated ice analysis charts;processing SAR;SAR scenes;weather conditions;Canadian Arctic Archipelago;Gulf of Saint Lawrence region","","25","","37","IEEE","6 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Compared with the achievements in land surface albedo studies, the global distributions of ocean water and sea ice albedo are seldom addressed. This study designed an operational global OWA algorithm based on the three-component reflectance model of the ocean water: sun glint, whitecaps, and water-leaving reflectance. The related achievements in these three areas are reviewed and integrated into the operational algorithm. After the sensitive analysis, the algorithm is compared with previous studies and validated with ground observations at COVE site located 25 km east of Virginia Beach (36.91° N, 75.71° W), and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm is generally consistent with previous parameterization scheme. As an example, the global OWAs in summer and winter 2011 are generated using the remote sensing reflectance data sets via the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications meteorological reanalysis data set. The generated product includes instantaneous (e.g., local noon) and daily mean OWAs under both clear-sky and white-sky conditions. Upon the examples, the local noon clear-sky OWA shows a significant latitude variation due to the dominance of the solar angle, whereas the white-sky OWA is sensitive to wind speeds and optical constituents. The global distribution of the daily mean OWA exhibits a similar trend to the local noon OWA. However, the daily mean clear-sky OWA is significantly larger than the local noon OWA; this finding should be noted when using OWA products for energy balance research. Additionally, all forms of OWA products exhibit increase in coastal areas with high input of terrestrial matters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2468054","International S&T Cooperation Program of China(grant numbers:2012DFG21710); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371356,41331171); National High Technology Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2013AA122801); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2014M550025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7236898","Ocean water albedo (OWA);sun glint;water-leaving reflectance;whitecaps;Ocean water albedo (OWA);sun glint;water-leaving reflectance;whitecaps","Open wireless architecture;Sea surface;Wind speed;Remote sensing;Sea measurements;Biological system modeling","albedo;data analysis;remote sensing;sea ice;seawater","ocean water albedo estimation;global climate variation;land surface albedo study;ocean water global distribution;sea ice albedo;global OWA algorithm;sun glint;whitecaps;water-leaving reflectance;COVE site;Virginia beach;summer season;winter season;AD 2011;remote sensing reflectance dataset;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer dataset;Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications meteorological reanalysis dataset;solar angle","","32","","83","OAPA","2 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is challenging to validate even basic essential variables, such as the sea ice extent, due to a lack of appropriate validation data. Instead of focusing on validation, this paper looks at the use of categorical triple collocation (CTC) for the task of quantitatively comparing three colocated data sets. CTC has been developed and used in earlier studies to rank binary data sets. In this paper, we extend earlier studies and bring in recent results from the binary classification community to estimate the class imbalance (the relative proportion of each class, ice or water). We then use this class imbalance to obtain quantitative estimates of the proportion correct of ice (sensitivity) and the proportion correct of water (specificity). The methodology is first tested using toy data, after which three data sets from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the east coast of Canada, are used. These data sets are from an ice-ocean model, a passive microwave sea ice concentration retrieval, and a sea ice concentration retrieval from synthetic aperture radar (SAR). By looking at both the sensitivity and the specificity, it is found that the passive microwave data have difficulty in recognizing ice during freeze-up, but they perform well at obtaining the correct water observations. This distinction cannot be made by ranking the data sets. The CTC method is compared with, and found to be complementary to, a validation using ice/water states from the interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2928452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798990","Binary data;sea ice validation;triple collocation","Sea ice;Sensitivity;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;snow;synthetic aperture radar","categorical triple collocation;Saint Lawrence;sea ice cover;climate studies;ice operations;basic essential variables;sea ice extent;CTC;colocated data sets;binary data sets;binary classification community;class imbalance;toy data;passive microwave sea ice concentration retrieval;passive microwave data;correct water observations","","4","","34","IEEE","14 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The number of pixels viewed by the CNN model in the input image used to generate an output pixel, or the receptive field, is important to detect large features or physical objects such as sea ice and correctly classify them. In addition, a noise phenomenon is present in the Sentinel-1 ESA Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) v2.9 SAR data, particularly in subswath transitions, visible as long vertical lines and grained particles resembling small sea ice floes. To overcome these two challenges, we suggest adjusting the receptive field of the popular U-Net CNN architecture used for semantic segmentation. It is achieved by symmetrically adding additional blocks of convolutional, pooling and upsampling layers in the encoder and decoder of the U-Net, constituting an increase in the number of levels. This shows great improvements in the performance and in the homogeneity of predictions. Second, training models on SAR data noise-corrected with an enhanced technique has demonstrated a significant increase in model performance and enabled better predictions in uncertain regions. An eight-level U-Net trained on the alternative noise-corrected SAR data is presented to be capable of correctly predicting many ambiguous SAR signatures and increased the performance by 8.44% points compared with the regular U-Net trained on the ordinary ESA IPF v2.9 noise-corrected SAR data.

To improve the estimation accuracy and calculation efficiency, we developed a method for estimating the surface albedo of Arctic sea ice using an ensemble back-propagation neural network (EBPNN) model. A bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo dataset of snow, white ice, and melt ponds was constructed using the asymptotic analytical radiative transfer (AART) model, and the nonlinear relationships between the surface reflectance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and surface albedo were established using the EBPNN model (prediction correlation coefficient  $(R)= 0.996$  and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.023). Our results are consistent with the in situ measurements and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) product ( $R= 0.916$ , RMSE = 0.085, and bias = 0.001), in which the reflectance anisotropy of the snow/ice and the influence of melt ponds were fully considered, and the calculation efficiency was significantly improved by using the EBPNN model.

Inspired by the demand for a computer-based mapping system, we have developed an automatic sea-ice classification method that integrates spatial contexture (unsupervised segmentation) with textural features (supervised pixel-level labeling). First, the full-scene image is oversegmented, and the segments are merged into homogeneous regions across the entire scene. Second, pixel-based classifiers (support vector machine and random forest) are compared for their ability to label the generated homogeneous regions. Finally, the segmentation and labeling are combined using a proposed energy function. The proposed method was tested on 18 dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes acquired over the Beaufort Sea. This dataset contains water, young ice, first-year ice, and multiyear ice covering melt, summer, and freeze-up seasons. The proposed method obtains an average classification accuracy of 86.33% based on the leave-one-out validation. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves promising classification results in both the quantity and quality measurements compared with benchmark methods. The robustness against incidence angle variance indicates that the proposed method is well qualified for operational sea-ice mapping.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3205849","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-2017-04869,DGDND-2017-00078,RGPAS2017-50794,RGPIN-2019-06744); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9887856","Classification;RADARSAT-2;random forest (RF);sea ice;segmentation;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Support vector machines;Radar polarimetry;Image segmentation;Monitoring;Labeling;Climate change","geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;ships;spaceborne radar;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","supervised pixel-level labeling;full-scene image;entire scene;pixel-based classifiers;support vector machine;generated homogeneous regions;dual-polarization RADARSAT-2 scenes;Beaufort Sea;young ice;first-year ice;multiyear ice;average classification accuracy;operational sea-ice mapping;RADARSAT-2 imagery;spatial contexture;textural features;mapping different types;sea ice;polar oceans;shipping navigation;climate change modeling;local community safety;ice charts;Canadian Ice Service;computer-based mapping system;automatic sea-ice classification method;unsupervised segmentation","","1","","69","CCBYNCND","12 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, in situ SSS data in the Arctic Ocean are very sparse. The L-band microwave radiometer on board of NASA SMAP mission provides salinity measurements since April 2015, at 40 km resolution with global ocean coverage in ~3 days. With improved land/ice correction and RFI detection, SMAP SSS are retrieved in ice-free regions near the river mouth and ice edge. The collocated SMAP SSS and in situ salinity data collected by AXCTD from Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) 2016 field campaign along Greenland coast show reasonable agreement in revealing the freshening signature, which is not seen in ocean model output. During the open water season (August), SMAP SSS were retrieved in Chukchi Sea (2015), in Prudhoe Bay and East Siberian Sea (2016), and in Kara Sea in both years. The SSS contrast between the two years is consistent with sea ice concentration observations. Variability of SSS in Kara Sea is correlated positively with adjacent river discharges but negatively with the salinity of water transported from Atlantic Ocean.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519602","SMAP;SSS;Arctic;freshwater;monitoring;sea ice;river discharge","Rivers;Oceans;Arctic;Sea ice;Salinity (geophysical);Discharges (electric)","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;rivers;sea ice;seawater","Greenland coast;in situ salinity data;in situ SSS data;Atlantic Ocean;sea ice concentration observations;SSS contrast;Kara Sea;East Siberian Sea;Chukchi Sea;open water season;ice edge;river mouth;ice-free regions;global ocean coverage;salinity measurements;NASA SMAP mission;L-band microwave radiometer;open straits;ocean transport;evaporation;precipitation;surface freshwater;river discharge;Arctic Ocean;water cycle;Arctic freshwater system;SMAP Sea surface salinity","","1","","4","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the early 2000s, the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) at the University of Kansas (KU) has designed, developed, and deployed airborne ultrawide-band (UWB) FM-CW radars, called Snow Radars, on National Science Foundation (NSF)-, NASA-, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)-, and Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI)-provided aircraft in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and generated a large amount of snow data products. In addition to the significant standalone value of the snow-thickness measurements, these data are being used in estimating Arctic sea ice thickness, which is a key variable in the study of atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions. This article provides a review of snow remote sensing techniques with airborne FM-CW radars to document the operating principle, design, and evolution of CReSIS' UWB FM-CW radars and discuss and promote understanding of the advantages and limitations associated with these systems.","2168-6831","","10.1109/MGRS.2017.2663325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7946223","","Airborne radar;Frequency modulation;Sea ice;Radar remote sensing;Sea measurements;Radar measurements;Frequency measurement","CW radar;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow","airborne measurements;snow thickness;frequency-modulated-continuous-wave radar;sea ice;land ice;airborne platform;snow deposition;Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets;University of Kansas;airborne ultrawide-band FM-CW radars;National Science Foundation;Antarctic regions;Arctic regions;atmosphere-ocean-ice interactions","","31","","52","IEEE","12 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Its magnitude and direction can be automatically retrieved using pairs of satellite images acquired over the same area. However, external reference data for validation of drift retrievals, such as tracks from buoys, are sparse. Information about the reliability of the retrieved ice drift field is crucial for applications such as operational sea ice mapping or validation of computer models for simulations of sea ice dynamics. In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic measure based on the properties of radar image pairs to assess the reliability of the retrieved ice drift vectors. The proposed method combines different parameters, e.g., correlation coefficient and two textural quantities, to provide information about the suitability of subimage regions for pattern matching. In this way, we generate a quality parameter [called confidence factor (CFA)] for the calculated ice drift velocities. The CFA is compared to results obtained by “backmatching.” The latter requires that the drift field is computed twice using the image pair, first in sequential and then in reversed order. For stable ice conditions, the results show that areas regarded as unreliable by the CFA compare well with the areas revealing larger differences from backmatching.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2340572","Alfred Wegener Institute in the framework of the German Earth Observing Network (Network EOS); Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology; EU 7th Framework project SIDARUS(grant numbers:262922); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875952","Motion estimation;reliability;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;uncertainty;Motion estimation;reliability;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;uncertainty","Correlation;Reliability;Vectors;Sea ice;Pattern matching;Speckle","motion estimation;oceanographic techniques;reliability;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice motion retrieval;synthetic aperture radar images;reliability;retrieved ice drift vectors;correlation coefficient;textural quantities;pattern matching;confidence factor;ice drift velocities;backmatching","","14","","24","IEEE","11 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental scatterometer and physical data were collected near Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, Canada, between May 20 and May 28, 2014, covering a severe storm event on May 25. We use the small perturbation scattering theory to model small-scale surface scattering, the Mie scattering theory to estimate the level of volume scattering in snow, and the Kirchhoff physical optics model to compute the large-scale surface scattering component. We observed good agreement between the model and experimental nn and VV NRCS. Before the storm, R2 between model and experimental NRCS was 0.88 and 0.82 for VV and nn, respectively. After the storm, R2 was 0.81 and 0.78 for VV and nn, respectively. Our model results suggest an overall increase in surface roughness after the storm event, supported by LiDAR measurements of the snow surface topography. Before the storm, the large-scale and small-scale surface scattering from the air-snow interface as well as volume scattering components dominated. After the storm, the large- and small-scale scattering contributions increased, while the volume scattering component considerably dropped. We attribute these effects to the increase in surface roughness and snow moisture content during the poststorm period. Our results could aid in interpretation of timeseries synthetic aperture radar images with respect to physical properties of snow and ice during the winter-spring transition period.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2712519","Canada Research Chairs; Canada Excellence Research Chairs Programs; Northern Scientific Training Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8002669","Electromagnetic wave scattering;Kirchhoff model;layered media;rough interfaces;small perturbation theory;snow-covered sea ice;surface and volume scattering","Scattering;Snow;Sea ice;Sea surface;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface topography","backscatter;Mie scattering;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar;time series","scattering contributions;C-band radar backscatter;snow-covered first-year sea ice;winter-spring transition;time-series angular dependencies;VV normalized radar cross-sections;first-year snow-covered sea ice;winter-spring transition period;experimental scatterometer;physical data;Cambridge Bay;Nunavut;Canada;AD 2014 05 20 to 28;small perturbation scattering theory;small-scale surface scattering;Mie scattering theory;Kirchhoff physical optics model;large-scale surface scattering component;surface roughness;LiDAR measurements;snow surface topography;air-snow interface;volume scattering component;snow moisture content;poststorm period;time series synthetic aperture radar images","","5","","58","IEEE","4 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the first original band with a large amount of information is determined based on the mutual information theory. Subsequently, the second original band with the least similarity is chosen by the spectral correlation measure method. Finally, the subsequent bands are selected through the linear prediction method, and the support vector machine classifier model is utilized for sea ice classification. In the experiments of Baffin Bay, comparative analyses are carried out between the proposed method and traditional sea ice detection methods.

Accurately characterizing the scene is crucial for oceanographic and cryospheric applications. To that end, a sea ice fraction model, composed of passive microwave sea ice concentration retrievals and an instrument simulator that integrates radiative power coming from all around the antenna, is used. We investigate the model currently used operationally to derive the ice fraction affecting the Aquarius observations and show that it can be significantly improved. On the one hand, the current model tends to overestimate sea ice fraction in the marginal ice zone where observations are used for salinity retrievals. On the other hand, the current model underestimates ice fraction within the ice pack where observations are used to derive sea ice properties. For the northern hemisphere, we also find evidence of the sea ice type impact on L-band radiometric observations.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based ice thickness charts were used as reference data. Thin ice detection was studied using polarization and spectral gradient ratios (PR and GR) calculated from the 36/37 and 89/91 GHz radiometer data. Thresholds for thin ice detection and maximum thicknesses for the detected thin ice (hT) were determined, as were error rates for misdetections. The results for different 1-D PR and GR parameters led to the conclusion that the AMSR-E PR36 and H-polarized GR8936 would be the best parameters for a 2-D classifier. We adopted the linear discrimination analysis (LDA) as a statistical tool. Thin ice areas with hT of 30 cm could be separated from thicker ice fields with approximately 20% error level. In our large data set, the estimation of thin ice thickness was not possible with reasonable accuracy due to the large scatter between ice thickness and the PR and GR signatures. This is likely due to a large data set, besides thin ice in polynyas also thin ice in the marginal ice zone and thin ice from freeze-up period. The optimal LDA parameters in the classifier and hT depended on the daily mean air temperature ((Tam)). We could not yet parameterize the classifier optimally according to (Tam), but the constructed classifier worked rather robustly as indicated by the relative small error rate variation between the three analyzed winters.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2416393","Sea ice and snow products for the Barents; Pechora and Kara Seas using multisensor satellite data (KaraX); Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation TEKES; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088607","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice;Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Ice thickness;Microwave radiometry;MODIS;Silicon carbide;Sea ice;Estimation","microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;statistical analysis","thin ice detection;Barents Sea;Kara Sea;SSMIS radiometer data;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System;Special Sensor Microwave Imager-Sounder radiometer data;AD 2008 to 2011;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;ice thickness chart;polarization-spectral gradient ratio;AMSR-E PR36;H-polarized GR8936;2D classification;linear discrimination analysis;LDA;statistical tool;ice thickness estimation;polynyas;marginal ice zone;freeze-up period;daily mean air temperature;frequency 36 GHz;frequency 37 GHz;frequency 89 GHz;frequency 91 GHz","","18","","43","EU","17 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the laser scanning technique is inherently limited, principally by the following: 1) the high inclination scanning angle of the sensor with respect to nadir; 2) the precision of the laser ranging estimate; and 3) the beam divergence of the laser. In this paper, we introduce a numerical model that has been designed to simulate the acquisition of LiDAR data over a regular rough surface. Results from the model compare well (r2 = 0.97) with LiDAR observations collected over two experimental surfaces of known roughness that were constructed from medium-density fibreboard using a computer numerical control three-axis router. The model demonstrates that surface roughness parameters are not sensitive to minor variations in the LiDAR sensor's range and laser beam divergence, but are slightly sensitive to the precision of the ranging estimate. The model also demonstrates that surface roughness parameters are particularly sensitive to the inclination angle of the LiDAR sensor. The surface RMS height is underestimated, and the correlation length is overestimated as either the inclination angle of the sensor or the true roughness of the surface increases. An isotropic surface is also increasingly observed as an anisotropic surface as either the inclination angle or the true surface roughness increases. Based on the model results, we propose a set of calibration functions that can be used to correct in situ LiDAR measurements of surface roughness.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2412034","Canada Excellence Research Chair and Canada Research Chair Programs; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canada Foundation for Innovation; University of Manitoba; Canada Graduate Scholarship (CGS-D3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069263","Geophysical measurements;laser applications;laser measurementapplications;modeling;numerical analysis;radar scattering;sea ice;rough surfaces;surfaces;Geophysical measurements;laser applications;laser measurement applications;modeling;numerical analysis;radar scattering;sea ice;rough surfaces;surfaces","Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Sea surface;Laser radar;Surface emitting lasers;Measurement by laser beam;Laser beams","oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;sea ice","terrestrial LiDAR;centimeter-scale sea ice surface roughness;natural surfaces;sea ice;LiDAR data acquisition;medium-density fibreboard;three-axis router;LiDAR sensor;isotropic surface;calibration functions","","16","","29","IEEE","26 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The antenna setup, mounted 25.0 m above the waterline, serves to acquire sea surface reflections at grazing angles below 30°. Within a 5-min coherent integration period, direct and reflected signal contributions can be separated. Except for the highest sea states, with roll angle changes of 20° peak to peak, the separation allows to retrieve the reflection power and quantifies it in cross-, co-, and cross-to-co-polar ratios. The sea-ice concentration is inverted from power ratios using a non-linear least-squares algorithm. Additional data on sea-ice concentration gathered by a watchman on the ship are used for validation. The inversion results have a 20% resolution in concentration and 3-h resolution in time. The validation shows that the cross- and cross-to-co-polar data are sensitive to the sea-ice concentration.

For the SAR layers, a novel approach to their use in ice detection was developed using the coefficient of variation (COV), defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of the normalized radar cross section, σ0, to the mean σ0. The COV reduced the complicated signatures of breaking waves and thin ice to bright ice pixels on a dark water background.

The model, SICNet, adopts an encoder–decoder framework with fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and can predict the SIC (covering  $320\times224$  grids, each with a resolution of 25 km) one-week lead with high accuracy. We design a temporal–spatial attention module (TSAM) to help SICNet capture spatiotemporal dependencies from SIC sequences. The satellite-derived SIC data of 33 years (1988–2020) from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) are employed to train and test the model, 1988–2015 for training, and 2016–2020 for testing. SICNet achieves the mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.67%, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.67%, and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.9784 in weekly predicting of SIC during the melting season. SICNet achieves better performance than existing deep-learning-based models. The TSAM reduced the MAE from 2.73% to 2.67%. We evaluate the model’s performance by recursively predicting, from seven- to 28-day leads. We employ the binary accuracy (BACC) metric to measure the accuracy of the predicted sea ice extent (SIE) and compare SICNet with the anomaly persistence (Persist). SICNet shows better performance than Persist with an average BACC on the 28th day of 2016–2019 over 90% (90.17%). For the 28-day lead predictions of three extreme minimum SIE in September 2007, 2012, and 2020, SICNet outperforms Persist with an average improvement of 1.84% in BACC and  $0.16 milkm^{2}$  in the SIE error.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3177600","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)(grant numbers:XDA19060101,XDB42040401); Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY010102); Key Deployment Project of Centre for Ocean Mega-Science through the CAS Programs(grant numbers:COMS2019R02Y9KY04101L); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M662452); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2006211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780401","Deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs);recursively predicting;satellite-derived sea ice concentration (SIC);SIC prediction;temporal–spatial attention","Predictive models;Numerical models;Sea ice;Arctic;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Atmospheric modeling;Oceans","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;snow","pan-Arctic;melting season;purely data-driven model;daily sea ice concentration;SICNet;fully convolutional networks;temporal-spatial attention module;satellite-derived SIC data;National Snow and Ice Data Center;mean absolute error;mean absolute percentage error;deep-learning-based models;predicted sea ice extent;encoder-decoder framework;weekly sea ice concentration prediction","","3","","46","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The brine content in snow pack was low in all three case studies, which is typical for cold winter conditions. We used the first-order approximation of the small perturbation theory accounting for surface scattering from the air-snow and snow-ice rough interfaces and continuously layered snow and sea ice. The experimental data were collected during the Circumpolar Flaw Lead system study in the winter of 2008 in the southern Beaufort Sea from the research icebreaker Amundsen. Good agreement between the model and experimental data were observed for all three case studies. The model results revealed that the scattering at the snow-ice rough interface is usually stronger than that at the air-snow interface. Furthermore, both model and experimental NRCS values (at VV and HH polarizations) were considerably higher for thin-snow cover compared with the thick-snow-cover case. We associate this effect with the lower attenuation of the propagated wave within the thin-snow pack in comparison to the thick-snow pack. We also demonstrated that different brine volume contents in snow with close thicknesses of 4 and 3 cm did not affect the backscattering coefficients at certain incidence angles and polarization. Our findings provide the physical basis for winter snow thickness retrieval and suggest that such retrievals may be possible from radar observations under particular scattering conditions.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2390192","Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(grant numbers:0091/R/TOO/2010/12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047848","Electromagnetic wave scattering;layered media;rough interfaces;small perturbation theory;snow-covered sea ice;Electromagnetic wave scattering;layered media;rough interfaces;small perturbation theory;snow-covered sea ice","Snow;Sea ice;Scattering;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Atmospheric modeling","approximation theory;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;perturbation theory;radar polarimetry;sea ice;snow","C-band radar backscatter;snow-covered first-year sea ice;C-band HH normalized radar cross-sections;C-band VV normalized radar cross-sections;cold winter conditions;first-order approximation;perturbation theory;snow-ice rough interfaces;air-snow rough interfaces;continuously layered snow;circumpolar flaw lead system;icebreaker;Amundsen;NRCS values;thick-snow-cover case;thin-snow pack;thick-snow pack;wave propagation;winter snow thickness retrieval;incidence angles;polarization;backscattering coefficients;radar observations;brine volume contents;AD 2008","","18","","44","IEEE","24 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For analysis, polarimetry parameters, such as co-(HH) and cross-(HV) polarization and several popular decomposition techniques, specifically Pauli, Freeman–Durden, Yamaguchi, Cloud–Pottier, and van Zyl, have been used to determine the polarimetric signatures of icebergs and sea ice. The statistical hypothesis T-test has been applied to achieve a precise comparison among backscatters from different icebergs groups. Statistical results tend to show a dominant surface scattering mechanism for icebergs in all types of clutter conditions. Moreover, icebergs in open water produce larger volume scatter than icebergs in sea ice, whereas icebergs in sea ice produce larger surface scatter than icebergs in open water.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3104626","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:452567-13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528916","Backscatter;hypothesis test;icebergs;polarimetric decomposition;sea ice","Sea ice;Backscatter;Scattering;Clutter;Synthetic aperture radar;Radar polarimetry;Sea surface","backscatter;geophysical image processing;polarimetry;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice;open water;iceberg backscatter;RADARSAT-2 images;newfoundland sea;polarimetric signatures;iceberg detection;different icebergs groups;size 3.0 km to 35.0 km","","1","","36","IEEE","3 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The solutions are crucial to microwave remote sensing that requires the preservation of coherent phase information. The heterogeneous snowpack is represented as a bicontinuous medium. Effects of the underlying half-space are included through a halfspace Green's function in a volume integral equation formulation. The volume integral equation is then solved using the discrete dipole approximation. The fast Fourier transform is effectuated for all three dimensions with half-space Green's function rather than the conventional free space Green's function. To overcome the snow volume truncation in the finite numerical calculations, periodic boundary conditions are applied in the lateral extent. Thus, in NMM3D, the physical microwave scattering and emission problem is solved without using any radiative transfer equations. In this formulation, the scattering matrix of the snowpack accounts for both the magnitude and phase. The NMM3D simulations are demonstrated at Ku-band frequency for a snow cover up to 25-cm thick. The results are applicable to remote sensing of snow over sea ice, and thin layers of terrestrial snow. Quantitative values of backscattering and bistatic scattering coefficients are derived for active microwave remote sensing, and brightness temperatures for passive microwave remote sensing. The full wave simulation results are compared with those of the partially coherent approach of the dense media radiative transfer (DMRT). The NMM3D results capture effects of backscattering enhancement and coherent layering that are missed in DMRT. The full wave solution to Maxwell equations is important to advance radar polarimetry, interferometry, and tomography that require the preservation of the full phase information and all interface interactions for applications to radar remote sensing of snow cover on land and on sea ice.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2703602","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terrestrial Hydrology Program(grant numbers:NNX15AU15G); NASA Instrument Incubator Program “Enhancement, Demonstration, and Validation of the Wideband Instrument for Snow Measurements (WISM),”; NASA Remote Sensing Theory Program(grant numbers:NNX15AI13G); NASA Terrestrial Hydrology Program; National Science Foundation (NSF) Polar Science Division(grant numbers:1503917); NSF XSEDE(grant numbers:TG-EAR100002); NASA Cryospheric Sciences Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7938336","Active and passive microwave;backscattering enhancement;coherent layer effects;dense media radiative transfer (DMRT);dense media scattering;discrete dipole approximation (DDA);full wave simulation;half-space Green's function;snow remote sensing;volume integral equation (VIE)","Snow;Mathematical model;Scattering;Green's function methods;Sea ice;Numerical models;Remote sensing","electromagnetic wave scattering;fast Fourier transforms;Green's function methods;hydrological techniques;integral equations;radar polarimetry;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;snow","active microwave remote sensing;passive microwave remote sensing;wave simulation results;partially coherent approach;dense media radiative transfer;coherent layering;wave solution;radar remote sensing;microwave signatures;numerical Maxwell equations;bicontinuous media;half-space dyadic Green's function;three-dimensional snowpack scattering;emission model;Maxwell's equations;entire snowpack;bistatic scattering coefficients;terrestrial snow;sea ice;snow cover;NMM3D simulations;snowpack accounts;scattering matrix;radiative transfer equations;emission problem;physical microwave scattering;periodic boundary conditions;finite numerical calculations;snow volume truncation;conventional free space Green's function;half-space Green's function;fast Fourier transform;discrete dipole approximation;volume integral equation formulation;halfspace Green's function;underlying half-space;bicontinuous medium;heterogeneous snowpack;coherent phase information;underlying halfspace","","16","","34","IEEE","2 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We compare the Doppler-derived ice velocities with global positioning system tracks from a drifting ice station as well as vector fields derived using traditional cross correlation between a pair of S1A and Radarsat-2 images with a time lag of only 25 min. A strategy is provided for precise calibration of the Doppler values in the context of the S1A level-2 ocean RVL product. When comparing the two methods, root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 7 cm/s were found for the extra wide (EW4) and EW5 swaths, while the highest RMSE of 32 cm/s was obtained for the EW1 swath. Though the agreement is not perfect, our experiment demonstrates that the Doppler technique is capable of measuring a signal from the ice if the ice is fast moving.

Here, the net gradient difference algorithm developed by Mahoney [1] has been extended to include the medium edge detection method to automatically delineate the SLIE using the sequential SAR data. The underlying method is to use a spatial gradient operation to identify potential edge pixels, before applying the noise removal using a baseline (2000-2008) SLIE, and a pixel connection technique to generate a contiguous edge. We show that in 2016, the SLIE extended 20 km (25%) further equatorward than in 2008. Good agreement has been achieved between the SLIE derived from our automated method and the manual SLIE extraction using the original SAR as well as a near-coincident Landsat-8 OLI image. The error in the automated approach is minimized when using three to four calibrated SAR images, all with the same incident angle and the maximum separation between them is less than 20 days.

The resultant large amount of brine rejection leads to the formation of dense water. The dense water forms Antarctic bottom water, which is the densest water in the global overturning circulation and a key player in climate change as a significant sink for heat and carbon dioxide. In this study, an algorithm was developed that uses Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data (2012–present) to detect polynya area and estimates thin ice thickness by a method similar to that used to develop the algorithm for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) data. Landfast sea-ice areas were also detected using AMSR2 data. Ice production in the polynyas was estimated by a heat flux calculation using AMSR2 sea-ice data. In four major polynyas, AMSR2 ice production was compared with AMSR-E (2003–2011) ice production through comparison of them with Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) ice production. The comparison confirmed that the ice production from AMSR-E/2 data, which have higher spatial resolution than SSM/I-SSMIS data, can be used to analyze time series covering more than 10 years. For example, maps of annual ice production based on AMSR-E/2 data revealed detailed changes of the Mertz Polynya, where the ice production decreased significantly after the Mertz Glacier Tongue calving in 2010. Continuous monitoring of the coastal polynyas by the AMSR series sensors is essential for climate-change-related analyses in the Antarctic Ocean.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2731995","Global Change Observation Mission-Water 1 (GCOM-W1); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013649","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2);Antarctic coastal polynyas;sea-ice production","Sea measurements;Production;Antarctica;Ice thickness;Sea ice;Microwave radiometry;Climate change","climatology;environmental monitoring (geophysics);remote sensing;sea ice;time series","Antarctic coastal polynyas;AMSR-E data;SSM-I-SSMIS data;sea ice production areas;brine rejection;Antarctic bottom water;global overturning circulation;climate change;carbon dioxide;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2;AD 2012;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS;heat flux calculation;AMSR2 sea ice data;AMSR2 ice production;AD 2003 to 2011;Special Sensor Microwave Imager-Sounder;SSMIS ice production;time series;Mertz Polynya;Mertz Glacier Tongue;coastal polynyas monitoring;AMSR series sensors;Antarctic Ocean","","20","","59","IEEE","21 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the size of the glistening zone, the transition from open seas to sea ice in the specular zone can take up to 10 s for satellite platforms and no methods exist that can process this. In this article, using DDMs collected by TechDemoSat-1, we demonstrate that this transition is comprised of a response that is fixed in the spatial domain, at the ice edge, and moving in the delay-Doppler domain. This is the first observation of persistent nonspecular coherent reflections from sea ice. The delay-Doppler trajectory of the ice response is shown to correspond with a point that is located on the ambiguity free line. Furthermore, the response is point-like as it suffers from delay and Doppler walk suggesting that it originates from a small spatial footprint, i.e., the first (few) Fresnel zone(s). Exploiting these facts, we then propose a technique that integrates the ice response in the spatial domain after preprocessing. This results in the edges of the ice sheet being emphasized as all of the power received during the transition phase maps to the edge of the sheet. We also propose to compensate for the delay-Doppler walk during preprocessing by modifying Woodward's ambiguity function when deconvolution is performed.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2943510","Australian Government through the Research Training Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8865623","GNSS-R;reflectometry;sea ice;transition;ice detection","Sea ice;Doppler effect;Delays;Receivers;Color;Sea surface","Doppler radar;ice;oceanographic techniques;radar detection;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice","delay-Doppler maps;specular zone;glistening zone;open seas;spatial domain;ice edge;delay-Doppler domain;persistent nonspecular coherent reflections;delay-Doppler trajectory;ice response;Fresnel zone;ice sheet;transition phase maps;delay-Doppler walk;deconvolution;sea ice transition detection;incoherent integration;reflectometry-based sea ice detection methods","","5","","23","CCBY","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although noise vectors in both the azimuth and range directions are provided in the standard S1 EW data for subtraction, the residual thermal noise still significantly affects sea ice detection by the EW data. In this article, we improve the denoising method developed in previous studies to remove the additive noise for the S1 EW data in cross-polarization. Furthermore, we propose a new method for eliminating the residual noise (i.e., multiplicative noise) at the subswath boundaries of the EW data, which cannot be well processed by simply subtracting the reconstructed 2-D noise field. The proposed method of removing both the additive and multiplicative noise was applied to EW HV-polarized images processed using different Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) versions. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of EW HV-polarized images under various sea ice conditions and sea states in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic.

Here, Γ is formulated as the product of the propagation loss due to SIT and the reflection coefficient of underlying seawater. The effect of surface roughness on Γ is neglected when only considering signals of coherent reflection. In practice, Γ at the specular point is first generated using TDS-1 data. Afterwards, SIT is calculated from TDS-1 Γ based on the proposed reflectivity model, and verified with two sets of reference SIT data; one is obtained by the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, and the other is the combined SMOS/Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) measurements. This analysis is performed on the data with SIT less than 1m. Through comparison, good consistency between the derived TDS-1 SIT and the reference SIT is obtained, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.84 and a root-mean-square difference (RMSD) of 9.39 cm with SMOS, and an r of 0.67 and an RMSD of 9.49 cm with SMOS/SMAP, which demonstrates the applicability of the developed model and the utility of TDS-1 data for SIT estimation.

The space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer from Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. is China’s first commercial GNSS-R instrument. On July 3, 2021, this payload was equipped on the Jilin-1 wide-range 01B satellite (J1-01B) developed by Changguang Satellite Technology Co., Ltd. and entered the polar orbit with the height about 500km from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center.The attitude of J1-01B is stable to the ground within 0.1 degrees, which can guarantee the high accuracy of GNSS-R antenna gain model on the detection of sea surface wind speed and direction, soil moisture and etc. Meanwhile, its orbital characteristics ensure that its trajectory can cover the north and south poles of the earth, providing opportunities for researches on sea-ice detection and sea-ice thickness retrieval. The payload supports the mutual switching between dual system (GPS L1 or BDS B1) signal mode and dual working mode (generate the doppler delay maps (DDM) in manual-adjustable resolution on the satellite, or collect intermediate frequency (IF) data with 58Mb/s rate), which guarantees the verification and continuous development of multi-system compatibility, data quality analysis and application scenario expansion.After two weeks of satellite’s launch, the satellite has entered normal working mode. In two periods from 6:0 to 6:15 and from 7:32 to 7:42 on July 16, 2021, GNSS-R data were collected in DDMs as well as IFs formats, when J1-01B was over the Pacific Ocean. And L1a DDMs with the horseshoe shape were generated with correction from raw DDMs, as well as from IFs.The GNSS-R instrument on the Jilin-1 wide 01B satellite is an important component of the Yunyao constellation plan, which would provide rich and stable data, and be an important role in global and regional exploration in aerospace, meteorology, ocean, earthquake and other fields.","","978-1-6654-1782-2","10.1109/GNSSR53802.2021.9617716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617716","Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS);GNSS Reflectometry;Hydrology;Remote Sensing","Global navigation satellite system;Sea surface;Satellites;Wind speed;Instruments;Reflectometry;Delays","aerospace instrumentation;atmospheric techniques;Global Positioning System;oceanographic techniques;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;wind","GNSS Reflectometer remote sensing mission;Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry;GNSS signals;sea level;ice density;space-borne GNSS-Reflectometer;Tianjin Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co;China's first commercial GNSS-R instrument;Jilin-1 wide-range 01B;Changguang Satellite Technology Co;polar orbit;GNSS-R antenna gain model;orbital characteristics;sea-ice detection;sea-ice thickness retrieval;dual system;GPS L1;BDS B1;dual working mode;Doppler delay maps;multisystem compatibility;data quality analysis;application scenario expansion;normal working mode;Jilin-1 wide 01B;Yunyao constellation plan;earthquake;Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center","","","","16","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the incidence angle dependence of C- and L-band HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient over Arctic first-year sea ice (FYI) and multiyear sea ice (MYI) in winter. Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band SAR (L-band) and RADARSAT-2 (C-band) images are used to derive ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies calculated using linear regression models. For L-band, mean ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies for FYI and MYI are -0.21 and -0.30 dB/1°, respectively; and for C-band, they are -0.22 and -0.16 dB/1°, respectively. To validate our results, we calculated root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) by comparing the ice type-specific dependence from 2010 with individual dependencies from 2009 based on ice types and frequencies. The RMSD is found to be smaller than the standard deviation of ice type-specific dependencies for both frequencies. The RMSD values for the L-band incidence angle dependencies are 0.03 and 0.04 dB/1° for FYI and MYI, respectively. For C-band, the RMSD values for the FYI and MYI dependencies are 0.03 and 0.01 dB/1°, respectively. Subsequently, we demonstrate that after applying incidence angle normalization, the variability of C- and L-band SAR backscatter reduces and separability of ice types increase substantially.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2841343","Izaak Killam Doctoral Scholarship; Alberta Innovates; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8393469","Arctic sea ice;C-band;incidence angle;L-band;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;L-band;Synthetic aperture radar;Backscatter;Arctic;Microwave FET integrated circuits","oceanographic regions;radar imaging;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","L-band wintertime backscatter;Arctic sea ice;synthetic aperture radar incidence angle;L-band HH-polarized microwave backscatter coefficient;Arctic first-year sea ice;MYI;C-band;mean ice type-specific incidence angle dependencies;FYI;ice type-specific dependence;individual dependencies;ice type-specific dependencies;RMSD values;L-band incidence angle dependencies;incidence angle normalization;L-band SAR;ice types increase;Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array;RADARSAT-2 images;linear regression models;AD 2010;AD 2009;noise figure -0.21 dB;noise figure -0.3 dB;noise figure -0.22 dB;noise figure -0.16 dB;noise figure 0.03 dB;noise figure 0.04 dB;noise figure 0.01 dB","","35","","60","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mean monthly area flux exhibits a prominent cycle with the peak in March $\rm{(78 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}\text{/month)}$  and the trough in August $\rm{(5 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}/\text{month)}$. Mean net annual ice area flux  $\rm{(644.1 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}\,\text{km}^{2}\rm{)}$ is primarily/slightly attributable to winter (October–May)/summer (June–September) outflow of $\rm{598.7\times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2}$ $\rm{(or\; 93.0\%)/ 45.4 \times 10}^{3}\,\text{km}^{2} (\rm{or} 7\%)$ . However, these quantities need to be considered with great prudence since comparisons with preceding studies indicate distinct difference may exist between calculated Fram Strait sea ice outflow based on varied ice motion datasets. In particular, major bias emerged during winter rather than summer. Trends are also affected due to this bias. Despite the clear disparity in magnitude, we found a good agreement with preceding estimates in terms of temporal variability. The linkage between ice area flux via the Fram Strait and various atmospheric circulation indices, such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a west-east dipole anomaly pattern (DA), as well as a seesaw structure between Beaufort and Barents Sea (BBO), was examined. Results show that atmospheric circulation patterns linked to the DA and BBO possess a relatively stronger influence on Fram Strait ice export over the 25-year period. By contrast, the AO- and NAO-related atmospheric circulation pattern exhibit weaker connections with ice outflow through the strait. In addition, correlation analysis further justify the robust connection with a cross-strait surface level pressure gradient index. Depending on months, it is suggested that a manifold of aforementioned atmospheric indices may jointly or alone impose a significant influence on sea ice export through the Fram Strait.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2584539","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41406215); Laboratory for Marine Geology; Qingdao National Laboratory; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2014M561971); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:MGE2013KG07); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514221","Fram Strait;remote sensing;sea ice area flux","Random access memory;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;Sea ice;Indexes;Arctic","atmospheric movements;atmospheric pressure;oceanographic regions;sea ice","concentration fields;AD 1988 to 2012;mean monthly area flux;mean net annual ice area flux;Fram Strait sea ice outflow;ice motion datasets;temporal variability;atmospheric circulation indices;Arctic Oscillation-related atmospheric circulation;west-east dipole anomaly pattern;seesaw structure;Beaufort Sea;Barents Sea;atmospheric circulation patterns;Fram Strait ice export;North Atlantic Oscillation-related atmospheric circulation;Arctic Sea ice area export;cross-strait surface level pressure gradient index","","16","","26","IEEE","15 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The primary objective of the mission is to quantify at high spatio-temporal resolution crucial characteristics, processes and interactions between sea ice, and other Earth system components in order to advance the understanding and prediction of climate change and its impacts on the environment and society. The objective is articulated through three key questions. 1) In a rapidly changing Arctic regime and under the resilient Antarctic sea ice trend, how will highly dynamic forcings and couplings between the various components of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere modify or influence the processes governing the characteristics of the sea ice cover (ice production, growth, deformation, and melt)? 2) What are the impacts of extreme events and feedback mechanisms on sea ice evolution? 3) What are the effects of the cryosphere behaviors, either rapidly changing or resiliently stable, on the global oceanic and atmospheric circulation and mid-latitude extreme events? To contribute answering these questions, G-TERN will measure key parameters of the sea ice, the oceans, and the atmosphere with frequent and dense coverage over polar areas, becoming a “dynamic mapper” of the ice conditions, the ice production, and the loss in multiple time and space scales, and surrounding environment. Over polar areas, the G-TERN will measure sea ice surface elevation (<10 cm precision), roughness, and polarimetry aspects at 30-km resolution and 3-days full coverage. G-TERN will implement the interferometric GNSS reflectometry concept, from a single satellite in near-polar orbit with capability for 12 simultaneous observations.

The polarimetric characteristics of sea ice for the simulated CP mode are compared with the classic polarimetric parameters, specifically the polarimetric entropy (H) and polarimetric scattering angle (α), for quad-polarized SAR systems. The physically based m-χ decomposition, obtained from the Stokes parameters of hybrid polarimetry mode CP SAR, is applied to sea ice classification, because the colorcoded images of the m-χ decomposition can be related to the basic scattering processes directly. Therefore, this methodology is able to provide more details in terms of sea ice classification than is possible with single polarimetic parameters. The classification results with the m-χ decomposition from CP SAR are shown to be comparable to those resulting from the Pauli RGB decomposition from quadpol SAR systems. Therefore, due to the planned wide swath widths for future CP SAR missions, such as the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission, we suggest that hybrid polarimetry is an attractive mode for future CP SAR-based sea ice monitoring.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2584542","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41306189); Chinese Academy of Sciences; Canada's World Class Tanker Safety Service; Panel on Energy Research and Development (PERD); U.S. Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-15-1-2611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517368","Compact polarization (CP);poincaré ellipticity parameter χ;polarmetric degree m;sea ice classification;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice;Scattering;Polarimetry;Monitoring;Entropy","radar polarimetry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea ice characterization;sea ice classification;hybrid polarimetry SAR;hybrid polarimetry synthetic aperture radar;classic Poincare ellipticity parameter;Stokes parameters;polarimetric characteristics;classic polarimetric parameters;polarimetric entropy;polarimetric scattering angle;quad-polarized SAR systems;physically based decomposition;hybrid polarimetry mode;color-coded images;Pauli RGB decomposition;Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission;compact polarized SAR-based sea ice monitoring","","21","","34","IEEE","20 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose an aleatoric uncertainty embedded sea-ice classification method together with transfer learning of two different pre-training strategies. Instead of representing the transferred feature as a deterministic embedding, the proposed method concerns the feature uncertainty and models the embedding as a Gaussian distribution with variance. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed aleatoric uncertainty estimation is beneficial to improving the classification result of transfer learning.

Due to the longer revisit time of homologous spaceborne satellites, only an average velocity can be determined. For longer time intervals, velocities due to short-duration events such as storms are lost. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from different sources make it easy to construct image sequences with short time intervals. However, the resolution and noise level between non-homologous SAR image pairs often differ greatly. When there is a relatively large resolution difference between image pairs, the areal features between image pairs are very different, which increases the difficulty of feature registration. In this paper, a super-resolution reconstruction method is proposed to solve the problem of resolution difference between image pairs for sea ice drift. This method can significantly improve the quality of feature registration of image pairs from different SAR sensors. We demonstrate through several examples the effectiveness of the method in feature matching of large resolution difference images from different SAR sensors.","","978-1-6654-0413-6","10.1109/ICSP51882.2021.9408919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408919","Feature matching;Image registration;Sea ice drift tracking;Super-resolution reconstruction;Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)","Image sensors;Storms;Spaceborne radar;Superresolution;Radar tracking;Radar polarimetry;Synthetic aperture radar","image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;image sequences;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","resolution difference images;different SAR sensors;feature registration;resolution difference nonhomologous SAR image pairs;sea ice drift tracking;SAR images;longer revisit time;homologous spaceborne satellites;longer time intervals;Synthetic Aperture Radar images;image sequences;short time intervals;noise level;super-resolution reconstruction method","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, different methods have been developed to study oceans using various RS systems. This urges the necessity of having review studies that comprehensively discuss various RS systems, including passive and active sensors, and their advantages and limitations for ocean applications. In this article, the goal is to review most RS systems and approaches that have been worked on marine applications. This review paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to the passive RS systems for ocean studies. As such, four primary passive systems, including optical, thermal infrared radiometers, microwave radiometers, and Global Navigation Satellite Systems, are comprehensively discussed. Additionally, this article summarizes the main passive RS sensors and satellites, which have been utilized for different oceanographic applications.

This paper describes a three-component scattering model to decompose polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) data of sea ice. The total backscatter is modeled as the incoherent summation of surface, double-bounce, volume, and residual components. The proposed model extends the volume scattering contribution of sea ice by considering transmission, extinction, and refraction effects. The model is validated using C-band Radarsat-2 quad-polarization data acquired over sea ice in the Bohai Sea.

In the Arctic seas, one of the major challenges of SSS remote sensing is the presence of sea ice. This paper proposes a data-driven ice correction (IC) algorithm which extracts emission from the water portion of measured brightness temperature (TB) in scenes mixed with water and ice. Emission of the ice portion was removed based on estimation according to the ice fraction (fice) in the satellite footprint and ice signature derived from surrounding pixels. The IC algorithm is applied to SMAP TB data to obtain TB with IC (TBIC), which are used for SSS retrieval using the standard JPL SMAP CAP processing system. We show that the algorithm is most effective near the ice edge, thereby increasing the fice threshold for possible SSS retrieval to 15% from the current 3% without IC. SMAP SSS are validated using in situ salinity collected during NASA's Ocean Melting Greenland (OMG) mission from 2016 to 2020 along the Greenland coast. The number of collocations between OMG and SMAP daily gridded salinity increased by more than 30% with IC. The statistical analysis shows a similar retrieval accuracy with or without IC, with the standard deviation of the difference between OMG and SMAP of 1.41 psu (with IC) and 1.42 psu (without IC).

This processing extends the area over which a precise sea level can be computed. In the frame of the European Space Agency Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (http://cci.esa.int), we have first developed a new surface identification method combining two complementary solutions, one using a multiple-criteria approach (in particular the backscattering coefficient and the peakiness coefficient of the waveforms) and one based on a supervised neural network approach. Then, a new physical model has been developed (modified from the Brown model to include anisotropy in the scattering from calm protected water surfaces) and has been implemented in a maximum likelihood estimation retracker. This allows us to process both sea-ice lead waveforms (characterized by their peaky shapes) and ocean waveforms (more diffuse returns), guaranteeing, by construction, continuity between open ocean and ice-covered regions.

It is based on measuring the similarity of the received GNSS reflected waveform or delay Doppler map (DDM) to the coherent reflection model waveform. Over the open ocean, the scattered signal has a diffusive, incoherent nature; it is described by the rough surface scattering model based on the geometric optics and the Gaussian statistics for the ocean surface slopes. Over sea ice and, in particular, newly formed sea ice, the scattered signal acquires a coherence, which is characteristic for a surface with large flat areas. In order to measure the similarity of the received waveform or DDM, to the coherent reflection model, three different estimators are presented: the normalized DDM average, the trailing edge slope (TES), and the matched filter approach. Here, a probabilistic study is presented based on a Bayesian approach using two different and independent ground-truth data sets. This approach allows one to thoroughly assess the performance of the estimators. The best results are achieved for both the TES and the matched filter approach with a probability of detection of 98.5%, a probability of false alarm of ~ 3.6%, and a probability of error of 2.5%. However, the matched filter approach is preferred due to its simplicity.

However, this method is not very well suited for dielectrics with losses several orders high and, therefore, cannot be considered as a general method of subsurface characterization. In this article, we introduce a new idea of near-field interferometry, which can be used to characterize higher loss dielectrics with dimensions very low compared with the wavelength. It is shown that, in low frequencies, there is a noticeable variation in the field components with different medium dielectric properties and thickness, and these changes can be detected externally from near-field measurements by varying receiver distance and the operating frequency. The proposed method is tested on a lossy sea ice model in the presence of a horizontal electric dipole, and the variation in field magnitudes is observed for thickness up to 5 m. Since practical sea ice bulks have thicknesses of a similar range, the near-field interferometry appears to be a promising approach to determine sea ice thickness from noninvasive measurements.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3040261","Office of Naval Research Global, London, U.K., as a part of the NICOP project “Non-Invasive Measurement of Sea Ice Thickness Using Low Frequency EM Waves”(grant numbers:N62909-19-1-2013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288919","Characterization;dipole radiation;interferometry;layered media;lossy dielectric;low-frequency;near field;Sommerfeld integral","Receivers;Dielectrics;Interferometry;Dielectric losses;Sea ice;Sea measurements;Frequency measurement","electric field measurement;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","lossy sea ice model;practical sea ice bulks;low-frequency near-field interferometry;far-field interferometry;subsurface characterization;dielectric properties;low-loss subsurface materials;operating wavelength;higher loss dielectrics;lossy dielectric characterization","","","","37","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Currently, those needs have been addressed with remote sensing satellites or in-situ instruments. However, in-situ instruments often sink or crash with ice blocks. Additionally, these instruments are isolated, making challenging its deployment and the data retrieval, using LEO satellite communications (e.g. Iridium, OrbComm). This also poses a problem in terms of modularity and flexibility, since sensors rely on proprietary communication systems. This work proposes a modular and cost-effective solution to this problem applying the paradigm of the Internet of Things to this context.

Classification of SAR sea ice imagery into ice and water is of particular relevance due to its relationship with ice concentration, a key variable in sea ice data assimilation systems. With increasing volumes of SAR data, automated methods to carry out these classifications are of particular importance. Although several automated approaches have been proposed, none look at the impact of including an estimate of uncertainty of the model parameters and input features on the classification output. This article uses an established database of SAR image features to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify pixel locations as either ice, water, or unknown. The classification accuracies are benchmarked using a recently developed logistic regression approach for the same database. The two methods are found to be comparable. The MLP approach is then enhanced to allow uncertainty to be estimated at each pixel location. Following methods proposed in the deep learning community, two kinds of uncertainty are considered. The first, epistemic uncertainty, is that due to uncertainty in the MLP weights. The second kind of uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, is that which cannot be explained by the model, and is therefore associated with the input data. It is found that including these uncertainties in the MLP models reduces their accuracies slightly, but also reduces misclassification rates. This is of particular importance for data assimilation applications, where misclassifications could severely degrade the analysis.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2992454","Grant and Contribution from Environment and Climate Change Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9112220","Classification;data assimilation;neural network;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);uncertainty","Uncertainty;Artificial neural networks;Radar polarimetry;Sea ice;Integrated circuits;Databases","data assimilation;geophysical image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;regression analysis;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","classification output;SAR image features;multilayer perceptron neural network;pixel location;classification accuracies;logistic regression approach;MLP approach;epistemic uncertainty;aleatoric uncertainty;including these uncertainties;MLP models;data assimilation applications;SAR imagery;synthetic aperture radar sea ice imagery;SAR sea ice imagery;particular relevance;ice concentration;sea ice data assimilation systems;automated methods","","10","","32","IEEE","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional method of sea ice classification involves single-scale classification, wherein the backscatter and gray-level co-occurrence matrix features in a specific resolution are used as classification bases. The classification is implemented only once. In this way, however, the scalloping and interscan banding (ISB) artifacts in some TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data affect the classification result. In this article, a two-scale method of sea ice classification is proposed. The two-scale process includes both the coarse- and fine-resolution classifications. First, the coarse-resolution classification utilizes downscale images to generate the ice zone. Subsequently, the fine-scale classification utilizes the full-resolution SAR image and the ice zone to generate the final classification result. The support vector machine is used as the classifier. This two-scale method provides a better classification result compared to the single-scale method in two aspects. First, it effectively avoids the appearance of scalloping and ISB artifacts in the results. Second, it is less time-consuming and provides satisfactory results for discriminating multiyear ice, first-year ice, and water. The validation is accomplished using independent images, with an overall average accuracy of 86.38%. This article shows that this method may provide an alternative for sea ice classification using TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3122546","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41806226); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9585380","Classification;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Training;Backscatter;Radar polarimetry;Feature extraction;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing","geophysical image processing;image classification;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","two-scale method;sea ice classification;TerraSAR-X ScanSAR data;single-scale classification;classification bases;coarse- resolution classifications;fine-resolution classifications;coarse-resolution classification;ice zone;fine-scale classification;final classification result;single-scale method","","","","18","CCBY","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, the development of immerging Earth-Observation micro/nano satellite technology provides new data source for polar region observations. The STU-2A is a newly-developed nano satellite specializing in polar region observation activities. It is a 3U CubeSat of 2.9kg with a size of 30×10×10 cm and carrying an earth observation camera, and was launched on Sept. 25th, 2015 and be deployed in a 470 × 485km, 97.3-degree inclination Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO). During the Antarctic summer of 2015/16, it has obtained images covering different ocean and coastal regions including Amundsen Sea, Ross Sea and Vincennes Bay. These images were used to analyze the change of ice sheet and sea ice and have played a role in the navigation task of the Xuelong vessel, a Chinese polar research ship. This satellite provides 100m resolution visible-light true color images, better than the MODIS data, which can only reach a maximum resolution of 250m. As the camera was specially designed for the polar region which has an environment of low solar elevation and high surface reflectance, it eliminates the oversaturation problem of the MODIS sensors and can provide high quality images. Based on data analysis and assessment, it is confirmed that this satellite data can meet the demand of glacier and sea ice observation. This paper will discuss the Cubesat design configuration, the payload camera design, and present its application in Antarctic glacier and sea ice observation.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127763","Nano Satellite;CubeSat;Antarctic Observation;Glacier Observation","Satellites;Antarctica;Cameras;Image resolution;Earth;Sea ice;Climate change","artificial satellites;cameras;climatology;data analysis;geophysical equipment;geophysical image processing;glaciology;oceanographic regions;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","Chinese cube satellite;polar observations;global climate changes;high quality satellite data;Polar Regions;Earth-Observation micro/nanosatellite technology;polar region observations;STU-2A;polar region observation activities;3U CubeSat;earth observation camera;coastal regions;Amundsen Sea;Ross Sea;ice sheet;Chinese polar research ship;MODIS data;high surface reflectance;high quality images;data analysis;sea ice observation;payload camera design;Sun Synchronous Orbit;Antarctic glacier;visible-light true color images;mass 2.9 kg;size 10.0 cm;size 485.0 km;size 100.0 m;size 250.0 m;U","","2","","7","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Numerical prediction models used for sea ice motion prediction often require a large number of data from diverse sources with varying uncertainties. In this paper, a deep learning approach is proposed to predict sea ice motion for several days in the future, given only a series of past motion observations. The proposed approach consists of an encoder-decoder network with convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) units. Optical flow is calculated from satellite passive microwave and scatterometer daily images covering the entire Arctic and used in the network. The network proves able to learn long-time dependencies within the motion time series, whereas its convolutional structure effectively captures spatial correlations among neighboring motion vectors. The approach is unsupervised and end-to-end trainable, requiring no manual annotation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in predicting sea ice motion of up to 10 days in the future, outperforming previous deep learning networks and being a promising alternative or complementary approach to resource-demanding numerical prediction methods.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2909057","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141310450); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1400802); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8701505","Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observing System (AMSR-E);Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT);AMSR2;Arctic sea ice;convLSTM;deep neural networks;drift prediction;optical flow;recurrent neural networks (RNNs)","Sea ice;Predictive models;Arctic;Data models;Atmospheric modeling;Numerical models;Microwave radiometry","geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);oceanographic regions;recurrent neural nets;sea ice;time series;vectors","sea ice motion prediction;motion observations;motion time series;convolutional long short-term memory networks;human activities;deep learning approach;motion vectors","","19","","74","IEEE","29 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm is comprised of- a Bayes variational algorithm for bias correction, the principal components transformation of the bias-corrected radiometric brightness temperature, and finally, a Bayesian regulation backpropagation network to translate the principal components to TPW estimate in the geophysical space. The algorithm is applicable over ocean, and in clear and cloudy scenes. However, the rainy and sea ice scenes are excluded in the retrieval.

The coherency is characterized as a function of ocean surface conditions and reflected signal parameters based on Spire Global CubeSat data collected from January to April 2019. The data contain 50-Hz GPS L1 and L2 carrier phase estimations obtained by open-loop tracking. Indicators based on the circular statistics of the excess-phase noise are developed to identify coherent and semicoherent reflections. Based on these indicators, we found that ~1% and 44% of GPS reflections over the ocean and sea ice, respectively, have potential for precision altimetry. The coherent and semicoherent reflection rates reach 23% in areas less than 200 km from the coastline and under calm sea conditions. Over young sea ice over the Arctic, this rate can be as high as 70%. There is a strong relationship between coherency and signal strength, and the coherency occurrence rate improves as the grazing angle decreases. The quality of the L1 and L2 coherent reflections is similar over sea ice, while, for reflections over the ocean, L1 signals are predominantly noisier and less coherent than the L2 signals. Using a postprocessing filtering method, the semicoherent reflections can achieve a similar level of altimetry precision as that of the coherent ones, thereby increasing the along-track length of the retrieved altimetry profile.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3129999","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:80NSSC20K1082,80NSSC20K1738); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9625022","Carrier phase estimations;coherent reflections;GPS reflection;ocean surface;precision altimetry;sea ice;semicoherent reflections","Reflection;CubeSat;Altimetry;Sea surface;Global navigation satellite system;Sea ice;Global Positioning System","Global Positioning System;oceanographic techniques;sea ice","ocean surface conditions;signal parameters;Spire Global CubeSat data;GPS L1;L2 carrier phase estimations;semicoherent reflections;GPS reflections;coherent reflection rates;semicoherent reflection rates;calm sea conditions;young sea ice;signal strength;coherency occurrence rate;grazing angle decreases;L2 coherent reflections;altimetry precision;coherent GNSS-reflections characterization;Global Navigation Satellite System;grazing angle geometries;low Earth orbit CubeSats;precision altimetry applications;AD 2019 01 to 04;size 200.0 km","","5","","62","CCBY","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Comparison of data products from IceBridge and CryoSat-2 is complicated by the fact that they use different geophysical corrections: reference ellipsoid, geoid model, tide model, and atmospheric corrections to derive surface elevation and sea-ice freeboard. In this paper, we compare sea-ice surface elevation and freeboard using eight coincident CryoSat-2, Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), and Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) observations with direct IceBridge underflights of CryoSat-2 ground tracks. We apply identical geophysical corrections to CryoSat-2 and IceBridge data to eliminate elevation biases due to these differences and focus on differences due to retracker performance. The IceBridge ATM and LVIS elevation and freeboard and Snow Radar snow depth data sets are averaged to each CryoSat-2 footprint for comparison. With snow depth measurements, we are able to compare elevations and freeboards at the snow/ice interface for five different CryoSat-2 retrackers (ESA, GSFCv1, AWI, JPL, and GSFCv2) and IceBridge. The overall mean of freeboard differences between GSFCv2, ESA, AWI, JPL retrackers, and ATM are in agreement within 0.05 m. However, the five different CryoSat-2 retrackers show distinct differences in mean elevation over leads and over floes. This suggests that the physical interpretation of the different retrackers needs to be considered depending on usage, for example, elevations from CryoSat-2 retrackers need to be carefully calibrated before comparing with elevation from other satellites for long-term surface elevation trends.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2865257","NASA’s Operation IceBridge Project Office; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8475036","Algorithms;altimetry;remote sensing;sea ice","Sea ice;Sea surface;Snow;Atmospheric modeling;Radar tracking;Data models","calibration;sea ice;snow","Ice Sensor observations;CryoSat-2 ground tracks;IceBridge data;IceBridge ATM;Snow Radar snow depth data sets;CryoSat-2 footprint;GSFCv1;GSFCv2;freeboard differences;airborne Operation IceBridge;polar sea ice;sea-ice freeboard;sea-ice surface elevation;coincident CryoSat-2;sensor suites;geophysical corrections;CryoSat-2 retrackers;spaceborne CryoSat-2 missions;reference ellipsoid;geoid model;tide model;atmospheric corrections;airborne topographic mapper;Land Vegetation and Ice Sensor observations;snow/ice interface;long-term surface elevation trends;size 0.05 m","","10","","29","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is limiting because only a small subset of labeled samples are used, which, given the nonstationary nature of the ice and water classes, will likely not reflect the full scene. To address this, we implement a binary ice–water classification in a more informative manner considering the uncertainty associated with each pixel in the scene. To accomplish this, we have implemented a Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) with variational inference to produce both aleatoric (data-based) and epistemic (model-based) uncertainty. This valuable information provides feedback as to regions that have pixels more likely to be misclassified and provides improved scene interpretation. Testing was performed on a set of 21 RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization SAR scenes covering a region in the Beaufort Sea captured regularly from April to December. The model is validated by demonstrating: 1) a positive correlation between misclassification rate and model uncertainty and 2) a higher uncertainty during the melt and freeze-up transition periods, which are more challenging to classify. By incorporating the iterative region growing with semantics (IRGS) segmentation algorithm and an uncertainty value-based thresholding algorithm, the Bayesian CNN classification outputs are improved significantly via both numerical analysis and visual inspection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3233871","NSERC Discovery Grant; NSERC Alliance Funding; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005093","Classification;ice maps;iterative region growing with semantics (IRGS);segmentation;uncertainty maps","Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Classification algorithms","geophysical image processing;ice;image segmentation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","21 RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization SAR scenes;Bayesian CNN classification outputs;Bayesian convolutional neural network;Beaufort Sea;binary ice-water classification;dual-polarized SAR Sea ice imagery;epistemic uncertainty;higher uncertainty;improved scene interpretation;informative manner;manually labeled samples;nonstationary nature;open water detection;semantics segmentation algorithm;synthetic aperture radar sea ice imagery;uncertainty value-based;uncertainty-incorporated ice;water classes","","","","52","IEEE","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a common struggle to obtain accurate classifications year round, particularly in the melt and freeze-up seasons. During these seasons, the radar backscatter signal is affected by wet snow cover, obscuring information about underlying ice types. By using additional spatiotemporal contextual data and a combination of convolutional neural networks and a dense conditional random field, we can mitigate these problems and obtain a single classifier that is able to classify accurately at 3.5-m spatial resolution for five different classes of sea ice surface from October to May. During the near year-long drift of the Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition, we collected satellite scenes of the same patch of Arctic pack ice with X-band SAR with a revisit time of less than a day on average. Combined with in situ observations of the local ice properties, this offers up the unprecedented opportunity to perform a detailed and quantitative assessment of the robustness of our classifier for level, deformed, and heavily deformed ice. For these three classes, we can perform accurate classification with a probability >95% and calculate a lower bound for the robustness between 85% and 88%.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3144731","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) through the Project “MOSAiCmicrowaveRS”(grant numbers:SI 2564/1-1,SP 1128/8-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9686749","Machine learning;robustness;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Convolutional neural networks;Robustness;Image resolution;Backscatter;Training","backscatter;image classification;neural nets;oceanographic techniques;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;snow;synthetic aperture radar","robust multiseasonal ice classification;high-resolution X-band SAR;automated solutions;sea ice-type classification;synthetic aperture radar imagery;cloud cover;arctic night;common struggle;accurate classifications year;radar backscatter signal;wet snow cover;ice types;additional spatiotemporal contextual data;convolutional neural networks;dense conditional random field;3.5-m spatial resolution;sea ice surface;year-long drift;Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory;Arctic Climate expedition;Arctic pack ice;local ice properties;unprecedented opportunity","","","","33","CCBY","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We examine the sensitivity of Ku-, X-, and C-band σVV0 and σHH0 to variability in snow geophysical properties such as salinity, density, temperature, and snow grain radius, sampled from a highly saline snow cover on first-year sea ice. A first-order multilayer snow and ice backscatter model is used to calculate σVV0 and σHH0 by taking into account the surface and volume scattering contributions within each snow layer of the snow pack. Penetration depth models are used to calculate the potential penetration of all three frequencies, at initial and perturbed snow property conditions. Sensitivity analyses suggest that variability in salinity and snow grain radius have the greatest effect, followed by density and temperature. This phenomenon is observed for all three frequencies, influencing microwave penetration and backscatter. Dielectric loss associated with highly saline snow covers and substantial changes in scattering contributions from snow grain radius perturbations were found to be the dominant factors affecting microwave penetration and backscatter. Results from this paper demonstrate the potential of using a multifrequency theoretical approach to correlate with active microwave observations to determine the geophysical and electrical state of snow/sea ice system. The paper also represents an evolution in a theoretical understanding on how an active microwave approach using multiple frequencies can be further utilized toward the development of snow thickness and/or snow water equivalent algorithm on smooth FYI.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2638323","Natural Science and Engineering Research Council Discovery Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803577","Active microwaves;backscatter;multifrequency;sea ice;snow","Snow;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Scattering;Backscatter;Sea ice;Ocean temperature","backscatter;density;microwaves;salinity (geophysical);sea ice;snow","multifrequency microwave backscatter;highly saline snow cover;smooth first year sea ice;first order theoretical modeling;salinity;density;temperature;snow grain radius;surface scattering;volume scattering;penetration depth models","","8","","53","IEEE","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Semantic segmentation has drawn much attention as an enabling technique for fast detection of objects in a scene including sea-ice conditions. Identifying sea-ice is a challenging problem, especially in the presence of raindrops. The raindrop alters the boundaries of the objects in the scene, and thus, degrades the identification performance. In this work, a raindrop removing framework is developed to enhance the classification performance. Three deep-learning semantic segmentation networks are trained to classify the scene of sea-ice images into ice, water, ship, and sky. The deep-learning networks are VGG-16, fully convolutional network, and pyramid scene parsing network. Transfer learning along with data augmentation operations have been implemented to improve the training process. Results illustrate that data augmentation operations enhance the performance of the three models.

This is often done using ice charts as training data. However, in these charts, an ice concentration label is given to a large region, which may not have a spatially uniform sea ice concentration distribution at the prediction scale of the CNN. This leads to representativity errors, which can be more pronounced at intermediate sea ice concentrations. In this study, we first investigate ways to perturb the ice chart labels to obtain improved predictions to account for the label uncertainty for intermediate ice concentrations. We then propose a method to augment the ice chart data by rescaling the information in the SAR imagery. The method is found to lead to improved accuracy in comparison to using the ice chart labels alone, with accuracy improving from 0.919 to 0.966. The sea ice concentration maps with the augmented labels also have much finer detail than the other approaches evaluated.

Statistical regression analysis and backscatter modeling are employed to explore the scattering mechanisms within the snowpack and to assess associations between backscatter and snow properties for both periods. Our results demonstrate substantial variation in both measured snow properties and C-band microwave backscatter over the diurnal cycle during the late winter period when the difference between maximum and minimum air and snow surface temperature was approximately 5 °C. No such variation in snow properties and backscatter occurred for the early melt period when our case study exhibited a small diurnal variation (~1 °C) in air and snow surface temperature. Statistical and modeled results show significant association between the microwave backscatter and snow properties for the top 8 cm of the snowpack. Basal snow properties do not contribute toward total backscatter in either case. As a result, we are certain that the sea ice surface was a negligible scattering interface during both cases. Correlations between backscatter and snow properties are incidence angle dependent, demonstrating the highest association at 50°. Diurnal backscatter from RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar acquisitions support the influence of varying diurnal snow properties on C-band backscatter, showing a difference of ~4 dB for σohhand σvvo during the late winter period.

Considering the distribution characteristic of sea ice scene, simulation samples are synthesized by algebraic operations on the respective regions of interest from two true samples. One of the two true samples can be an additional image, which is more easily collected than others, such as full ice and snow. Simultaneously, it introduces new information.

Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is very valuable for the observation of polar regions, and extensive work was already carried out on detection and tracking of large icebergs. However, the identification of small icebergs is still challenging especially when these are embedded in sea ice. In this paper, a new detector is proposed based on incoherent dual-polarization SAR images. The algorithm considers the limited extension of small icebergs, which are supposed to have a stronger cross-polarization and higher cross- over copolarization ratio compared to the surrounding sea or sea ice background. The new detector is tested with two satellite systems. First, RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric images are analyzed to evaluate the effects of high-resolution data. Subsequently, a more exhaustive analysis is carried out using dual-polarization ground-detected Sentinel-1a extra wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test areas are in the east coast of Greenland, where several icebergs have been observed. A quantitative analysis and a comparison with a detector using only the cross-polarization channel are carried out, exploiting grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology improves the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter by up to 75 times. This returns an improved probability of detection.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2569450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485879","Arctic;iceberg detection;polarimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Detectors;Clutter;Scattering","oceanographic techniques;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","depolarization ratio anomaly detector;sea ice;dual-polarization SAR images;RADARSAT-2 quad-polarimetric images;synthetic aperture radar;Sentinel-1a images;Greenland;iceberg detection;polarimetric radar","","33","","37","IEEE","6 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm, denoted as AMSR2 thin ice detection algorithm—version 2 (ATIDA2), is targeted for the Arctic Ocean. The detection of thin ice with a maximum thickness of 20 cm is based on the classification of the 36-GHz polarization ratio ( $PR36$ ) and H-polarization 89–36-GHz gradient ratio ( $GR8936H$ ) signatures with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and thick ice restoration with  $GR3610H$ . The thick ice restoration removes erroneous thin ice detections due to thin and thick ice  $PR36$  and  $GR8936H$  signature mixing. ATIDA2 is applied only when sea ice concentration (SIC) is ≥70% and the air temperature is ≤−5 °C to decrease misclassification of thick ice as thin ice. For the AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data, an atmospheric correction is applied following an EUMETSAT OSI SAF correction scheme in SIC retrieval algorithms. ATIDA2 is applied to L1R swath datasets, and then, the results are combined to a daily thin ice chart. ATIDA2 was developed and validated using MODIS ice thickness charts over the Barents and Kara Seas. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice in the daily chart is 8.7%, and 37.0% for vice versa. The comparison of the ATIDA2 chart and the SMOS ice thickness chart over the Arctic showed rough correspondence in the thin versus thick ice classification. The ATIDA2 chart is targeted to be used together with SAR imagery for various sea ice classifications.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3142966","European Union (EU), Finland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden, through the Kolarctic Cross Border Collaboration Project “Ice Operations”(grant numbers:KO2100 ICEOP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9681066","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Ice;Sea ice;Arctic;Silicon carbide;Production;Oceans;Microwave radiometry","oceanographic regions;radiometry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","AMSR2 radiometer data;ice detection algorithm-version;polarization ratio;ice restoration;ice PR36;sea ice concentration;AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data;MODIS ice thickness charts;ATIDA2 chart;SMOS ice thickness chart;sea ice classifications;thick ice classification;Arctic winter conditions;Arctic Ocean;temperature 5.0 degC;size 20.0 cm;frequency 36.0 GHz to 89.0 GHz","","1","","69","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has potential benefits for wide-swath SAR imagery over flat areas and ocean, wide angled airborne and UAV based SAR data, connecting narrow-beam SAR images at different acquisition angles, as well as land-based analysis with local topographic terrain angles.

One of the algorithms that combine both observations to identify partial concentrations of ice types (including MYI) is the Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE). However, cycles of warm-cold air temperature trigger wet-dry cycles of the snow cover on MYI surface. Under wet snow conditions, anomalous brightness temperature and backscatter, similar to those of first-year ice (FYI), are observed. This leads to misidentification of MYI as being FYI, hence decreasing the estimated MYI concentration suddenly. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a correction scheme to restore the MYI concentration under this condition. The correction is based on air temperature records. It utilizes the fact that the warm spell in autumn lasts for a short period of time (a few days). The correction is applied to MYI concentration retrievals from ECICE using an input of combined QuikSCAT and AMSR-E data, acquired over the Arctic region in a series of autumn seasons from 2003 to 2008. The correction works well by replacing anomalous MYI concentrations with interpolated ones. For September of the six years, it introduces over 0.1×106 km2 MYI area, except for 2005. Due to the regional effect of warm air spells, the correction could be important in the operational applications where ice concentrations are crucial on small scale and mesoscale.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2503884","China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360933","Arctic sea ice;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE);ice concentration;microwave remote sensing;multiyear ice (MYI);surface air temperature;Arctic sea ice;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor (ECICE);ice concentration;microwave remote sensing;multiyear ice (MYI);surface air temperature","Ocean temperature;Arctic;Microwave radiometry;Sea surface;Sea ice;Meteorology","atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;ice;snow","AMSR-E data;QuikSCAT data;Arctic region;autumn seasons;AD 2003 to 2008;warm air spell regional effect;concentration retrievals;reanalysis air temperature records;multiyear ice misidentification;first-year ice;anomalous brightness temperature;wet snow conditions;MYI surface;snow cover;wet-dry cycles;warm-cold air temperature cycles;Environment Canada Ice Concentration Extractor;ice type partial concentrations;passive remote sensing observation;active microwave remote sensing observation;multiyear ice characteristics;multiyear ice concentration estimates","","22","","52","IEEE","18 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, a recently proposed iceberg detector the intensity Dual-Pol Ratio Anomaly Detector (iDPolRAD) is tested using ALOS-2 L-band data. The detector is designed for dual-polarized incoherent SAR images, however in this work we want to investigate the loss of performance with respect to using coherent data. Therefore different versions of the iDPolRAD requiring quad-pol data are proposed here and tested. The ALOS-2 data were acquired on the East Coast of Greenland, where a large number of icebergs are visible in the images. The results show that different polarisations could bring different information and therefore the availability of dual-pol could improve the detection although a quad-pol algorithm will not be operational at the moment due to the limited size of the swath.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8519206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8519206","SAR;polarimetry;iceberg detection;ALOS-2","Detectors;Sea ice;Scattering;Synthetic aperture radar;Training;L-band;Sea surface","radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","altimeters;intensity Dual-Pol Ratio Anomaly Detector;iDPolRAD;ALOS-2 L-band data;dual-polarized incoherent SAR images;quad-pol data;quad-pol algorithm;iceberg detection;cold waters;space-borne scatterometers;synthetic aperture radar systems;sea ice;East Coast Greenland","","1","","5","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose semantic segmentation for automated detection and classification of sea ice types using camera feeds onboard an ice breaker. For this purpose, we evaluate the SegNet and PSPNet101 neural network architectures, which have proven success in navigation and mapping applications such as self-driving cars, remote sensing, and medical imagery. The networks are used to segment images based on two custom datasets, one with four classes: ice, ocean, vessel, and sky, i.e., sea ice detection dataset, and the second with eight classes: ocean, vessel, sky, lens artifacts, first-year ice, new ice, grey ice, and multiyear ice, i.e., sea ice classification dataset. The Nathaniel B. Palmer imagery, which captured 2-month footage of the icebreaker completing an Antarctic expedition was used in the creation of both datasets. A subset of the dataset was labeled to generate a 240-image training set for sea ice detection achieving an accuracy of 98% classification for the 26-image test set. The sea ice classification dataset consists of 1,090 labeled images achieving accuracies of 98.3% or greater for all ice types for the 104-image test set.

In CWNN, dual-tree complex wavelet transform is introduced into convolutional neural networks for changed and unchanged pixels' classification, and then, the effect of speckle noise is effectively reduced. In addition, a virtual sample generation scheme is employed to create samples for CWNN training, and the problem of limited samples is alleviated.

We find that MWRI-ASI SIC has the smallest difference with AMSR2-ASI SIC with the mean absolute difference (MAD) of 6.8%, and the differences mainly occur at the marginal ice zone regions. The MWRI-ASI displays the highest difference with Sea Ice Index and OSI-430-b at 25 km with the mean MAD of 11.8%. MADs between MWRI-ASI SIC and SIC products from other sensors are below 10% except for late June to early October, when those are higher. Compared with the MODIS SIC, MWRI-ASI SIC outperforms other SIC products at the same resolution, with the mean bias of −2.1% and mean RMSD of 13.5%.

The algorithm is comprised of two steps: correction of the annotated thermal noise magnitude (previously proposed in Park et al., 2018) and a novel correction of the annotated thermal noise range dependence. The magnitude of the annotated thermal noise is corrected by applying scale and offset coefficients tuned on a few hundred of Sentinel-1 data acquired over surfaces with low backscatter in interferometric wide and extra-wide swath modes in HV and VH polarizations. The values of coefficients for all modes and polarizations for data processing with the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) version 3.1–3.3 are provided. The range dependence is corrected by minimizing a cost function between the annotated range profiles of thermal noise and antenna pattern gain (APG). An objective validation metric based on a comparison of averaged backscatter at interswath boundaries is proposed. Validation is performed on hundreds of Sentinel-1 scenes acquired over the open ocean, doldrums, deserts, and sea ice. It shows that the new algorithm outperforms the standard thermal noise removal algorithm proposed by European Space Agency in almost all cases. Analysis shows that the new algorithm worsens noise correction in cases when the range dependence of the annotated APG does not match with the observed signal, indicating either problems with signal processing on IPF or imprecise annotation of APG.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3131036","European Space Agency (ESA) through the S1DENOISE Project ESA(grant numbers:4000129496/19/I-NS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627699","Remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar (SAR);Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR);thermal noise","Thermal noise;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice;Training;Table lookup;Sea surface;Ocean temperature","geophysical signal processing;radar imaging;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;thermal noise","thermal denoising;cross-polarized Sentinel-1 data;extra wide swath modes;Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar level-1 ground range;annotated thermal noise magnitude;annotated thermal noise range dependence;extra-wide swath modes;data processing;Instrument Processing Facility;Sentinel-1 scenes;standard thermal noise removal algorithm;noise correction;HV polarization;VH polarization","","","","13","CCBY","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a U-Net model is trained to identify multi-year ice (MYI), first-year ice (FYI), and open water (OW) from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. 14 Sentinel-1 A/B Extended Wide (EW) mode images, acquired in the Beaufort Sea and Svalbard between January and March 2020, and their gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture feature are split into chips to be fed into the model for training and testing. The GLCM is a set of images reflecting the comprehensive information of direction, adjacent interval, and variation amplitude of the gray level of original image. It can also be understood as texture features of original image. It is the basis of analyzing local patterns in an image and their arrangement rules. Dissimilarity of HH (HH-Dis) chosen from 20 kinds of available GLCM texture features is combined with horizontal-vertical (HV) polarization, horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization, and incident angle as inputs. The LabelMe software creates labels with visual interpretation. The proportions of FYI and MYI data in training data were adjusted to approximately equal, to avoid bias of model prediction results towards dominant categories. The result shows that the combination of HH, HV, incident angle and HH-Dis has the highest precision of 92.10%, although the precision is 89.35% when only HH and HV information combined. This result reflects the potential of adding GLCM for sea ice classification.","1559-9450","978-1-6654-6023-1","10.1109/PIERS55526.2022.9793312","Chinese Academy of Sciences; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793312","","Training;Visualization;Training data;Predictive models;Radar polarimetry;Software;Marine navigation","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;neural nets;oceanographic regions;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","U-Net model;dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images;marine navigation;Northwest Passage;synthetic aperture radar images;Beaufort Sea;GLCM texture features;horizontal-vertical polarization;horizontal-horizontal polarization;sea ice classification;gray level cooccurrence matrix texture feature;SAR images;Sentinel-1 A-B extended wide mode images;Svalbard;AD 2020 01 to 03;LabelMe software","","","","18","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the next-generation ICESat sensor also presents new data processing challenges due to the high number of false returns present in the resultant point cloud that are mainly caused by the high sensitivity of the photon detector to solar returns. In this letter, we propose a novel noise filter for single photon laser altimeter data utilizing a Bayesian decision theory. We applied our algorithm to the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) data sets and compared the filtered estimate of ground to coincident high resolution airborne LiDAR data. The results show that the proposed algorithm differentiates between noise and ground surface returns effectively with 6-m root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the MABEL green channel lasers and 4-m RMSE for the near-infrared channel lasers.

The complexity of coastal wind field is the main reason why these areas are so important. It is necessary to retrieve the wind field of coastal areas from remote sensing satellite. In order to retrieve wind speed from CYGNSS, the matched data were processed by matching CYGNSS with NCEP wind speed. An empirical wind speed retrieval algorithm was established for CYGNSS coastal data. The accuracy of CYGNSS coastal wind field was determined by various comparisons with NCEP.

The CNN is applied to the prediction of Arctic sea ice for marine navigation and as input to sea ice forecast models. This generic model is specifically well suited for fusing data sources where the ground resolutions of the sensors differ with orders of magnitude, here 35 km × 62 km (for AMSR2, 6.9 GHz) compared with the 93 m × 87 m (for sentinel-1 IW mode). In this work, two optimization approaches are compared using the categorical cross-entropy error function in the specific application of CNN training on sea ice charts. In the first approach, concentrations are thresholded to be encoded in a standard binary fashion, and in the second approach, concentrations are used as the target probability directly. The second method leads to a significant improvement in R2 measured on the prediction of ice concentrations evaluated over the test set. The performance improves both in terms of robustness to noise and alignment with mean concentrations from ice analysts in the validation data, and an R2 value of 0.89 is achieved over the independent test set.

The model is designed to generate and process reflected signals for various airborne radar systems and even synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) systems. Such modern systems typically produce radar images. But here we concentrate on solving the problem of measuring the thickness of ice along with the calculation of images of the ice surface. Thus, to solve this problem, it is necessary to preserve several ideas (such as decimeter and decameter waves, vertical looking, wideband, coherent processing, and resolution of multiple reflections). The model is suitable for identifying features of SAR implementation in such a remote sensing application. During the first study, to simplify the model, only basic parameters of the ice surface were realized: the ice is homogenous and both of its surfaces consist of many bright points. The model can simulate reflected signals and radar images with additional information about an ice layer structure. So, a precision wideband radar system can measure the ice thickness, evaluate its dirtiness, uniformity, other object presence, etc.","","978-1-7281-3165-8","10.1109/USBEREIT48449.2020.9117743","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9117743","sea ice model;ice thickness measurement;SAR;radar system;remote sensing;signal processing","Sea surface;Radar measurements;Ice surface;Sea measurements;Radar imaging;Ice;Radar signal processing","airborne radar;mathematical analysis;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;thickness measurement","wideband radar system;sea ice signals;synthetic-aperture radar system;mathematical modeling;signal reflection;ice surface;SAR implementation;ice layer structure;airborne radar imaging systems;thickness measurement","","","","12","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The operational monitoring of low backscatter targets can benefit from a stronger integration of freely available SAR imagery from Sentinel-1. We, therefore, propose a detection method applicable to Sentinel-1 extra wide-swath (EW) SAR scenes. Using intensity values coupled with incidence angle and noise-equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) information, the image segmentation method is able to detect the low backscatter targets as one segment across subswaths. We use the Barents Sea as a test site due to the abundant presence of low backscatter targets with different origins, and of long-term operational monitoring services that help cross-validate our observations.

The recent SMOS, Aquarius, and SMAP satellites have demonstrated the value of measurements at 1400 MHz for observing surface soil moisture, sea surface salinity, sea ice thickness, soil freeze/thaw state, and other geophysical variables. However, the information obtained is limited by penetration through the subsurface at 1400 MHz and by a reduced sensitivity to surface salinity in cold or wind-roughened waters. Recent airborne experiments have shown the potential of brightness temperature measurements from 500-1400 MHz to address these limitations by enabling sensing of soil moisture and sea ice thickness to greater depths, sensing of temperature deep within ice sheets, improved sensing of sea salinity in cold waters, and enhanced sensitivity to soil moisture under vegetation canopies. However, the absence of significant spectrum reserved for passive microwave measurements in the 500-1400 MHz band requires both an opportunistic sensing strategy and systems for reducing the impact of radio-frequency interference. Here, we summarize the potential advantages and applications of 500-1400 MHz microwave radiometry for Earth observation and review recent experiments and demonstrations of these concepts.

We add a dense conditional random fields to the ConvLSTM, which further extracts global spatial information and can predict SIC more accurately. The experimental results show that compared with ConvLSTM, our model has a great improvement in the overall prediction accuracy and has more accurate predictions in the SIC boundary region, especially in the melting and freezing seasons when the SIC changes drastically.

Traditionally, Arctic sea-ice types are mainly identified based on the scatterometer, radiometer, and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with the medium-incidence angles (about 20°–60°). The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), as a new type sensor with the low-incidence angles (0°, 2°, 4°, 8°, and 10°), is different from traditional remote sensors. SWIM has the potential to recognize sea-ice types based on its echo signals and backscattering information, whereas relevant research is still under development. In this research, the sea-ice classification using the SWIM’s observations of the low-incidence angles is studied. Firstly, the waveform features of the six low-incidence angles were extracted from the SWIM echoes from November 2019 to April 2020, including the maximum power (MAX), the backscattering power (BSP), the pulse peakiness (PP), the stack standard deviation (SSD), the leading-edge width (LEW), and the trailing-edge width (TEW). Secondly, the Euclidean distances among the sea-ice types (the first-year ice (FYI) and the multi-year ice (MYI)) and the open water (OW) are used to analyze the distinction of the three categories based on the waveform features in the incidence angles. Thirdly, the FYI, MYI, and OW are classified by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the waveform features, and the three kinds of kernel (Gaussian kernel, Linear kernel, and Polynomial kernel) for SVM are analyzed for their capabilities of sea-ice classification. Then, the classification results are compared with the ice charts of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) to evaluate the classification accuracies. It is found that the accuracies of the waveform features in the low-incidence angles for the Gaussian kernel are the highest, and the accuracies of the Linear kernel are the lowest. It is revealed that the accuracies of all features in the different angles using Gaussian kernel is up to 77%. It is concluded that SWIM has the capacity for the sea-ice classification. In the future, our work will focus on the development of recognition methods based on more waveform features or feature sets to improve the accuracies of the sea-ice classification. This research will expand new horizons for the SWIM ocean detection application.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-7247-7","10.1109/PIERS53385.2021.9695052","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9695052","","Support vector machines;Sea surface;Surface waves;Feature extraction;Arctic;Kernel;Monitoring","backscatter;geophysical signal processing;image classification;ocean waves;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","Arctic sea-ice types;medium-incidence angles;Surface Wave Investigation;Monitoring instrument;type sensor;low-incidence angles;sea-ice classification;waveform features;first-year ice;multiyear ice;Gaussian kernel;ice charts;Arctic sea-ice type recognition;Arctic sea-ice monitoring","","","","23","IEEE","3 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The MSU is an operational source of data on dynamic processes in the environment with a temporal resolution of 15-30 minutes.

For many applications, quantitative values of Arctic environment parameters are needed regardless of cloud cover and time of day (illumination). These include, for example, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), ice drift speed and direction, ice concentration, area of land ice melting zones, type and intensity of solid and liquid precipitation, cloud liquid water content, total atmospheric water vapor content, and other geophysical parameters.

The detection algorithm was trained from collocated observations between ATMS-NPP and CloudSat cloud profiling radar (CPR) snowfall product. Both brightness temperature (TB) variables and global forecast system (GFS) output variables are evaluated for snowfall detection in this algorithm. Results show that combining TB variables and GFS variables provide the optimal snowfall detection performance. The Heidke skill score (HSS) values are about 0.56 over all three surface types, and the probability of detection (POD) values are 0.76, 0.70, and 0.72 over ocean, sea ice, and coast, respectively. The importance of the GFS variables differs greatly among these three surface types. The detection algorithm primarily depends on TB variables over ocean and HSS only increased by 0.05 by adding GFS variables. In contrast, GFS variables are critically important to snowfall detection over sea ice and coastal regions. Without GFS variables, the HSS values over both sea ice and coastal regions decrease sharply from about 0.56 to about 0.40. Over ocean, we also developed a regional snowfall detection model in each 10° grid box, which greatly outperform the global detection model over certain regions (e.g., sea of Okhotsk and Labrador Sea).

This study investigates the feasibility of mediating semantic query and catalogue search together to allow more searchable parameters without any changes to the existing metadata database and catalogue service. Limitations of a catalogue's textual search capabilities are analyzed. A use case of searching for sea ice imagery using search criteria that are absent in the NASA ECHO (the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration EOS Clearing House) catalogue service is presented. An ontology dedicated for remotely sensed sea ice data collections is introduced. Details of a two-step hybrid metadata search model, i.e., collection-level discovery search enabled by ontology query, and granule-level inventory search fulfilled by catalogue service, are presented and evaluated. Our results show that this semantically enhanced catalogue search model could easily extend the existing catalogue service to allow more searchable parameters, and, at the same time, maintain a backward compatibility with them.

The integration also serves to improve each algorithm individually, decreasing reliance on ancillary datasets. Case studies are presented that exemplify both ongoing challenges for these retrievals and potential research uses of such an integrated satellite product. Two cases are presented each for precipitation at high latitudes and marginal sea ice detection, with analysis supplemented by satellite data from CloudSat profiles and Himawari-8 imagery. Detection and retrieval of snowfall remains a challenge, while light rainfall detection can be aided by a variational algorithm. Sea ice concentrations below 20% cause disagreements, but the algorithms otherwise agree well on the sea ice edge.

Four scenarios of land, land ice, sea ice, and ocean were also considered.

First, we evaluate the self-consistency of the DEMs where flight paths cross over each other and two measurements are made at the same location. Secondly, we compare the quality of the outputs of the ice-bottom tracker before and after applying manual corrections to the tracker results; the tracker is an algorithm that we implemented to automatically track the ice-bottom.

In the retrieval algorithm, the background scattering is subtracted from the total scattering giving the volume scattering of snow. With the look-up table, we generate regression equations between multiple and single scattering and correlations between the scattering albedo and optical thickness at the two bands. With these relationships and the volume scattering of the snowpack, the best solution for the radar observation is found using a priori constrained least-squares cost function. Next, the absorption loss of the snowpack is derived from the solution, which is directly proportional to the SWE. We have applied the algorithm to airborne SAR observations from Finland and Canada.

Therefore, it is the key to accurately judge the type of sea ice around the ship. However, remote sensing technology will be restricted by external weather changes. Therefore, this paper presents a method based on statistical feature extraction and machine learning of ship main engine vibration signal, so as to realize the recognition of sea ice types. Firstly, according to the sea ice video information captured by the camera, the acceleration and vibration data collected by the vibration sensor are divided, and the wavelet threshold denoising algorithm is adopted to enhance the features. Then, based on the statistical characteristics of vibration signals, time domain and frequency domain features are extracted.

In particular, a proposed reformulation of the LMB equations exposes a structure which is exploited to propose a compact algorithm for the generation of the filter's posterior distribution. Further, spatial indexing is applied to the clustering process of the filter, allowing efficient separation of the filter into smaller, independent parts with lesser total complexity than that of an unclustered filter.

In this work, a new detector is proposed based on dual-polarized incoherent SAR images. Small icebergs have a stronger cross polarization accompanied by a higher cross- over co-polarization ratio compared to sea ice in many cases. This is the rational at the base of the detector. The new detector is tested with dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel-1a Extra Wide swath images acquired over the time span of two months. The test area is on the East Coast of Greenland, where large numbers of icebergs occur. This work is mostly focused on the development of an appropriate Constant False Alarm Rate for the contrast enhanced image, that is based on a modification of the Cell-Averaging CFAR. A quantitative comparison of the proposed detector with an ordinary CA-CFAR using only the cross polarization channel is provided. We focus on grounded icebergs as test targets. The proposed methodology seems able to improve the contrast between icebergs and sea ice clutter up to 75 times. This returns an increased probability of detection and reduced probability of false alarms.","","978-2-8748-7045-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811650","","Detectors;Sea ice;Training;Synthetic aperture radar;Clutter;Scattering;Random access memory","geophysical image processing;hydrological techniques;image enhancement;object detection;probability;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","iceberg detector;CFAR test;dual-polarized radar imagery;small iceberg identification;sea ice;dual-polarized incoherent SAR images;co-polarization;cross polarization;dual-polarization ground detected Sentinel-1a Extra Wide swath images;East Coast of Greenland;constant false alarm rate;contrast enhanced image;detection probability;false alarm probability;modified cell-averaging CFAR","","","","5","","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing methods can obtain accurate SICs for most situations, but they usually perform poorly in low SIC regions because of the spatial differences in the neighboring pixels induced by the discontinuity of the sea ice cover. In this letter, to cope with the difficulty of this problem, an improved SIC estimation method is proposed to retrieve SIC, focusing on low SIC regions. The proposed method introduces the spatial relationships into SIC estimation by employing a total variation (TV) regularizer. Moreover, nonnegative constrained least squares (NCLS) is used to derive the optimal solutions from the SIC estimation equation. Verification was conducted in low SIC regions (0%–50%) of the Antarctic utilizing ship-based in situ data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the results were compared with those of some of the mature methods. The results indicated that the proposed method can obtain a superior accuracy with a smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) (6.0%–14.61%) than the other algorithms in low SIC regions. Furthermore, the proposed method can accurately estimate the SIC of both first-year ice and multiyear ice. The findings of this study confirm the need to consider the spatial relationships in the processing of SIC estimation.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2021.3090395","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1406102); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41676179,41941010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486871","Antarctic;nonnegative constrained least squares (NCLS);sea ice concentration (SIC);spatial relationships;total variation (TV) regularizer","Silicon carbide;Sea ice;TV;Estimation;Antarctica;Microwave theory and techniques;Microwave integrated circuits","","","","","","17","IEEE","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Estimates acquired from passive microwave data have coarse spatial resolution, may have errors due to atmospheric contamination, and often perform poorly in marginal ice zones. Image analysis charts are not as precise, subject to analyst interpretation, and only available over specific geographic areas. We have implemented a U-net with synthetic aperture radar images as inputs and use ice concentration estimates retrieved from passive microwave data as training labels. The U-net, due to not being sensitive to patch size, is shown to be an improvement over previous work with convolutional neural networks that use fully connected layers at the output. Data augmentation and an L1 loss function were applied along with a novel training scheme that leverages curriculum learning. In this training scheme, the model is first trained with samples from open water and consolidated ice regions before incorporating samples from marginal ice regions. In a tenfold cross validation experiment, we achieve 3-4% mean absolute error comparing to estimates using passive microwave data and observe curriculum learning models having more stable training. Predictions on four with-held SAR scenes with difficult ice conditions were evaluated with image analysis charts. A mean absolute error of 7.18% is achieved, which is lower than errors associated with passive microwave data alone.

Traditional sea ice concentration and thickness criteria could only detect the polynya once it was open.

Only winter periods (October-May) were investigated. Maximum ice speed of 81.7 cm/s to SW was detected at 80°N 0°W between November22 and 23, 2013. At 79°N between 7° and 5°W, sea ice speed vectors were mostly directed to S-SW but reversed to the north for short periods. Using ERA-Interim atmospheric data, the southward component of the ice speed (max. +71.7, min. -30.9 cm/s) was correlated (R = 0.93) to the cross-strait sea level pressure gradient. Ice speeds due to the EGC were obtained by subtracting the wind-induced ice speed component estimated by linear regression. Results for winter 2013-2014 show that the mean southward component of the EGC (9.4 cm/s, σ = 3.0) accounted more than half of the mean sea ice speed (17.7 cm/s, σ = 7.2). The EGC oscillated between 5 and 15 cm/s and sustained the southward ice export during short periods when the wind reversed to north. Satellite-based measurements of the surface EGC are the complement to hydrographic measurements in Fram Strait, but further investigation is required to understand how the apparent variability of the current is influenced by the thickness of the ice transiting in the strait or by wind induced north-to-south oscillations of the sea surface in the strait.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2529847","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422703","Arctic sea ice export;COSMO-SkyMed;East Greenland current (EGC);EGC background current;Fram Strait","Random access memory;Ferroelectric films;Nonvolatile memory;Sea ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Arctic","geophysical image processing;gradient methods;marine radar;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;wind","east Greenland current;COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR image;AD 2013 03 to 2014 12;western Fram strait;maximum ice speed;ERA-interim atmospheric data;southward ice speed component;cross-strait sea level pressure gradient;wind-induced ice speed component;mean sea ice speed;EGC oscillation;hydrographic measurement;sea surface north-to-south oscillations","","","","32","IEEE","1 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, monitoring spatial distribution and temporal changes in snow depth and accumulation over remote mountains and glaciers in wide areas is challenging because of limited accessibility for in-situ measurements. As a part of NASA Operation IceBridge missions, we took airborne radar measurements of snow over Alaskan mountains, icefields and glaciers in late May of 2018, with a compact frequency-modulated continuous wave radar system, operating from 2 GHz to 8 GHz and installed on a Single Otter aircraft. In this paper, we describe the radar instrument, its installation onto the platform, the data collection and processing activities, and report the major results from these surveys. We observed seasonal snow depth between ~0.3 m to ~15 m for elevations above sea level from ~1726 m to ~3624 m. We successfully mapped snow accumulation layers to depths exceeding ~85 m below the surface at high-elevation summits of Mount Wrangell and Bona. The traced snow depth profiles over glaciers and accumulation layers at mountain summits point to the utility of these data to the study of water resource management, hydrology modelling, and regional climate change.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-9154-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2019.8900034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900034","Alaska glaciers;FMCW radar;snow measurements","Snow;Sea measurements;Spaceborne radar;Airborne radar;Aircraft;Radar antennas;Climate change","airborne radar;climatology;CW radar;FM radar;glaciology;hydrological techniques;hydrology;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;snow;water resources","high-elevation summits;Mount Wrangell and Bona;Single Otter aircraft;freshwater resources;snow accumulation layers;seasonal snow depth;radar instrument;icefields;airborne radar measurements;NASA Operation IceBridge missions;in-situ measurements;remote mountains;snow water equivalent;climate history;local seasonal snow accumulation;mountain summits;coastal areas;mountainous areas;compact FMCW radar;glaciers;alaska mountains;airborne snow measurements;frequency 2.0 GHz to 8.0 GHz","","8","","11","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the primary objective is the measurement of SSS, the instrument combination operates continuously, acquiring data over land and sea ice as well. An important feature of the data processing includes detection and mitigation of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), which is done separately for both active and passive instruments. Correcting for RFI is particularly critical over ocean because of the high accuracy required in the brightness temperature measurements for SSS retrieval. It is also necessary for applications of the Aquarius data over land, where man-made interference is widespread, even though less accuracy is required in this case.

An analysis of weather events was performed using multisensor satellite measurements, the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), and Arctic System Reanalysis, version 2 (ASR2). The CFSv2 data showed that the most intense cold advection occurred at the 1000-900 hPa boundary layer. It was shown that CAO had been developing from November 30 to December 6 and was accompanied by the sea surface wind speed exceeding 20 m/s and rapid formation and drift of sea ice. Analysis of the sea ice response to the CAO showed fast freezing of the Chukchi Sea for seven days indicating excessive heat loss of the water basin. In addition, significant increase in the open and very open ice areas was observed. These areas could be exposed to excessive cold atmosphere, releasing heat into the atmosphere. PL events have been identified during intensive mesocyclogenesis over the sea during 15-17 November. Weather conditions were characterized by the values of wind speed reaching 15-17 m/s and dry air with total water vapor content (5-7 kg/m2). Analysis of the synthetic aperture radar image revealed the position and horizontal size of the meso-α-cyclone, the fine structure of the mesoscale frontal system of the PL forming meso-γ-vortices, and the wave-like line of the horizontal wind shear in the local convergence zone. The representation of PL events in sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed fields from the ASR2 and CFSv2 datasets was ambiguous. However, the satellite-based and CFSv2 wind speeds better agreed for high-wind conditions.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2934749","Russian Science Foundation(grant numbers:17-77-20112,AAAA-A17-117030110037-8); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8816674","Arctic;Chukchi Sea;cold-air outbreak (CAO);combined active/passive microwave;polar low (PL);sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea ice;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Arctic;Wind speed","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric pressure;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;sea ice;storms;synthetic aperture radar;weather forecasting;wind","ASR2;CFSv2 datasets;Chukchi Sea;cold-air outbreak;mesocyclone case studies;satellite multisensor measurements;reanalysis datasets;polar low events;low sea ice extent;weather events;multisensor satellite measurements;NCEP Climate Forecast System;Arctic System Reanalysis;CFSv2 data;intense cold advection;sea surface wind speed;sea ice response;excessive heat loss;very open ice areas;excessive cold atmosphere;PL events;weather conditions;dry air;mesoscale frontal system;sea level pressure;near-surface wind speed fields;marine weather systems;boundary layer;November-December period;CFSv2 wind speeds;velocity 20.0 m/s;pressure 900.0 hPa to 1000.0 hPa;velocity 15.0 m/s to 17.0 m/s","","2","","39","IEEE","27 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, using SAR images to separate the marginal ice zone (MIZ) from consolidated ice and open water has not been explicitly considered before. One typical feature of MIZ is that it is more dynamic than consolidated ice, and includes floes, fast and thin ice or ice eddies. The current paper utilizes the dynamic feature of MIZ to investigate a curvelet-based feature extraction method in order to classify a SAR image into open water, dynamic ice and consolidated ice, as a first step toward using SAR imagery to identify the MIZ. An experiment of 10-fold cross validation is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method is effective. Finally, an SVM classifier is used on a SAR image to test the performance of the curvelet-based feature.

Existing researches have explored the detection of oil rigs, oil spills, sea ice, and other targets with spaceborne GNSS-R. However, these researches may not fully consider the advantages of multiple GNSS-R satellites, for example, Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) which has eight satellites. Two problems of using multiple GNSS-R satellites for detection and location are how to estimate the sea clutter that is used to cancel the clutter in DDMs and how to remove location ambiguity caused by the transformation from the delay-Doppler (DD) domain to the spatial domain. In this article, an oil rig is taken as an example for detection and location with multiple GNSS-R satellites. To distinguish the oil rig from sea clutter, this article uses subspace projection to estimate the clutter and subtract the estimation from the DDMs. Moreover, after the clutter cancellation, this article projects the potential oil rig coordinates in the DD domain into a uniform coordinate system and removes the location ambiguity based on multisatellites fusion. The measured DDMs collected by CYGNSS are employed to conduct experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed methods for detection and location with DDMs. By subtracting the estimated sea clutter from DDMs, the potential oil rig can be indicated in the DD domain.

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ice thickness swath charts were used as reference data for the algorithm development. The algorithm is based on the classification of 36-GHz polarization ratio (PR36) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio (GR3689H) signatures with linear discriminant analysis. We applied an atmospheric correction to the AMSR2 L1R data following established sea ice concentration (SIC) retrieval algorithms. The PR36 and GR8936H signatures were adjusted to a constant air temperature (Ta) before the thin ice detection using an empirical relationship between them and Ta. The maximum thickness of detected thin ice was estimated to be 20 cm. The thin ice detection with the L1R data is conducted only when SIC ≥ 70% and Ta ≤ -5 °C to limit conditions where thick ice may be erroneously detected as thin ice. The thin ice detection algorithm was developed for the Barents and Kara Seas, but it should also be applicable for other Arctic marginal ice zones (MIZs). The daily thin ice chart was validated using an independent set of MODIS daily ice thickness charts. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice was 10% and 32% for vice versa. We demonstrate the use of the daily thin ice chart for monitoring the thin ice fraction in the Barents and Kara Seas.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2913283","Finnish Meteorological Institute; Luonnontieteiden ja Tekniikan Tutkimuksen Toimikunta(grant numbers:283034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719016","Arctic;passive microwave remote sensing;polynya;thin sea ice","Microwave radiometry;Ice thickness;MODIS;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave imaging;Microwave integrated circuits","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;ice;microwave measurement;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice","Kara Seas;thin ice detection;AMSR2 high-frequency Radiometer data;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 radiometer high-frequency brightness temperature;L1R swath data;ice swath charts;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ice thickness swath charts;36-GHz polarization ratio;PR36;AMSR2 L1R data;sea ice concentration retrieval algorithms;ice detection algorithm;Arctic marginal ice zones;MODIS daily ice thickness charts;ice fraction;frequency 36.0 GHz;frequency 89.0 GHz;temperature -5.0 degC;size 20.0 cm;Ta;H","","6","","59","IEEE","21 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study aims to detect crevasses from ICESat-2 data and obtain three-dimensional features of the crevasse. First, the change of along-track surface slope and the depth threshold is combined to obtain the crevasse bottom points and the crevasse edge points. Second, the distance between the crevasse bottom points and the fitted ice shelf surface by crevasse edge points is used as the crevasse bottom points depth. Third, the crevasse direction is judged by the strong and weak laser positions and the width is calculated by the crevasse edge points and crevasse direction. The Amery ice shelf (AIS) is chosen as the test area to validate the method by ATL06 data, combined with the Landsat-8 optical image. The depth of the crevasses in the AIS is about ranges from 2.0 to 60.0 m, and the width is mainly 400 to 1600 m, and the width and length of the L3 rift have dramatically changed, which is an indicator that the AIS is in a new calving cycle. The method in this article can accurately obtain three-dimensional information of the crevasses, find crevasses with abnormal changes in depth and width, and provide effective help for predicting the calving of the ice shelf.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3085302","Special Fund for High-Resolution Images Surveying and Mapping Application System(grant numbers:42-Y30B04-9001-19/21); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41871382,41971425); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444795","Amery ice shelf (AIS);crevasse;ICESat-2;satellite laser altimetry;three-dimensional (3-D) features","Licenses;Image edge detection;Visualization;Satellites;Monitoring;Surface topography;Remote sensing","glaciology;ice;optical images;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice","Amery ice shelf;ICESat-2 ATL06 data;ice shelf internal structure;three-dimensional features;crevasse edge points;fitted ice shelf surface;crevasse direction;size 400.0 m to 1600.0 m;size 2.0 m to 60.0 m","","2","","29","CCBY","1 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Sentinel-3 mission addresses these requirements by implementing and operating the following instruments, building on experience and heritage from the ERS and ENVISAT missions: •A dual frequency, delay-Doppler Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) instrument supported by a dual frequency passive microwave radiometer (MWR) for wet-tropospheric correction, and a Precise Orbit Determination package. This combined package provides measurements of sea-surface height and topography measurements over sea ice, ice sheets, rivers and lakes. •A highly sensitive Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) delivering multichannel wide-swath optical measurements for ocean and land surfaces. With 21 bands, compared to the 15 on Envisat's MERIS, a design optimised to minimise sun-glint and, a resolution of 300 m over all surfaces, OLCI marks a new generation of measurements over the ocean and land.

One of the reasons for this increased traffic is the lengthening of open water season, which is accompanied by increases in the area covered by intermediate ice concentrations' or marginal ice zones (MIZs). These regions are difficult to detect using passive microwave data. In this paper, we propose the use of deep learning for automatic detection of MIZs in the RADARSAT-2 satellite images. A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset is manually annotated to train, test and refine the method. Various convolutional neural network (CNN) models are evaluated as fixed feature extractors for the task of classification. To aid the classification accuracy we use a weighted binary cross-entropy loss criterion. Finally, to refine the segmentation process, we used a multi-scale patch technique.

The core of the method is a forward model which can ingest bulk data for seven geophysical parameters to reproduce the brightness temperatures observed by a passive microwave radiometer. The retrieval method inverts the forward model and produces ensembles of the seven parameters, wind speed, integrated water vapor, liquid water path, sea and ice temperature, sea ice concentration and multiyear ice fraction. The method is constrained using numerical weather prediction data in order to retrieve a set of geophysical parameters that best fit the measurements. A sensitivity study demonstrates the method is robust and that the solution it provides is not dependent on initialization conditions. The retrieval parameters have been compared with the Arctic Systems Reanalysis model data as well as columnar water vapor retrieved from satellite microwave sounders and the Remote Sensing Systems AMSR-E ocean retrieval product in order to determine the feasibility of using the same setup over pure surface with 100% and 0% sea ice cover, respectively. Sea ice concentration retrieval shows good skill for pure surface cases. Ice types retrieval is in good agreement with scatterometer backscatter data. Deficiencies have been identified in using the forward model over sea ice for retrieving atmospheric parameters, that are connected to the treatment of surface emissivity and surface temperature. The retrieval agrees well with legacy atmospheric retrieval products in open ocean areas.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2739858","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; International Research Training Group; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8027026","Arctic regions;atmospheric measurements;remote sensing;sea ice","Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Atmospheric modeling;Sea ice;Atmospheric measurements;Brightness temperature;Microwave radiometry","atmospheric techniques","optimal estimation algorithm;atmospheric parameter retrieval;passive microwave data;AMSR-E radiometer;passive microwave radiometer;wind speed;integrated water vapor;sea ice concentration;multiyear ice fraction;geophysical parameters;Arctic Systems Reanalysis model;Remote Sensing Systems;AMSR-E ocean retrieval product","","12","","18","IEEE","7 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They retrieve wind indirectly by measuring the normalized radar cross section (σ°) of the surface, and estimating the wind via geophysical model function relating σ° to the vector wind. The σ° measurements have proven to be remarkably capable in studies of the polar regions where they can map snow cover; detect the freeze/thaw state of forest, tundra, and ice; map and classify sea ice; and track icebergs. Further, a long time series of scatterometer σ° observations is available to support climate studies. In addition to fundamental scientific research, scatterometer data are operationally used for sea-ice mapping to support navigation. Scatterometers are, thus, invaluable tools for monitoring the polar regions. In this paper, a brief review of some of the polar applications of spaceborne wind scatterometer data is provided.

The multi-instrument inversion and data assimilation preprocessing system, artificial intelligence version, or MIIDAPS-AI for short, is valid for both polar and geostationary microwave and infrared sounders and imagers as well as for pairs of combined infrared and microwave sounders. The algorithm produces vertical profiles of temperature and moisture as well as surface temperature, surface emissivity, and cloud parameters. Additional products from hyperspectral infrared sensors include selected trace gases. From microwave sensors, additional products such as rainfall rate, first year/multiyear sea ice concentration, and soil moisture can be derived from primary products. The MIIDAPS-AI algorithm is highly efficient with no noticeable decrease in accuracy compared to traditional operational sounding algorithms. The automatically generated Jacobians from this deep-learning algorithm could provide an explainability mechanism to build trustworthiness in the algorithm, and to quantify uncertainties of the algorithm's outputs. The computation gain is estimated to be two orders of magnitude, which opens the door to either 1) process massively larger amounts of satellite data, or to 2) offer improvements in timeliness and significant saving in computing power (and therefore cost) if the same amount of data is processed.

In this paper, the measured underwater noise data over a year period from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019 (local time) in the Chukchi Plateau are presented and discussed to study the monthly and seasonal statistical characteristics of underwater noise. Due to the transient sound signals generated by sea-ice activities, the underwater noise spectrum levels have a greater fluctuation during ice-cover period, and there are a large number of discrete values in the upper part of the empirical probability density diagram of noise spectrum level, which have deviated from the main distribution areas of noise spectrum level. For temperature increasing and ice-melting, the ice concentration decreases rapidly with time in summer, and the sea surface of Chukchi Plateau is in ice-free conditions for a few months. During the open-water conditions, the underwater noise of Chukchi Plateau should be dominated by wind-generated noise and it is almost unaffected by transient sounds, therefore, there are few discrete values which can be discovered on the empirical probability density diagram of noise spectrum level. The mean and median values of noise spectrum levels of the four seasons have been studied and compared. The spring reaches the lowest level in mean and median values for the gradually rising temperature and lower wind speed, and it is considered to be the quietest season in a year in Arctic Ocean, which is in agreement with the view of Sagers and Ballard. The attenuation trends of the mean and median values with the increasing frequency in summer are different from that of the other three seasons. The other three seasons exhibit a steeper attenuation slope than summer. The median values of noise spectrum levels measured in this paper demonstrate a higher attenuation slope compared with the results of Sagers and Ballard. The measured underwater noise is dominated by wind-generated noise in summer, therefore, the attenuation law of median values with the increasing frequency in summer is compared with that of Wenz. The noise spectrum levels decrease 4 dB/octave with the increasing frequency between 630 Hz and 2 kHz in this paper, and the result of Wenz is approximately decreasing 5 dB/octave.","","978-1-7281-8190-5","10.1109/COA50123.2021.9519949","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519949","underwater noise;transient sound signals;statistical characteristics;ice concentration;Chukchi Plateau","Temperature measurement;Sea surface;Wind speed;Sea measurements;Attenuation;Market research;Noise measurement","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;sea ice;underwater sound;wind","wind-generated noise;empirical probability density diagram;mean values;median values;Chukchi Plateau;sea ice concentration;sea surface temperature;wind speed;measured underwater noise data;monthly characteristics;seasonal statistical characteristics;underwater noise spectrum levels;AD 2018 10 01 to 2019 09 30;transient sound signals;ice-cover period;ice-melting;ice-free conditions;Arctic Ocean;frequency 630.0 Hz to 2.0 kHz","","","","23","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scene covers an area with a length of more than 100 km and comprises both the marginal ice zone and, for the largest part, open water. The wave and wind field is retrieved from satellite at high spatial resolution using empirical retrieval algorithms. These algorithms are XWAVE and XMOD-2 specifically developed for X-Band SAR. XWAVE allows for determining the significant wave height not only for long swell waves, but also for short waves with their wave pattern being hardly visible from SAR. The latter is based on the analysis of image spectrum parameters and spectral noise. As well, the possibility of the imaging quality of longer waves visible from SAR being affected by SAR-specific nonlinear imaging effects is narrowed down. Both the wave and wind field are found to exhibit considerable spatial variability, and their relationship is analyzed.

This framework is based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Post-Classification Comparison (PCC) to detect the multitemporal variations using SCATSAT-1 images (sigma-naught, gamma-naught, and brightness temperature). For validation purposes, the classified maps and change maps are compared with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) derived SIE and SWE polar gridded datasets.

PREFIRE will fly a pair of small CubeSat satellites to probe a little-studied portion of the radiant energy emitted by Earth for clues about Arctic warming, sea ice loss and ice-sheet melting. Two miniaturized Thermal Infrared Spectrometers (TIRS) on two CubeSat satellites, are based on technology previously flown on the Mars Climate Sounder, an instrument on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The CubeSats will orbit Earth's poles to measure far-infrared emissions and how they change throughout the day and over seasons. By building, characterizing, and operating, TIRS payloads in two different polar orbits, the PREFIRE mission has potential impact on NASA in these focus areas through (1) Quantification of the influence of variable surface conditions on Arctic and Antarctic thermal emission, (2) Estimation of the impact of atmospheric constituents on the polar greenhouse effect, and, (3) Determination of the impacts of variations in far-infrared emissivity and greenhouse effect on ice sheet melt and sea level rise. The observations will allow scientists to assess how changes in thermal infrared emissions at the top of Earth's atmosphere are related to changes in cloud cover and surface conditions below.

The emissivities are colocated with GPM's dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) surface backscatter measurements in clear-sky conditions. The emissivity-backscatter database is used to characterize surfaces within the GPM orbit for precipitation retrieval algorithms and other applications. The full 10-166-GHz emissivity vector is retrieved using optimal estimation. Since GMI includes water vapor sounding channels, retrieval of the atmospheric and surface states are performed simultaneously. Using the MERRA2 reanalysis as the a priori atmospheric state and with proper characterization of its error, we are able to effectively screen for cloud- and precipitation-affected emissivities. Comparisons with colocated CloudSat data show that this GMI-based screen is able to detect precipitation that DPR alone does not; however, about 10% of precipitation occurrence from CloudSat is still undetected by GMI. The unsupervised Kohonen classification technique was then applied to multiyear monthly 0.25° gridded mean retrieved emissivities and backscatter distinctly for snow-free, snow-covered, and sea ice surfaces in order to classify surfaces based on both active and passive microwave characteristics. The classes correspond to vegetation coverage and type, inundation zones, soil composition, and terrain roughness. Snow and sea ice surfaces show clear seasonal cycles representing the increase in snow and ice spatial extent and reduction in the spring.

The InSAR method provides improved accuracy particularly in the slow-moving interior of the ice sheets at higher resolution but requires crossing satellite acquisitions as well as image pairs with adequate coherence. On zones without crossing orbits our processing line uses the velocity vector derived from INSAR and flow direction from OT to optimally fill in gaps. Fast moving areas where coherence is not preserved are filled with OT velocity observations. The added value of the new ice velocity maps is assessed by intercomparison with operational ice velocity products and in-situ GPS data.

However, in sea ice drift velocity measurements, only a Doppler centroid estimation algorithm in frequency domain has been studied, so whether there is a better algorithm is worth exploring. In this study, based on Sentinel-1A IW data, three Doppler centroid estimation algorithms applied to ocean current retrieval are selected. Combined with the characteristics of the TOPS mode, made two applicability adjustments to each algorithm, and finally applied the three algorithms to sea ice radial surface velocity measurements. The first adjustment is to explore and determine the optimal parameters. The second adjustment is to use parallel computing to improve the efficiency, which is improved by an average of 43.55%. In addition, the deviation of Doppler centroid estimation bias correction is verified using rainforest data, and the deviation is controlled at approximately 3 Hz. Based on the three algorithms, five sets of experiments are carried out in this study. By analyzing and comparing the results of each algorithm, it is found that the results of the three algorithms are relatively consistent, among which the correlation Doppler estimation algorithm has the advantages of high efficiency and high precision and is the most suitable method for sea ice drift measurement among the three methods. However, for SAR images with abnormal speckles caused by human activities, the sign Doppler estimation algorithm can effectively remove abnormal speckles and ensure the smoothness of the image with better adaptability.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3241978","Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2022MD002); Marine Project(grant numbers:2205cxzx040431); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC2803300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10035958","Sentinel-1A;sea ice drift measurement;radial surface velocity;Doppler centroid estimation","Sea ice;Doppler effect;Estimation;Sea surface;Sea measurements;Velocity measurement;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","","","","CCBY","3 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The primary instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which measured the distance from the spacecraft to the earth's surface via the roundtrip travel time of individual laser pulses. GLAS utilized pulsed lasers and a direct detection receiver consisting of a silicon avalanche photodiode and a waveform digitizer. Early in the mission, the peak power of the received signal from snow and ice surfaces was found to span a wider dynamic range than anticipated, often exceeding the linear dynamic range of the GLAS 1064-nm detector assembly. The resulting saturation of the receiver distorted the recorded signal and resulted in range biases as large as ~50 cm for ice- and snow-covered surfaces. We developed a correction for this “saturation range bias” based on laboratory tests using a spare flight detector, and refined the correction by comparing GLAS elevation estimates with those derived from Global Positioning System surveys over the calibration site at the salar de Uyuni, Bolivia. Applying the saturation correction largely eliminated the range bias due to receiver saturation for affected ICESat measurements over Uyuni and significantly reduced the discrepancies at orbit crossovers located on flat regions of the Antarctic ice sheet.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2702126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990535","Ice sheets;laser ranging;lidar;remote sensing;satellite laser altimetry","Optical surface waves;Measurement by laser beam;Receivers;Surface emitting lasers;Detectors;Ice","geophysical signal processing;glaciology;Global Positioning System;height measurement;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice;snow;vegetation","ICESAT-GLAS altimetry measurement;signal dynamic range;saturation correction;NASA Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite;AD 2003;AD 2009;satellite-based global lidar measurement;Earth ice sheet elevations;sea-ice thickness;vegetation canopy structure;Geoscience Laser Altimeter System;spacecraft;laser pulses;silicon avalanche photodiode;waveform digitizer;GLAS 1064-nm detector;ice-covered surfaces;snow-covered surfaces;spare flight detector;GLAS elevation estimation;Global Positioning System surveys;salar de Uyuni;Bolivia;ICESat measurements;Antarctic ice sheet","","20","","29","OAPA","25 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This letter aims to provide a higher resolution MPF product, derived by using 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz  $T_{\mathrm {B}}\text{s}$  at H-polarization instead of the 6.9 GHz  $T_{\mathrm {B}}$  H-polarization in the GR calculation. For GR(10/89)- and GR(18/89)-based MPF retrievals, the difference standard deviations were ~3.8%. This is lower than the ~14.3% standard deviation of the GR(23/89)-, GR(36/89)-, and PR(89)-based MPF retrievals. Our results suggest that the GR(10/89) and (18/89) MPF retrievals are available at a product quality similar to the original GR(6/89)-based MPF retrieval. We recommend that the GR(18/89) MPF retrieval adopted is used in nearshore environments such as in the CAA.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2020.3038888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284577","Advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E);AMSR2;Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA);melt pond fraction (MPF);melt season;passive microwave;sea ice","Standards;Spatial resolution;Microwave radiometry;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Sea ice;Arctic","","","","","","14","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current global ionospheric TEC maps (GIMs) have limited spatial and temporal resolutions and accuracy due to lack of GNSS observations over oceans, polar caps, and inaccessible terrains. Our analysis of Spire Global’s CubeSat data indicates that coherent GNSS signals reflected off sea ice, inland water bodies, and calm ocean surface can be processed to achieve cm-level precision carrier phase estimations. Signal coherency is especially prevalent over sea ice where 41.7% reflections are coherent, compared to 4.3% in the overall dataset. This article presents the methodology to estimate slant TEC along the reflection signal ray path using coherent dual-frequency GNSS-R pseudoranage and carrier phase estimations obtained from low-cost CubeSats. The methodology is applied to Spire Global’s CubeSat data. The results show that the slant TEC retrieved from GNSS-R measurements and from GIM follow a similar trend. Moreover, the GNSS-R-based TEC time series offer a nearly “frozen in time” observation of the ionospheric structures due to the rapid scan velocity of GNSS-R rays across the ionosphere. The study demonstrates the potential of GNSS-R observations to fill the data gaps over the polar regions where space weather activities and TEC disturbances are most frequent and intense. Potential error sources and mitigation techniques are also discussed.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3093328","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) Space Environment Exploitation (SEE) Program(grant numbers:DI 9AC00009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481931","Coherent reflection;global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R);ionosphere;ionospheric disturbance;ocean;phase delay altimetry;sea ice;total electron content (TEC);TEC mapping","Global navigation satellite system;CubeSat;Sea measurements;Extraterrestrial measurements;Phase measurement;Ionosphere;Sea ice","ionospheric disturbances;ionospheric techniques;reflectometry;satellite navigation;spaceborne radar;total electron content (atmosphere)","GNSS-R observations;TEC disturbances;space-borne coherent GNSS-R measurements;coherent global navigation satellite system reflectometry measurements;low earth orbits;data source;ionospheric disturbance observations;current global ionospheric TEC maps;GNSS observations;Spire Global's CubeSat data;coherent GNSS signals;sea ice;cm-level precision carrier phase estimations;signal coherency;slant TEC;reflection signal ray path;low-cost CubeSats;GNSS-R-based TEC time series;ionospheric structures;GNSS-R rays","","6","","44","IEEE","13 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using UAS, the resolution and precision of the tracking can be locally improved. To track the large amount of individual objects present in an area as large as the Arctic, it is necessary to efficiently select and exclusively work with the objects in the relevant field-of-view.

Owing to the geometrical interaction between microwaves and the imaged targets, the rates at which intensities decay depend on the nature of the targets, thus rendering single-rate image correction approaches only partially successful. The decay, also known as the incidence angle effect, impacts the segmentation of wide-swath images performed on absolute intensity values. We propose to integrate the target-specific intensity decay rates into a nonstationary statistical model, for use in a fully automatic and unsupervised segmentation algorithm. We demonstrate this concept by assuming Gaussian distributed log-intensities and linear decay rates, a fitting approximation for the smooth systematic decay observed for extended flat targets. The segmentation is performed on Sentinel-1, Radarsat-2, and UAVSAR wide-swath scenes containing open water, sea ice, and oil slicks. As a result, we obtain segments connected throughout the entire incidence angle range, thus overcoming the limitations of modeling that does not account for different per-target decays. The model simplicity also allows for short execution times and presents the segmentation approach as a potential operational algorithm. In addition, we estimate the log-linear decay rates and examine their potential for a physical interpretation of the segments.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2993067","Statoil and the Arctic University of Norway; CIRFA; Norges Forskningsråd(grant numbers:237906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9103275","Image segmentation;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Surface topography;Sea surface;Image segmentation;Sea ice;Remote sensing;Backscatter;Earth","approximation theory;Gaussian distribution;image segmentation;pattern clustering;radar computing;radar imaging;signal detection;synthetic aperture radar;unsupervised learning","smooth systematic decay;extended flat targets;UAVSAR wide-swath scenes;single-rate image correction rendering;wide-swath image segmentation;fitting approximation;Sentinel-1;Radarsat-2;open water;sea ice;Gaussian distributed log-intensities;unsupervised segmentation algorithm;fully automatic segmentation algorithm;nonstationary statistical model;target-specific intensity decay rates;absolute intensity values;incidence angle effect;imaged targets;geometrical interaction;implicit intensity decay;incidence angles;signal acquisition;synthetic aperture radar systems;SAR images;clustering-based segmentation;incidence angle dependencies;log-linear decay rates;per-target decays","","8","","35","CCBY","28 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In previous thin-ice thickness algorithms, ice thickness is estimated by utilizing a negative correlation between ice thickness and polarization ratio (PR) of AMSR-E. However, in these thin-ice algorithms, the relationship has large dispersion. We consider that the problem is caused by not taking account of ice type. We classified thin-ice regions around Antarctica into two ice types: 1) active frazil, comprising frazil and open water and 2) thin solid ice, areas of the relatively uniform thin ice, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data. For each ice type, we examined the relationship between the AMSR-E PR of 36 GHz and ice thickness, showing that the active frazil type has a much smaller thickness than the thin solid ice type for the same PR. The two ice types can be discriminated by a simple linear discriminant method in the plane of the PR and gradient ratio of AMSR-E, with the misclassification of 3%. From these results, we propose a new thin-ice algorithm. The two ice types are classified by the linear discriminant method, and then empirical equations are used to obtain the ice thickness for each ice type. This algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of the thin-ice thickness.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2853590","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(grant numbers:17H01157,17H06317); Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency(grant numbers:RA1W403); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424412","Antarctic coastal polynya;frazil ice;passive microwave;thin-ice thickness","Ice thickness;Sea ice;Microwave FET integrated circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Microwave theory and techniques;Sea measurements","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radiometry;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","sea-ice production;thin-ice thickness algorithms;thin-ice regions;relatively uniform thin ice;solid ice type;AMSR-E passive microwave data;microwave radiometers;Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System;ocean thermohaline circulation;Antarctica;uniform thin ice;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data;active frazil type;thin solid ice type;simple linear discriminant method;empirical equations;frequency 36.0 GHz","","18","","53","IEEE","2 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Measurement of ice-surface heights with a spatial and temporal resolution that not only allows elevation-change calculation, but also captures ice-surface morphology and its changes is required to aid in investigations of the geophysical processes associated with glacial acceleration. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System aboard NASA's future ICESat-2 Mission (launch 2017) will implement multibeam micropulse photon-counting lidar altimetry aimed at measuring ice-surface heights at 0.7-m along-track spacing. The instrument is designed to resolve spatial and temporal variability of rapidly changing glaciers and ice sheets and the Arctic sea ice. The new technology requires the development of a new mathematical algorithm for the retrieval of height information. We introduce the density-dimension algorithm (DDA) that utilizes the radial basis function to calculate a weighted density as a form of data aggregation in the photon cloud and considers density an additional dimension as an aid in autoadaptive threshold determination. The autoadaptive capability of the algorithm is necessary to separate returns from noise and signal photons under changing environmental conditions. The algorithm is evaluated using data collected with an ICESat-2 simulator instrument, the Slope Imaging Multi-polarization Photon-counting Lidar, over the heavily crevassed Giesecke Brær in Northwestern Greenland in summer 2015.

This can be exploited to design a matched filter to detect sea-targets in a DDM sequence without the requirement for any (pre)detection and can be considered a track-before-detect technique. In this article, such a filter is developed and applied to DDMs collected by TechDemoSat-1, and the detection of sea-ice is demonstrated. A frequency analysis of simulated and actual DDM sequences containing a sea-target is carried out. We show that the stationary sea-clutter is bound to the zero time-frequency plane in the 3-D frequency response of the DDM time series, while only $\approx $ 13.8% of the target's energy is located in this plane. This finding motivates the application of an adaptive whitening filter to blindly suppress the temporally correlated clutter in the DDM sequence before applying the matched filter to the prewhitened sequence containing a spatially fixed point-like response arising from the edge of an ice sheet, which is equivalent to a point-like sea-target such as a ship. This results in a signal-to-clutter ratio of $\approx $ 12 dB being achieved when processing only the weak target responses at nonspecular locations originating from the spatially fixed edge of the ice sheet. This is the first technique to exploit the delay and Doppler dynamics of a target to obtain a coherent integration gain.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.2973142","Australian Government through the Research Training Program; ARC-funded “ARC Training Center for CubeSats, UAVs, and Their Applications”(grant numbers:IC170100023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016366","Blind clutter suppression;global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R);matched filtering;multiframe detection;reflectometry;sea-ice;sea-target detection;TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1)","Delays;Doppler effect;Receivers;Clutter;Satellites;Sea ice;Sea surface","adaptive filters;Doppler radar;filtering theory;matched filters;object detection;oceanographic techniques;radar clutter;radar detection;radar signal processing;reflectometry;satellite navigation;time-frequency analysis","spaceborne global navigation satellite system-reflectometry receiver;realistic sea-targets;matched filter;track-before-detect technique;sea-ice;simulated DDM sequences;actual DDM sequences;stationary sea-clutter;zero time-frequency plane;DDM time series;adaptive whitening filter;prewhitened sequence;weak target responses;spaceborne GNSS-R based sea-target detection;potential sea-targets;TechDemoSat-1;3D frequency response","","13","","36","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Probability of the presence of ice within 2.05 km  $\times2.05$  km areas is modeled using a form of logistic regression as a function of the difference between the wind speeds estimated from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and those obtained from numerical weather prediction short-term forecasts, the spatial correlation between HH and HV backscatter signals, and the spatial standard deviation of the wind speed estimated from SAR. The resulting ice probability model was built based on thousands of SAR images and corresponding Canadian Ice Service (CIS) Image Analysis products covering all seasons and all Canadian and adjacent Arctic regions being monitored by CIS. Extensive verification of the proposed technique was conducted for an entire year (2013) against independent Image Analysis products and Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System ice extent products.

This process, similar to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging systems, reduces the along-track resolution down to the theoretical limit equal to half the antenna length. We call this the fully focused SAR (FF-SAR) altimetry processing. The technique is directly applicable to SAR altimetry missions such as CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, or Sentinel-6/Jason-CS. The footprint of an FF-SAR altimeter measurement is a narrow strip on the surface, which is pulse limited across track and SAR focused along track. Despite the asymmetry of the altimeter footprint, the fully focused technique may be useful for applications in which one needs to separate specific targets within highly heterogeneous scenes, such as in the case of sea ice lead detection, hydrology, and coastal altimetry applications. In addition, over rough homogeneous surfaces, such as the ocean or ice sheets, the improved multilooking capability of FF-SAR leads to a significant increase in the effective number of looks with respect to the delay/Doppler processing, resulting in better geophysical parameter estimation. The proposed processing technique was verified by processing full bit rate CryoSat-2 SAR mode data over the Svalbard transponder. Hydrology, sea ice, and open ocean applications are also demonstrated in this paper, showing the improvement of this technique with respect to conventional and delay/Doppler altimetry.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2607122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579570","Altimetry;delay/Doppler altimetry;SAR altimetry;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Altimetry;Radar tracking;Spaceborne radar;Satellites;Radar imaging","Doppler radar;geophysical signal processing;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","fully focused coherent pulse echo processing;nadir-looking pulse-limited radar altimeter;synthetic aperture radar;SAR imaging system;antenna length;fully focused SAR altimetry processing;SAR altimetry mission;Sentinel-3;Sentinel-6-Jason-CS;sea ice lead detection;hydrology;coastal altimetry;ocean;ice sheet;CryoSat-2 SAR mode data;Svalbard transponder;delay-Doppler altimetry","","51","","30","OAPA","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to carry out these studies, it is necessary to delimit accurately the icebergs in satellite images, mainly of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) type. The Adaptive Canny method has shown to be efficient for the detection of edges of objects in SAR images, according to recent publications and conferences. These studies were only carried out for images that had approximately half of each backscatter, without considering that the dimension of the objects can affect the edge detection process. Here, we present the results of the efficiency of the Adaptive Canny method as the size of the object, from which it is intended to extract the contour, decreases. A systematic analysis of the behavior of the method has been performed with objects of variated dimensions, through a Monte Carlo type experiment with synthetic images, where the contours of the figures were extracted with the Adaptive Canny method and compared with the Ground Truth (GT). Then, the method was tested on real images of the Antarctic Ocean, with blocks of ice of different sizes to contrast the results with those obtained with synthetic images.","","978-1-7281-4350-7","10.1109/LAGIRS48042.2020.9165572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9165572","Iceberg;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar;edge detection","Image edge detection;Synthetic aperture radar;Ice;Meters;Satellites;Backscatter;Sea surface;Climate change","edge detection;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;Monte Carlo methods;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","open sea;satellite images;SAR images;adaptive Canny method;icebergs detection;polar regions;contour extraction;Monte Carlo type experiment;ground truth;antarctic ocean","","","","16","IEEE","12 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At present, quantification of frontal position change primarily relies on time-consuming and subjective manual mapping techniques, limiting our ability to understand changes to glacier calving fronts. Here we describe a newly developed automated method of mapping glacier calving fronts in satellite imagery using observations from a representative sample of Greenland’s peripheral marine-terminating glaciers. Our method is adapted from the 2-D wavelet transform modulus maxima (WTMM) segmentation method, which has been used previously for image segmentation in biomedical and other applied science fields. The gradient-based method places edge detection lines along regions with the greatest intensity gradient in the image, such as the contrast between glacier ice and water or glacier ice and sea ice. The lines corresponding to the calving front are identified using thresholds for length, average gradient value, and orientation that minimize the misfit with respect to a manual validation data set. We demonstrate that the method is capable of mapping glacier calving fronts over a wide range of image conditions (light to intermediate cloud cover, dim or bright, mélange presence, etc.). With these time series, we are able to resolve subseasonal to multiyear temporal patterns as well as regional patterns in glacier frontal position change.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3053235","NASA ROSES Cryospheric Grants(grant numbers:80NSSC18K1228,80NSSC19K0976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9349100","Computational infrastructure;Cryosphere;geographic information systems (GIS);optical data","Ice;Image segmentation;Remote sensing;Earth;Artificial satellites;Wavelet transforms;Image edge detection","edge detection;glaciology;ice;image segmentation;remote sensing;sea ice;wavelet transforms","automated detection;marine glacier calving fronts;2-D wavelet transform modulus maxima segmentation method;calving front position;ice caps;ice sheets;subjective manual mapping techniques;newly developed automated method;Greenland's peripheral marine-terminating glaciers;image segmentation;gradient-based method;edge detection lines;glacier ice;mapping glacier;glacier frontal position change","","4","","38","CCBY","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We combined the ascending and descending DDInSAR images to figure out the direction of the true displacement over the anomaly. As a result, the circular anomaly appears mainly to be a vertical movement, not in the flow direction.

These signals can be processed as a radar scatterometer, as a radar altimeter, or as an unfocused synthetic aperture radar. GNSS-R has shown its potential to infer numerous geophysical variables: over land soil moisture, vegetation height, detection of freeze-thaw state, etc., map sea ice extent and type…, and over the ocean wind speed and direction, significant wave height, altimetric measurements or even more recently NASA has released a marine plastics litter product, and some also claim that sea surface salinity (SSS) can be inferred. In addition, retrieval algorithms neglect some of the variations of the delay Doppler map (DDM) that are linked to the observation geometry, i.e., look angle with respect to the speed vectors of the transmitter and receiver. All these different effects impact the DDM peak value and its shape, and may affect the retrieval of geophysical parameters, and ultimately the data interpretation. In this study, the following factors impacting the DDM peak value are studied: the observation geometry, the sea surface temperature, and SSS, the 10 m height wind speed (U10) and direction (WD), the presence of foam, the sea development state, the presence of swell, currents, rain, and the presence of oil slicks perturbing the sea surface roughness.

Delay waveform (DW) and delay-Doppler map (DDM) are the main observables in GNSS-R simulation, and are usually effects by the complex ocean environment, such as wind and swell. Besides the effects of wind, this article focuses on analyzing the influence of swell on the simulation of GNSS-R. In this article, a complex model of DW and DDM is presented with effects of swell. Swell modeled here by narrow-band Gaussian spectrum, and the influence of swell on the sea surface scattering coefficient, which can be calculated using Kirchhoff approximation-geometric optics. Observables obtained from the simulation in the space-borne scene are analyzed. The simulation results show that swell has a stable and significant impact on the simulation of GNSS-R observables.

On the trails of these missions, recent studies showed that microwave radiometers operating at even lower frequencies (P-band) can provide new information for cryospheric and ocean science and improve the current understanding of Earth processes. In particular, experimental airborne campaigns were conducted in both Artic and Antarctica, within the NASA's UWBRAD project, by using a wide band radiometer operating in the range 0.5-2 GHz, aimed at investigating the temperature profiles of ice sheets and the sea ice thickness. By leveraging the results of UWBRAD system, a new mission concept was proposed to ESA Earth Explorer 10 and 11 (called CryoRad) and NASA EVI-6 (called PolarRad) featuring a spacebome 0.4-2 GHz nadir-looking microwave radiometer for the monitoring of polar regions. Even though the main goals of all these sensors are related to observables such as soil moisture, ocean salinity, and geophysical parameters of the cryosphere, all of them suffer from the emission due the atmosphere. In the spectral range comprised between 0.5 and 2 GHz the atmosphere is considered almost transparent, being the major contributions to the emission due to the water vapor (in both physical phases) and to the molecular oxygen, however a clear assessment is still lacking in literature. The aim of this paper is to provide an accurate estimate of the atmospheric effect on measured TB from space at low frequency for different climate scenario by using a combination of in-situ data (i.e. radio-sounding) and microwave emission model.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-0369-6","10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9554138","Microwave radiometry;atmospheric emission;water vapor;liquid content","Earth;Microwave measurement;Microwave integrated circuits;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Satellite broadcasting;NASA","atmospheric composition;atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation;atmospheric humidity;glaciology;radiometry;sea ice","atmospheric emission;low microwave frequencies;site-based analysis;L-band passive microwave radiometer satellites;Earth Observation;microwave radiometers;P-band;cryospheric;ocean science;Earth processes;particular campaigns;experimental airborne campaigns;NASA's UWBRAD project;wide band radiometer;temperature profiles;ice sheets;sea ice thickness;UWBRAD system;mission concept;ESA Earth Explorer 10;NASA EVI-6;ocean salinity;spectral range;atmospheric effect;microwave emission model;nadir-looking microwave radiometer;CryoRad;frequency 0.5 GHz to 2.0 GHz;frequency 0.4 GHz to 2.0 GHz","","","","13","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Decades of satellite, airborne, and ground observations show clear evidence of increased melting of glaciers and ice sheets, declines in sea ice, and decreasing spring snow cover. This increased melting of cryosphere cover makes Earth more absorptive of sunlight and moves enormous volumes of stored water from frozen state to liquid, raising sea level and changing water availability to large populations. However, the distribution of forcings controlling this accelerated melting is poorly known. Atmospheric warming from greenhouse gases is contributing to this acceleration but its magnitude is uncertain due to our uncertainties in the controls on the dominant contributor to annual melt, absorbed sunlight, itself controlled by albedo. Despite this crucial role of albedo and solar radiation in snow and ice melt, sparse measurements have kept us from understanding the global distribution of controls on albedo, grain size and impurities, and from accurately modeling melt processes worldwide. Such an understanding is crucial to determining cryosphere melt and projecting its future behavior. Global spectroscopic measurements are required to improve our understanding of controls on cryosphere melt rates, enabling better predictions of future changes that will affect humankind.","2153-7003","978-1-5090-4951-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2017.8127647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8127647","Snowmelt;glacier melt;imaging spectroscopy;energy balance;global","Snow;Ice;Spectroscopy;Uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Climate change","albedo;atmospheric composition;atmospheric temperature;climatology;glaciology;ice;melting;sea ice;snow","sea ice;spring snow cover;cryosphere cover;stored water;frozen state;sea level;annual melt;absorbed sunlight;albedo;global distribution;global spectroscopic measurements;cryosphere melt rates;imaging spectroscopy;cryospheric melting;global retreat;climate change;ground observations;ice sheets;melting;melt processes;Water availability","","","","8","IEEE","4 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its formation and persistence are due to the combined effect of katabatic winds, regional ice conditions, and the Drygalski Ice Tongue (DIT). The combined effect of these elements arranges a delicate balance in TNB. To evaluate the interacting elements, we focused our attention on the DIT, one of the largest ice tongues in Antarctica. The DIT is a 70-km long tongue, which juts out like a pier from the icy land into northern McMurdo Sound of Antarctica's Ross Dependency. The analysis presented in this article was carried out using Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) images. The methodology developed for the analysis consists of three steps: 1) DIT shape enhancement, 2) fuzzy Bayesian segmentation which associates the analyzed set of pixels with a binary label field, and 3) parametric representation of the shape of the DIT to compare the area of the ice tongue as it was 12 years ago and as it is today. The computed mean value of the DIT surface velocity was 703 m y$^{-1}$. To estimate the closeness of the derived parameter to the true value, using a statistical approach, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean value is 703$\pm$4.236 m y$^{-1}$. Our analysis confirms a trend of advance. That is, after the significant calving events of the tongue in 2005 and 2006, the DIT has resumed its normal growth, and its length has increased by 12% in the last 12 years.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3205560","ASI (Italian Space Agency); “COSMO-SkyMed Open Call for Science Initiative”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9882966","Ice;image segmentation;remote sensing;synthetic aperture imaging","Ice;Tongue;Remote sensing;Antarctica;Earth;Shape;Image segmentation","Bayes methods;geophysical image processing;glaciology;hydrological techniques;image segmentation;oceanographic regions;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","parametric representation;binary label field;fuzzy Bayesian segmentation;DIT shape enhancement;Antarctica Ross Dependency;DIT surface velocity;Cosmo-SkyMed images;northern McMurdo Sound;long tongue;regional ice conditions;TNB;Terra Nova Bay polynya;coastal polynya;Drygalski Ice Tongue;area variation;time 12.0 year;size 70 km","","","","48","CCBY","9 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By measuring the time of flight, pointing angle, and absolute position for individual photons, ICESat-2 provides detailed elevation measurements of earth's surface. Calculating accurate and precise elevations requires an understanding of how photons interact with surfaces, and characterization of the photon distribution after returning from surfaces. Neither MABEL nor ATLAS records the transmitted laser pulse shape, relying instead on aggregating several pulses worth of photons, often using histograms, to characterize the pulse shape. In this paper, we assess the limitations of using histograms and propose a more robust method to describe MABEL's system impulse-response function using an exponentially modified Gaussian distribution. We also provide standard error estimates for the arithmetic mean and standard deviation calculations, and for exponentially modified Gaussian parameters using a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. We apply this method to photon returns from a sea ice lead and from a dry salt lake bed as case studies for estimating the standard error associated with sample size for the arithmetic mean and standard deviation, and for the exponentially modified Gaussian parameters. We use these standard errors to calculate the minimum number of photons required to find both Gaussian and exponentially modified Gaussian distribution parameters within 3 cm of their parent population values.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2907230","Goddard Space Flight Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8697143","Data processing;Ice;Cloud;land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2);laser altimetry;Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental LiDAR (MABEL);photoncounting","Photonics;Measurement by laser beam;Shape;Histograms;Surface emitting lasers;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness","altimeters;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;photon counting;remote sensing by laser beam;sea ice","exponentially modified Gaussian parameters;sea ice lead;arithmetic mean;exponentially modified Gaussian distribution;system impulse response function;photon-counting LiDAR data;aircraft-based photon-counting laser altimeter;measurement techniques;Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System;ATLAS;sole instrument;time of flight;individual photons;photon distribution;transmitted laser pulse shape;histograms;standard deviation calculations;Earth surface;MABEL system impulse-response function;NASA ICESat-2 mission;NASA Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental LiDAR","","6","","26","IEEE","23 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The algorithm is based on the segmentation and nonparametric constant false alarm rate (SnP-CFAR) approach. Unlike in parametric CFAR detection, in our method, there is no need to define target, guard, and background areas explicitly. Instead, we apply the CFAR detection to the pixels within each detected segment and the background is formed of the nearby pixels not included in the target segment. By using nonparametric background probability density function (PDF) estimates, we also eliminate the need of assuming a specific type of a background PDF. We compared the detection results with the operational Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) Gamma-CFAR algorithm results.

Two Saildrones funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), SD-1036 and SD-1037, were equipped with infrared (IR) radiation pyrometers in a “unicorn” structure on the deck for the determination of the ocean sea surface skin temperature (SST $_{\mathrm {skin}}$ ).

After stringent quality control of data and eliminating measurements influenced by sea ice and precipitation, and restricting the acceptable tilt angles of the USV based on radiative transfer simulations, SSTskin can be derived to an accuracy of approximately 0.12 K. The error budget of the derived SSTskin is developed, and the largest component comes from the instrumental uncertainties, assuming that the viewing geometry is adequately determined. Thus, Saildrones equipped with these sensors could provide sufficiently accurate SSTskin retrievals for studying the physics of the thermal skin effect, in conjunction with accurate subsurface thermometer measurements, and for validating satellite-derived SSTskin fields at high latitudes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3231519","National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) contribution to the National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) Multi-sensor Improved Sea-Surface Temperature (MISST) project, Lead PI: Dr. Chelle Gentemann, The Farallon Institute(grant numbers:80NSSC20K0768); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996427","Arctic;infrared (IR) radiometer;Saildrone;sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin)","Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;Sea measurements;Skin;Sea surface;Atmospheric measurements;Sensors","ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;pyrometers;quality control;radiative transfer;radiometers;radiometry;remote sensing;sea ice;temperature measurement;thermometers","150-day cruises;accurate subsurface thermometer measurements;Arctic Ocean;atmospheric measurements;Bering Strait;Chukchi Sea;Dutch Harbor;eliminating measurements;high latitude Sea surface skin temperatures derived;infrared radiation pyrometers;ocean sea surface skin temperature;oceanographic measurements;precipitation;radiative transfer simulations;Saildrone infrared measurements;Saildrones;satellite-derived SSTskin fields;SD-1036;SD-1037;sea ice;sufficiently accurate SSTskin retrievals;temperature 0.12 K;thermal skin effect;USV","","1","","54","CCBY","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, we outline a methodology for identifying scatterers at known angles from multichannel imagery by aligning our measurements to an independent fine-resolution satellite-derived digital elevation model of the Arctic that extends beyond the swath of the SAR. We adopt a support statistic based on our partial knowledge of the array response to identify approximately single-source measurements in our scenes. This technique is a departure from traditional approaches to the sounder array characterization problem that require measurements of flat, specular surface reflections from a maneuvering platform. We aggregate observations of single sources and measure manifold corrections relative to our nominal model from the principal eigenvector of our array covariance. We demonstrate the application of three measured manifolds in tomography and compare performance to a nominal manifold that assumes isotropic radiators and known array geometry.

GNSS-R has demonstrated its potential to infer numerous geophysical variables over land (soil moisture, vegetation height, detecting freeze-thaw states … ), over the ocean (wind speed and direction, significant wave height, sea surface altimetry … ), over sea ice (extent, depth, type … ). Even a marine plastics litter product has been recently released by NASA, and some have suggested that sea surface salinity could also be inferred.

Since SAR sensors are side-looking, it is the vector sum of both the vertical and horizontal components along the line of sight (LOS) that can be measured, creating some ambiguity in separating the two elements. Impacted by ocean tides and inverse barometer effect (IBE), ice shelves are subject to a vertical bias to be removed.

"Inferring subglacial topography of the Emerald Icefalls (King George Island, Antarctica) from ice surface terrestrial laser scanning","M.

While there is a great progress in measurements of glacial surface, ice thickness measurements have limited coverage and are usually heavily interpolated. Still, there are some areas where typical remote sensing techniques fail because of adverse climatic conditions, mainly persistent cloud cover, and very steep topography. A perfect example of such feature are icefalls dominating landscapes of the maritime Antarctic. In order to close that gap, a simple method based on repeated terrestrial laser scanning of the ice surface is proposed. Based on such measurements, inverse Shallow Ice Approximation ice flow modelling was applied to infer the sub glacial topography of the Emerald Icefalls, King George Island. The icefalls were surveyed twice within 8 day period, allowing to perform feature tracking analysis and, hence, to derive surface ice flow velocity field. The measured flow velocities are spatially highly variable, suggesting the existence of four separated trunks. The estimated ice depths are low with the mean value of 30.3±8.3 m. Therefore, as suggested by previous studies, the overall ice flux of Emerald Icefalls is low despite relatively high surface ice flow velocities.","","978-1-5386-0740-4","10.1109/GRSS-CHILE.2017.7996014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7996014","Antarctica;cryosphere;glaciology;ice thickness;LiDAR;Terrestrial Laser Scanning","Surface topography;Ice thickness;Antarctica;Ice surface;Measurement by laser beam","sea ice","subglacial topography;ice surface terrestrial laser scanning;ice thickness measurements;glacial surface;remote sensing techniques;terrestrial laser scanning;inverse shallow ice approximation;ice flow modelling;King George Island;Emerald Icefalls","","1","","30","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, the interpretation is still performed manually by ice analysts due to the complexity of data and the difficulty of creating fine-level ground truth. To overcome these problems, a semi-supervised approach for ice-water classification based on self-training is presented. The proposed algorithm integrates the spatial context model, region merging, and the self-training technique into a single framework. The backscatter intensity, texture, and edge strength features are incorporated in a CRF model using multi-modality Gaussian model as its unary classifier. Region merging is used to build a hierarchical data-adaptive structure to make the inference more efficient. Self-training is concatenated with region merging, so that the spatial location information of the original training samples can be used. Our algorithm has been tested on a large-scale RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization dataset over the Beaufort and Chukchi sea, and the classification results are significantly better than the supervised methods without self-training.","2160-7516","978-1-4673-6759-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2015.7301380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7301380","","Training;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea ice;Merging;Backscatter;Accuracy","edge detection;geophysical image processing;image classification;image texture;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","semisupervised approach;ice-water classification;dual-polarization SAR satellite imagery;SAR sea ice imagery;ship navigation;climate monitoring;ice analysts;fine-level ground truth;spatial context model;region merging;self-training technique;backscatter intensity;edge strength features;CRF model;multimodality Gaussian model;unary classifier;hierarchical data-adaptive structure;spatial location information;training samples;large-scale RADARSAT-2 dual-polarization dataset;Beaufort Sea;Chukchi Sea","","7","","22","IEEE","26 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe the development of radar system hardware and its mounting onto a UAV, as well as initial tests with this radar as a snow measuring device. Preliminary results from both ground and airborne testing show that the radar system is capable of obtaining snow depth information that corresponds well to in situ validation data with a correlation of 0.87.

One line of evidence involves comparison with Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) observations, including the areas of low aerosol loading close to Antarctica. In this paper, a principal reason for the AOD overestimation is identified, which is stray light measured by the MISR cameras in dark regions of high-contrast scenes. A small fraction of the light from surrounding bright areas, such as clouds or sea ice, is redistributed to dark areas, artificially increasing their brightness. Internal reflections and light scattering from optical elements in MISR's pushbroom cameras contribute to this veiling light effect. A simple correction model is developed that relies on the average scene brightness and an empirically determined set of veiling light coefficients for each MISR camera and wavelength. Several independent methods are employed to determine these coefficients. Three sets of coefficients are further implemented and tested in prototype MISR 4.4-km AOD retrievals. The results show dramatic improvements in retrieved AODs compared against MAN observations and the currently operational V22 MISR retrievals. For the best performing set of coefficients, the bias is reduced by 51%, from 0.039 to 0.019, the RMSE is lowered by 19%, from 0.062 to 0.050, and 84% of retrievals fall within the uncertainty envelope compared with 66% of retrievals in V22.

However, the time resolution of satellite remote sensing is usually several days, which is inadequate to reveal the rapid change and calving process of polar glaciers. To detect the rapid response of polar glaciers, especially glacier front on various oceanic forcing, such as ocean tide, Terrestrial Radar Interferometry (TRI) has been introduced to detect the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), glacier velocity change and some more complicating glacier-ocean interaction processes. Here we show some typical applications of the TRI in glacier-ocean interaction study, which contributes to better understanding how ocean affecting glacier changes.

Thus, an approach that is interpretative in nature and applicable across polarimetric modes is required. In this context, the geodesic distance (GD)-based approach within the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) literature is seen as an eigenvalue-decomposition free approach to interpret and analyze quad PolSAR data. This approach is highly adaptive toward applications due to its ability to compare the SAR observation with a known scatterer/model, or with another SAR observation in general providing a means for direct interpretation. In this work, we show that the GD (originally defined for the quad polarization mode) is generalizable across any arbitrary SAR polarimetric mode while retaining its simple form for ready computation. We show that the GD-based approach provides level ground for comparison of different polarimetric modes given a fixed application. We demonstrate it using change detection as the chosen application. In addition, we show how the behavior of the three roll-invariant GD-based parameters change under different polarimetric modes (e.g., quad, dual, and compact polarization modes). We also discuss how the GD-based approach can also be adapted to ground range detected (GRD) product data, which is presently available from Sentinel-1 and widely used in many applications. However, in this case, we show that only one of the three GD-derived parameters can be defined. We believe this work will make the GD-based approach important for present and future PolSAR applications cutting across sensors and its available polarimetric modes.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3231932","Centre for Integrated Remote Sensing and Forecasting for Arctic Operations (CIRFA) and the Research Council of Norway (RCN)(grant numbers:237906); Visual Intelligence Centre for Research-based Innovation; RCN(grant numbers:309439); Automatic Multisensor remote sensing for Sea Ice Characterization (AMUSIC) Framsenteret “Polhavet” flagship(grant numbers:2020); IMPETUS project; European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(grant numbers:101037084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998571","Compact;dual;geodesic distance (GD);ground range detected (GRD);hybrid;NISAR;polarimetric mode;PolSAR;quad;Sentinel-1;twin","Synthetic aperture radar;Symmetric matrices;Sensors;Scattering;Manifolds;Level measurement;Data models","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;geophysical techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","arbitrary SAR polarimetric mode;available polarimetric modes;chosen application;compact polarization modes;different polarimetric modes;direct interpretation;eigenvalue-decomposition free approach;fixed application;future PolSAR applications;GD-based approach important;GD-derived parameters;generalized geodesic distance-based approach;polarimetric synthetic aperture radar literature;quad polarization mode;quad PolSAR data;roll-invariant GD-based parameters;SAR observation;synthetic aperture radar acquisition;traditional quad polarimetric mode","","","","48","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the quality level (QL) 3 MODIS SSTs are classified into cloudy or clear-sky pixels based on MODIS cloud mask products. The cloudy SST pixels, flagged as confident cloudy or probably cloudy in the cloud masks, are further classified into three groups according to their associated daytime cloud-top and optical properties. Taking the SSTs measured by 11 buoys over one year as the reference data, those three groups of cloudy SSTs are significantly underestimated, with biases of −33.45 °C, −6.35 °C, and −4.72 °C. The QL 3 clear-sky SSTs are identified as probably and confident clear in the cloud masks and are not influenced by clouds, with a bias of nearly 0 °C. Then, three support vector regression (SVR) models are individually proposed for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. Taking the cloud-top and optical parameters as inputs of the proposed SVR models, we can obtain SSTs with a bias of 0 °C and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 1.6 °C for the three groups of cloudy SSTs. The method proposed in this study shows the potential for TIR SST estimation under some cloudy conditions using satellite remote sensing cloud products. Considering the RMSE of 0.4 °C in operational sea surface temperature and sea ice analysis, further study is needed before actual applying the method proposed in this study.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3097505","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071337,41601390); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFC1504403,2018YFC1504503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497315","Clouds;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);sea surface temperature (SST);thermal infrared (TIR)","Clouds;Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement;MODIS;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Atmospheric measurements","clouds;ocean temperature;radiometry;remote sensing","cloud influence;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;SST retrieval;MODIS SSTs;clear-sky pixels;MODIS cloud mask products;cloudy SST pixels;confident cloudy;cloud masks;cloudy SSTs;QL 3 clear-sky SSTs;support vector regression models;TIR SST estimation;cloudy conditions;satellite remote sensing cloud products;operational sea surface temperature;sea ice analysis;cloud reduction;MODIS thermal;thermal infrared data sea surface temperature retrieval;daytime cloud-top;longwave SST retrieval;temperature -33.45 degC;temperature -6.35 degC;temperature -4.72 degC;temperature 1.6 degC;temperature 0.4 degC","","","","39","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the framework of the Copernicus program, the Sentinel-1 mission is the workhorse for acquiring systematically and providing routinely a large volume of C-band SAR data to the Copernicus services and the global scientific and commercial user community. As part of the Copernicus expansion, ESA completed the study phase for an L-band SAR mission (ROSE-L) last October 2019 and issued the corresponding Request for Proposal for the development of two spacecraft. On the other hand, the availability of high-resolution X-band data is ensured through national European SAR missions, such as TerraSAR-X, Cosmo-SkyMed and PAZ, which are referred to as Copernicus Contributing Missions. L-band SAR data are required for applications, such as surface deformation mapping, monitoring of cryosphere dynamics, sea-ice classification and land cover mapping, among others. As such, L-band data provide complementary information to C- and X-band data. Besides ESA's ROSE-L, Germany is perusing the implementation of the proposed Tandem-L mission, at national level. Recently, disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies have emerged on the EO market. This has triggered discussions on whether or to what extent smallSats can eventually replace or complement large institutional SAR missions. In this paper we provide the overview of the evolution of the Copernicus SAR Space Component: the Sentinel-1 Space Segment and the Spacecraft development status, the ROSE-L development approach and we also discuss the challenges for the evolution. its objectives and implementation, the systematic data acquisition strategy including coverage and revisit frequency, and the end-to-end SAR performance","2153-7003","978-1-7281-6374-1","10.1109/IGARSS39084.2020.9323149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9323149","Copernicus;Sentinel-1;ROSE-L;SAR","Europe;Orbits;Sea surface;Imaging;Systematics;Strain;L-band","data acquisition;geophysical techniques;marketing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","L-band SAR mission;high-resolution X-band data;national European SAR missions;commercial user community;Copernicus expansion;global scientific user community;Copernicus services;C-band SAR data;Sentinel-1 mission;Copernicus program;historical data;international cooperation;ESA's Earth Observation program;Copernicus Sentinel mission;end-to-end SAR performance;systematic data acquisition strategy;Spacecraft development status;Sentinel-1 Space Segment;Copernicus SAR Space Component;institutional SAR missions;EO market;disruptive NewSpace smallSat SAR companies;Tandem-L mission;ESA's ROSE-L;land cover mapping;sea-ice classification;surface deformation mapping;L-band SAR data;Copernicus Contributing Missions","","1","","4","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To distinguish sea targets from sea clutter, one can estimate the sea clutter and subtract it from the DDM, leaving behind only the sea target's signature on the DDM. This is computationally expensive and will not be robust when the sea clutter estimate is poor or if there are DD tracking errors. This article presents two blind methods for the suppression of sea clutter: first, an adaptive filter and second, an infinite impulse response low-pass filter. We use real DDMs collected by TechDemoSat-1 to show the autoregressive, hence temporally correlated nature of the DDM time series, and present evidence that two blind methods can suppress clutter at least as effectively as the existing method, albeit at a fraction of its computational cost.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2956183","Australian Government; ARC-funded(grant numbers:IC170100023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935537","Adaptive filtering;blind filtering;clutter suppression;global navigation satellite systems reflectometry (GNSS-R);reflectometry","Clutter;Adaptive filters;IIR filters;Time series analysis;Reflectometry;Global navigation satellite system","adaptive filters;geophysical signal processing;low-pass filters;object detection;oceanographic techniques;radar clutter;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;sea ice;transient response","delay-Doppler maps;sea clutter estimate;sea target;sea ice;spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry missions;spaceborne GNSS-r target detection;blind sea clutter suppression","","12","","24","IEEE","17 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we used ten-year measurements from Cloudsat radar and CALIPSO lidar to assess and characterize two convection diagnostics, namely, deep convection (DC) and convective overshooting (COV), derived from microwave humidity sounder measurements. When snow and sea ice-covered regions, such as Siberia and elevated regions (>1800 m) are discarded, DC and COV are associated with convective clouds, as identified by Cloudsat, more than 90% of time. COV reaches the Tropopause in 51% of cases. Results also show that ice water content (IWC) profiles peak higher for COV (9 km) than DC (7 km), with a heavier average ice loading for DC (0.9 g/m3) than for COV (0.8 g/m3). Maximal altitude reached by ice clouds is higher in the tropics than in the midlatitudes (16.1 km against 12.7 km in average for COV events), while average IWC is slightly higher in the tropics (0.21 g/m3 against 0.18 g/m3 for DC events).

For continuity reasons, the choice of space agencies is usually to apply the same retracker from one satellite mission to the other to ensure long-time homogeneous series. In this article, taking the opportunity of a new configuration of the nadir pointing measurements onboard the recently launched China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) with the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) instrument (Hauser et al., 2020), the retracking method was upgraded, by implementing a novel algorithm, called “Adaptive” retracker. It combines the improvements brought by Poisson et al., (2018) for the estimation of surface parameters from peaked waveforms over sea ice, improvements in the way the instrumental characteristics are considered in the model (mispointing, point target response) and a more accurate consideration of speckle statistics. In this article, we first show from simulations carried out in the instrumental configuration of SWIM that the Adaptive algorithm has better accuracy and performance than the classical MLE4 algorithm. Then, the geophysical parameters obtained with real data from SWIM are analyzed with comparisons to reference data sets (model and products from altimeters). We show that this new algorithm has several benefits with respect to the classical MLE4 method: no need of lookup tables to correct biases, significant noise reduction on all geophysical variables especially the significant wave height, and performance of inversion over a large set of echo shapes, resulting from standard oceanic scenes as well as highly specular conditions such as over bloom or sea ice.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3064236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385074","Altimetry;China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT);nadir;ocean;radar;retracking algorithm;Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM);validation","Sea surface;Adaptation models;Surface waves;Satellites;Radar;Instruments;Standards","altimeters;backscatter;geophysical signal processing;ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;speckle","Adaptive algorithm;altimeter nadir echoes;sea surface parameters;altimeter missions;inversion method;backscattered waveform;continuity reasons;space agencies;satellite mission;long-time homogeneous series;recently launched China France Oceanography Satellite;Surface Waves Investigation;Monitoring instrument;retracking method;called Adaptive retracker;peaked waveforms;sea ice;instrumental characteristics;point target response;instrumental configuration;classical MLE4 algorithm;geophysical parameters;altimeters;classical MLE4 method;echo shapes","","12","","29","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ice and water information was automatically extracted from more than 7000 RADARSAT-2 HH-HV ScanSAR Wide images acquired over the Canadian Arctic and adjacent waters throughout the entire year 2013. A quality-control procedure was specifically developed and applied to reduce the number of erroneous SAR retrievals. To assess the impact of SAR ice and water retrievals on the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS) ice concentration analyses, we designed a set of data assimilation experiments with and without the inclusion of SAR retrievals. Our verification results suggest that the assimilation of SAR-derived retrievals considerably improves ice concentration analyses in the situations where high spatial resolution is important (e.g., near land and over small inland lakes). Furthermore, SAR retrievals are particularly useful over the areas where the Canadian Ice Service's (CIS) manually derived ice products (such as Image Analyses, daily and weekly ice charts) are not available or have limited coverage. The three-satellite RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) launched in June 2019 will significantly increase the temporal frequency of SAR data. According to the most recent CIS estimate, more than 54 000 RCM images a year will be acquired over the CIS areas of interest.

First, we extended our previously introduced ice and water detection approach operating at a 2.05 km x 2.05 km spatial scale to a set of 19 different spatial scales ranging from 2.05 km (41 pixels) down to 0.25 km (5 pixels). As the spatial resolution was increased, the overall accuracy of ice and water detection stayed at a very high level across all scales (between 99.5% and 99.8%), but the number of water retrievals substantially dropped. Second, we designed an approach for estimating ice concentration in a 2 km × 2 km (40 × 40 pixels) area consisting of 64 5 × 5 pixel blocks. The 5 × 5 pixel blocks which are initially classified as unknowns are iteratively combined in clusters with effective spatial scales larger than 5 pixels. The clusters are further classified as ice or water using the ice probability model corresponding to the effective spatial scale. The 40 x 40 pixel area becomes populated with high-resolution (5 x 5 pixels) ice and water retrievals, and the ice concentration is estimated based on the number of ice and water retrievals. The proposed approach produces a much better agreement with the Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis ice concentrations (rootmean-square error (RMSE) = 2.2%) compared to the original 2-km ice/water detection approach (RMSE = 19.9%). The developed technique will be adapted to the RADARSAT Constellation Mission data for data assimilation in Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3000672","Canadian Space Agency RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) Data Utilization and Application Plan (DUAP) Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119138","Ice concentration;multiple scales;RADARSAT-2;Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System (RIOPS);synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Probability;Distance measurement;Image analysis;Data assimilation;Radar polarimetry","data assimilation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","ice concentration;dual-polarization SAR images;water retrievals;multiple spatial scales;dual-polarization HH-HV ScanSAR Wide images;ice numerical models;introduced ice;2.05 km spatial scale;19 different spatial scales;spatial resolution;40 pixels;64 5 × 5 pixel blocks;effective spatial scale;ice probability model;40 x 40 pixel area;5 pixels;Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis ice concentrations;Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System;size 2.05 km;size 0.25 km;size 2.0 km","","6","","21","Crown","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to the spatiotemporal limitations of existing datasets, budgetary constraints, logistical challenges, and adverse temperature and climatic conditions of Antarctica, researchers face great challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have helped to solve this issue because they can collect high-resolution spatiotemporal data and conduct operations in inaccessible locations at a low cost and with ease compared with in situ observation and conventional spaceborne and airborne remote sensing. The development and testing of UAVs for use in polar environments mainly focus on enhancing UAV performance in extreme Antarctic conditions by improving their endurance, wind resistance, and aerial photography stability. The equipped multisensors, flexible data collection and operation window, and high-spatiotemporal resolution all contribute to making UAVs the most powerful platform for cryospheric research. In recent years, a series of UAV-related studies on the cryosphere have been published. However, a thorough review that explicitly details the scientific progress and possibilities of using UAVs in Antarctic polar research is lacking. In this era of rapid global and regional climate change, it is becoming increasingly necessary to employ UAVs to investigate the finer changes in the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) and ice shelves. This work investigates the use of UAVs in the monitoring of the glacial microtopography (including rifts and crevasses, surface subsidence, and melting ponds), ice surface landforms, atmosphere, flora and fauna, sea ice, subglacial environment, and other aspects of Antarctic glaciology investigation, and it speculates on their future use in multidisciplinary research.","2168-6831","","10.1109/MGRS.2022.3227056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10019278","","Antarctica;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Satellites;Ocean temperature;Artificial intelligence;Remote sensing;Monitoring;Climate change","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Today, for some North Atlantic operational regional models, skilled human experts visualize and extract the gulf stream and rings (warm and cold eddies) through an extensive and knowledge-based manual process. To automate this task, we develop a dynamics-inspired deep learning system that extracts the Gulf Stream and rings from concurrent satellite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH). We pose the above problem as a multilabel semantic image segmentation problem. A novel deep convolutional neural network architecture named W-Net, with two parallel encoder–decoder branches, is developed to perform the segmentation. The W-Net’s one branch is the SST branch (accepts SST image as input) and another is the SSH branch (accepts SSH as input), and the final output is a segmentation of gulf stream, warm rings, and cold rings. A dataset consisting of SST, SSH, and manual feature annotation (ground truth) from 2014 to 2018 is used for training. For gulf stream, we obtain 82.7% raw test accuracy and a low error of 4.39% in the detected path length. For the Rings, we obtain more than 71% raw eddy detection accuracy. A detailed ablation study and an examination of both SST and SSH parts of the network are presented to understand how the deep neural network learns to segment the gulf stream’s meandering path and Rings accurately.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3096202","Internal Grant of IISc toward hardware for deep learning (Startup Grant to DS); INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship from the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India(grant numbers:IFA18-ENG271); Arcot Ramachandran Young Investigator Award; NSF(grant numbers:OCE-1851242); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494073","Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR);convolutional neural network (CNN);eddies;Gulf Stream;Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA);rings;semantic segmentation;western boundary currents","Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Streaming media;Image segmentation;Deep learning;Remote sensing;Task analysis","data visualisation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image segmentation;neural net architecture;ocean temperature;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques","cold eddies;dynamics-inspired deep learning system;concurrent satellite images;sea surface height;multilabel semantic image segmentation problem;deep convolutional neural network architecture;parallel encoder-decoder branches;W-Net;SST branch;SST image;SSH branch;manual feature annotation;sea surface temperature;synoptic ocean features;North Atlantic operational regional models;warm eddies;gulf stream visualization;skilled human experts;gulf stream extraction;warm ring segmentation;cold ring segmentation;ring visualization;ring extraction","","3","","50","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CCI science teams focus on R&D activities to generate long -term, global climate data records that describe the evolution of key components of the Earth's climate system, as defined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) (see https://public.wmo.int/en/programmes/global-climate-observing-system) in support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (see https://unfccc.int/). Currently more than 20 Essential Climate Variables (ECV) of the 54 GCOS defined ECVs have been addressed by science teams involved in the CCI. All ECV datasets are fully validated and have high levels of traceability and consistency, including quantitative estimates of uncertainty required by both climate science and modelling communities. In its contribution to climate and Earth system science, this programme has published over 700 peer-reviewed articles, and supported the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) headline statements on climate in both its fifth Assessment Report and subsequent reports, such as the ‘Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’, with ongoing involvement in the IPCC's sixth assessment cycle.

Earth observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and repeating temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements.. CoastWatch satellite data products are free and open (publicly available without the need for registration), and include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (e.g. chlorophyll), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. CoastWatch also distributes outputs from environmental models which incorporate several of these basic physical parameters to derive more complex information. These products cover multiple spatial regions (global and regional coverage) and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves, and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and other environmental satellite missions. CoastWatch is well positioned to link upstream ocean satellite data producers with downstream user needs for real life applications. Our central “hub” is colocated with the ocean satellite data scientists in College Park, MD and our “spokes” are our seven regional Nodes distributed geographically around the country and across NOAA mission line offices. Our Gulf of Mexico Node is co-located with the NOAA Office of Ocean and Atmospheric Research, in the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (NOAA/OAR/AOML) in Miami, FL. Our Central Pacific Ocean Watch Node is co-located with the National Marine Fisheries Service at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (NOAA/NMFS/PIFSC). CoastWatch operates 1) interactive and interoperable data portals to facilitate search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading; 2) a central helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc.; 3) routine data quality and availability services that enable the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets; 4) in-person training courses along with evolving online tutorial and virtual training opportunities. CoastWatch Utilities is a software package that helps users analyze and visualize satellite data products on their own. Coastwatch also collaborates directly with users to provide satellite data expertise in the development of applications that solve user-specific problems.

Despite apparent limitations, accurate hyperspectral data can provide useful independent information to critique the stability of global SST products on the annual-to-decadal time scale. We compared data from atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS) on EOS Aqua and Crosstrack Interferometer Sounder (CrIS) on SNPP with the SST products from NOAA/NESDIS [real time global (RTG)], the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC), and the U.K. Met Office [Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA)]. For the 2013–2019 period, the overall standard deviation of the difference between AIRS and the RTG was 0.55 K, with an increasing trend over time. In contrast, the standard deviation of the difference between the AIRS, the CMC, and the OSTIA dropped steadily to below 0.4 K, a level previously seen only in SST products relative to independent buoy data. Unexplained biases between the observed and the gridded SSTs at the 100-mK level are consistent with the already existing estimates of the AIRS and CrIS absolute calibration accuracy. However, the AIRS and CrIS observations both show artifacts in all three SST products, increasing with distance from the equator, with the CMC artifacts being the smallest. Even with the CMC, a trend of 4 mK per year relative to AIRS and CrIS was observed between 2013 and 2019 for the 30S–30N oceans.

The Alaska coastline is larger than that of any other RA territory as well as the combined seaboard of the United States (US). It is also the only US regional observing system that includes a polar observing component in the Arctic. The effects of climate change in Alaska are already evidenced by the steady decline of Arctic summer sea ice extent and concentration, increased wildfires, thawing permafrost, increasing ocean acidification (OA) and recognizable ecosystem shifts. Other concerns include increased marine traffic, especially through the Bering Strait and across the Arctic Ocean region, ongoing industrial activities, escalating coastal erosion and inundation affecting many coastal subsistence communities, and physical and biological ramifications from the rapid and dramatic retreat of sea ice over the past 30 years. Addressing these changes including mitigation, adaptation and management of resources (e.g., fisheries) requires sustainable, reliable and accessible marine information from both ambient monitoring activities and process oriented research projects. The AOOS conceptual build out plan for the Alaskan Arctic prioritizes core monitoring platforms and activities for safe marine operations, improved storm and hazard response, and integrated data products for ecosystem assessments and climate trends. In this paper, we summarize how AOOS approaches this mission, and discuss actions currently underway in the Arctic, including the ongoing development of the Arctic Data Integration Portal.","","978-1-5090-1537-5","10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7761428","Arctic;ocean observing;data management;water level;sea level;ice detection;ecosystem;moorings;oil;AIS;weather","Arctic;Sea measurements;Oceans;Storms;Sensors;Ecosystems;Climate change","climatology;ecology;environmental monitoring (geophysics);erosion;remote sensing;sea ice;wildfires","Arctic data integration portal;climate trend;integrated data product;hazard response;storm response;marine operation;coastal subsistence community;coastal erosion;industrial activity;Arctic Ocean region;Bering Strait;ecosystem shift;ocean acidification;wildfire;Arctic summer sea ice extent;climate change;United States;RA territory;offshore environment;coastline environment;IOOS Regional Association;Integrated Ocean Observing System;AOOS;Alaska Ocean Observing System","","","","9","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The random rough surface models were applied to soil surfaces and ocean surfaces. The discrete random media models were applied to snow and vegetation. For rough surface scattering, we use the surface integral equations of Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai that are solved by the method of moments using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions. The sparse matrix canonical grid method is used to accelerate the matrix column multiplications. In modeling the rough surfaces, we use the exponential correlation functions for soil surfaces and the Durden-Vesecky ocean spectrum for ocean surfaces. In scattering by terrestrial snow and snow on sea ice, we use the volume integral equations formulated with the dyadic half-space Green's function. The microstructure of snow is modeled by the bicontinuous media. In scattering by vegetation, we use the discrete scatterers of cylinder. The NMM3D formulation is based on the Foldy-Lax multiple scattering equations in conjunction with the body of revolution for a single scatterer. For rough surface scattering, simulations results are compared with advanced integral equation model, small slope approximation, small perturbation method, and two scale model. For volume scattering by snow, results are compared with the bicontinuous dense media radiative transfer.

The quality of ASCAT winds is known to be generally degraded, with increasing values of the inversion residual or maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE). In the current ASCAT Wind Data Processor (AWDP), an MLE-based QC is adopted to filter poor-quality winds, which has proven to be effective in screening artifacts in the ASCAT winds, associated with increased subcell wind variability and other phenomena such as confused sea state. However, some poorly verifying winds, which appear in areas with moist convection, are not screened by the operational QC. The extension of the QC procedure with SEs is investigated, based on a comprehensive analysis of quality-sensitive parameters, using the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model winds, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) rain data, and tropical buoy wind and precipitation data as reference, taking into account their spatial and temporal representation. The validation results show that the proposed method indeed effectively removes ASCAT winds in spatially variable conditions. It filters three times as many wind vectors as the operational QC, while preserving verification statistics with local buoys. We find that not the rain itself, but the extreme local wind variability associated with rain appears to generally decrease the consistency between ASCAT, buoy, and ECMWF winds.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2392372","European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility Associated Scientist(grant numbers:OSI-AVS-12-04); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) National R&D(grant numbers:AYA2012-39356-C05-03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042264","Quality control (QC);rain;scatterometer;singularity analysis (SA);wind;wind variability;Quality control (QC);rain;scatterometer;singularity analysis (SA);wind;wind variability","Rain;Maximum likelihood estimation;Wind speed;Sea measurements;Vectors;Backscatter","atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric techniques;maximum likelihood estimation;microwave imaging;quality control;rain;remote sensing;wind","local wind variability;precipitation data;tropical buoy wind;microwave imager;TRMM-TMI rain data;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission;ECMWF wind;European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts;quality-sensitive parameter;confused sea state;increased subcell wind variability;screening artifacts;poor-quality winds;MLE-based quality control;ASCAT wind data processor;maximum-likelihood estimator;singularity exponent;advanced scatterometer;image processing method;ASCAT wind quality control near rain","","49","","21","IEEE","13 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The scattered signals over sea ice, flooded areas, even under dense vegetation, and in some cases, over land show a significant coherent component. Under coherent scattering conditions, it is usually stated that the coherent signal component comes from an area equal to the first Fresnel zone. This letter analyzes in more detail the spatial resolution in this forward scattering configuration, showing that, when coherent scattering is nonnegligible, the spatial resolution is mostly determined by the geometry and not by typical surface roughness values. As the scattering area around the specular reflection point increases and encompasses the first Fresnel zone, the received power increases and then it fluctuates as higher order Fresnel zones are included (rapid phase changes due to the spherical waves). These contributions may explain in part the large scattering encountered over inhomogeneous land regions, as these different contributions add or subtract, depending on the phase of the electric field, and are weighted by different scattering coefficients (i.e., changes in the dielectric constant and/or surface roughness, such in water ponds or some agricultural fields). Finally, over homogeneous targets, when all Fresnel zones are included, the received power tends asymptotically to the value obtained using the free-space propagation with a total path length equal to the sum of the path lengths, weighted by the reflection coefficient. This value can also be interpreted as coming from an effective region that is actually ~0.6 times the first Fresnel zone.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2019.2916164","Secretar??a de Estado de Investigaci??n, Desarrollo e Innovaci??n(grant numbers:RTI2018-099008-B-C21); EU FEDER, ICREA Academia Award from the Catalan Government; European Space Agency(grant numbers:4000120299/17/NL/AF/hh); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725558","Coherent scattering;Fresnel zone;Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R);spatial resolution","Scattering;Fresnel reflection;Spatial resolution;Receivers;Sea surface;Transmitters","agriculture;electromagnetic wave scattering;Fresnel diffraction;geophysical signal processing;radar signal processing;reflectometry;remote sensing;satellite navigation;surface roughness","higher order Fresnel zones;specular reflection point increases;scattering area;typical surface roughness values;forward scattering configuration;coherent signal component;coherent scattering conditions;significant coherent component;flooded areas;scattered signals;satellite navigation signals;multistatic radar;Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry;spatial resolution;Fresnel zone;dielectric constant surface roughness;scattering coefficients;inhomogeneous land regions;rapid phase changes","","51","","16","IEEE","29 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NOAA National Ocean Service's Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) understands these changing conditions and recognizes the critical need for real-time oceanographic and meteorological observations along the U.S. Arctic coasts to support safe navigation. CO-OPS has been developing and testing a new, real-time oceanographic and meteorological observing system to address measurement needs at remote coastal sites where lack of infrastructure limits the use of land-based designs. The prototype system has two main components: 1) a bottom mounted ocean measurement platform and 2) a surface buoy with meteorological sensors and a satellite telemetry system. These two components are connected wirelessly, via an underwater acoustic link. Design details of the new system under development are presented here, along with results from three mid-Atlantic field trials successfully completed with an evolving prototype system, during 2014–2016.

It also explores iceberg SAR signature variability over various ocean parameters. Three-dimensional (3-D) profiles of icebergs were captured in a field study off the coast of Bonavista, NL, Canada, in June 2017 at the time of an SAR satellite overpass. The 3-D profiles were captured from a vessel, using a LiDAR and multibeam sonar. The SAR image and 3-D profiles were captured within hours of one another. Simulated SAR images of the icebergs were generated in a simulator called GRECOSAR with the satellite, target orientation, and ocean parameters that closely mimic the real SAR scene. A new ocean model was introduced to model an ocean backscatter at satellites' lower incidence angle beam mode. Comparison between real and simulated SAR images of the icebergs shows good agreement in terms of SAR signature, total radar cross section, and polarimetric decomposition. Wind direction was varied over 90° extent to observe icebergs' backscatter variability in the simulator. Furthermore, simulated SAR images were generated for low and high wind conditions. Our study finds that the macrostructure of the melt iceberg dominates its polarimetric behavior of its backscatter. Large variability of iceberg SAR signature over varying ocean parameters was also observed. A mathematical model that considers the melting condition of iceberg suggested that significant backscattering can reflect from top surface when the melt water layer could be as little as 0.1 mm.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2954847","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:452567-13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8960658","Backscatter model;electromagnetic (EM) model;GRECOSAR;iceberg;RADARSAT-2;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Backscatter;Radar polarimetry;Scattering;Seeasurface;Wind speed;Synthetic aperture radar","backscatter;geophysical image processing;geophysical signal processing;radar cross-sections;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","mathematical model;melt iceberg;satellites;ocean backscatter;ocean model;SAR scene;simulated SAR images;SAR satellite overpass;ocean parameters;iceberg SAR signature variability;C-band RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar images;scattering behavior;lower beam mode;wind conditions;EM model","","3","","49","IEEE","15 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, ice-shelf change (e.g., ice-shelf thinning) results in accelerated ice discharge into the ocean, which has a direct effect on sea level. Studying ice-shelf velocity allows the monitoring of the ice shelves' stability and evolution. Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is a common technique from which highly accurate velocity maps can be inferred at high resolution. Because ice shelves are afloat, small sea-level changes-i.e., ocean tides and varying atmospheric pressure (aka inverse barometer effect) lead to vertical displacements. If not accounted for in the interferometric process, these effects will induce a strong bias in the horizontal velocity estimation. In this article, we present an empirical DInSAR correction technique from geophysical models and double DInSAR, with a study on its variance propagation. The method is developed to be used at large coverage on short timescales, essential for the near-continuous monitoring of rapidly changing areas on polar ice sheets. We used Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions in interferometric wide and extra -wide swath modes. The vertical interferometric bias is estimated using a regional climate model (MAR) and a tide model (CATS2008). The study area is located on the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica.

Basal melting of the ice shelves would reduce their ability to restrain the discharge of grounded ice into the ocean. However, estimating the basal melt rate is challenging due to the large uncertainty in the calculation. In this study, we use a Lagrangian framework to improve the basal melt rate derivation and apply the method to the Shackleton ice shelf as a case study. We use the CryoSat-2 data to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of ice shelf surface elevation changes between 2010 and 2018. Combining these results with the ice surface velocity and output from the regional climate model, we obtain a map of the basal melt rate and calculate the total and average basal mass balance. The total basal meltwater production for the Shackleton ice shelf is 54.6 ± 7.2 Gt/yr. The highest melt rates, which exceed 50 m/yr, are found close to the grounding line and the main trunk of Denman glacier. Based on the analysis, we show that the Lagrangian method can provide more spatially coherent patterns of ice shelf surface elevation changes and reduce the uncertainty in basal melt rate calculation.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3077359","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41776200,41941010,41531069); Distinguished Young Scientists of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019CFA057); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9423551","Altimetry;basal melt rate;CryoSat-2;ice shelf;Lagrangian framework","Ice shelf;Ice;Sea surface;Antarctica;Sea measurements;Sea level;Uncertainty","glaciology;melting;radar altimetry;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level","Shackleton ice shelf;CryoSat-2 radar altimetry;ice sheets;ice shelves;grounded ice;basal melting;basal melt rate derivation;CryoSat-2 data;ice shelf surface elevation changes;ice surface velocity;total balance;average basal mass balance;total basal meltwater production;basal melt rate calculation;ice shelves buttress","","2","","63","CCBY","4 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Hence, continuous monitoring of glacier changes and in particular the mapping of positional changes of their calving front is of significant importance. This delineation process, in general, has been carried out manually, which is time-consuming and not feasible for the abundance of available data within the past decade. Automatic delineation of the glacier fronts in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can be performed using deep learning-based U-Net models. This article aims to study and survey the components of a U-Net model and optimize the model to get the most out of U-Net for glacier (calving front) segmentation. We trained the U-Net to segment the SAR images of Sjogren-Inlet and Dinsmoore–Bombardier–Edgworth glacier systems on the Antarctica Peninsula region taken by ERS-1/2, Envisat, RadarSAT-1, ALOS, TerraSAR-X, and TanDEM-X missions. The U-Net model was optimized in six aspects. The first two aspects, namely data preprocessing and data augmentation, enhanced the representation of information in the image. The remaining four aspects optimized the feature extraction of U-Net by finding the best-suited loss function, bottleneck, normalization technique, and dropouts for the glacier segmentation task. The optimized U-Net model achieves a dice coefficient score of 0.9378 with a 20% improvement over the baseline U-Net model, which achieved a score of 0.7377. This segmentation result is further postprocessed to delineate the calving front. The optimized U-Net model shows 23% improvement in the glacier front delineation compared to the baseline model.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3148033","Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg; Stadtler-Stiftung under the Emerging Field Initiative TAPE: Tapping the Potential of Earth Observation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9699423","Glacier calving front segmentation;optimized U-Net;semantic segmentation","Image segmentation;Training;Radar polarimetry;Ice;Synthetic aperture radar;Deep learning;Antarctica","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;glaciology;image segmentation;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level;synthetic aperture radar","baseline U-Net model;glacier front delineation;glacier calving front segmentation;global sea-level rise;glacier changes;glacier fronts;synthetic aperture radar images;deep learning-based U-Net models;data augmentation;glacier segmentation task;Dinsmoore-Bombardier-Edgworth glacier systems;Antarctica Peninsula region;ERS-1/2 mission;Envisat mission;RadarSAT-1 mission;ALOS mission;TerraSAR-X mission;TanDEM-X mission","","1","","55","CCBY","1 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For object detection (e.g., ship, sea ice, and drilling platform) in maritime monitoring which has been widely discussed, it is still a challenge to eliminate the false alarms caused by ocean clutter. Accordingly, a modified feature-based framework for ship detection using CP SAR data was proposed in this paper. In particular, a Guard-filter was used after feature extraction to reduce the effect of ocean clutter. Several simulated CP SAR imageries based on Gaofen-3 quad-polarization SAR image were selected for further investigations on ship detection. A SVM classifier was included in the framework to do a pixel-wise classification. The result shows that the proposed method has a better performance compared to traditional methods (e.g., constant false alarm rate and polarimetric whitening filter) and the feature-based method without filtering. Overall false alarm rates are decreased by 35% with the proposed method.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8518763","Compact polarimetric SAR;ship detection;Guard-filter;Gaofen-3;false alarm","Marine vehicles;Oceans;Scattering;Feature extraction;Synthetic aperture radar;Clutter;Support vector machines","feature extraction;image classification;object detection;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;ships;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar","ship detection;compact polarization SAR image;compact polarimetric SAR imaging mode;quad-polarization mode;linear dual-polarization mode;object detection;ocean clutter;modified feature-based framework;CP SAR data;simulated CP SAR imageries;Gaofen-3 quad-polarization SAR image;constant false alarm rate;polarimetric whitening filter;feature-based method;pixel-wise classification","","6","","12","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the life of the CALIPSO mission, the stability of the CALIOP depolarization ratio calibration has remained within 1%. CALIOP's highly stable depolarization ratio measurements can be used for studying changes in phytoplankton backscatter and carbon biomass (Behrenfeld et al., 2013). Using the depolarization ratio measurements from CALIOP together with collocated A-Train measurements (such as the ocean surface backscatter cross section derived from CloudSat ocean surface backscatter measurements, AMSRE/AMSR-2 wind speeds, and MODIS diffuse attenuation coefficients), we have developed innovative retrieval methods that translate the CALIOP ocean subsurface signals into the following optical and physical properties (Behrenfeld et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015): · the cross polarization component of the column integrated ocean subsurface backscatter signal; · the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp); · the depolarization ratio of ocean subsurface backscatter; and · the ocean subsurface beam attenuation coefficient.

Y. Usikov Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (IRE NASU). It had 100-kW magnetron source, 12-m deployable slotted-waveguide antenna and onboard signal processing unit. Instead of planned experiments, only five days after placement into the polar Earth orbit in the autumn of 1983, SLR of “Cosmos-1500” rendered truly outstanding service. It provided a stream of microwave images of the polar sea ice conditions that enabled the rescue of the freighters in the Arctic Ocean. However, the way to success was far from smooth. Besides of the technical problems, A. Kalmykov had to overcome the jealousy and hostility of both his home institute administration and the USSR bureaucracy. Later, SLR of “Cosmos-1500” was released to the industry and became the main instrument of the USSR and Russian series of remote sensing satellites “Okean” and Ukrainian satellites “Sich-1” and “Sich-1M.” We believe that SLR of “Cosmos-1500” is a perfect candidate to the status of IEEE Milestone in Ukraine.","","979-8-3503-3152-3","10.1109/UkrMW58013.2022.10036997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10036997","history of microwaves;orbital side-looking radar;remote sensing","Microwave integrated circuits;Slot antennas;Spaceborne radar;Satellite broadcasting;Streaming media;Signal processing;Sensors","","","","","","26","IEEE","13 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the season length for shore-fast ice decreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more susceptible to erosion from storm waves. Such coastal erosion is a concern since a large proportion of the population centers and infrastructure in the Arctic are located near the coasts. Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need models capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects of coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses Gaussian process (GP) models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort Sea near Drew Point, AK, USA. GP regression is a data-driven modeling methodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse environments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use annual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from existing data sets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines from satellite imagery. We combine our calibrated models with future climate models to generate a range of plausible future erosion scenarios. Our results show that the GP methodology substantially improves yearly predictions compared to linear and nonlinear least squares methods and is capable of generating detailed forecasts suitable for the use by decision makers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2018.2865429","University of Alaska Anchorage; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8454820","Arctic;coastal erosion;Gaussian process (GP)","Sea measurements;Arctic;Predictive models;Data models;Temperature measurement;Temperature distribution;Forecasting","atmospheric temperature;climatology;erosion;Gaussian processes;land use;ocean waves;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;soil;storms","Gaussian process regression;Arctic coastal erosion forecasting;Arctic coastal morphology;climatological changes;season length;shore-fast ice decreases;temperatures warm permafrost soils;storm waves;population centers;decision makers;scenario-based predictions;Gaussian process models;GP regression;data-sparse environments;remote Arctic coastlines;annual coastline positions;near-shore summer temperature averages;data sets;calibrated models;future climate models;plausible future erosion scenarios;GP methodology;infrastructure;land use;Beaufort Sea;Drew Point;USA;Alaska;data-driven modeling methodology;satellite imagery;nonlinear least square method","","8","","36","IEEE","5 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CP captures single-look complex data which can be used to derive the multilook complex (MLC) coherence matrix, or, equivalently, the Stokes vector data of the backscattered field. The challenge is to develop computer vision algorithms that can be used to effectively segment the scene using this new data source. An unsupervised region-based segmentation approach has been designed and implemented that utilizes the complex Wishart distribution characteristic of the MLC CP data. The segmentation method is based on the iterative region growing with semantics algorithm originally designed for single and dual pol intensity SAR data. The algorithm has been tested using both simulated CP SAR images and a pair of available quad polarization SAR images.

NOAA CoastWatch provides free and open access to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate. Satellites make observations from which several ocean, coastal, and inland water parameters can be derived. Ocean observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements. While NOAA may be known for operating satellites for use in weather forecasting by the National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA also routinely produces satellite-based ocean data products in support of all NOAA mission services including NWS, National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service, and the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. These ocean products are freely and openly available to everyone, including government, academic, commercial and general public users. NOAA CoastWatch has existed since 1989 when the primary focus was on distributing sea surface temperature data for continental US regions. With time and in response to the continual development of ocean observations from space, the CoastWatch scope has expanded. CoastWatch satellite data products now include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (chlorophyll, etc.), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. These products have global and regional coverage and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and/or non-NOAA satellite missions. We serve a broad audience who use ocean satellite data in operational oceanographic applications. Here, the word “operational” has an expanded definition compared with traditional weather service usage. The program is organized as a “hub and spokes”. The “hub” has the primary processing responsibilities and co-located with the ocean satellite environmental data record (EDR; i.e., Level 2) producers. The “spokes” are regional Nodes distributed geographically and across NOAA mission line offices, CoastWatch is well-positioned to bridge upstream ocean EDR producers with downstream user needs. The new interactive data portal enables search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading. Casual or occasional users can search, view and download data products using online interactive tools, including a space and time search. Routine “power” users can use command-line scripts to automate their access. CoastWatch maintains a helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc. The OceanWatch Monitor (https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/om/) enables the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets and an internal Data Monitor tracks operational production output.

In this experiment, scan angles of the Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) and Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) were experimentally changed to observe from nadir to about +34°. While the result showed that the precipitation echo could be obtained at wider scan angles, the occurrence of sidelobe and grating lobe clutters not seen in a normal scan were simultaneously observed. The mainlobe clutter height of KuPR increased linearly along the incident angle, and 0.5 mm/h precipitation may be masked up to 4 km over land at the angle of +34°. Besides, the grating lobe clutter clearly occurred in KuPR when the ground surface of the grating lobe direction was land or sea ice. The maximum scan angle without the grating lobe contamination was +23.43°, approximately corresponding to 355 km swath width with the orbit altitude of 407 km. For KaPR, the grating lobe contamination was not significant and the mainlobe clutter height peaked at the scan angle of around 26°, and then tended to decrease at larger scan angles. Therefore, precipitation at the lower altitude may have a chance to be detected even at larger scan angles, while weaker surface echoes at larger scan angles may need new techniques to estimate precipitation for the KaPR.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.2998724","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104903","Meteorological radar;radar clutter;spaceborne radar","Spaceborne radar;Clutter;Gratings;Radar measurements;Radar clutter;Observatories","atmospheric precipitation;meteorological radar;radar clutter;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar","Ka-band precipitation radar;Ku-band precipitation radar;AD 2017 09;grating lobe contamination;grating lobe direction;mainlobe clutter height;grating lobe clutters;precipitation echo;KaPR;KuPR;global precipitation measurement core observatory;dual-frequency precipitation radar;wide swath observation experiment;spaceborne precipitation radar","","2","","28","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Processing satellite radar altimetry data over inland water bodies on a large scale has been a cumbersome task primarily due to the removal of contaminated measurements as a result of surrounding land. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm to automatically generate time series from raw satellite radar altimetry data without user intervention. With this method, users with a little knowledge on the field can now independently process radar altimetry for diverse applications. The method is based on K-means clustering, interquartile range, and statistical analysis of the dataset for outlier detection. Jason-2 and Envisat radar altimetry data were used to demonstrate the capability of this algorithm. A total of 37 satellite crossings over 30 lakes and reservoirs located in the U.S., Brazil, and Nigeria were used based on the availability of in-situ data. We compared the results against in-situ data and root-mean-square error values ranged from 0.09 to 1.20 m. We also confirmed the potential of this algorithm over rivers and wetlands using the southern Congo River and Everglades wetlands in Florida, respectively. Finally, the different retracking algorithms in Envisat; Ice-1, Ice-2, Ocean, and Sea-Ice were compared using the proposed algorithm.

This has become increasingly true also in the Arctic, where reduced sea ice extent has made Arctic oceans more accessible for industry and tourism-related ship traffic. To minimize the environmental impacts of an oil spill, it is important to identify the source and monitor the extent and progression of a spill. In this paper, Lipschitz-Regularity (LR) transformation and two-dimensional stationary wavelet transform (2D-SWT) are integrated into a previously developed image analysis workflow [1] for application to oil spill detection. To describe the performance of the developed approach under controlled conditions, we have applied our method to simulated SAR data of wind driven oceans containing oil spills of various properties. The simulated SAR data starts from a SAR raw signal simulator, which includes both an ocean and an oil slick model. Several crude oil types of varying slick thickness can be simulated and wind speed as well as sensor wavelength can be varied in the simulator. In addition to simulated data, we also used our method on several real-life real life oil spill scenarios using a series of L-band ALOS PALSAR images, and X-band TerraSAR-X images acquired during the Deep-Water Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 and C-band Sentinel-1A images acquired from the Persian Gulf in 2017. From our analysis, we concluded that the LR and 2D-SWT have distinct advantages in oil spill detection and lead to high performance spill mapping results.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232360","Change detection;SAR;Bayesian inferencing;flood mapping;decision support","Oils;Synthetic aperture radar;Sea surface;Transforms;Surface waves;L-band","crude oil;geophysical image processing;marine pollution;oil pollution;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;wavelet transforms;wind","oil spill detection;reduced sea ice extent;Arctic oceans;developed image analysis workflow;simulated SAR data;SAR raw signal simulator;oil slick model;crude oil types;Deep-Water Horizon spill;wind-driven oceans;spill mapping;L-band ALOS PALSAR images;X-band TerraSAR-X images;C-band Sentinel-1A images;Persian Gulf;AD 2017;2D stationary wavelet transform;Gulf of Mexico;AD 2010;Lipschitz-Regularity transformation;petroleum hydrocarbons;marine pollution","","","","8","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advancements in marine trade have lead to the increase in the number of ships in the world waters. The usage of satellite-based radar images have become well known for maritime surveillance as ship detection is relatively simple and independent of the climatic conditions. Ships can be easily discerned in the SAR images due to their bright intensity which results due to the strong radar backscatter from their metal surface. These are the significant pixels in an image which can be gathered to detect the ship targets. During heavy sea state conditions and presence of speckle noise, sea ice and coastline structure, the ship detection process is affected since these non-ship features in the sea also exhibit high intensities in the SAR image. These false alarms have to be reduced. So, in this work a Significance based ship detection algorithm followed by a discrimination stage using ensemble classifier is proposed to differentiate the ship and non-ship targets. To enhance the ship detection process, the images are subjected to ridgelet transform based despeckling. The efficacy of the proposed Significance based target detection is proved by the obtained results.","","978-1-7281-1604-4","10.1109/ICIICT1.2019.8741483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741483","Target Detection;Ridgelet Transform;Significance;Ensemble classifier","Marine vehicles;Radar polarimetry;Object detection;Transforms;Radar imaging;Synthetic aperture radar","geophysical image processing;image classification;object detection;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;ships;synthetic aperture radar","SAR imagery;surveillance scenario;target detection algorithms;marine traffic management;marine trade;satellite-based radar images;maritime surveillance;SAR image;strong radar backscatter;ship targets;heavy sea state conditions;sea ice;coastline structure;ship detection process;nonship targets;based despeckling;synthetic aperture radar images;significance based target detection;significance based ship detection algorithm","","","","19","IEEE","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) mission, based on a multifrequency microwave radiometer and designed to observe the ocean, sea ice, and Arctic environment, requires brightness temperature measurements with a total absolute uncertainty of 0.5 K and a spatial resolution of 5 km. This constraint demands very large reflectors with a gain value of tens of decibels. Mechanical constraints will be attained by using a mesh reflector, which guarantees the required resolution but with the drawback of a radiation pattern characterized by many grating lobes that contaminate the value of the brightness temperature associated with the boresight position. In this article, an antenna pattern correction (APC) is proposed to correct these effects. The algorithm takes advantage of an iterative formulation based on the Jacobi Method, providing a suitable correction that depends on the chosen spatial resolution. The APC algorithm was tested at both K- and Ka-bands with similar performance. Here, only the results from the latter are shown, as its antenna pattern is the most challenging among CIMR.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3238269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10021618","Antenna pattern correction (APC);conical scan;Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR);microwave radiometry;radiometric accuracy","Antennas;Earth;Temperature measurement;Microwave radiometry;Antenna measurements;Climate change;Spatial resolution","","","","","","13","CCBY","19 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This mission aims to provide information about surface height, surface vector winds, sea-ice, coastal land surface and liquid water clouds. Depending on the final system characteristics, it could also contribute to our knowledge of coastal ocean turbidity and ecology. We propose here to focus on the wind vector retrieval. Wind is a major source of momentum to the upper ocean and modulates the coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. In littoral areas, wind influences economic activities like ship navigation and fisheries. The Lidar can provide a retrieval of wind properties closer to the coastlines and at a finer scale than typical microwave systems. We will present the theoretical basis of how the lidar can retrieve the wind speed through the surface roughness measurement [1] and wind direction from the multistatic measurement of the wave slope asymmetry. It is well known that the upwind and crosswind components of the mean square slope are drastically different [2] and several lidar receivers looking at the laser light coming from different directions will be sensitive to this asymmetry. The CALIPSO lidar mission has conducted several large off-nadir angle maneuvers (10° to 30° off-nadir) that show this signature of wind direction but with a limited ability for retrieval because it's a single monostatic system. We will present a preliminary analysis of these data and an overview of the features of the Rainbow mission that will allow us to retrieve wind vector from a cubesat lidar constellation.","","978-1-5386-5485-9","10.1109/CWTM43797.2019.8955257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955257","Lidar;wind vector;wind speed;wind direction;wave slope","","atmospheric techniques;clouds;oceanographic techniques;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;remote sensing by radar;surface roughness;wind","CALIPSO lidar mission;single monostatic system;Rainbow mission;cubesat lidar constellation;wave slope asymmetry;multistatic space Lidar constellation;wind direction retrievals;National Ocean Partnership Program;lidar cubesat mission;surface height;surface vector winds;sea-ice;coastal land surface;liquid water clouds;final system characteristics;coastal ocean turbidity;ecology;wind vector retrieval;upper ocean;ship navigation;fisheries;wind properties;typical microwave systems;surface roughness measurement;multistatic measurement;mean square slope;lidar receivers","","","","16","USGov","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of in situ observations from the MIZ of the Arctic Ocean confirms the conclusion drawn based on theoretical estimates as well as the simulation ability of our new model to describe wave evolution in the MIZ. In wave refraction, variation of wavenumber in magnitude is determined by the incident wavenumber and the ice mass. A larger incident wavenumber or a larger ice mass leads to a larger variation of wavenumber in magnitude, though during refraction, the variation of wavenumber in magnitude is more sensitive to the incident wavenumber because it is proportional to the cube of the incident wavenumber, while it is linearly proportional to the ice mass. On the other hand, both the angle of refraction and the deflection are determined by the angle of incidence, the incident wavenumber and the ice mass. A larger angle of incidence, a shorter wave or larger ice mass results in a larger angle of refraction and a larger deflection. All these conclusions are supported by offline calculations, an online model and in situ observations. The online model also suggests that the instrument should be kept at a distance from the ice edge to obtain more general information of the open ocean.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3028866","National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:ZK18-03-29); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9214406","Wave refraction;marginal ice zone;frazil-pancake ice;wavenumber variation","Sensitivity;Sea ice;Ice thickness;Arctic;Ocean temperature","ocean waves;oceanographic regions;sea ice","Arctic Ocean;ice edge;larger ice mass results;shorter wave;larger incident wavenumber;wave evolution;MIZ;wavenumber variations;online model;offline calculation;theoretical estimates;frazil-pancake ice;marginal ice zone;wave refraction","","","","22","CCBY","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is valid for their combined incidence angle range and being used to generate wind climate data records. CMOD7 has been developed in several steps as a successor of CMOD5.n. First, CMOD5.n has been adapted to the ASCAT transponder calibration, which is considered more accurate than any ESCAT gain calibration. This results in a linear scaling of the backscatter values. Second, for low winds, there is a clear mismatch between CMOD5.n and the measurements. An independently developed ASCAT C-band GMF, C2013, which performs particularly well for low winds was adopted to improve low winds for the ASCAT incidence angle range. Third, retrievals with CMOD5.n show wind speed probability distribution functions (pdf) that undesirably depend on wind vector cell (WVC) position across the swath. To overcome this effect, a higher order calibration is applied, which matches the wind speed pdfs for all WVCs of ASCAT and ESCAT. The resulting CMOD7 GMF indeed shows overall improved performance on all relevant quality parameters compared to CMOD5.n. It is found that the standard deviations of error for wind speed and wind direction of ASCAT are improved. The same holds for the maximum-likelihood estimates, showing an 8% improved consistency with the local triplet of backscatter measurements. As a consequence, triple collocation with moored buoy and numerical weather prediction winds results in smaller wind vector components and wind direction retrieval errorsim.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2681806","Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF); ASCAT; KNMI; OSI SAF; AWDP; EUMETSAT; NWP SAF; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891633","Calibration;radar cross section;radar remote sensing;sea surface;satellite application;wind","Radar measurements;Calibration;Sea measurements;Wind speed;Backscatter;Spaceborne radar","atmospheric techniques;calibration;maximum likelihood estimation;weather forecasting;wind","CMOD7 geophysical model function;ASCAT wind retrieval;ERS wind retrieval;incidence angle range;wind climate data record;ESCAT gain calibration;ASCAT transponder calibration;ASCAT C-band GMF;maximum-likelihood estimate;wind vector cell position;wind speed probability distribution function","","141","","35","IEEE","19 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is designed for the purpose of retrieving wind field over oceans. It also provides information on surface soil moisture content and sea ice. Although ASCAT uses a linear frequency modulated pulse with a center frequency of 5.255 GHz (C-band), it is subject to radio frequency interference (RFI). This paper analyses seven years of ASCAT data and shows an increase of the number of noise outliers and an increase of the noise background level over specific land areas. This suggests that the outliers are not a natural occurrence, but are due to RFI from ground-based equipments. As regards the observed increase of the noise background level, it is not straightforward to associate possible RFI sources which could have caused it. However, since the ASCAT has a dynamic range of about 30 dB, the worse measured increase of 1 dB in the noise floor has almost no impact on performance, in particular, on soil moisture retrieval. In addition, the effect of the noise outliers on the estimate of the ASCAT receiver filter shape function used in the processing is also examined and is found to introduce errors of up to 0.4 dB. However, the occurrence of the noise outliers is generally very low, typically two out of 60 000 noise measurements per day, so the impact on the operational use of ASCAT data for wind vector retrieval is limited.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2640561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815317","Advanced scatterometer (ASCAT);C-band scatterometer;radio frequency interference (RFI)","Shape;Receivers;Sea measurements;Noise measurement;Radiofrequency interference;Backscatter;Radar measurements","atmospheric techniques;sea ice;wind","radio frequency interference analysis;Metop ASCAT backscatter measurement;advanced ASCAT scatterometer radar system;center frequency;radio frequency interference;ASCAT data;RFI;ground-based equipment;noise floor;soil moisture retrieval;ASCAT receiver filter shape function;wind vector retrieval","","4","","15","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We then detail a procedure in which a reference image stereo pair is combined with a third repeat image to simultaneously extract surface elevation and displacement, providing DEMs and SDMs that are precisely coregistered and optimally terrain corrected. We conclude with example applications to a fjord with moving icebergs and a fast-flowing glacier and an assessment of DEM quality assessment and improvement by the LSF.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2938146","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:NNX10AN61G); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1559691,1543501); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1542736); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8832183","Digital elevation model (DEM) quality;displacement maps;glacier;rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) bias;Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM)","Surface topography;Satellites;Correlation;Kernel;Earth;Surface fitting;Displacement measurement","digital elevation models;geophysical image processing;glaciology;hydrological techniques;image resolution;oceanographic techniques;sea ice;stereo image processing;terrain mapping","submeter resolution;moving icebergs;fast-flowing glacier;in-track stereo;high-resolution image;TIN-based Search-space Minimization algorithm;Surface Extraction;feature tracking;cross-track images;repeat-single scan images;abundant pairs;single acquisitions;earth;critical measurements;repeat satellite imagery;surface displacement;digital elevation models;SETSM algorithm;pushbroom satellite images;DEM quality assessment;SDMs;surface elevation;repeat image;reference image stereo pair;cross-track image stereo pairs;DEMs;Local Surface Fitting","","3","","20","IEEE","11 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the accelerating dynamics of ice shelf melt in a warming environment are poorly understood, and the collapse of Antarctic ice shelves remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in global sea level rise projections. The cavities below Antarctic ice shelves are notoriously difficult to access, making model-based hypotheses about the relationship between ocean warming and greater ice shelf melting difficult to verify because of a lack of in-situ data to constrain model parameters and examine key assumptions. We present early progress on IceNode, a novel vehicle under development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory designed to acquire well-distributed, concurrent, long-duration melt rate measurements under ice shelves. IceNodes are deployed as an array from a ship at the shelf edge, and use variable buoyancy to ride melt-driven exchange currents far into the cavity. Once underneath their target landing area, they release a ballast weight to gain high positive buoyancy and attach to the underside of the ice shelf, where they acquire in-situ measurements of basal melt rate directly at the ice-ocean interface for a year or more. Finally, IceNodes detach from their landing structure and use variable buoyancy to ride melt-driven exchange currents back to open water, where they surface and transmit their mission data home. IceNodes are designed to be relatively low-cost, expendable, and have simple logistics, enabling scientists to deploy scalable arrays that acquire simultaneous, distributed measurements of co-varying ice shelf melt and ocean conditions over large spatial areas, thereby providing an unprecedented view of ice shelf melt rate variability and its drivers.","0197-7385","978-0-692-93559-0","10.23919/OCEANS44145.2021.9705733","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705733","icenode;ice shelf;ice shelves;grounding zone;melt;sea level rise;climate change;underwater vehicles;oceanic instrumentation;sensors;robotics;autonomous;vehicle design;buoyant lander;profiling float;oceanography","Weight measurement;Current measurement;Area measurement;Sea measurements;Buoyancy;Ice shelf;Antarctica","glaciology;ice;melting;ocean temperature;oceanographic techniques;radar tracking;remote sensing by radar;sea ice;sea level","long-duration melt rate measurements;Antarctic ice shelves;Antarctic Ice Sheet;global sea level rise projections;IceNode;melt-driven exchange currents;basal melt rate;ice-ocean interface;ice shelf melt rate variability","","1","","16","","15 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IceNode is a novel robotic vehicle under development at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to acquire such measurements, but presents a complex design problem owing to the large design space and conflicting performance requirements. Evaluating a preliminary design requires several types of tedious analysis which prevents rapid iteration and exploration of the design space.

Using this framework, we selected parameters which had the largest effects on design success and conducted a generative design study in which we programmatically varied a handful of parameters to generate 1540 different design candidates and test them across 160 different environmental scenarios.

Inspired by recent advances in metric learning techniques, a new framework is proposed for a formal approximation of the channel error covariance. The idea is tested for the detection of precipitation and its phase over oceans, using coincidences of passive/active data from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and CloudSat satellites. The initial results demonstrate that the presented approach cannot only capture the known laws of radiative transfer equations, but also the surrogate signatures that can arise due to the co-occurrence of precipitation and other radiometrically active land-atmospheric state variables. In particular, the results demonstrate high precision (low error) for the low-frequency channels of 10-37 GHz in the detection of both rain and snowfall over oceans. Using the optimal estimate of the channel error covariance through the multi-frequency k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification approach, without any ancillary data, it is demonstrated that the probability of passive microwave detection of snowfall (0.97) can be higher than that of the rainfall (0.88), when drizzle and light snowfall are the dominant form of precipitation. This improvement is hypothesized to be largely related to the information content of the low-frequency channels of 10-37 GHz that can capture the co-occurrence of snowfall with an increased cloud liquid water content, sea ice, and wind-induced changes of surface emissivity.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2941682","National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:80NSSC18K0742); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858045","Channel error covariance;metric learning;precipitation passive microwave retrievals;precipitation phase;satellite snowfall detection","Ocean temperature;Brightness temperature;Sea surface;Bayes methods;Microwave radiometry","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric techniques;clouds;hydrological techniques;radiative transfer;radiometry;rain;snow","multifrequency k-nearest neighbor classification approach;radiative transfer equations;CloudSat satellites;Global Precipitation Measurement;metric learning techniques;error covariance matrix;radiometric channels;improved microwave retrieval;satellite retrieval;microwave channel error covariance;information content;light snowfall;drizzle;passive microwave detection;rain;low-frequency channels;low error;radiometrically active land-atmospheric state variables;formal approximation;frequency 10.0 GHz to 37.0 GHz","","4","","57","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Low Earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reflectometry (GNSS-R) measurements provide a promising opportunity for retrieval of ionospheric TEC over sea ice and calm waters, which offers a potential new data source to fill the gaps of ground-based GNSS networks. However, the GNSS-R slant TEC (sTEC) estimations include contributions from the incident and reflection ray paths, whose ionospheric piercing points (IPPs) can be separated by hundreds of kilometers. This article presents an algorithm that integrates sTEC measurements from the GNSS-R CubeSats and available ground-based GNSS receivers to derive Arctic vertical TEC (vTEC) maps. A simulation study using the model ionosphere constructed from the NeQuick-2 is conducted to assess the performance of the algorithm. Varying levels of temporal resolutions and solar activities, and the number of CubeSats and the number of maximum simultaneously tracked reflection signals by a CubeSat are implemented in the simulation. The results show that the inclusion of coherent GNSS-R measurements improves the accuracy of the vTEC maps under all levels of solar activities. The RMSE improvement percentage is most obvious when the update interval is the shortest. Increasing the number of CubeSats further improves the accuracy. However, no significant improvement in vTEC map accuracy is observed when the number of maximum simultaneously tracked GNSS-R satellites is higher than 4. Quantitative measures and analyses of the algorithm performances are presented in this article.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3138692","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Defense Sciences Office (DSO) Space Environment Exploitation (SEE) Program(grant numbers:DI 9AC00009); National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)(grant numbers:80NSSC21K1156); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663187","Arctic total electron content (TEC) mapping;coherent global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reflectometry (GNSS-R);GNSS;low Earth orbit (LEO) CubeSat;TEC","CubeSat;Global navigation satellite system;Orbits;Low earth orbit satellites;Extraterrestrial measurements;Reflection;Sea measurements","artificial satellites;electron density;Global Positioning System;ionosphere;ionospheric disturbances;ionospheric techniques;radiowave propagation;satellite navigation;solar activity;total electron content (atmosphere)","Arctic TEC mapping;ground-based GNSS observations;ionospheric total electron content maps;ionospheric delay corrections;satellite navigation applications;Low Earth orbit CubeSat-based global navigation satellite system reflectometry measurements;ionospheric TEC;ground-based GNSS networks;GNSS-R slant TEC estimations;ionospheric piercing points;GNSS-R CubeSats;ground-based GNSS receivers;Arctic vertical TEC maps;coherent GNSS-R measurements;vTEC maps;integrated LEO-based GNSS-R observations;tracked GNSS-R satellites","","1","","32","IEEE","24 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of Sentinel-1 images divided into two classes, representing the presence and absence of a maritime mesocyclone, respectively. The dataset is constructed using the ECMWF reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004 annotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be publicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to classify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model yields an  $F1$  score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently detected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep learning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key features in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the model is accurate even if: 1) such features are significantly cropped due to the limited swath width of the SAR; 2) the features are partly covered by sea ice; and 3) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating the model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km), it is found that higher resolution yield the best performance. This emphasizes the potential of using high-resolution sensors like SAR for detecting polar lows, as compared to conventionally used sensors such as scatterometers.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3204886","European Space Agency (ESA) through the Open Call Project “Polar Low Detection Based on Sentinel-1 Data”(grant numbers:4000129961); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878346","Deep learning;mesocyclones;polar lows;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Synthetic aperture radar;Deep learning;Satellites;Atmospheric modeling;Data models;Radar polarimetry;Image color analysis","","","","","","56","IEEE","6 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This version of the BRE employs arbitrary signals of opportunity and assumes a wider range of surface scattering and kinematic regimes. It contains two terms, one describing the coherent, and another, noncoherent, diffuse component. The latter term can result from any scattering model, not necessarily from the Kirchhoff Approximation/Geometric Optics model as in the previous version.The another limitation of that version pertains to a formulation of the Woodward Ambiguity Function (WAF). It was based on an assumption that all spectral components of the signal experience the same Doppler shift due to kinematic effects. However, for the signals with a significant off-nadir incidence the Doppler shift will affect various spectral components slightly differently leading to a distortion of the WAF. This phenomenon should be taken into account in altimetric measurements from low-Earth orbit platforms performed at incidence angles significantly deviating from nadir.The previous version of the BRE was limited only to the case of strong diffuse scattering, whereas the improved BRE allows computation of the Delay-Doppler Maps (DDM) also for the case of weak surface scattering which might be accompanied by the coherent component. The latter becomes an important feature in the case of the forward bistatic radar scattering from rivers, lakes, small bodies of water, wetlands, sea ice, etc.The mechanism of weak-to-moderate diffuse scattering differs from that of strong diffuse scattering. It involves scattering from surface roughness with spatial scales shorter than the high-frequency cutoff of strong diffuse scattering. For example, the modeling of ocean GNSS reflections shows sensitivity to rain surface effects at low winds.","","978-1-5386-6762-0","10.1109/ICEAA.2018.8520509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8520509","Rough surfaces;sea surface electromagnetic scattering;global positioning system (GPS);radar measurements;wind","Sea surface;Scattering;Mathematical model;Rain;Bistatic radar;Surface waves;Rough surfaces","Doppler shift;electromagnetic wave scattering;geometrical optics;geophysical signal processing;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar;satellite navigation;surface roughness","weak-to-moderate diffuse scattering;forward bistatic radar scattering;surface roughness;spatial scales;coherent component;weak surface scattering;Delay-Doppler Maps;strong diffuse scattering;off-nadir incidence;kinematic effects;Doppler shift;signal experience;spectral components;WAF;Woodward Ambiguity Function;Kirchhoff Approximation/Geometric Optics model;scattering model;kinematic regimes;arbitrary signals;improved bistatic radar equation","","3","","11","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We evaluate their performance using texture properties of sea ice images which are physically related to the radar signal backscattering within a SAR resolution cell. Here we use the local entropy as indicator determined by gray-level-co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method describing how often different compositions of pixel brightness values occur in an image.

As a consequence of the first trend, the relevance of small satellites in line with the “cheaper and faster”philosophy is increasing. The second one opens up completely new horizons by enabling the design of architectures aimed at improving the performance, reliability, and efficiency of current and future space missions. The EU H2020 ONION project (“Operational Network of Individual Observation Nodes”) has leveraged on the concept of fractionated and federated satellite systems (FFSS) to develop and design innovative mission architectures resulting in a competitive advantage for European earth observation (EO) systems. Starting from the analysis of emerging needs in the European EO market, the solutions to meet these needs are identified and characterized by exploring FFSS. In analogy with terrestrial networks, these systems envision the distribution of satellite functionalities amongst multiple cooperating spacecrafts (nodes of a network), possibly independent, and flying on different orbits. FFSS are considered by many as the future of space-based infrastructures, as they offer a pragmatic, progressive, and scalable approach to improve existing and future space missions. This paper summarizes the main results of the ONION project and the high-level design of the marine weather forecast mission for polar regions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2844257","EU H2020 ONION Project(grant numbers:687490); Thales Alenia Space; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats(grant numbers:ESP2015-70014-C2-1-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8372453","Satellite;mission;constellation;federation;sensors;fractionation;SAR;GNSS-R;VIS/NIR/SWIR/LWIR;imagers;polar;weather;ice;marine;currents","Satellites;Weather forecasting;Space vehicles;Monitoring;Aquaculture;Sea ice","artificial satellites;atmospheric techniques;space vehicles;weather forecasting","polar satellite mission;copernicus system;space industry;concurrent trends;increased modularity;distributed satellite systems;cheaper philosophy;fasterphilosophy;completely new horizons;EU H2020 ONION project;Operational Network;Individual Observation Nodes;fractionated satellite systems;federated satellite systems;innovative mission architectures;competitive advantage;European earth observation systems;European EO market;exploring FFSS;terrestrial networks;systems envision;satellite functionalities;multiple cooperating spacecrafts;space-based infrastructures;high-level design;marine weather forecast mission;polar regions;space missions","","16","","18","OAPA","5 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ESA's Copernicus imaging microwave radiometer (CIMR) mission aims at collecting the geophysical observables at a spatial resolution ranging from 60 km in L band to 4 km in Ka band. This goal can be achieved by equipping CIMR with a large unfurlable mesh reflector antenna. A limitation of the antenna design is that the antenna pattern includes grating lobes that contaminate the scene measurement with contributions originated far from the nominal footprint. This effect introduces inaccuracies in brightness temperature measurements, particularly when facing radiometric discontinuities, e.g., near the coastlines and sea ice edges, which can be greater than the mission required maximum of 0.5 K. The aim of this article is to assess a technique which will be able to correct the effects of antenna pattern and obtain reliable TB measurements. The analyzed simple technique is based on a regularized deconvolution of the antenna pattern to reconstruct the actual brightness temperatures. The technique was tested over a synthetic scenario that mimics both steep and smooth variations in spatial and thermal domains.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3124829","OHB Italia; European Space Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9601153","Antenna pattern correction (APC);Copernicus imaging microwave radiometer (CIMR);microwave radiometry;radiometric resolution","Antenna measurements;Microwave radiometry;Temperature measurement;Sea measurements;Pollution measurement;Brightness temperature;Microwave imaging","compensation;deconvolution;microwave antennas;microwave measurement;radiometers;radiometry;reflector antennas;temperature measurement;temperature sensors","CIMR antenna pattern brightness temperature compensation;spaceborne microwave radiometry;spatial resolution;reflector dimension;Ka band;brightness temperature measurements;spatial domains;thermal domains;unfurlable mesh reflector antenna design;ESA Copernicus imaging microwave radiometer;temperature 0.5 K;size 60.0 km to 4 km","","1","","27","CCBY","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We perform knowledge distillation in terms of sharing the feature space instead of output only. Therefore, we also propose a new loss function for the Codistillation technique in AFSD.

The new method is based on monitoring changes in the location and shape of the surface of maximum density of ocean backscatter measurements, also known as “the wind cone.” The cone metrics technique complements established calibration approaches, such as rain forest and NWP ocean calibration, through the characterization of linear as well as nonlinear beam offsets, the latter via wind cone deformations. Given instrument evolution, proven stability, and the monitoring by transponders, we take ASCAT-A data over 2013 as absolute calibration reference. This paper describes the new method and its application as intercalibration tool in the context of the reprocessing activities for ERS-1 and ERS-2.

CO-OPS continually pursues efforts to identify potential improvements to its observatory network. Many recent studies on global climate change have identified a significant increase in Arctic warming rates. Resulting trends of increased sea ice loss have led to Arctic waterways becoming more accessible during summer seasons. As a result, an increase in maritime transport throughout the region is anticipated for the near future. Presently, Artic waters within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have very few navigational support products and services. NOAA, recognizing the changing conditions, anticipates a growing, critical need for real-time oceanographic and meteorological observations across the region. In support of long term modernization plans, CO-OPS has been working on the design, development, and testing of a standalone, real-time water level measurement system for use in remote Arctic coastal regions with very limited infrastructure. Two types of system designs have been identified, for short and long term applications. Both design types include a bottom mounted pressure gauge for the primary source of water level measurements. The long-term system design involves a cable run from an offshore bottom mounted pressure gauge to a small, shore station. The short term system design includes a surface buoy with satellite telemetry and acoustic modem; and a bottom unit consisting of a conductivity, temperature, pressure sensor and acoustic modem. The buoy based system is intended for real-time communications during ice-free periods. Details of the short-term version system design will be presented along with results from a recent field trial conducted in the lower Chesapeake Bay region near Virginia Beach, Virginia during 2014–2015. Plans for continuing system development and test will be discussed.","","978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7404519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404519","Arctic water levels;navigational safety;coastal ocean observatory;hydrographic survey;bottom mounted;pressure gauge","Real-time systems;Modems;Acoustics;Sea surface;Arctic;Telemetry;Sea measurements;Climate change","level measurement;oceanographic techniques;pressure gauges;pressure sensors;remote sensing;temperature sensors","bottom mounted pressure gauge;temperature sensor;pressure sensor;acoustic modem;satellite telemetry;short term system design;long-term system design;remote Arctic coastal regions;Alaska Arctic coasts;standalone real-time water level measurement system","","1","","11","","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we examine scenarios involving subsurface layers exhibiting electrical response given by deviated anisotropic tensors exhibiting low loss and high inter-layer dielectric contrast (i.e., strong subsurface wave guidance), as well as predominantly cross-pol specular interface scatter (XSIS)-based subsurface backscatter. We hypothesize that this scenario can occur within myriad layered geophysical structures containing media hosting a distribution of sub-wavelength, non-spherical inclusions with mean non-vertical orientation. Guidance-enhanced, XSIS-based backscatter we predict can dominate cross-pol InSAR observations (particularly at lower frequencies such as P-band) concerning these types of structures, leading (in the limit of stronger wave guidance) to rapid, inverse-quadratic degradation of correlation versus InSAR spatial baseline, as well as high and linearly divergent phase bias. Modeling the dominant cross-pol backscatter mechanisms adds another tool for Polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) data interpretation and inversion concerning sea ice and other complex layered geophysical structures which can contain media possessing effective anisotropic dielectric response.","2155-5753","978-1-5090-2518-3","10.1109/IRS.2016.7497294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497294","Electromagnetic propagation;radar interferometry;radar polarimetry;radar remote sensing","Backscatter;Coherence;Media;Numerical models;Dielectrics;Degradation","anisotropic media;electromagnetic wave polarisation;inhomogeneous media;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar","InSAR coherence degradation;layered media;anisotropic media;cross polarized InSAR;complex valued InSAR;interferometric synthetic aperture radar;coherence magnitude;phase magnitude;electromagnetic wave penetration;subsurface layer;anisotropic tensor;interlayer dielectric contrast;strong subsurface wave guidance;cross polarized specular interface scatter;subsurface backscatter;nonvertical orientation;inverse quadratic degradation;layered geophysical structures;effective anisotropic dielectric","","","","17","IEEE","23 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
