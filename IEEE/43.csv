Nevertheless, to our knowl-edge there is not any dataset composed of Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3) geo-referenced images. In this paper we present SEN23, a dataset composed of 100 complete multi-spectral S2 and S3 paired images of different locations along Europe from the 2021 summer. The coupled images were obtained with a time difference of three or less days, containing less than a 1 % of cloud coverage and have a resolution difference of × 15. SEN23E is expected to help with the development of new multi-spectral, multi-resolution and multi-modal models for complex tasks which need con-text and complete images.

Fusion of a low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI datacube) with its corresponding high spatial resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI datacube) to reconstruct a high spatial resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI) has been a significant subject in recent years. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to achieve a high quality of spatial and spectral information fusion. In this paper, we propose a Deep Multi-Scale Learning Model (called DeepSen3) of spatial-spectral information fusion based on multi-scale inception residual convolutional neural network (CNN) for more efficient hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion from ESA remote sensing satellite missions (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images). The proposed DeepSen3 fusion network was applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10, 20 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepSen3 network achieves the best performance (both qualitatively and quantitatively) compared with recent state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.","2158-6276","978-1-6654-7069-8","10.1109/WHISPERS56178.2022.9955139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9955139","Deep Learning;Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-CNN);Multi-Scale Inception;Feature Extraction;Spatial-Spectral Image Fusion;Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Remote Sensing Images;HyperSpectral Images (HSI);Multi-Spectral Images (MSI)","Deep learning;Satellites;Signal processing;Market research;Distance measurement;Convolutional neural networks;Spatial resolution","artificial satellites;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical image processing;image fusion;remote sensing","deep multiscale learning model;DeepSen3 fusion network;ESA remote sensing satellite missions;high spatial resolution hyperspectral image;low spatial resolution hyperspectral image fusion;multiscale inception residual convolutional neural network;multisharpening;multispectral remote sensing image fusion;Sentinel-2 MSI images;Sentinel-3 OLCI images;Sentinel-3 remote sensing images;spatial-spectral information fusion","","","","20","IEEE","22 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the proposed approach assembles a multi -spectral data fusion scheme together with a convolutinal neural network (CNN) mapping function to project the OLCI sensor onto its corresponding spatial reference which is synthetically generated by the OLCI/MSI fusion.

However, the synergies between both multi-spectral instruments are often difficult to exploit from an operational perspective. Standard pansharpening algorithms may encounter important disadvantages due to the limited intersensor data availability in actual production environments. Moreover, the lack of a real high-resolution ground-truth for super-resolution techniques may affect the radiometric quality of the final result. In this scenario, this work investigates the viability of using the Multi-Spectral Instrument of Sentinel-2 for super-resolving data products acquired by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument of Sentinel-3. Specifically, we define an inter-sensor image enhancement framework which combines a PCA-based component substitution pansharpening scheme with a CNN-based spatial enhancing super-resolution mapping.

At both resolutions the thermal observations from Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on Sentinel-3 and optical observations from Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 are used within a Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) modelling scheme. For the fine resolution estimates, the thermal observations acquired by SLSTR at around 1 km resolution are sharpened using high-resolution (20 m) optical observations taken by MSI and a machine learning algorithm. The results indicate that it is possible to derive fluxes with similar accuracy at both spatial scales, while obtaining more detailed separation of fluxes originating from individual landscape features at the fine scale.","2153-7003","978-1-5386-7150-4","10.1109/IGARSS.2018.8518229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8518229","land-surface energy fluxes;thermal sharpening;machine learning;Sentinel-2;Sentinel-3","Spatial resolution;Land surface temperature;Atmospheric modeling;Energy resolution;Heating systems;Ocean temperature;Temperature measurement","atmospheric techniques;geophysical image processing;land surface temperature;radiometers;remote sensing","Sentinel-2 observations;Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer;Land-Surface Energy fluxes;machine learning algorithm;high-resolution optical observations;fine resolution estimates;Two-Source Energy Balance modelling scheme;thermal observations;spatial resolution;Sentinel-3 observations;size 20.0 m;size 1.0 km","","1","","12","IEEE","4 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques-a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images-were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods-based on different strategies and tools-have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper). To that end, we provide both a quantitative analysis of the performance of some state-of-the-art methods on simulated images, and a qualitative analysis on real images.","2158-6276","978-1-6654-3601-4","10.1109/WHISPERS52202.2021.9484009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484009","Image fusion;Remote sensing;Sentinel-2 MSI;Sentinel-3 OLCI;Simulations;Real data","Satellites;Statistical analysis;Conferences;Sea measurements;Distance measurement;Sensors;Spatial resolution","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image fusion;image resolution;remote sensing","fusion methods;multi-sharpening techniques;multisharpening methods;multisharpening techniques;simulated images;Sentinel-3 OLCI;spectral bands;fused image;spectral resolutions;hyper-spectral images;spectral resolution;high spatial resolution;multispectral images;Sentinel-2 MSI","","2","","21","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
