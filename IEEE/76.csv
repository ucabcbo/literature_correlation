"An Enhanced Probabilistic Posterior Sampling Approach for Synthesizing SAR Imagery With Sea Ice and Oil Spills","L. Xu; A. Wong; D. A.

This letter presents an enhanced region-based probabilistic posterior sampling approach to effectively synthesize SAR imagery with different ocean features. In the proposed approach, instead of relying entirely on the SAR intensity values, the posterior sampling is performed based on a number of quantitative factors, such as intensity, label field, and the prior class probability of sampling candidates, constituting a complete probabilistic framework that addresses key aspects in the synthesis of SAR imagery from heterogeneous sources. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can better address the difficulties caused by the heterogeneity in the source images compared with the existing state-of-the-art ice synthesis method, and it will improve the consistency, comprehensiveness, and fairness of the evaluation of the remote sensing classification and segmentation algorithms.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2633572","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ArcticNet; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41501410); Canada Research Chairs Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7797259","Image synthesis;oil spills;sea ice;statistical texture modeling","Synthetic aperture radar;Oils;Sea ice;Probabilistic logic;Image segmentation;Image generation","image sampling;marine pollution;oil pollution;pollution measurement;radar imaging;sea ice;synthetic aperture radar","enhanced probabilistic posterior sampling;SAR imagery synthesis;sea ice;oil spills;synthetic aperture radar;ocean features;source images","","3","","13","IEEE","23 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
