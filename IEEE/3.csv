Monitoring these forest areas is more effective with the help of satellite imagery, since ground operations are hampered by vegetation density and height, making them less productive and more expensive. However, nowadays, freely available imagery from Sentinel-2 satellite has a maximum spatial resolution of 10 meters per pixel, a low resolution to identify small or thin structures in the image, such as roads, bridges, buildings, rivers, fuel breaks, among others.To improve image’s resolution, a new super-resolution algorithm, named KGEONP – K Geographically Nearest Pixels, is proposed in this paper. It benefits from Sentinel-2 regular observations (it has a revisit of 5 days) and the georeferencing error of its images (whose maximum value is 1.5 pixels). KGEONP seeks to add as much information as possible to the super-resolved image, by using data from K-nearest pixels and their spatial distance for computing each new pixel’s value.KGEONP was applied to Sentinel-2 images to increase resolution by a factor of 10 and was compared to state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques. It showed quite satisfactory results, with the capacity of increasing resolution and maintaining the structural data of the source images.","","978-1-6654-1264-3","10.1109/YEF-ECE52297.2021.9505092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505092","Super-Resolution;Satellite Imagery;Earth Observation;Sentinel-2;Georeferencing Error","Meters;Interpolation;Satellites;Structural panels;Superresolution;Vegetation mapping;Forestry","fires;forestry;geophysical image processing;image resolution;remote sensing;vegetation","Sentinel-2 images;superresolution techniques;multiimage super-resolution algorithm supported;Sentinel-2 satellite images geolocation error;hottest seasons;forest fires;forest areas;satellite imagery;ground operations;vegetation density;freely available imagery;maximum spatial resolution;Sentinel-2 regular observations;georeferencing error;superresolved image;KGEONP;K geographically nearest pixels;time 5.0 d","","1","","21","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"An Approach To Super-Resolution Of Sentinel-2 Images Based On Generative Adversarial Networks","K. Zhang; G. Sumbul; B.

The proposed approach consists of two main steps. The first step aims to increase the spatial resolution of the bands with 20m and 60m spatial resolutions by the scaling factors of 2 and 6, respectively. To this end, we introduce a generator network that performs SR on the lower resolution bands with the guidance of the bands associated to 10m spatial resolution by utilizing the convolutional layers with residual connections and a long skip-connection between inputs and outputs. The second step aims to distinguish SR bands from their ground truth bands. This is achieved by the proposed discriminator network, which alternately characterizes the high level features of the two sets of bands and applying binary classification on the extracted features. Then, we formulate the adversarial learning of the generator and discriminator networks as a min-max game. In this learning procedure, the generator aims to produce realistic SR bands as much as possible so that the discriminator incorrectly classifies SR bands. Experimental results obtained on different Sentinel-2 images show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to both conventional and deep learning based SR approaches.","","978-1-7281-2190-1","10.1109/M2GARSS47143.2020.9105165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9105165","Sentinel-2 images;super-resolution;generative adversarial network;remote sensing","Image color analysis;Superresolution;Neural networks;Geoscience and remote sensing;Games;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;game theory;geophysical image processing;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques","generative adversarial network;super-resolution approach;S2GAN;spatial resolution;Sentinel-2 spectral bands;generator network;lower resolution bands;ground truth bands;discriminator network;binary classification;adversarial learning;realistic SR bands;Sentinel-2 images;convolutional layers;feature extraction;min-max game;size 20.0 m;size 10.0 m;size 60.0 m","","3","","10","IEEE","2 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the spatial resolutions of Sentinel-2 images are different across its spectral bands, including four bands with a resolution of 10 m, six bands with a resolution of 20 m, and three bands with a resolution of 60 m. To facilitate the effectiveness of analyzing these images, super-resolving of the low-/medium-resolution bands to a higher resolution is desired. As in any image restoration inverse problems, we exploit image self-similarity, a commonly observed property in natural images, which underlies the state-of-the-art techniques, e.g., in image denoising. However, the design of self-similarity priors in nondiagonal inverse problems is challenging; often, a denoiser based on self-similarity is plugged into the iterations of an algorithm, without a guarantee of convergence in general. In this article, for the first time, we introduce a convex and scene-adapted regularizer built explicitly on a self-similarity graph directly learned from the Sentinel-2 images. We then develop a fast algorithm, termed Sentinel-2 super-resolution via scene-adapted self-similarity (SSSS). We experimentally show the superiority of SSSS over four commonly observed scenes, indicating the potential usage of our convex self-similarity regularization in other imaging inverse problems.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2019.2953808","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)-Portugal, Ministry of Education and Science (MEC); The European Regional Development Fund (FEDER) PT2020 Partnership Agreement(grant numbers:UID/EEA/50008/2019); Young Scholar Fellowship Program (Einstein Program) of Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST108-2636-E-006-012); Higher Education Sprout Project of Ministry of Education (MOE) to the Headquarters of University Advancement at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931230","Convex optimization;scene-adapted self-similarity;self-similarity;Sentinel-2 satellite;super-resolution","Spatial resolution;Inverse problems;Imaging;Convex functions;Europe","convex programming;geophysical image processing;graph theory;image denoising;image resolution;image restoration;inverse problems;iterative methods","Sentinel-2 super-resolution via scene-adapted self-similarity;nondiagonal inverse problems;image denoising;image self-similarity;image restoration inverse problems;Sentinel-2 images;spatial resolutions;Earth observation missions;European Space Agency;Sentinel-2 satellite;unsupervised Sentinel-2 super-resolution;imaging inverse problems;convex self-similarity regularization","","30","","55","IEEE","11 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to high spectral and spatial resolution of the data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are very popular sources of information. Nevertheless, in practice if we would like to receive final product in 10 m resolution we should use bands with 10 m resolution. Sentinel-2 has four such bands, but also has other bands, especially red-edge 20 m resolution bands that are useful for vegetation analysis and often are omitted due to lower resolution.

To tackle this inverse problem, we leverage the deep image prior expressed by the convolution neural network (CNN). Specifically, a plain ResNet architecture is adopted, and the 3-D separable convolution is utilized to better capture the spatial–spectral features. The loss function is tailored based on the degradation model, enforcing the network output obeying the degradation process. Meanwhile, a network parameter initialization strategy is designed to further mine the abundant fine information provided by existing 10-m bands. The network parameters are inferred solely from the observed S2 image in a self-supervised manner without involving any extra training data. Finally, the network outputs the super-resolution result.

The feasibility to detect a road depends on its width, which can reach sub-pixel size in some satellite products. In the last decade, many attempts have been carried out to automatize this labour. However, the vast majority of methods rely on aerial imagery, whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps.

One such domain concerns the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission, which provides multispectral images in the form of 13 spectral bands, captured at three different spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 m. This research aims to provide a super-resolution mechanism based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for upsampling the low-resolution (LR) spectral bands of S2 up to 10-m spatial resolution. Our approach is centered on attaining good performance with respect to two main properties: consistency and synthesis. While the synthesis evaluation, also known as Wald’s protocol, has spoken for the performance of almost all previously introduced methods, the consistency property has been overlooked as a viable evaluation procedure. Recently introduced techniques make use of sensor’s modulation transfer function (MTF) to learn an approximate inverse mapping from LR to high-resolution images, which is on a direct path for achieving a good consistency value. To this end, we propose a multiobjective loss for training our architectures, including an MTF-based mechanism, a direct input–output mapping using synthetically degraded data, along with direct similarity measures between high-frequency details from already available 10-m bands, and super-resolved images. Experiments indicate that our method is able to achieve a good tradeoff between consistency and synthesis properties, along with competitive visual quality results.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3240296","CENTURION-H2020-SPACE-2018-2020–“Copernicus Datacube and AI Services for Society, Industry and New Market Generation”; EUROPEAN COMMISSION; European Health and Digital Executive Agency(grant numbers:101004311); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026840","Consistency;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);Sentinel-2 (S2);super-resolution;synthesis","Spatial resolution;Superresolution;Training;Neural networks;Monitoring;Degradation;Optimization","","","","","","46","CCBY","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Obtaining all bands at 10 m resolution would benefit many applications. Recently, many model-based and deep learning (DL)-based sharpening methods have been proposed. However, the downside of those methods is that the DL-based methods need to be trained separately for the 20 m and the 60 m bands in a supervised manner at reduced resolution, while the model-based methods heavily depend on the hand-crafted image priors. To break the gap, this article proposes a novel unsupervised DL-based S2 sharpening method using a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to sharpen the 20 and 60 m bands at the same time at full resolution. The proposed method replaces the hand-crafted image prior by the deep image prior (DIP) provided by a CNN structure whose parameters are easily optimized using a DL optimizer. We also incorporate the modulation transfer function-based degradation model as a network layer, and add all bands to both network input and output. This setting improves the DIP and exploits the advantage of multitask learning since all S2 bands are highly correlated. Extensive experiments with real S2 data show that our proposed method outperforms competitive methods for reduced-resolution evaluation and yields very high quality sharpened image for full-resolution evaluation.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3092286","Icelandic Research Fund(grant numbers:207233-051); University of Iceland Doctoral(grant numbers:1547-154305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9464640","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);image fusion;MTF-based degradation;Sentinel-2 image sharpening;super-resolution;unsupervised deep learning","Spatial resolution;Pansharpening;Electronics packaging;Image fusion;Hyperspectral imaging;Degradation;Training","convolution;feature extraction;image classification;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optical transfer function;unsupervised learning","Sentinel-2 sharpening;single unsupervised convolutional neural network;MTF-based degradation model;Sentinel-2 constellation;multispectral images;deep learning-based sharpening methods;reduced resolution;model-based methods;hand-crafted image priors;novel unsupervised DL-based S2 sharpening method;single convolutional neural network;deep image;modulation transfer function-based degradation model;network layer;network input;competitive methods;reduced-resolution evaluation;yields very high quality sharpened image;full-resolution evaluation;size 10.0 m;size 20.0 m;size 60.0 m","","9","","58","CCBY","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nonetheless, effectively exploiting such intersensor synergies still raises important challenges for super-resolution (SR) algorithms in terms of operational data availability, sensor alignment and substantial resolution changes, among others. In this scenario, this article sets a new SR framework for spatially enhancing S3 ocean and land color instrument (OLCI) products by taking advantage of the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral instrument (MSI). To achieve this goal, we initially study some of the most important deep learning-based approaches. Then, we define a novel Level-4 SR framework which integrates a new convolutional neural network specially designed for super-resolving OLCI data. In contrast to other networks, the proposed SR architecture (termed as SRS3) employs a dense multireceptive field together with a residual channel attention mechanism to relieve the particularly low spatial resolution of OLCI while extracting more discriminating features for the large spatial resolution differences with respect to MSI. The experimental part of the work, conducted using ten coupled OLCI and MSI operational data, reveals the suitability of the presented Level-4 SR framework within the Copernicus programme context as well as the advantages of the proposed architecture with respect different state-of-the-art models when spatially enhancing OLCI products.

Particularly, 10 S2 bands at 10 and 20 m spatial resolution are used to accomplish the PRISMA super-resolution (SR) task. The article presents a new end-to-end procedure, called PRISMA-SR, that starting from the S2 data and the low-resolution PRISMA image, provides a super-resolved image with a spatial resolution of 10 m and the same spectral resolution as the PRISMA HS sensor. The first step of the PRISMA-SR procedure consists in fusing S2 data at different spatial resolutions to obtain a synthetic MS image with 10 m spatial resolution and 10 spectral bands. Then, an unsupervised procedure is applied to coregister the fused S2 image and the PRISMA image. Finally, the two images at different spatial resolutions are properly combined in order to obtain the super-resolved HS image. Solutions for each step of the PRISMA-SR processing chain are proposed and discussed.

However, in coastal areas, these phenomena are complex and their analyze requires multi-spectral images with both a high spatial and spectral resolution. Unfortunately, no satellite is able to provide both at the same time. As a consequence, multi-sharpening techniques-a.k.a. fusion or super- resolution of multi-spectral and/or hyper-spectral images-were proposed and consist of combining information from at least two multi-spectral images with different spatial and spectral resolutions. The fused image then combines their best characteristics. Various methods-based on different strategies and tools-have been proposed to solve this problem. This article presents a comparative review of fusion methods applied to Sentinel-2 MSI (13 spectral bands with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m) and Sentinel-3 OLCI (21 spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 300 m) images. Indeed, both satellites are extensively used in marine observation and, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the fusion of their data was partially investigated (and not in the way we aim to do in this paper).

In this paper, we introduce a novel postacquisition computational technique aiming to enhance the spectral dimensionality of imaging systems by exploiting the mathematical frameworks of sparse representations and dictionary learning. We propose a coupled dictionary learning model which considers joint feature spaces, composed of low- and high-spectral resolution hypercubes, in order to achieve spectral superresolution performance. We formulate our spectral coupled dictionary learning optimization problem within the context of the alternating direction method of multipliers, and we manage to update the involved quantities via closed-form expressions. In addition, we consider a realistic spectral subsampling scenario, taking into account the spectral response functions of different satellites. Moreover, we apply our spectral superresolution algorithm on real satellite data acquired by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors. Finally, we have investigated the problem of hyperspectral image unmixing using the recovered high-spectral resolution data cube, and we are able to demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant value in hyperspectral image understanding techniques.

The official methodology on land appraisal includes use of soil fertility characteristics combined with coefficients related to the distance to the infrastructure objects or settlements and placing of field in specific functional areas, like recreational, or areas with high level of radiation pollution. In this study we collected open source infostructure geospatial information and characteristics of fields obtained from remote sensing data - crop types and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to build land price predictive model trained on the official land market information. This work designed to investigate potential of geo-informational technologies and remote sensing in the land appraisal use. We separated all available ground truth land price data into three groups by fields size - very small, small, medium and big. We found different relationships between field characteristics and prices. For very small fields the most important features are area, altitude, slope, bonitet and distances to elevators, villages and roads. For small fields the most important are bonitet, altitude, area and distances to cities and roads. For medium and big field's area, slope, distance to cities, roads and historical NDVI.","2153-7003","978-1-6654-2792-0","10.1109/IGARSS46834.2022.9884045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9884045","deep learning;Generative Adversarial Networks;GAN;super-resolution;Sentinel-2","Pollution;Roads;Urban areas;Vegetation mapping;Soil;Predictive models;Agriculture","agriculture;crops;geographic information systems;land use planning;pricing;remote sensing;soil;vegetation;vegetation mapping","cornerstone task;Ukrainian agriculture sector;official methodology;soil fertility characteristics;infrastructure objects;settlements;specific functional areas;open source infostructure geospatial information;remote sensing data - crop types;Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;land price predictive model;official land market information;geo-informational technologies;land appraisal use;available ground truth land price data;fields size;field characteristics;bonitet;big field;agriculture land appraisal;infrastructure data;st July;land market start effect","","","","15","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the capability of applications that employ infrared information is often limited by its spatial resolution. To overcome this problem, we propose a method for sharpening these infrared bands. This method is based on the multiresolution analysis (MRA) method, which focuses on the image residual in the spatial domain. The sharpened image can be obtained from the combination of the low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) components. The residual image is performed as the HF components, which can be estimated from the difference between the original image and its smoothing (blurring) version. The bicubic interpolation was applied to generate the LF component. The least-square error of the image residual was employed to determine the optimal injection weight, which can be expressed in the analytic form. The Sentinel-2A images of Central Thailand were used to test our proposed method and then compared to conventional sharpening methods, such as Gram-Schmitt, Intensity-Hue-Saturation (HIS), and Brovey methods. The results show that our proposed method can give quality metrics higher than others. Moreover, our composited infrared band image also gives color similar to the native composite image.","","978-1-6654-8584-5","10.1109/ECTI-CON54298.2022.9795632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795632","super-resolution;image upscaling;MRA-based;least-square error;pan-sharpening","Measurement;Visualization;Interpolation;Smoothing methods;Image color analysis;Hafnium;Telecommunications","image colour analysis;image resolution;image restoration;infrared imaging;interpolation;least squares approximations;optimisation","image residual optimization;Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument;visible-near infrared bands;multiresolution analysis method;sharpening methods;native composite image;Sentinel-2A infrared bands;infrared band image composite;Central Thailand;Gram-Schmitt;intensity-hue-saturation;HIS;Brovey methods;low-frequency components;high-frequency components;HF components;LF components;multiresolution analysis method;MRA method;narrow near-infrared bands;short-wave infrared bands;narrow NIR bands;SWIR bands","","","","17","IEEE","16 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the limited capacity of sensors, providing high spatial and spectral resolution is still a challenging issue. Spectral super-resolution (SSR) increases the spectral dimensionality of multispectral images to achieve resolution enhancement. In this article, we propose a spectral resolution enhancement method based on the generative adversarial network framework without introducing additional spectral responses prior. In order to adaptively rescale informative features for capturing interdependencies in the spectral and spatial dimensions, a spatial spectral feature attention module is introduced. The proposed method jointly exploits spatio-spectral distribution in the hyperspectral manifold to increase spectral resolution while maintaining spatial content consistency. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 radiance data and real coregistered advanced land image and Hyperion (MS and HS) images, which indicates the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3238853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62036005); Special Fund of Hubei Luojia Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024263","Adversarial learning;attention mechanism;hyperspectral imagery;spectral super-resolution (SSR)","Hyperspectral imaging;Spatial resolution;Image reconstruction;Superresolution;Sensors;Correlation;Cameras","","","","","","52","CCBY","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering complex environments of urban surface features, traditional semantic segmentation methods are difficult to solve the problems of mixed pixels and limited spatial resolution of images. The subpixel mapping technology is an effective method to solve the above problems in urban land use classification. However, traditional subpixel mapping methods are sensitive to mountain shadow, high-rise building shadow and impermeable surface heterogeneity, resulting in false classification. Therefore, we propose a subpixel mapping method that can reduce the shadow effect. This method uses a multi-index feature fusion strategy to optimize the abundance of the shadow errors in the abundance image, and uses a super-resolution reconstruction neural network model to reconstruct the optimized abundance image for the subpixel mapping of urban land use. Experiments were conducted on Sentinel-2 images obtained over Yuelu District of Changsha City, Hunan Province, China. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively overcome the influence of building shadows and mountain shadows in urban land cover classification and is superior to traditional SPSAM, RBF, SRSPM and other methods in the effect and accuracy of urban land use subpixel mapping.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2023.3243895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10042183","Subpixel mapping, shadow;multi-index feature fusion;abundance optimization;super-resolution reconstruction","Superresolution;Image reconstruction;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Urban areas;Gravity;Buildings","","","","","","","CCBY","10 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, uncertainty exists unavoidably in SPM, which is an ill-posed downscaling problem. Spatio-temporal SPM methods have been proposed to deal with this uncertainty, but current methods fail to explore fully the information in the time-series images, especially more rapid changes over a short-time interval. In this article, a fast and slow changes constrained spatio-temporal subpixel mapping (FSSTSPM) method is proposed to account for fast LCLU changes over a short time interval and slow changes over a long time interval. Both fast and slow changes-based temporal constraints are proposed and incorporated simultaneously into the FSSTSPM to increase the accuracy of SPM. The proposed FSSTSPM method was validated using two synthetic datasets with various proportion errors. It was also applied to oil-spill mapping using a real PlanetScope-Sentinel-2 dataset and Amazon deforestation mapping using a real Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. The results demonstrate the superiority of FSSTSPM. Moreover, the advantage of FSSTSPM is more obvious with an increase in proportion errors. The concepts of the fast and slow changes, together with the derived temporal constraints, provide a new insight to enhance SPM by taking fuller advantage of the temporal information in the available time-series images.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2021.3133534","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41971297,42171345); Tongji University(grant numbers:02502350047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641799","Downscaling;Hopfield neural network (HNN);land cover and land use (LCLU);spatio-temporal dependence;subpixel mapping (SPM);super-resolution mapping","Spatial resolution;Neurons;Monitoring;Image resolution;Uncertainty;Remote sensing;Satellites","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;image resolution;land cover;marine pollution;remote sensing;terrain mapping;time series;vegetation mapping","oil-spill mapping;Amazon deforestation mapping;Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer dataset;fast changes;slow changes;derived temporal constraints;temporal information;available time-series images;mixed-pixel problem;land cover;finer spatial resolution;original coarse data;downscaling problem;spatio-temporal SPM methods;short-time interval;spatio-temporal subpixel mapping method;fast LCLU changes;short time interval;long time interval;FSSTSPM method","","","","55","IEEE","7 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
