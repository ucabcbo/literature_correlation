"Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Mapping Arctic Vegetation Using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Fusion","Z. L. Langford; J. Kumar; F. M. Hoffman","University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA","2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)","18 Dec 2017","2017","","","322","331","Accurate and high-resolution maps of vegetation are critical for projects seeking to understand the terrestrial ecosystem processes and land-atmosphere interactions in Arctic ecosystems, such as U.S. Department of Energy's Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment (NGEE) Arctic. However, most existing Arctic vegetation maps are at a coarse resolution and with a varying degree of detail and accuracy. Remote sensing-based approaches for mapping vegetation, while promising, are challenging in high latitude environments due to frequent cloud cover, polar darkness, and limited availability of high-resolution remote sensing datasets (e.g., ~ 5 m). This study proposes a new remote sensing based multi-sensor data fusion approach for developing high-resolution maps of vegetation in the Seward Peninsula, Alaska. We focus detailed analysis and validation study around the Kougarok river, located in the central Seward Peninsula of Alaska. We seek to evaluate the integration of hyper-spectral, multi-spectral, radar, and terrain datasets using unsupervised and supervised classification techniques over a ~343.72 km2 area for generating vegetation classifications at a variety of resolutions (5 m and 12.5 m). We fist applied a quantitative goodness-of-fit method, called Mapcurves, that shows the degree of spatial concordance between the public coarse resolution maps and k-means clustering values and relabels the k values based on the best overlap. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach for developing high resolution vegetation maps for our study region in Arctic. We compare two CNN approaches: (1) breaking up the images into small patches (e.g., 6 × 6) and predict the vegetation class for entire patch and (2) semantic segmentation and predict the vegetation class for every pixel. We also perform accuracy assessments of the developed data products and evaluate varying CNN architectures. The fusion of hyperspectral and optical datasets performed the best, with accuracy values increased from 0.64 to 0.96-0.97 when using a training map produced by unsupervised clustering and Mapcurves labeling for both CNN models.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-3800-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2017.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8215680","Multi-Sensor;Fusion;Remote Sensing;Vegetation Classificaiton","Vegetation mapping;Remote sensing;Arctic;Earth;Biological system modeling;Artificial satellites;Meteorology","geophysical image processing;image classification;image fusion;image segmentation;neural nets;pattern clustering;sensor fusion;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","US Department of Energy;Arctic vegetation mapping;Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment;Mapcurves labeling;unsupervised clustering;hyperspectral-optical dataset fusion;k values;training map;developed data products;vegetation class;CNN approaches;high resolution vegetation maps;public coarse resolution maps;vegetation classifications;unsupervised classification techniques;central Seward Peninsula;validation study;Alaska;multisensor data fusion approach;high-resolution remote sensing datasets;frequent cloud cover;high latitude environments;existing Arctic vegetation maps;Arctic ecosystems;land-atmosphere interactions;terrestrial ecosystem processes;multisensor remote sensing fusion;convolutional neural network approach;size 343.72 km","","5","","44","IEEE","18 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our review reveals that conventional fusion and MM methods are not enough for navigation in challenging environments, like urban areas and Arctic environments. We also offer new results from testing inertial and optical sensors in vehicle positioning in snowy conditions. We find that the fusion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and inertial navigation systems (INSs) does not provide the accuracy required for automated driving, and the use of optical sensors is challenged by snow covering the road markings.

To overcome the problems of single-sensor solutions, such as inertial navigation systems and global navigation satellite systems, hybrid navigation solutions with multiple complementary sensors are required. This paper proposes a new decentralized architecture to adapt the practical measurement noise of sensors and improve the robustness of the entire system. Previous studies have examined such techniques as Kalman filters that are primarily used to address stationary Gaussian noise. An approach named interacting dual model based adaptive filter (IDM-AF) is proposed in this study to overcome nonstationary noise and certain non-Gaussian factors, and a method that dynamically estimates the noise covariance matrix is derived in this paper. In accordance with practical requirements of fusing asynchronous sensors, we propose a new information fusion scheme based on the so-called degradation indicators of subsystems and a temporal alignment algorithm. Subsystem level and system level simulations and evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture and algorithms enhance navigational performance in the Arctic. Compared to a current method, the proposed architecture is shown to reduce the positioning error by 33.3-46.9% for different scenarios.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2018.2853083","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571167,61471142,61102084); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416697","Arctic region;asynchronous information fusion;interacting dual model based adaptive filter (IDM-AF);nonstationary noise;temporal alignment","Arctic;Adaptation models;Global navigation satellite system;Mathematical model;Noise measurement","adaptive filters;covariance matrices;Gaussian noise;Gaussian processes;image fusion;inertial navigation;Kalman filters;satellite navigation;sensor fusion","Arctic region;single-sensor solutions;inertial navigation systems;global navigation satellite systems;hybrid navigation solutions;multiple complementary sensors;Kalman filters;stationary Gaussian noise;nonstationary noise;nonGaussian factors;noise covariance matrix;practical requirements;asynchronous sensors;information fusion scheme;temporal alignment algorithm;system level simulations;navigational performance;adaptive filtering","","5","","41","IEEE","20 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we introduce a flexible and efficient method based on graph Laplacians for information selection at different levels of data fusion. The proposed approach combines data structure and information content to address the limitations of existing graph-Laplacian-based methods in dealing with heterogeneous datasets.

The proposed DDCM-Net consists of dense dilated convolutions merged with varying dilation rates. This can effectively enlarge the kernels' receptive fields, and, more importantly, obtain fused local and global context information to promote surrounding discriminative capability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DDCM-Net on the publicly available ISPRS Potsdam dataset and achieve a performance of 92.3% F1-score and 86.0% mean intersection over union accuracy by only using the RGB bands, without any post-processing.

Efforts have been made to automate the detection and segmentation of polyps, a precancerous precursor, to effectively minimize missed rate. Widely used computer-aided polyp segmentation systems actuated by encoder-decoder have achieved high performance in terms of accuracy. However, polyp segmentation datasets collected from varied centers can follow different imaging protocols leading to difference in data distribution. As a result, most methods suffer from performance drop when trained and tested on different distributions and therefore, require re-training for each specific dataset. We address this generalizability issue by proposing a global multi-scale residual fusion network (GMSRF-Net). Our proposed network maintains high-resolution representations by performing multi-scale fusion operations across all resolution scales through dense connections while preserving low-level information. To further leverage scale information, we design cross multi-scale attention (CMSA) module that uses multi-scale features to identify, keep, and propagate informative features. Additionally, we introduce multi-scale feature selection (MSFS) modules to perform channel-wise attention that gates irrelevant features gathered through global multi-scale fusion within the GMSRF-Net. The repeated fusion operations gated by CMSA and MSFS demonstrate improved generalizability of our network.Experiments conducted on two different polyp segmentation datasets show that our proposed GMSRF-Net outperforms the previous top-performing state-of-the-art method by 8.34% and 10.31% on unseen CVC-ClinicDB and on unseen Kvasir-SEG, in terms of dice coefficient. Additionally, when tested on unseen CVC-ColonDB, we surpass the state-of-the-art method by 9.38% and 4.04% in terms of dice coefficient, when source dataset is Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.","2831-7475","978-1-6654-9062-7","10.1109/ICPR56361.2022.9956726","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956726","","Training;Image segmentation;Protocols;Supervised learning;Logic gates;Performance gain;Pattern recognition","cancer;feature extraction;image fusion;image segmentation;medical image processing;minimisation","CMSA;computer-aided polyp segmentation systems;cross multiscale attention module design;cross multiscale attention module design;CVC-ColonDB;global multiscale fusion;global multiscale residual fusion network;GMSRF-Net;high-resolution representations;highly operator-dependent;imaging protocols;improved generalizability;leverage scale information;multiscale attention module;multiscale feature selection;multiscale fusion operations;polyp segmentation datasets;repeated fusion operations;resolution scales","","3","","25","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By leveraging the natural suitability of E-commerce, where different modalities capture complementary semantic information, we contribute a large-scale multi-modal pretraining dataset M5Product. The dataset comprises 5 modalities (image, text, table, video, and audio), covers over 6,000 categories and 5,000 attributes, and is 500× larger than the largest publicly available dataset with a similar number of modalities. Furthermore, M5Product contains incomplete modality pairs and noise while also having a long-tailed distribution, resembling most real-world problems. We further propose Self-harmonized ContrAstive LEarning (SCALE), a novel pretraining framework that integrates the different modalities into a unified model through an adaptive feature fusion mechanism, where the importance of each modality is learned directly from the modality embeddings and impacts the inter-modality contrastive learning and masked tasks within a multi-modal transformer model. We evaluate the current multi-modal pre-training state-of-the-art approaches and benchmark their ability to learn from unlabeled data when faced with the large number of modalities in the M5Product dataset.
