In particular, the process of satellite image generation is discussed going through each step of its lifecycle. A special explanatory emphasis is given to the process of remote sensing and further mapping and fusion of satellite imagery within acquired segments of electromagnetic spectrum. Moreover, methods of satellite imagery retrieval have been practically demonstrated. The satellite imagery data has been extracted from Sentinel 2 dataset and analyzed with Python language image processing libraries.","","978-1-7281-9969-6","10.1109/ICISCT50599.2020.9351456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351456","Computer vision;satellite image;image formation;image preprocessing;NDVI;Sentinel 2;satellite;imagery;python;sentinel;remote sensing","Information science;Satellites;Image synthesis;Wavelength measurement;Libraries;Sensors;Remote sensing","artificial satellites;geophysical image processing;image processing;Python;remote sensing","conceptual introduction;practical introduction;satellite image formation;satellite image generation;special explanatory emphasis;satellite imagery retrieval;satellite imagery data;preprocessing methods;Sentinel 2 dataset;Python language image processing libraries","","3","","5","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
